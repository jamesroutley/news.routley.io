    <h1>Summarize Any Article as a Dialog Between Two People with Bing Chat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I recently discovered <strong><a href="https://www.letsrecast.ai/">Recast</a></strong>, a brilliant tool that turns your want-to-read articles into rich audio summaries. It summarises long articles into the human dialog.</p>



<p>Here is an example of Recast audio file:</p>



<figure><audio controls="" src="https://www.aidemos.info/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/output.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Because I was fascinated by this idea I tried to replicate it with the help of ChatGPT Bing Chat. My idea is simple, use Bing Chat to create a dialog summary and later use Microsoft Edge Browser for text-to-speech conversion.</p>



<p>Here is the <strong>prompt for Bing Chat</strong>:</p>



<pre><code>browse https://electrek.co/2023/05/15/renewables-us-utility-scale-generating-capacity-q1-2023/ and make a summary in the form of a dialog between two people. Leave an empty row after each dialog. Bolden the important parts of the text. Before the dialog start with 2 or 3 sentence summary.</code></pre>



<p>Change the URL with your URL.</p>



<p>And the Bing Chat Response:</p>

<p>So you have your summary in dialog form.</p>



<p>It also <strong>works with PDFs</strong>.</p>



<pre><code>browse https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07185.pdf and make a summary in a form of dialog between two people. Leave an empty row after each dialog. Bolden the important parts of the text. Before the dialog start with 2 or 3 sentence summary.</code></pre>



<p>And Bing Chat response:</p>



<pre><code>The paper proposes Megabyte, a multi-scale decoder architecture that enables end-to-end differentiable modeling of sequences of over one million bytes. Megabyte segments sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches. The paper shows that Megabyte can perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling, achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on ImageNet, and model audio from raw files.

A possible dialog based on the paper is:

**Alice**: Hey Bob, have you read the new paper on Megabyte?

**Bob**: No, what&#39;s that?

**Alice**: It&#39;s a new model for predicting million-byte sequences with multiscale transformers.

**Bob**: Million-byte sequences? That sounds challenging.

**Alice**: Yeah, it is. Most existing autoregressive transformers can only handle short sequences like text or low-resolution images. They scale poorly to long sequences like high-resolution images, podcasts, code, or books.

**Bob**: So how does Megabyte solve this problem?

**Alice**: Well, it uses a clever trick. It segments the sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches.

**Bob**: What does that mean?

**Alice**: It means that it can use sub-quadratic self-attention, much larger feedforward layers, and improved parallelism during decoding. This makes it faster and more efficient than standard transformers.

**Bob**: I see. And does it work well?

**Alice**: Yes, it does. The paper shows that Megabyte can perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling, achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on ImageNet, and model audio from raw files.

**Bob**: Wow, that&#39;s impressive. I wonder what kind of applications it can enable.

**Alice**: Me too. Maybe we can use it to generate high-quality content without tokenization.

**Bob**: That would be awesome. I&#39;ll check out the paper. Thanks for telling me about it.

<p>But why not make it one step further and make Microsoft Edge read the text?</p>



<p>The problem with Microsoft Edge is that text-to-speech always starts from the top of the webpage. But we only what to read the main text generated with Bing Chat. I remembered that back in the day I made the <strong><a href="http://www.vcarrer.com/2013/01/writability-write-in-your-browser.html">Writability – Minimal Distractions Free Browser Text Writing Tool</a> </strong>that can help us copy the text in the browser and force the Edge to read it.</p>



<p>You need to paste this code inside the Microsft Edge URL</p>

<p>And paste any text for Edge text-to-speech to read it.</p>



<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<p>The final result looks like this:</p>

</div><figcaption>No sound video. For some reason, the screen recorder didn’t record the sound</figcaption></figure>



<p>So there you have it your own private dialog Summarizer and text-to-voice reader.</p>
