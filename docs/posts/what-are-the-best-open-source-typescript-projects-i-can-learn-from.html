    <h1>Ask HN: What are the best open source TypeScript projects I can learn from?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>What are the best open source TypeScript frontend and backend real world projects I can learn from?</p><p>I am a self-taught web developers and I haven&#39;t worked for any good companies. There are no seniors reviewing my code.</p><p>My code quality can be improved but I don&#39;t know how. Maybe reading some good codebase is a way out.</p><p>I use React in frontend and express in Backend. Do you know any good OSS projects that use those stacks?</p><p>Maybe I should read popular OSS frameworks instead of web app&#39;s source code? I am thinking of changing my job, so reading real web app&#39;s source code might be more relavant.</p><p>I am very thankful for any advices. And Happy New Year!</p></div></div></div>
