            <p>Aren&#39;t you tired of never knowing when someone responded to your witty retort? If you are like me, you will get comments and not know about them until weeks later.</p>
            <h3>HARK! No longer, I say!</h3>
            <h3>Verily!?</h3>
            <h3>VERILY!</h3>
            <p>Subscribe to your HN Username and get an email notification when someone responds to you!</p>
            <p>We collect every new submission and comment from Hacker News, and once every 5 minutes or so (assuming I don&#39;t break something), we check our user&#39;s accounts for new replies.</p>
            <p><small>NOTE: This only includes direct replies to you (no grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews, first cousins, estranged wives, lovers, long lost siblings, or Uncle Bernie - only direct children of your submission/comment).</small></p>
