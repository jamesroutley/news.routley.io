<h4 id="recurse-center">Recurse Center</h4>
<p>Biggest news this month is that I got into <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> and will be attending a batch in January during my parental leave. RC has been on my radar for years as many of the creative technology groups in NYC have member overlap and a good % of the authors of weird, interesting technical blogs mention RC. I just never found a good time to take 6-12 weeks to pursue non-monetary things until now - whenever I have had time away from jobs, I was usually in the midst of <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-04_job-search-results">a full-blown job search</a>.</p>
<p>RC is basically a programming retreat (like a writer&#39;s retreat). The goal is to have focused time to explore and collaborate on technical interests, removed from the external pressures and influences of business / money. I&#39;m excited to explore technology from a more creative lens again with tentative focus on web fundamentals, networked games, and applied AI though I&#39;ll probably shift as the batch goes on.</p>
<p>One thing&#39;s for certain - I&#39;ll probably be writing more as one of <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">RC&#39;s values</a> is learn generously.</p>
<h4 id="cinderblockhtml">CinderBlockHtml</h4>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/SIRHAMY/CinderBlockHtml/tree/main">v0.6.1 of CinderBlockHtml</a>. This adds a bunch of missing, uncommon html elements and a few helpers like single empty node / attributes. These are things I found I wanted while building my sites so figured others would want them as well.</p>
<p>This package remains <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_vibe-coded-csharp-library">largely vibe coded</a> and I think that&#39;s totally fine. The code here is not complex, most of it is boilerplate mapping of new attributes to existing foundations. I think this is one of the places AI shines and is a hallmark of <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_stop-vibe-coding">using AI effectively by vibe engineering</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to give the library a shot, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CinderBlockHtml">available on Nuget</a>.</p>
<h4 id="migrating-my-blog-from-f-to-c">Migrating my blog from F# to C#</h4>
<p>I moved my blog from <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-11_why-im-moving-blog-fsharp-to-csharp">F# to C#</a> for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tooling is better - ecosystem and AI</li>
<li>C# is p good these days</li>
</ul>
<p>I hate saying that AI is a reason I&#39;m moving but I have way less time / attention to devote to side projects as a <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-08_newborn-parent-sleep-schedule">new dad</a> and AI is great for getting me unstuck or filling out boilerplate code so I can do smth else. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-12_programming-language-death-spiral">AI is better at coding in popular languages</a> so unfortunately it matters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s already paid dividends - I did a majority of the switch from F# to C# with AI, built out my bidirectional backlinks with AI, and my new digital garden post types with AI. I could&#39;ve done all of this myself but it would&#39;ve taken a lot more time / energy / attention at which point I might&#39;ve just not done the migration.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not done with F# completely but I expect a majority of my projects in the next year will be C#.</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-digital-garden">Creating a Digital Garden</h4>
<p>I have been following the concept of a <a href="https://hamy.xyz/notes/digital-garden">digital garden</a> for awhile and like a lot of its values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique websites</li>
<li>Personal notes</li>
<li>Build in public</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://hamy.xyz/notes/iamhamy-project">My site has evolved several times</a> over the years and many of the core design choices align with these values - even if I hadn&#39;t discovered the formalized version.</p>
<p>I expect to be writing on my site for decades and while I love blog posts and think they&#39;re valuable, they&#39;re just not the best medium for every kind of writing. Some pieces of writing around concepts are better served in the form of a wiki where they can be updated to reflect my current best definition / resources for them.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m starting that wiki now. It currently lives in my <a href="https://12days.cmdchallenge.com/notes">notes</a> folder and will be the home for notes on concepts that I want to be able to link to around the internet. They&#39;re more notes than polished essays (which live on my blog) so expect todos and half-finished thoughts but I think over time this will grow into something interesting and valuable - maybe not for the masses but for me to look back on.</p>

<h4 id="migrating-my-site-hosting-to-nomad">Migrating my site hosting to Nomad</h4>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/iamhamy-static/labs/posts/2025/2025-12_how-i-self-host/2025-11_how-i-self-host_architecture.png" alt="My Server Deployments"/></p>
<p>Last year I switched <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-10_host-docker-container-coolify">from cloud to self hosting</a> and then a few months ago <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-08_coolify-to-ansible">from managed self hosting to manual self hosting</a>.</p>
<p>This was nice but I ran into a couple edge cases that were tedious - like how to setup no downtime deploys, how to create healthchecks, and how to efficiently pack containers on my servers. For awhile it was an annoyance but not a big deal (none of my services are very valuable) but I eventually had enough when <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-11_post-mortem-hamy-xyz-404s">I pushed a bad change that broke my website for 19 hours</a> and I didn&#39;t know it happened.</p>
<p>I started looking into ways to fix and realized I&#39;d have to roll my own versions of a lot of cloud primitives to get the protections I wanted and then I&#39;d be stuck maintaining those builds forever. That didn&#39;t really seem like how I wanted to spend my time / energy so I started looking for off-the-shelf options.</p>
<p>I eventually landed on Nomad as a nice cross between the capabilities of a full-blown orchestrator and the simplicity of a batteries-included solution. So now <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-12_how-i-self-host">I orchestrate my multi-server container deployments with Nomad</a>.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health checks</li>
<li>Blue/green deploys</li>
<li>Auto server packing (which means easy scaling to n servers, containers)</li>
<li>Dashboards + monitoring</li>
<li>Auto restarts</li>
<li>Push-based deploys</li>
</ul>

<p>My Shares are falling off a bit. Views / watch time / subs are down and so is my output.</p>
<p>Some hypotheses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I switched thumbnail styles to be more aligned to my current design system / brand which ppl might not like</li>
<li>I&#39;m not leaning into topics that viewers have shown they like - mostly just writing ab whatever I&#39;m building</li>
<li>People are using AI more and reading / watching videos less which means less traffic to me</li>
<li>My content is not the most friendly - it&#39;s just me reading off a blog post - which has a high bounce rate which the algorithm doesn&#39;t love</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure what it is (probably all of them and more) but most metrics are in the red.</p>
<p>Largely that&#39;s fine - I&#39;m in this for the long term because <a href="https://hamy.xyz/notes/writing">I enjoy writing</a> and it still helps pay for my project costs so we&#39;ll keep chugging.</p>
<h3 id="profit">Profit</h3>
<p>Work is going well! I&#39;m feeling good about the company and team and really excited for a couple months off to recharge and focus on the baby.</p>
<h2 id="reflect">Reflect</h2>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>Walking and exercising less over the holidays / colder weather.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been trying to eat more healthy as I got some cholesterol readings that were borderline high so want to get ahead of that.</p>
<p>Sleep continues to be elusive with <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-08_newborn-parent-sleep-schedule">the baby&#39;s sleep schedule</a>. She&#39;s turned into an alarm clock that goes off at 6am so there&#39;s really no room for sleeping in anymore.</p>
<h3 id="wealth">Wealth</h3>
<p>Keeping on with the <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/the-simple-path-to-wealth">The Simple (, Long, Short, Boring, Probable) Path to Wealth</a>.</p>
<h3 id="happiness">Happiness</h3>
<p>This is the first month that having a baby seems &#34;normal&#34;. I&#39;ve forgotten what it felt like day-to-day to not have a kid and now the daily cycles of feedings, play time, and naps feel like just another part of my day.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been able to find a balance between my other pursuits - like seeing friends, exploring places with the baby, and finding time for my side projects. It&#39;s much different from what it was like without a kid but I think we&#39;re hitting our stride.</p>
<h2 id="observe">Observe</h2>
<h3 id="connect">Connect</h3>
<p>A lot of family time and a few hangs with friends. We&#39;re trying to get out 1-2 days a week but sometimes we&#39;re just tired lul.</p>
<h3 id="explore">Explore</h3>
<p><strong>Places:</strong> Avalon in Alpharetta, downtown Roswell, Himitsu in Buckhead</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> A bunch of tech blog posts and <a href="https://amzn.to/4iHtcZr">book 10 of the wandering inn</a>, though I think I need to take a break from the story after this one.</p>
<ul>
<li>On sustainable art: <a href="https://essays.fnnch.com/make-a-living">How to make a living as an artist</a>. Aligns with a lot of rought theories I&#39;ve had where good art is also fiscally sound art, in whatever domain your art lives in.</li>
<li>Small batches: <a href="https://www.petemillspaugh.com/think-small">Think Small</a>. I like the idea of atomic cycles - do the simplest version of the thing that is reasonable. Compound these on top of each other. I also like this interpretation of a digital garden.</li>
<li>Rigid + Flexible: <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-170578362">Live a disciplined life, spontaneously</a>. Hard agree with this idea and is a concept I come back to regularly. Will probably write an essay on it at some point but this one gets the gist.</li>
<li>AI + Software Engineering - <a href="https://www.scottarbeit.com/blog/llm-s-and-smaller-less-popular-programming-languages">LLM&#39;s and Smaller, Less Popular Programming Languages</a>. Interesting to think ab how AI impacts the software industry. One outcome may be that small langs have less AI support so fall behind. A significant factor in me moving away from F#.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching:</strong> Dancing with the Stars (Alix should&#39;ve won), chick flicks / holiday movies Megna likes, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@megnasaha8417">Megna&#39;s family vlogs</a></p>
<p><strong>Listening:</strong> My First Million and Pragmatic Engineer podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Playing:</strong> Making my way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@megnasaha8417">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a></p>
<h3 id="improve">Improve</h3>
<p>Been playing a lot with AI and trying to find simple prompts / systems to improve my coding / writing / diagrams. You&#39;ll see a few of these in action in my various blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>That&#39;s all for November.</p>
<p>Looking forward to December:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holidays and time off</li>
<li><a href="https://hamy.xyz/tags/advent-of-code">Advent of Code 2025</a> in functionalish C#</li>
<li>Reflecting on my year</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
