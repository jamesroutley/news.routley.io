    <h1>No, Google did not hike the price of a .dev domain from $12 to $850</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
It was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33928399" rel="external">perfect outrage fodder</a>,
quickly gaining hundreds of upvotes on Hacker News:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you know, domain extensions like .dev and .app are owned by Google. Last year, I bought the http://forum.dev domain for one of our projects. When I tried to renew it this year, I was faced with a renewal price of $850 instead of the normal price of $12.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It&#39;s true that most .dev domains are just $12/year.  But this person
never paid $12 for forum.dev.  According to his <a href="https://twitter.com/EmirKarsiyakali/status/1601436674856464384" rel="external">own screenshots</a>, he paid
4,360 Turkish Lira for the initial registration on December 6, 2021,
which was <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=TRY&amp;date=2021-12-06#table-section" rel="external">$317 at the time</a>.  So yes, the price did go up, but not nearly
as much as the above comment implied.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33929337" rel="external">According to a Google worker</a>,
this person should have paid the same, higher price in 2021,
since forum.dev is a &#34;premium&#34; domain, but got an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33929987" rel="external">extremely favorable
exchange rate</a> so he ended up paying less.  That&#39;s unsurprising
for a currency which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932022_Turkish_currency_and_debt_crisis" rel="external">experiencing rampant inflation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, domain pricing has become quite confusing in recent years, and
when reading the ensuing Hacker News discussion, I learned that a lot of people have
some major misconceptions about how domains work.  Multiple people said untrue or nonsensical things
along the lines of &#34;Google has a monopoly on the .dev domain.  GoDaddy doesn&#39;t have a monopoly on .com, .biz, .net, etc.&#34;
So I decided to write this blog post to explain some basic concepts and demystify
domain pricing.
</p>

<h4>Registries vs Registrars</h4>

<p>
If you want to have an informed opinion about domains, you have to
understand the difference between registries and registrars.
</p>

<p>
Every top-level domain (.com, .biz, .dev, etc.) is controlled by exactly
one registry, who is responsible for the administration of the TLD
and operation of the TLD&#39;s DNS servers.  The registry effectively owns
the TLD.  Some registries are:
</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr><th>.com</th><td>Verisign</td></tr>
	<tr><th>.biz</th><td>GoDaddy</td></tr>
	<tr><th>.dev</th><td>Google</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Registries do not sell domains directly to the public.  Instead,
registrars broker the transaction between a domain registrant and the
appropriate registry.  Registrars include Gandi, GoDaddy, Google, Namecheap,
and name.com.  Companies can be both
registries and registrars: e.g. GoDaddy and Google are registrars for
many TLDs, but registries for only some TLDs.
</p>

<p>
When you buy or renew a domain, the bulk of your registration fee goes
to the registry, with the registrar adding some markup.  Additionally,
18 cents goes to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers), who is in charge of the entire domain system.
</p>

<p>
For example, Google&#39;s current .com price of $12 is broken down as follows:
</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr><th>$0.18</th><td>ICANN fee</td></tr>
	<tr><th>$8.97</th><td>Verisign&#39;s registry fee</td></tr>
	<tr><th>$2.85</th><td>Google&#39;s registrar markup</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Registrars typically carry domains from many different TLDs, and TLDs
are typically available through multiple registrars.  If you don&#39;t like
your registrar, you can transfer your domain to a different one.
This keeps registrar markup low.  However, you&#39;ll always be stuck with
the same registry.  If you don&#39;t like their pricing, your only recourse
is to get a whole new domain with a different TLD, which is not meaningful
competition.
</p>

<p>
At the registry level, it&#39;s not true that there is no monopoly on .com - Verisign has just as
much of a monopoly on .com as Google has on .dev.
</p>

<p>
At the registrar level, Google holds no monopoly over .dev - you can buy .dev domains through registrars
besides Google, so you can take your business elsewhere if you don&#39;t like the Google registrar.  Of course, the bulk of your fee will
still go to Google, since they&#39;re the registry.
</p>


<h4>ICANN Price Controls</h4>

<p>
So if .com is just as monopoly-controlled as .dev, why are all .com
domains the same low price?  Why are there no &#34;premium&#34; domains
like with .dev?
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s not because Verisign is scared by the competition, since there
is none.  It&#39;s because Verisign&#39;s contract with ICANN is different
from Google&#39;s contract with ICANN.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/details/com" rel="external">.com registry agreement</a> between Verisign and ICANN
capped the price of .com domains at $7.85 in 2020, with at most a 7% increase allowed
every year.  Verisign has since imposed two 7% price hikes, putting
the current price at $8.97.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/details/dev" rel="external">.dev is governed by ICANN&#39;s standard registry agreement</a>, which
has no price caps.  It does, however, forbid &#34;discriminatory&#34; renewal pricing:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In addition, Registry Operator must have uniform pricing for renewals
of domain name registrations (&#34;Renewal Pricing&#34;).  For the purposes of
determining Renewal Pricing, the price for each domain registration
renewal must be identical to the price of all other domain name
registration renewals in place at the time of such renewal, and such
price must take into account universal application of any refunds,
rebates, discounts, product tying or other programs in place at the
time of renewal.  The foregoing requirements of this Section 2.10(c)
shall not apply for (i) purposes of determining Renewal Pricing if
the registrar has provided Registry Operator with documentation that
demonstrates that the applicable registrant expressly agreed in its
registration agreement with registrar to higher Renewal Pricing at the
time of the initial registration of the domain name following clear
and conspicuous disclosure of such Renewal Pricing to such registrant,
and (ii) discounted Renewal Pricing pursuant to a Qualified Marketing
Program (as defined below).  The parties acknowledge that the purpose
of this Section 2.10(c) is to prohibit abusive and/or discriminatory
Renewal Pricing practices imposed by Registry Operator without the
written consent of the applicable registrant at the time of the initial
registration of the domain and this Section 2.10(c) will be interpreted
broadly to prohibit such practices.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This means that Google is only allowed to increase a domain&#39;s renewal price
if it also increases the renewal price of all other domains.  If Google
wants to charge more to renew a &#34;premium&#34; domain, the higher price must
be clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the registrant at time of initial
registration.  This prevents Google from holding domains hostage:
they can&#39;t set a low price and later increase it after your domain
becomes popular.
</p>

<p>
(By displaying prices in lira instead of USD for forum.dev, did Google
violate the &#34;clear and conspicuous&#34; disclosure requirement?  I&#39;m not sure, but if
I were a registrar I would display prices in the currency charged by the registry
to avoid misunderstandings like this.)
</p>

<p>
I wouldn&#39;t assume that the .com price caps will remain forever.
.org used to have price caps too, before switching
the standard registry agreement in 2019.  But even if .com switched to
the standard agreement, we probably wouldn&#39;t see &#34;premium&#34; .com domains: at this point,
every .com domain which would be considered &#34;premium&#34; has already been registered. And
Verisign wouldn&#39;t be allowed to increase the renewal price of already-registered domains
due to the need for disclosure at the time of initial registration.
</p>



<h4>There ain&#39;t no rules for ccTLDs (.io, .tv, .au, etc.)</h4>

<p>
It&#39;s important to note that registries for country-code TLDs (which is every 2-letter TLD)
<a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/cctld-2012-02-25-en" rel="external">do not have enforceable registry agreements with ICANN</a>.  Instead, they are governed
by their respective countries (or similar political entities), which can do as they please.
They can sucker you in with a low price and then
hold your domain hostage when it gets popular.  If you register your domain in a banana
republic because you think the TLD looks cool, and el presidente wants your domain to
host his cat pictures, tough luck.
</p>

<p>
This is only scratching the surface of what&#39;s wrong with ccTLDs, but that&#39;s
a topic for another blog post.  Suffice to say,
I do not recommend using ccTLDs unless all of the following are true:
</p>

<ul><li>You live in the country which owns the ccTLD and don&#39;t plan on moving.</li><li>You don&#39;t expect the region where you live to secede from the political entity which owns the ccTLD.  (Just ask the British citizens who had .eu domains.)</li><li>You trust the operator of the ccTLD to be fair and competent.</li></ul>

<h4>Further Complications</h4>

<p>
To make matters more confusing, sometimes when you buy a domain from a
registrar, you&#39;re not getting it from the registry, but 
from an existing owner who is squatting the domain.  In this case, you
pay a large upfront cost to get the squatter to transfer the domain to you,
after which the domain renews at the lower, registry-set price.  It used to be fairly
obvious when this was happening, as you&#39;d transact directly with the squatter,
but now several registrars will broker the transaction for you.
The Google registrar calls these &#34;aftermarket&#34; domains, which I think is a good name,
but other registrars call them &#34;premium&#34; domains, which is confusing because such
domains may or may not be considered &#34;premium&#34; by the registry and subject to higher renewal prices.
</p>

<p>
Yet another confounding factor is that registrars sometimes steeply discount the initial registration
fee, taking a loss in the hope of making it up with renewals and other services.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, there are multiple scenarios you may face when buying a domain:
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Initial Fee</th><th>Renewal Fee</th></tr>
<tr><td>Non-premium domain, no discount</td><td>$$</td><td>$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>Non-premium domain, first year discount</td><td>$</td><td>$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premium domain, no discount</td><td>$$$</td><td>$$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premium domain, first year discount</td><td>$$</td><td>$$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>Aftermarket non-premium domain</td><td>$$$$</td><td>$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>Aftermarket premium domain</td><td>$$$$</td><td>$$$</td></tr>
<tr><td>ccTLD domain</td><td>Varies</td><td>Sky&#39;s the limit!</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
I was curious how different registrars distinguish between these cases, so
I tried searching for the following domains at Gandi, GoDaddy, Google, Namecheap, and name.com:
</p>

<ul><li><strong>safkjfkjfkjfdkjdfkj.com</strong> and <strong>nonpremium.online</strong> - decidedly non-premium domains</li><li><strong>8b.dev</strong> - premium domain</li><li><strong>dnsarchive.com</strong> - aftermarket domain</li></ul>

<p>
I think Gandi and Google do the best job conveying the first year and renewal prices using
clear and consistent UI.  Namecheap is the worst, only showing a clear renewal price when it&#39;s
less than the initial price, but obscuring it when it&#39;s the same or higher (note the use of the
term &#34;Retail&#34; instead of &#34;Renews at&#34;, and the lack of a &#34;/yr&#34; suffix for the 8b.dev price).
name.com also obscures the renewal price for nonpremium.online (I very much doubt it&#39;s $1.99).
GoDaddy also fails to show a clear renewal price for the non-premium domains, but at least says the quoted price is &#34;for the first year.&#34;
</p>

<p>
My advice is to pay very close attention to the renewal price when buying a domain, because it may be the same,
lower, or higher than the first year&#39;s fee.  And be very wary of 2-letter TLDs (ccTLDs).
