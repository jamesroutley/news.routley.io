  <p>I built a custom desktop on a CNC router. It&#39;s a 3-layer stack of 1/2&#34; MDF. It has recessed areas for my split keyboard and coffee mug. Cables can tunnel through the middle layer of the desk. No this is not a desktop PC, it&#39;s literally the top of a desk.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replace my add-on forearm rests with a single desktop</li>
<li>Recess my split keyboard into the desk surface for straighter wrist ergonomics</li>
<li>Give my coffee a bit more of a spill-resistant setup</li>
<li>route cabling within channels inside the desktop interior
<ul>
<li>Especially for the cable connecting the halves of the split keyboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>learn enough CNC for this project</li>
<li>Get experience building with and painting MDF</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-slow-learning-curve">A slow learning curve</h2>
<p>This was my first CNC project. It took months of calendar time to come to fruition - mostly due to scheduling and tooling overhead accessing the CNCs I had access to.</p>
<p>Getting this project done took several months, learning a total of 4 CAD/CAM software processes across 3 operating systems, loading a full sheet of MDF into my van about 4 extra times, and juggling CNC schedules. The details are so boring that I can&#39;t even bring myself to type them out. Let&#39;s just say &#34;hey, that looks like a great CNC project&#34; does not articulate the requisite overhead.</p>
<h2 id="3d-printed-inserts">3D-printed inserts</h2>
<p>I used basic rounded rectangles in the actual MDF with the idea of potentially wanting different inserts over time. So I modeled up inserts for my keyboard&#39;s PCB shape using files exported from the <a href="https://peterlyons.com/problog/2024/05/kipra-keyboard/">ergogen process I used to make my keyboard</a>. In addition to a pocket for the PCB to fit into, I needed to clear space for the cables to be connected and a hole so cables could be routed via the desktop layer 2 tunnels.</p>
<p>I also made a coffee holder for my favorite coffee mug. And before you point out how silly and limiting this is - don&#39;t you worry - I made an adapter so my second-favorite coffee mug fits too!</p>
