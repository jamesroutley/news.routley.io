<p><span id="more-23888"></span>Why do people build things? I love reading biographies of  entrepreneurs. What comes through clearly, besides their passion and perseverance, is the thought that &#8216;I built it because I needed something like this&#8217;. And of course no one made such a thing at the time.</p>
<p>I have been writing this blog for nearly 12 years and sometimes I think I should change its name. Listening to Neil Diamond&#8217;s <em>Girl, You&#8217;ll Be A Woman Soon</em> (whilst <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2026/01/a-puzzling-time/">making a puzzle</a>) made be blush somewhat because I was already in my late 40s when I started sharing my recipes on this platform. If I had any inkling it would have such longevity I should have called it something like Grandma Gochugaru. But I take heart that Lois Maxwell played the role of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond films for 23 years until they had to retire her. I am good as a &#8216;Miss&#8217; for another 10 years.</p>
<p>I started this blog because I can almost never find the scrap of paper or the newspaper cutting with the recipe I want to keep/ use/ pass on. On purpose it has no advertisements or subscription fee. It&#8217;s a privilege to share what you have if you are able to do so.</p>
<p>There are two frustrating things about this blog: 1) some of the oldest posts have a quirk which means the photos don&#8217;t show up although they exist and 2) sometimes I include a recipe as part of a bigger item and it is not easy to just call up that recipe. Examples of the latter are Christmas Red Cabbage and Milk Bread.</p>
<p>I am starting the rectification process, beginning with Milk Bread. This recipe is used in <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2022/06/hot-dog-flower-buns/">Hot Dog Flower Buns</a> and <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2022/08/tuna-and-sweetcorn-buns/">Tuna and Sweetcorn Buns</a>. The original recipe is from <em>Mooncakes and Milk Bread</em> by Kristina Cho, published by Harper Horizon, ISBN 978-0785238997. Her recipe for milk bread, what she refers to as <em>The Mother of All Milk Breads</em>, is <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/good-food/korean-vegan-tortilla-tournament-huitlacoche-milk-bread/kristina-cho-chinese-bakeries-book">here</a>. On Ms Cho&#8217;s website there is a recipe for <a href="https://eatchofood.com/blog/2021/11/15/sweet-potato-rosemary-milk-bread-rolls">Sweet Potato and Rosemary Milk Bread Rolls</a> which I may try soon.</p>

<p>My recipe below has been adapted for use with a <a href="https://www.vorwerk.com/gb/en/s/shop/products/thermomix/c/thermomix">Thermomix</a>, uses metric measurements and baked in a fan-assisted oven. This time I have reduced the sugar. The starting point is the <em>tangzhong</em>. This is a paste (roux in French) made from milk and flour. An explanation is <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong">here</a> and the ratio is 1 part flour to 5 parts milk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Milk Bread:</p>
<p>150 g full-fat milk + 30 g bread flour, for the <em>tangzhong</em></p>
<p>190 g full-fat milk</p>
<p>1½ teaspoons easy bake/ quick/ instant yeast</p>
<p>25 g unrefined caster sugar</p>
<p>500 g bread flour</p>
<p>¾ teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>85 g beaten egg (use the remainder for the egg wash)</p>
<p>85 g unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p>rest of egg + 1 tablespoon double cream, for the egg wash</p>
<p>sesame seeds for sprinkling over</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also need two lined baking sheets for the larger rolls, or 2 x 20 cm square pans for the small dinner rolls. Oil a large mixing bowl with 1 teaspoon of sunflower or rapeseed oil. My recipe is specifically for use with a <a href="https://www.vorwerk.co.uk/en/c/home/products/thermomix.html">Thermomix</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>First make the tangzhong. Place 150 g full-fat milk + 30 g bread flour in a small saucepan over low heat. On my electric hob this is level 6. Stir the mixture vigorously for around 3½ minutes. This will result in a soft paste.</p>
<p>Remove the paste from the warm pan and place in a bowl to cool down. Place the tangzhong next to the other ingredients you are using for the dough.</p>
<p>Start on the bread dough. Place 190 g full-fat milk + 1½ teaspoons instant yeast in the TM bowl. Warm <strong>2 minutes / 37 C / speed 2</strong>.</p>
<p>Add 25 g sugar, 500 g bread flour, ¾ teaspoon salt, 85 g egg and 85 g butter. IMPORTANT: now add the cooled tangzhong. Knead <strong>3 minutes / dough function</strong>.</p>
<p>Using an oiled silicone spatula, scrape the dough into the oiled bowl. Pull the sides of the dough gently towards the middle, then turn it over to make a ball. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave in a warm spot to proof until doubled in size. This take around 1½ hours (or 1 hour in an oven with a dough-proofing function). You can also keep the dough overnight in the refrigerator, to have a longer proof of 8 hours. Bring the dough back to room temperature before continuing with the recipe.</p>
<p>After the first rise, divide the dough into 10 portions, around 100 g each. For small dinner rolls, divide the dough into 18 balls of around 60 g each (place 9 rolls in each square baking pan). I weigh each portion out to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>Roll each dough ball into a circle, then gather the edge of the dough towards the centre. Twist the top of the dough together and turn upside down, forming a bun.</p>
<p>Place the bun onto the lined baking tray. Repeat with the remaining buns.</p>
<p>When all the buns have been formed, cover with a piece of cling film and proof for around 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this second proofing heat the oven to to 180 C / 160 C fan. Beat 1 tablespoon of egg with 1 tablespoon of double cream and use this egg wash to brush the top of the buns. Sprinkle over the sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Bake the buns for 20 minutes until golden brown.</p>
<p>Let the buns cool down before eating.</p>
