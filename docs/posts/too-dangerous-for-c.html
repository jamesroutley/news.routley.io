    <h1>Too dangerous for C&#43;&#43;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                <p>Some patterns are only made practical thanks to Rust&#39;s memory safety, and too dangerous to use in C++. Here&#39;s a concrete example.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Working on an internal library written in Rust, I had an error type for a parser that I wanted to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html"><code>Clone</code>able</a>, without duplicating the data inside. In Rust, this calls for a <strong>r</strong>eference-<strong>c</strong>ounted pointer, like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html">Rc</a>.</p>
<p>So I wrote my error type, used it as the error variant of the fallible functions, and moved on with my life.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Error {
</span><span>    </span><span>data</span><span>: Rc&lt;ExpensiveToCloneDirectly&gt;,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>pub type </span><span>Response = Result&lt;Output, Error&gt;;
</span><span>
</span><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: Input) -&gt; Response {
</span><span>    todo!()
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sometimes later, we noticed that parsing would take a long time to execute on some inputs, so I decided I&#39;d send the input to another thread via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">channel</a>, and I&#39;d get the response back through another channel, so that long orders wouldn&#39;t block the main thread.</p>

<p>As the compiler nicely explained, it is because the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#impl-Send-for-Rc%3CT,+A%3E"><code>Rc</code> type does not support being sent between threads</a>, as doing so would cause data races. Indeed, the reference count in <code>Rc</code> is not manipulated in an atomic manner that would be thread safe, it is using regular integer operations.</p>
<p>For thread-safe reference counting, Rust offers <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html">another type called <code>Arc</code></a>, that uses <strong>a</strong>tomic <strong>r</strong>eference <strong>c</strong>ounting. Modifying the code to use <code>Arc</code> is a simple matter of:</p>

<p>As long as I didn&#39;t need reference counting to be atomic, I could use <code>Rc</code>. When I needed thread-safety, the compiler forced me to switch to <code>Arc</code> and the overhead of atomic reference counting. This is an illustration of the old principle of &#34;don&#39;t pay for what you don&#39;t use&#34;.</p>
<p>This principle is dear to the heart of C++ developers too, yet in stark contrast to Rust, C++ only has shared pointers with atomic reference counting in its standard library, that is the equivalent to <code>Arc</code>, not <code>Rc</code>. You always pay for the atomic even if you don&#39;t use it. Providing 2 classes was considered, but rejected, notably because <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15140227/1614219">it was deemed too dangerous</a> (&#34;Code written with the unsynchronized <code>shared_ptr</code> may end up being used in threaded code down the road, ending up causing difficult to debug problems with no warning&#34;).</p>
<p>Because Rust will catch these at compile time, it is not dangerous.</p>
<p>On some C++ standard library implementations, there are attempts to recover the lost performance in some limited situations (e.g. the program as a whole is not multi-threaded), <a href="http://snf.github.io/2019/02/13/shared-ptr-optimization/">to hilarious effect on micro-benchmarks</a>.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet-it-fails-to-be-safe"><a href="#and-yet-it-fails-to-be-safe" aria-label="Anchor link for: and-yet-it-fails-to-be-safe">And yet it fails to be safe</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately the precaution taken by C++ of always having an atomic reference count is still insufficient to make <code>shared_ptr</code> safe in a multi-threaded context, as one should pay attention to a couple of the proverbial footguns.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a subtle issue, and honestly I don&#39;t think I ever ran into that one, but I include it for clarity because sometimes people mix it with the second one.</p>
<p>You can take a <code>shared_ptr</code> and make a copy of it, calling its copy constructor, in a thread-safe way. What you cannot do, however, is share a single instance of a <code>shared_ptr</code> between multiple threads. Imagine having a struct containing a shared pointer that is shared between threads, and a method on that struct that reassigns the shared pointer. If that method is called unsynchronized by multiple threads, then this will result in undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is enough of an issue that C++20 added a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic2">partial template specialization to <code>std::atomic&lt;std::shared_ptr&gt;</code></a>. My advice, though, would be &#34;don&#39;t do that!&#34;. Instead, keep your shared pointer in a single thread, and send copies to other threads as needed.</p>
<p>Since assignment requires at an exclusive reference or an owned object, Rust statically forbids assigning to an <code>Arc</code> that is shared between multiple threads, avoiding the issue at compile time.</p>
<h3 id="the-pointed-to-object-still-requires-synchronization"><a href="#the-pointed-to-object-still-requires-synchronization" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-pointed-to-object-still-requires-synchronization">The pointed-to object still requires synchronization</a></h3>
<p>In a <code>shared_ptr</code>, only the reference counting is atomic, but the pointed-to object needs its own synchronization for writing and reading from different threads. This is a bit of a pitfall because it is tempting to simplify &#34;<code>shared_ptr</code> is a thread-safely-referenced-counted pointer&#34; to &#34;<code>shared_ptr</code> is a thread-safe reference-counted pointer&#34;, while only the former is true.</p>
<p>While this may seem obvious to seasoned developers, I saw a lot more of this issue in the wild, probably always by junior developers 🙃  never by experienced developers refactoring their code to introduce threads 😇</p>
<p>Naturally, Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#thread-safety">imposes the same requirement</a> on the content of <code>Arc</code>, but <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#impl-Send-for-Arc%3CT,+A%3E">thanks</a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html">the <code>Send</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html">the <code>Sync</code></a> traits, and <code>Arc</code> only providing shared reference to its contents, writing and reading the pointed-to object unsynchronized is a compile-time error.</p>
<p>Rust achieves this result entirely thanks to the borrow checker and its type system. It is the only language I used that can statically <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html">prevent data races</a>.</p>
