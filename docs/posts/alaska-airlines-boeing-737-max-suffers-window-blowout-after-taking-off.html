Aircraft is now leveling 12,000 in a left turn heading three four zero,&#39; the unidentified woman could be heard saying after Friday evening&#39;s drama over the skies of Portland in <a target="_self" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-fabf7a20-ac5e-11ee-8998-a34089685955">Oregon</a>.</p><p>&#39;We need a divert. We&#39;ve declared an emergency. We are depressurized.

The controversial jet was carrying 171 passengers and six crew.</p><p>Its catastrophic failure depressurized the cabin, with the force of the air rushing in ripping the shirt off a young boy, whose mom was seen holding onto him. Passengers also watched as their phones were sucked out into the night sky.</p><p>Terrifying footage showed fliers looking out through the gaping hole of the fuselage onto the twinkling lights of Portland below in the eerily quiet cabin.</p><p>Miraculously, no injuries were reported on the plane, which had only gone into service in November 2023. Boeing, Alaska Airlines and the National Transportation Safety Board have all launched investigations. </p><div>  <p>Alaska flight 1282 left Portland just after 5pm local time on Friday when a window blew out at 16,000 feet, ripping a child&#39;s shirt off</p></div><div>  <p>The Boeing 737-9 MAX rolled off the assembly line just two months ago, receiving its certification in November 2023, according to FAA record posted online</p></div><div>  <p>A photo shows the blown out window. It is offered as a door on the aircraft. Alaska chose not to take this option - although the frame of the prospective door was entirely ripped out by the fuselage failure  </p></div><p>Passengers reported hearing a &#39;really loud boom&#39; before a &#39;deathly&#39; silence fell over the cabin as the plane made its emergency landing back in Portland around 40 minutes later. </p><p>A 20 year-old woman called Elizabeth <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2024/01/scary-incident-forces-alaska-airlines-flight-back-to-pdx.html">told Oregon Live</a> how &#39;it sounded like your ears were popping like normally on a plane, but 10 times louder. I couldn&#39;t believe it was real.&#39;</p><p>&#39;We were all calm,&#39; she said of her fellow passenger, &#39;but I did feel like I was about to cry, because who knows this could be my last few moments.&#39; </p><p>Another passenger, Kyle Rinker, 29, said the plane became &#39;deathly silent. Nobody made a noise.&#39; </p><p>Reports suggest that 26A, the seat next to the blown-out window was not occupied. </p><p>Although a door is available for that row in the plane&#39;s design Alaska chose not to exercise that option, having the doors deactivated by Boeing before delivery. </p><p>It therefore appears from the inside of the cabin like a regular window seat, although from the outside the frame of the deactivated door remains visible. The area of fuselage that was ripped out aligns perfectly with that door frame, suggesting a possible structural failure. </p><p>The emergency exit doors are designed to open inwardly and cannot be pushed outwards, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.airlinereporter.com/2021/03/we-flew-alaska-airlines-737-max-inaugural-revenue-service-heres-our-newsy-review/">according to Airline Reporter</a>. </p><p>The National Safety Transport Board said it was investigating the event and will post any updates when they are available. </p><p>The Boeing 737-9 MAX rolled off the assembly line just two months ago, receiving its certification in November 2023, according to FAA record posted online. </p><p>Several passengers <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kptv.com/2024/01/06/plane-window-blows-out-mid-air-makes-emergency-landing-portland-airport/">told KPTV</a> that the airplane&#39;s oxygen masks deployed immediately, and multiple people used the masks as they waited for the plane to land at PDX.</p><p>Another passenger told the outlet that a child had to be held in his seat by his mom. </p><div>  <p>Reports suggest that fortunately 26A, the seat next to what appears to have been an emergency exit with a window, was not occupied</p></div><div>  <p>Reports suggest that fortunately 26A, the seat next to what appears to have been an emergency exit with a window, was not occupied.
