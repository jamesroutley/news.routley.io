                Aegis Authenticator is a free, secure and open source app for
                Android to manage your 2-step verification tokens for your
                online services.

                <h3>Encryption</h3>
                <p>
                  All of your one-time passwords are stored in a vault. If you
                  choose to set a password (highly recommended), the vault will
                  be encrypted using strong cryptography. If someone with
                  malicious intent gets a hold of the vault file, it’s
                  impossible for them to retrieve the contents without knowing
                  the password. Entering your password each time you need access
                  to a one-time password can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can
                  also enable biometric unlock if your device has a biometrics
                  sensor (i.e. fingerprint or face unlock).
                </p>

              </p>
              <div>
                <h3>Organization</h3>
                <p>
                  Over time, you&#39;ll likely accumulate tens of entries in your
                  vault. Aegis Authenticator has lots of organization options to
                  make finding the one you need at a particular moment easier.
                  Set a custom icon for an entry to make it easier to find.
                  Search by account name or service name. Have a lot of one-time
                  passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier access.
                  Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.

              <div>
                <h3>Backups</h3>
                <p>
                  To make sure you will never lose access to your online
                  accounts, Aegis Authenticator can create automatic backups of
                  the vault to a location of your choosing. If your cloud
                  provider supports the Storage Access Framework of Android
                  (like Nextcloud does), it can even create automatic backups to
                  the cloud. Creating manual exports of the vault is also
                  supported.

                        Wonderful new 2FA app! I&#39;ve been looking for one with
                        password security and the ability to use the phone&#39;s
                        fingerprint sensor to open.

                        The app is the new player on 2fa market. Love that it&#39;s
                        open source and comes with more secure encryption out of
                        box than competitors. Devs are super active and
                        responsive to the feedback.

                        Simple, effective and the peace of mind that comes with
                        open source code. Bye bye Google Authenticator!

                      Compared to other 2FA apps, we think Aegis stands out in
                      terms of its simplicity and security. Most popular apps
                      like Google Authenticator and FreeOTP don&#39;t bother with
                      additional security measures. They allow access to your
                      tokens right after opening the app. Aegis, on the other
                      hand, encrypts all of your tokens at rest and requires a
                      password or the touch of a finger to decrypt them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another important feature is the ability to export your
                      tokens and import them into another device. Google
                      Authenticator doesn&#39;t have this, which has not only
                      annoyed users for years, but has also resulted in loss of
                      access to lots of accounts.

                  <p>Maybe! We certainly welcome feature requests and we make
                    sure to consider every one of them. However, as we work on
                    this app in our spare time, we can&#39;t make any promises as to
                    when or if it will make it into the app. We usually work on
                    the features we would like to have ourselves, so if you&#39;d
                    like to see a feature sooner rather than later, the fastest
                    way would be to contribute! We&#39;re happy to help you in the
                    process. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues">GitHub</a>.</p>
