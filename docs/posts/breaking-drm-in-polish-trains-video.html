<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>We&#39;ve all been there: the trains you&#39;re servicing for a customer suddenly brick themselves and the manufacturer claims that&#39;s because you&#39;ve interfered with a security system.</p>

<p>This talk will tell the story of a series of Polish EMUs (Electric Multiple Unit) that all refused to move a few days after arriving at an “unauthorized” service company. We&#39;ll go over how a train control system actually works, how we reverse-engineered one and what sort of magical “security” systems we actually found inside of it.</p>

<p>Reality sometimes is stranger than the wildest CTF task. Reality sometimes is running `unlock.py` on a dozen trains.</p>

<p>The talk will be a mix of technical and non-technical aspects of analysis which should be understandable for anyone with a technical background. We’ll briefly explain how modern EMUs look like inside, how the Train Control &amp; Monitoring System works, and how to analyze TriCore machine code.</p>
