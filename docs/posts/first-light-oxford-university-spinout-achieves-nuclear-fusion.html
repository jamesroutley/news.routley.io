<p><strong></strong> First Light Fusion (First Light), the University of Oxford fusion spin-out, today confirms it has achieved fusion. The UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has independently validated the result. <br/></p>
<p>This is the first time fusion has been achieved using the unique targets developed by First Light, and the corresponding projectile technology. First Light’s mission is to solve the problem of fusion power with the simplest machine possible. Projectile fusion is a new approach to inertial fusion that is simpler, more energy efficient, and has lower physics risk. First Light has achieved fusion having spent less than £45 million, and with a rate of performance improvement faster than any other fusion scheme in history.</p>


























<p><em>“</em><em>By focusing on an approach to fusion which is both simpler and cheaper than other fusion technologies, we believe we have identified a genuine route to commercial fusion, with a view to meeting not just vital scientific milestones, but also to develop a sustainable business model. Our unique target technology enables a business model based on consumables, which differentiates us from all other fusion technologies. This includes the manufacture and distribution of the targets themselves,</em><em> using partners for the plant development largely borrowing from existing technologies</em><em>. Our focus on the business model is equally important: fusion must show it is more than an expensive science experiment, but that it can be a commercial solution to the challenge of producing baseload clean energy</em><em>”</em><strong>Ian Chapman, UKAEA chief executive, said:</strong><em>“Fusion promises to be a safe, low carbon and sustainable part of the world’s future energy supply, and we support all advances in this scientific and engineering grand challenge. These results are another important step forward, and we are impressed that First Light have arranged independent analysis of their result.”</em><strong>FUSION FACTS</strong></p>



<ul><li>First Light has shown the most rapid progress on fusion triple product of any project in the history of fusion</li><li>The number of neutrons produced is low, around 50, however, this matches the predicted yield exactly</li><li>The speed of the projectile is 6.5 kilometres per second, which is 14,500 miles per hour</li><li>The fuel implodes at over 70 kilometres per second, over 6 times escape velocity</li><li>The fuel is compressed to a pressure of 10 Terapascals, which is 100 million atmospheres, higher than the pressure in the centre of Jupiter</li><li>The fuel capsule within the target is a few mm in size</li><li>When it fuses, the fuel has been compressed down to less than 100 microns in size, smaller than the thickness of a human hair</li><li>Our targets boost the pressure of impact by over 20 times</li><li>In a power plant the process would be repeated every 30 seconds</li><li>In a power plant, each target would release enough energy to power the average UK home for over 2 years</li></ul>
<p><strong>The need for fusion</strong></p>
<ul><li>Global power demand is expected to double by 2040 and could increase fivefold by 2060 when new technologies enable the electrification of a wider range of applications, particularly important at a time of ongoing global energy insecurity and in the broader context of achieving critical net zero goals as part of collective efforts to address climate change. </li><li>First Light commissioned research concluded that 19,900 TWh per year could be generated from wind and solar globally by 2040. This is an 8-fold increase on today but is still less than half of the projected requirement. </li><li>So while the rapid and maximum deployment of renewables is key to achieving the 2050 Paris target, in several parts of the world wind and solar power alone will not be able to meet projected energy demand, opening up a market for clean baseload power to complement renewables. </li><li>To mitigate the impact of climate change a large global market for baseload clean power will open up to complement renewables and that is where fusion energy will play a key role.</li></ul>

First Light’s inertial confinement approach aims to create the extreme temperatures and pressures required for fusion by compressing a target using a hypervelocity projectile. First Light’s approach to fusion energy, which is safe, clean, and virtually limitless, has the potential to transform the world’s energy system. Unlike existing nuclear, there is no long-lived waste, no meltdown risk, and raw materials can be found in abundance. First Light’s investors include Oxford Science Enterprises (formerly OSI) and IP Group plc.</p>
