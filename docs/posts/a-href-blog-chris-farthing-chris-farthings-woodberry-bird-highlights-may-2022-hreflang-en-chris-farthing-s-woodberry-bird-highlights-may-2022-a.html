    <div><p>The first half of May generally sees a few migrant birds passing through, before things settle down as the breeding season takes over. By the end of May we usually only see birds which breed here or birds visiting from their breeding ground within a few miles of here.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><p><strong>Swifts </strong>were late arriving back to the UK this year and unusually we had to wait until 4<sup>th</sup> May for our first. Other migrants seen in early May were low numbers of <strong>common sandpiper</strong>, <strong>sand martin</strong>, <strong>house martin</strong> and <strong>swallow</strong>. The first<strong> spotted flycatcher </strong>of the year was seen on the 10<sup>th</sup> with two birds being seen along the new river together on the 14<sup>th</sup>. The 14<sup>th</sup> also saw the first <strong>whitethroat</strong> of the year. Our reputation as one of the best sites for flycatchers in London was demonstrated by a <strong>pied flycatcher</strong> being seen on the 19<sup>th</sup>, also along the new river just northeast of the main entrance.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p><strong>Common terns (above)</strong> were first seen on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and thereafter became daily visitors, although the highest count was only four. One pair showed interest in one of our tern rafts. After being scarce for the first four months of the year, sightings of <strong>little egret (below)</strong> increased in May. First they were seen regularly in the mud during a period of low water levels, but after the level rose they still came to catch fish near the water inlet.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The group of four <strong>red-crested pochard</strong> which were seen earlier in the year still popped in a few times in early may, as did a single <strong>shelduck</strong>, presumably from Walthamstow Wetlands where the species breed. The good year for larger raptors continued with a few more sightings each of<strong> buzzard</strong> and <strong>red kite (below)</strong>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>One happy<strong> </strong>event which<strong> </strong>usually takes place in May here is the hatching of cygnets. The reservoir pair still haven’t nested this year but the pair on the new river hatched seven <strong>cygnets (below)</strong> starting on the 10<sup>th</sup>. They had lost one by the end of the month but six is still a good number.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The total number of bird species seen here in May 2022 was 65, around three short of the average for the corresponding month in the previous five years.</p></div>
