    <h1>KDE Asking for Donations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Why do we <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">ask for donations</a> so often? Because it‚Äôs important! As KDE becomes more successful and an increasing number of people use our software, our costs grow as well:</p>



<ul>
<li>Web and server hosting</li>



<li>Organizing and hosting larger Akademy events</li>



<li>Funding more and larger sprints</li>



<li>Paying people to work on stuff the volunteer community doesn‚Äôt focus on, and retaining them over time</li>
</ul>



<p>And so on. If we don‚Äôt raise more money while our software becomes more popular, we risk ‚Äúdying of success,‚Äù so to speak. Remember, we give all this stuff away for free, no strings attached! Nobody has to pay a cent if they don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt afford to.</p>



<p>Accordingly, if you‚Äôre plugged into KDE social media, you probably see a lot of requests for <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">donations</a>. I end every one of my ‚ÄúThis Week in KDE‚Äù posts with one, and many others do for <a href="https://planet.kde.org">their own blog posts</a> as well. KDE‚Äôs official social media channels blast it out constantly, and we also do yearly fundraisers that are widely promoted online. If you‚Äôre reading this, you may get the impression that we‚Äôre always begging for cash!</p>



<p>But if you‚Äôre <em>not</em> plugged into these communications channels, you might not have ever seen a donation request at all. We know that the fraction of people who subscribe to these channels is small, so there‚Äôs a <em>huge</em> number of people who may not even know they <em>can</em> donate to KDE, let alone that donations are critically important to its continued existence.</p>



<p>Starting in Plasma 6.2, that changes, and I‚Äôd like to introduce what it will look like! From 6.2 onwards, Plasma itself will <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490">show a system notification asking for a donation</a> once per year, in December:</p>

<p>The idea here is to get the message that KDE really does need your financial help in front of more eyeballs ‚Äî especially eyeballs not currently looking at KDE‚Äôs public-facing promotion efforts.</p>



<hr/>



<p>Now, I know that messages like this can be controversial! The change was carefully considered, and we tried our best to minimize the annoying-ness factor: It‚Äôs small and unobtrusive, and no matter what you do with it (click any button, close it, etc) it‚Äôll go away until next year. It‚Äôs implemented as a KDE Daemon (KDED) module, which allows users and distributors to permanently disable it if they like. You can also disable just the popup on System Settings‚Äô Notifications page, accessible from the configure button in the notification‚Äôs header.</p>



<p>Ultimately the decision to do this came down to the following factors:</p>



<ol>
<li>We looked at FOSS peers like Thunderbird and Wikipedia which have similar things (and in Wikipedia‚Äôs case, the message is vastly more intrusive and naggy). In both cases, it didn‚Äôt drive everyone away and instead instead resulted in a massive increase in donations that the projects have been able to use to employ lots of people.</li>



<li>KDE really needs something like this to help our finances grow sustainably in line with our userbase and adoption by vendors and distributors.</li>
</ol>



<p>So now let me address what I anticipate will be some common concerns:</p>



<h2>I think you‚Äôre wrong; people hate pop-ups and this is going to turn them off!</h2>



<p>Like I said, peer organizations didn‚Äôt see that happen, and some were even more in-your-face about it. I do suspect a small but vocal crowd of people will spread doom and gloom about it on social media anyway, of course. This also happened when we implemented off-by-default telemetry ‚Äî which by the way, <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/metrics-in-kde-are-they-useful/">was implemented so conservatively that it barely collects any information of value at all</a>. It‚Äôs a cautionary tale about the danger of being too timid and ending up with the worst of both worlds.</p>



<p>The worst-case scenario is that we don‚Äôt get more donations from this after a couple of years, and end up removing it. That‚Äôs always an option. But I think it‚Äôs worth venturing out there and being a bit bold! With risk comes opportunity.</p>



<h2>KDE shouldn‚Äôt need to pay people directly; employment should come from vendors and distributors shipping our software!</h2>



<p>To a certain extent this already does happen: by far the largest contributor of paid work is Blue Systems ‚Äî mostly funded by Valve Corporation, which ships KDE software on the Steam Deck. There are also trickles and spurts of sponsored work from distros, KDAB, and enterprising folks who get funded via grants.</p>



<p>Ultimately a healthy economic ecosystem around KDE includes people employed by many parties, including KDE itself, in my opinion. This is how KDE can help control its own destiny. And that costs money! Money that needs to come from somewhere.</p>



<h2>Why does it have to be a notification pop-up? Put this in Welcome Center or something!</h2>



<p>We had a request for donations in Welcome center for several years, and it didn‚Äôt make a difference, because right after you‚Äôve installed the system wasn‚Äôt the right time to ask. At that point, you don‚Äôt know if you like Plasma yet, so asking for money is premature.</p>



<h2>If KDE is as successful as Thunderbird and Wikipedia have been, what are you going to do with all that money?</h2>



<p>This is a question the KDE e.V. board of directors as a whole would need to answer, and any decision on it will be made collectively.</p>



<p>But as one of the five members on that board, I can tell you my personal answer and the one that as your representative, I‚Äôd advocate for. It‚Äôs basically the platform I ran on two years ago: extend an offer of full-time employment to our current people, and hire even more! I want us to end up with paid QA people and distro developers, and even more software engineers. I want us to fund the creation of a next-generation KDE OS we can offer directly to institutions looking to switch to Linux, and a hardware certification program to go along with it. I want us to to extend our promotional activities and outreach to other major distros and vendors and pitch our software to them directly. I want to see Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ship Plasma by default. I want us to use this money to take over the world ‚Äî with freedom, empowerment, and kindness.</p>



<p>These have been dreams for a long time, and throughout KDE we‚Äôve been slowly moving towards them over the years. With a lot more money, we can turbocharge the pace! If that stuff sounds good, you can <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">start with a donation today</a>. üôÇ </p>



<hr/>



<p>I know talking about money can be awkward. But failure to plan is planning to fail; money is something we can‚Äôt ignore and just hope things work out ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt. Raising more money is a part of that plan, and this new yearly donation notification is a part of raising money. It‚Äôs my expectation and hope that asking our users for donations will result in more donations, and that we can use these to accelerate KDE‚Äôs reach and the quality of our software!</p>
