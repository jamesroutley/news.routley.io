    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, January 7, 2025</em></p><p>I&#39;ve been using the TUI version of the book software for a couple days, and have some observations!</p><p>First off, here&#39;s how it looks:</p><p><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/beeps-0.3.0.png" alt="a TUI for tagging pings running in a terminal with a blue background. The interface is two columns: one for ping times, and one for tags. Several tags are filled in, mostly with &#34;sleep.&#34;"/></p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>Unlike my previous attempts at making this software, I can see and edit the whole database. I knew that would be helpful, but it&#39;s way more helpful than I thought! For example, I no longer have to guess as much at what I previously tagged something. I can also go back and adjust without editing the file directly!</p><p>I&#39;m also finding that my memory of precisely what I&#39;m doing can get spotty quickly. For example, I got a notification about a ping this morning and thought &#34;oh, I&#39;ll tag that in a minute. It&#39;s easy; I&#39;m doing <code>X</code>!&#34; Ten minutes later, I went back and couldn&#39;t for the life of me remember what <code>X</code> had been. I know it was something related to journaling, but not the exact details.</p><p>I guess that&#39;s part of the point, though: removing the ability to gloss over time I spent unwisely is a major part of why I wanted this system to exist in the first place!</p><p>As I&#39;ve added features to this TUI, though, it&#39;s becoming less and less suited as the subject of a book that&#39;s not <em>only</em> about making TUIs in Rust. I&#39;m almost at the point of wanting to drop it for the book and make some simpler entry-only interface instead… problem is, I didn&#39;t find the entry-only interface was very nice to use at all! Since part of this book is making good choices for product design like that, I don&#39;t really want to go back to that.</p></article></div>
