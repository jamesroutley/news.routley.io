<p><h2><i>Website is Now and Forever a Mess</i></h2></p>
<p>Now is the point where, if all impulses were followed, I&#39;d write about developing my special little website.
I might include rationale for choosing tools, prior art, and maybe even attempt to connect the construction to some higher programming ideals in the hopes that they become true for me by association.
But, staring down the empty scaffolding I&#39;ve created, it&#39;s clear to me: this website is a mess and I prefer it that way.
It&#39;s my mess!
I hope my voice will be present in dead ends, nonsensical organization, inconsistent writing styles, and inevitable inaccuracies.
Please enjoy the &#34;<a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/mess/">weeds, and tools left lying on the ground</a>&#34;.
</p><p>Building a website is a very open-ended task I&#39;ve approached a few times without lasting success.
I don&#39;t have much experience with the web, and really not much regular interest.
I&#39;ll get caught in some sub-problem that&#39;s more interesting to me like styling CSS or <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/hhtml/blob/main/src/Markup/Parse.hs">writing parsers</a>.
Simply, this website is whatever exists at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/website">https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/website</a>.
As of writing, I&#39;ve glued POSIX tools together for an ad-hoc markup language.
If you want to see what it looks like, <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/website/tree/main/item/src/colophon.m4">see the source of this page</a>.
