    <h1>Emacs 29.1 Released</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Today is a great day for Emacs - Emacs 29.1 has just been released<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>!
Every Emacs release is special, but I haven’t been so excited about a new version of Emacs
in ages. Why so?</p>

<p><strong>Reason #1</strong> - <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2021/12/06/emacs-is-not-a-proper-gtk-application/">pure GTK
front-end</a>
(a.k.a. <code>pgtk</code>). This also means that now Emacs supports natively Wayland. Which in tern means that it’s easier than ever to run <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/using-emacs-on-windows-11-with-wsl2/">Emacs in Windows’s WSL</a>. This is huge!</p>

<p><strong>Reason #2</strong> - built-in support for the massively popular <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> via <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">eglot</a>. <code>eglot</code> has existed for a while, but it’s nice
to see it bundled with Emacs going forward. This will certainly make Emacs better positioned to complete with “modern” editors like VS Code.</p>

<p><strong>Reason #3</strong> - built-in support for
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">TreeSitter</a>. This means that a few
years down the road we’ll have many Emacs major modes that are much faster, robust
and feature-rich. It’s infinitely easier to built a major mode using a real
parser instead of using regular expressions.  Lots of built-in modes have
already been updated to have a version using <code>TreeSitter</code> internally. Frankly, I
can’t think of a bigger improvement in Emacs in the almost 20 years I’ve been an
Emacs user. Exciting times ahead!</p>

<p>You can read all about the new release <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.29">here</a>. I’ll likely write a few articles about some of the new features in the weeks and months to come. In Emacs We Trust! M-x Forever!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Feel free to share in the comments what are you most excited about.</p>
