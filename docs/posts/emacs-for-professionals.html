  <p>This is a series of brief articles aimed at teaching Emacs to
  computer professionals who are unfamiliar with it. I do not dwell on
  the basics of the user interface, which can be learned from the
  built-in tutorial. Instead, each article in this series will distill
  one very specific command line (CLI) tool or technique that
  Linux/UNIX users often use, and describe an equivalent function or
  technique in Emacs. The tool or technique discussed will be specific
  enough that the whole article can explain the concept in around 1000
  words, and will provide examples, or specific actions to be
  taken. The goal is to have a list of recipes that Linux users can
  search and find quickly, and read through in just a few minutes, to
  learn the most useful ways of using Emacs to solve day-to-day
  problems.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>In the year 2022 and beyond, there is no shortage of
  professionals who are quite skilled at using computers to do their
  jobs. Among this demographic, a plurality are fluent in using Linux
  (or a UNIX like Mac OS X). They can use the interactive command line
  tools for these OSs, like Vim and Tmux, and the shell scripting with
  tools like the GNU Coreutils
  (e.g. <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>) within CLI shell
  languages Bash, Zsh, Fish. Most have written short scripts or
  programs with languages like Python, and have tried using (or have
  at least heard of) the Lisp programming language before.</p>

  <p>It seems clear to me that people with this level of knowledge,
  the people who I am calling <i><q>computer professionals</q></i>
  could benefit a great deal from learning about Emacs, and how Emacs
  is capable of performing all of the functions that the other Linux
  interactive command line tools provide. I also think that many of
  the small, one-time-use scripts that could be written in Python
  could be written as well in a language like Emacs Lisp, and
  professionals could benefit from this knowledge as well.</p>

  <p>And yet, in my experience, there is not nearly enough educational
  material about Emacs created with this group of <i>professionals</i>
  in mind as the target audience. Most Emacs-related content found on
  the Internet falls into two categories: (1) the fundamentals of how
  to use Emacs key bindings to edit text, aimed at absolute beginners
  who have never tried using Emacs before, and (2) discussion for
  seasoned Emacs users about tools and technique that they might try
  out for themselves to complement their existing Emacs workflow.</p>

  <p>To be sure, there is good material out there aimed at
  professionals. But the nuggets of useful information are often just
  one element of a larger topic discussed at great depth that might
  take some 30 minutes or more to read completely. Not that this is
  bad, but somtimes a more concise recipe-like document is really what
  I want to read. (See also: a list of my favorite Emacs
  educators <a href="http://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001/articles/2022-04-27_best-way-to-learn-emacs.html#bloggers-who-emacs">in
  this article</a>.)</p>

  <p>This was frustrating for me when I first wanted to learn about
  Emacs. I have earned my masters degree in computer science, and
  having worked as a software engineer for 10 years, the whole time
  using Bash, Vim, and GNU Screen for doing much of my work. But I had
  a hard time finding learning material about Emacs that wasn&#39;t for
  complete beginners, or that wasn&#39;t a string of Emacs jargon
  indecipherable to someone who had no experience using Emacs beyond
  simply editing text.</p>

  <h4>A conscious decision to switch</h4>
  <p>I had tried learning Emacs on multiple occasions as a graduate
  student, and was always frustrated with the user experience. It
  wasn&#39;t
  intuitive <a href="http://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001/articles/2022-04-27_best-way-to-learn-emacs.html#cheat-sheet">how
  to navigate the user manual</a>, and there were seemingly better
  options available: <code>vim</code> and <code>tmux</code> are a
  powerful combination, and have very good manual pages.</p>

  <p>I eventually made a decision to learn Emacs because I knew that
  it follows the principles of functional programming better than
  ordinary shell scripting. In functional programming you have two key
  ingredients:
  <b>functions</b>, and a means to <b>compose</b> functions together
  to build larger functions that solve a particular problem. Without
  using Emacs, your functions are the Linux CLI tools, and you can
  compose these tools with shell pipes to solve problems. But Emacs
  provides better ways of composing CLI tools because it is programmed
  in Lisp, which is a functional programming language. Emacs also
  provides a better framework for constructing views over your data
  than something like Ncurses and the ANSI terminal protocol. Once I
  had made this realization, it was obvious to me why Emacs was the
  best toolkit to use in my day-to-day work, and I consciously put in
  the effort to overcome frustration and finally learn Emacs as a
  skill.</p>

  <p>As I got better at using Emacs, I started to see how I did not
  usually need to consciously compose the Emacs functions together,
  function composition often happened naturally because of the way the
  Emacs user interface is setup, and also because most Emacs functions
  compose together over a very versatile data structure: the
  <b>text buffer</b>. But also, Emacs has encoded the techniques of
  Linux and UNIX users and Lisp programmers accumulated over it&#39;s
  half-century long existence, and these techniques are just there
  waiting to be discovered.</p>

  <p>So I write this series in the hopes that other professionals like
  myself might come to the same realization that I did about Emacs
  being a more useful toolkit than what they may currently be using
  now, while quickly learning the techniques necessary to replace
  their existing workflow with an equivalent Emacs-based workflow, and
  forgoing the tedious prerequisite lessons on cursor navigation, or
  the basics of Lisp programming.</p>
