      Weather APIs are notoriously complicated—every vendor offers their own proprietary data structures,
      unit types, and request formats. With Weather Machine, you can write just one integration and get highly
      accurate global forecasts from The Weather Company, AccuWeather, AerisWeather, and many other sources.

      Dark Sky&#39;s single-response JSON format remains the gold standard for developer friendliness.
      Weather Machine makes every data source drop-in compatible with Dark Sky&#39;s API, so you can
      switch over in minutes.

      You can use our Dark Sky compatible JSON endpoint, or GraphQL for conditional
      fetching of specific data. Either way, you automatically get parallelization, unit conversion,
      well-formatted responses, and caching with zero configuration.

      saving you money without sacrificing any speed or accuracy.
