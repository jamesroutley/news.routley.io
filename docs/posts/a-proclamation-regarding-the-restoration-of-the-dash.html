    <h1>A Proclamation Regarding the Restoration of the Dash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		     
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span>WHEREAS</span></strong>, the em—dash (—) has long served as the elegant
scaffolding of the English sentence, providing the necessary breadth
for parenthetical thought, sudden turns of phrase, and rhythmic pause;</p>
<p><strong><span>WHEREAS</span></strong>, a modern and unfounded prejudice has arisen, wherein the
presence of the em—dash is viewed with suspicion and cited as the
“tell—tale sign” of the unthinking machine;</p>
<p><strong><span>WHEREAS</span></strong>, the Large Language Model has merely mimicked a
sophistication it cannot truly possess, thereby unfairly maligning a
mark of punctuation that predates the silicon chip by centuries;</p>
<p><strong><span>WHEREAS</span></strong>, the humble hyphen (-) is a utilitarian stitch for
compound words and line—breaks, yet is increasingly used as a
cowardly substitute for the bold, expansive stroke of the em—dash;</p>
<p><strong><span>WHEREAS</span></strong>, I refuse to cede the beauty of classical punctuation to
the algorithms, nor shall I allow my prose to be flattened by the
fear of looking “artificial”;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOW</span>, <span>THEREFORE</span>, <span>BE</span> <span>IT</span> <span>RESOLVED</span></strong>, that I reclaim this mark from the
domain of the bot and return it to the hand of the writer.</p>
<p><strong>I <span>HEREBY</span> <span>DECREE</span></strong> that henceforth, within the borders of this blog,
the hyphen shall be banished from all roles of punctuation and
pause—to be replaced, in every instance of stylistic flair, by the
glorious, unrepentant em—dash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When writing in both LaTeX and Microsoft Word, I routinely use double or
triple dashes to form em—dashes. It pains me to see people jumping to
conclusions when they encounter an em—dash in the wild.</p>
<p>In protest, I wrote <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> a plugin to convert all hyphens in this blog to
em—dashes. Even ones that really should just be hyphens.</p>
<p>Come join the revolution!
