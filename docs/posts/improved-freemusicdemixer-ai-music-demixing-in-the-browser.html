<p>In music demixing or music source separation, AI models are used to separate the different instruments from a music recording into stems. This web application allows you to demix your music files, free and with no usage limits since it runs on <strong>your computer!</strong> ü´µüèΩ</p>

<p>Load a song to decompose it into <strong>bass, drums, vocals, other, and karaoke</strong> using a near-state-of-the-art AI model, <a href="https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch">Open-Unmix</a> with the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5069601">UMX-L</a> pretrained weights. This site is created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/sevagh">Sevag H</a>.</p>

<h2 id="runs-locally-in-your-browser">Runs locally in your browser!</h2>

<p>Unlike similar products, <strong>it‚Äôs free to use and doesn‚Äôt store your data.</strong> All processing is done in your browser, and your files are never uploaded anywhere. It runs well on computers and <strong>very slowly</strong> on smartphones; user beware.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>For the demo, I used <a href="https://www.jaxiusmusic.com/file-share/4a94f6cf-a844-4d72-b849-328829fe158f">a free song by Jaxius Music</a>, which you can also download if you don‚Äôt have any music files handy.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a demo of 20 seconds of demixed outputs; press the play button and toggle sources to add or remove them from the mix:</p>


<p>Ready to try it on your own music files?</p>

    </p>

    </div>




<h2 id="latest-news">Latest news</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improved demixing quality by 1+ dB SDR with Wiener filtering</li>
  <li>Support demixing larger tracks with low-memory segmented inference and streaming LSTM</li>
  <li>Added batch demixing and a checkbox to show developer output logs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can only use the outputs for non-commercial applications as per the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5069601">UMX-L weights license</a></li>
  <li>The task is CPU and memory intensive (up to 4 GB), please be patient! Very very large tracks may still crash!</li>
  <li>Please open a <a href="https://github.com/sevagh/free-music-demixer/issues">GitHub Issue</a> for any bugs or feature requests.</li>
