    <h1>CPNG, a backwards compatible fork of PNG</h1>

<p>CPNG (&#34;<b>C</b>om<b>p</b>atible <b>N</b>etwork <b>G</b>raphics&#34;) is a<b> 100% backwards compatible fork of the ~30 year old PNG image format</b>, which is still <b>thoroughly, and probably forever, stuck in the 1990&#39;s</b>. I&#39;ve been quietly designing, prototyping, and <a href="https://github.com/richgel999/fpng/">shipping CPNG&#39;s key features</a>Â over the past couple years on github.</p><p>Why continue messing with PNG at all? <b>Because if you can figure out how to squeeze new features into PNG in a backwards compatible way, it&#39;s instantly compatible with all browsers, OS&#39;s, engines, etc. This is valuable.</b></p><p>I realized, as long as my software is significantly faster for encoding/decoding (&gt;10x encode, &gt;2-3x decode - per thread) and is 100% backwards compatible, I&#39;ll have gathered the momentum and library adoption to also add some badly needed new features: faster encoding/decoding by constraining and simplifying the Deflate stream to pixels vs. bytes, SIMD encoding, multithreading so performance can scale up to modern systems, and real HDR pixels (FP16 IEEE half float and LOGLUV32) so it scales to modern and future HDR monitors/tool chains.</p><p><b>Crucially, the CPNG data stream must be entirely backwards compatible with the existing PNG format</b>, like how color TV was introduced but it still worked on B&amp;W TV&#39;s.<b> New features can be added, as long as existing decoders ignore them and return a viewable image:</b></p></div></div>
