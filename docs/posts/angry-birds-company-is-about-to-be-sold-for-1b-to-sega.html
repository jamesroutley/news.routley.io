    <h1>‘Angry Birds’ company is about to be sold for $1B to Sega</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sega is reportedly close to buying Rovio Entertainment — the company that owns the <em>Angry Birds</em> mobile game franchise — for a whopping $1 billion, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sega-nears-deal-for-angry-birds-mobile-game-maker-12bc7984">according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Sega may lock in the big deal by early next week, according to people speaking with <em>WSJ</em>.</p><p>It’s surprising to think that Sega — specifically, its parent company Sega Sammy Holdings — would want to spend so much on Rovio given the decline in popularity of the <em>Angry Birds</em> games. The original game was a smash success in 2009, but the franchise has seemingly fallen off since its 2014 peak, when Rovio reported <a href="http://time.com/3750618/angry-birds-rovio-profits/">falling profits</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/2/6893259/rovio-may-lay-off-130-as-growth-slows">layoffs</a>.</p><p>In 2016, Rovio tried a movie adaptation, <em>The Angry Birds Movie, </em>which was a box office success and is still the seventh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_based_on_video_games">highest grossing video game movie</a> — even if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/24/12624122/angry-birds-2-rovio-entertainment">reviews weren’t kind</a>. Its 2019 sequel, <em>The Angry Birds Movie 2</em>, did not achieve the same success. Rovio watched as competitors like <em>Candy Crush</em> grew more and more, eating away interest in <em>Angry Birds</em>.</p><div><div><p>Perhaps Sega has dreams of launching Angry Birds into the Nights</p></div></div><p>Recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23609181/angry-birds-rovio-classics-delisted-google-play-app-store-reds-first-flight">Rovio removed its original <em>Angry Birds</em> game</a> from the Google Play Store, and it renamed the iOS version to <em>Red’s First Flight</em>. The move was done seemingly to move players over to its lucrative freemium sequels and obscure the buy once and play forever business model of the original game.</p><p>Rovio previously neared an $800 million deal for Israeli developer Playtika to take over, but <a href="https://investors.playtika.com/news-releases/news-release-details/preliminary-discussions-between-rovio-and-playtika-have-ended">those talks officially dwindled in March</a>. Now, Sega might soon own the Finland-based <em>Angry Birds</em> company instead.</p><p>Rovio’s original <em>Angry Birds</em> game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/5/9/3009640/angry-birds-downloaded-over-one-billion-times">the first mobile game to reach 1 billion downloads</a> (a record <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111221-first-mobile-game-series-to-reach-1-billion-downloads">certified by <em>Guinness World Records</em></a>, in fact), and Rovio claimed its combined library of games had reached 5 billion downloads as of last year. So maybe there’s an argument for the company to valued at a fifth of a dollar per download. Remember that time Take-Two bought social game studio Zynga for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/23/23131804/take-two-zynga-acquisition-complete">$12.7 billion</a>? </p><p>Maybe Sega’s got a new set of heroes on par with Sonic and friends, just waiting for an epic mobile games franchise to propel them.</p></div></div></div>
