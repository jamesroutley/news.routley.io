    <h1>Ego, empathy, and humility at work</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In our daily lives empathy and humility are obvious virtues we aspire to. They keep our egos in check. Less obvious is that they’re practical skills in the workplace, too. I think, for developers and technical leaders in particular, that the absence of ego is the best way to further our careers and do great work.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202105/what-is-the-ego" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">the simplest of terms</a> the ego is the characteristic of personhood that enables us to practice self-reflection, self-awareness, and accountability for the actions or decisions we take.</p><p>However, the ego also motivates us to reframe our perception of the world in whatever way keeps us centered in it. Each of us is perpetually driven to justify our place in the world. This <em>constant self-justification</em> is like an engine that idles for our entire lives, and it requires constant fine-tuning. When it runs amok this is what we call a “big” ego.</p><h2>Breaking News! Developers Have Egos!</h2><p>I’m not thinking only of the 10x engineer stereotype, although I’ve worked with such folks in the past. Ego is more nuanced than that. Besides the most arrogant developer in the room throwing their weight around, our egos manifest in hundreds of ways that are much harder to detect.</p><p>As developers we’re more susceptible to letting our egos run free. The nature of our work is so technical that to others it can seem obscure, arcane, or even magical. Sometimes we don’t do enough to actively dispel that notion—and just like that half the work of self-justification is already done for us.</p><p>Very often it’s not intentional. The simplest example is the overuse of jargon and acronyms. We all do it, but as <a href="https://clearleft.com/thinking/letters-of-exclusion" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Jeremy Keith explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Still, I get why initialisms run rampant in technical discussions. You can be sure that most discussions of particle physics would be incomprehensible to outsiders, not necessarily because of the concepts, but because of the terminology.</p></blockquote><p>Simply mashing a few letters together can be empowering for ourselves while being exclusionary for others. It’s an artifact—albeit a small one—of our egos. We know what the technobabble means. Our justified place in the universe is maintained.</p><p>Sometimes we express our egos more deliberately. Developers have a clear tendency towards gatekeeping. For most, it’s an honest mistake. There’s a fine line between holding others to a certain expectation versus actively keeping people on the outside. When we see ourselves doing this we can correct it easily enough.</p><p>Sadly there are developers who seemingly like to gatekeep. They get to feel like wizards in their towers with their dusty books and potions. But, it’s actually self-limiting. Gatekeeping by definition means you’re fixed in place and never moving, standing guard for eternity.</p><p>My point is our egos can “leak” in so many ways that it takes diligence to catch it let alone correct it. The following is a short, incomplete list of typical statements we as developers might say or hear at work. If you parse them more precisely each one is an attempt at self-justification:</p><ul role="list"><li>“That’s the way we’ve always done it.”</li><li>“It’s not that complicated! You just…”</li><li>“Yeah, I should be able to finish this in a day.”</li><li>“This legacy codebase is an absolute disaster.”</li><li>“Assign it to me. Nobody else will be able to fix it.”</li><li>“You can’t be a senior dev. You don’t know anything about…”</li><li>“Ugh, our morning standup is so useless.”</li><li>“This feature is too important to assign to the junior dev.”</li><li>“We should start using this new tool in our pipeline.”</li><li>“We should never use that new tool in our pipeline.”</li></ul><h2>Everything Is Bigger Than You</h2><p>The ego is concerned with the self but very easily becomes something harmful in the absence of new information or context. Indeed, the ego nudges us to self-justify so much that one could argue it actively <em>resists</em> new information when left unchecked.</p><p>You may have read one of the example statements above with some familiarity and thought, “But what if I’m right?”</p><p>To which I’d say: OK, but should that be your default stance? Why might you feel the need to immediately start a conversation with a self-justification? There are ways to adjust our approach, make our points, and accept new information all at the same time.</p><p>In any interaction—be it a meeting, Slack thread, or water cooler conversation—we must remember that <strong>the matter at hand is bigger than us in ways we don’t yet understand</strong>.</p><p>This is a simple enough heuristic but we need the skills to gain that understanding. We need empathy and humility. Empathy is the ability to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/speaking-in-tongues/202012/what-is-empathy" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">recognize and comprehend what someone else is thinking or feeling</a>. Humility is a resistance to our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainsnacks/201501/the-paradoxical-power-of-humility" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">“competitive reflexes”</a> through the practice of emotional neutrality and vulnerability. Both serve to counteract the ego.</p><p>To make these concepts more actionable I find it simpler to define them in terms of the purposes they serve. Specifically…</p><ol role="list"><li>Empathy is how we <em>gather new information</em>.</li><li>Humility is how we <em>allow information to change our behavior</em>.</li></ol><p>This framing also helps remind us what empathy and humility <em>are not</em>. It’s not about putting yourself in another’s shoes, as the saying goes. It’s not about being submissive or a pushover. It’s not about altruism or self-sacrifice. We can easily practice empathy and humility without it ever being at our own expense.</p><h2>The Pursuit Of Information</h2><p>I don’t know about you but I go to work to solve problems, be creative, and build shit. I can’t think of a single instance where an unruly ego solved anything I’ve worked on. Ego just makes an existing challenge worse. Solutions require information I don’t have yet.</p><p>Empathy and humility are usually top of mind during situations of pain or distress, but they’re really aspects of emotional intelligence that should be activated at all times. Once you adjust your mindset to treat them as basic tools for the <em>pursuit of information</em> you’ll see opportunities to leverage them everywhere.</p><p>Developers can apply this mindset with almost anybody they come into contact with. Fellow developers, naturally. But also less technical teammates (e.g., QAs, designers, product owners, stakeholders) who have their own unique skills and context that our success depends on. And of course our users should be at the center of every problem we’re working to solve. Lastly, even executives and upper management have some insight to offer if you dare (<a href="https://matthogg.fyi/how-to-care-about-your-job-when-it-doesnt-care-about-you/">but only up to a certain point</a>).</p><h2>“Be Curious, Not Judgmental”</h2><p>I’ve been waiting years for a chance to work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Ted Lasso</a> into one of my essays. Today’s the day, readers.</p><p>The titular character is such an archetype for leadership that my jaw hit the floor when I first watched the show. The example Ted sets has spawned <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ted+lasso+leadership" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">countless think pieces about leadership and management</a>. Suffice it to say he exhibits all of my principles over the series’ 34 episodes. He’s empathy and humility sporting a mustache. He’s the absence of ego personified.</p><p>I highly recommend watching the show but to get a taste this 5 minute clip is worth your time. This is the famous “darts scene”…</p><p><iframe type="text/html" title="Ted Lasso 2020 - Darts Scene" data-src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3S16b-x5mRA" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There’s a common and derisive attitude that qualities like empathy or humility are signs of weakness. You have to get all up in your feelings. Ew! But they require enormous reserves of strength, patience, and determination. It’s those who follow their egos who are weak.</p><p>Letting your ego take control is the easiest thing in the world. Just ask any toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Resisting those impulses and remaining calm, on the other hand, has been a virtue humanity has aspired to for thousands of years. As the Roman emperor and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Stoic</a> philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Marcus Aurelius</a> wrote: “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”</p><h2>You’re Neither Ted Lasso Nor A Roman Emperor</h2><p>The practice of empathy, humility, and keeping your ego in check will <strong>test you daily</strong>. The feedback I’ve received the most from my coworkers is that I’m extraordinarily calm and even-keeled in any situation—even situations where I’d be right to freak out.</p><p>Is that just naturally my personality? Maybe in part, but <em>remaining calm is a choice</em>. I’m actively choosing to favor solutions over my own ego. To my colleagues past and present I confess to you now that any time you’ve seen me calm, cool, and collected I was very likely <strong>internally screaming</strong>.</p><p>If this sounds like a lot of work you might be wondering if it’s worth it. I think it is. At the very least your coworkers and colleagues will like you better. That’s no small thing.</p><p>In all seriousness, the positive feedback I get most about the developers I manage is when they’ve demonstrated empathy and humility while dialing back their egos. This is because they’re people we can work with—literally. Nobody wants to work with a narcissist or a rock star. Nobody is materially impressed by <a href="https://matthogg.fyi/developers-your-job-is-not-to-write-code/">how many lines of code we wrote</a>, or how fast we wrote it.</p><p>When people want to work with us—or even look forward to it—that means we have trust and respect. We’ll be on proper footing for working effectively as a group to solve problems. For developers this looks like coaching a junior developer, hopping on a quick call to pair with somebody, or understanding the business value of the next backlog item. For leaders this looks like people who feel empowered to do their work, who can proactively identify issues, or who can rally and adapt when circumstances change.</p><p>Anybody can do this! I can’t think of any other career advice that’s as universal as empathy and humility. Everybody is capable of, at any point in their lives, small yet impactful improvements.</p><p>So remember—watch your ego and look for opportunities to leverage empathy and humility in the pursuit of information so that you can solve problems together.</p><p>In <a href="https://matthogg.fyi/my-working-principles-for-managing-ego-empathy-and-humility/">my next essay on this subject</a> I’ll get into the practical. What I like about this advice is that, while there’s much we can do, we don’t have to do it all to see some benefit. We can pick and choose and try something out. We can take your time and grow. Nobody’s perfect, not even Ted Lasso. Even if we take after a character like <a href="https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Kent" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Roy Kent</a> we can still call that a win. Just watch the show, OK?</p></section></div>
