    <h1>Using Microsoft&#39;s New CLI Text Editor on Ubuntu</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p><strong>If you spend a lot time in a terminal on Linux you’ll have preferred command-line text editor, but Microsoft’s recently announced open-source offering, simply called <em>Edit</em>, might be worth checking out — if only so you know you’re not missing out.</strong></p>



<p><em>Edit</em> is a remake/reboot of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS-DOS Editor</a>, updated to suit current sensibilities. Built using Rust, it aims to deliver a user experience that, per its GitHub page, provides <em>“modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/edit-is-now-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft says it made <em>Edit</em></a> <em>“to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use”</em> on Windows if/when needed, out-of-the-box (as recent versions of Windows do not include a CLI text editor in recent versions).</p>



<p>The arrival of <em>Edit</em> will mean Windows devs aren’t forced to fire up notepad.exe to make a simple shell script edit, but is there any benefit to running the app on Linux? </p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>When I spotlight apps, tools and utilities on this blog, it’s <em>not</em> because I think you (or anyone) “MUST” use them. I simply showcase choices. Whether you choose to use them is up to you.</p>



<h2>Why would Linux users use <em>Edit</em>?</h2>

<p>Windows is the primary target for <em>Edit</em> since it lacks a built-in CLI text editor natively so the fact you can use <em>Edit</em> on Linux (and macOS) is more of bonus than purpose.</p>



<p>But if you use Linux and <em>VSCode</em> your muscle memory might like the fact <em>Edit</em> shares many of the latter’s keybindings. This could make it easier to slot in to your workflow compared to <code>vim</code> or <code>nano</code> (though I stress it’s not a replacement for either of those).</p>



<p>Not that only avowed VSCode fans will see the appeal. </p>



<p>The simplicity of the text-driven UI (TUI) makes it less complex to learn, while the speed of <em>Edit</em>, even when seeking across lines in giant 1GB+ files, is impressive — both USPs are by design.</p>

<p>Eager to avoid “how to exit vim” memes, Microsoft designed <em>Edit</em> as a modeless text editor (as opposed to a multi-mode one like Vim, where you need to learn how to activate different modes and switch between them as needed). </p>



<p>You can <strong>use a mouse or a keyboard</strong> to access menus, select lines or regions of text, position the caret, etc which makes using it feel more intuitive in use than the either/or approach of (admittedly more capable) alternatives.</p>



<p><em>Edit</em> offers up a modest, lightweight set of features (and an equally modest footprint: a mere 250kB out of the box, and fast file opening) including: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Find and Replace</strong> (supports <em>Match Case</em> &amp; <em>Regular Expression</em>)</li>



<li><strong>Word wrap</strong> <strong>on resize</strong> (optional)</li>



<li><strong>Set tab/space indentation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Set/change file encoding</strong></li>



<li><strong>Line Feed (LF) or Carriage Return + Line Feed ( CRLF)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Open multiple files</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There’s pretty much all there is right now. <em>Edit</em> has no syntax highlighting, no range of colour schemes, no command prompt, and few creature comforts common in other command line text editors.</p>



<p><em>Edit</em> is designed to edit text, rather than handle complex task better suited to IDEs.</p>



<p>More features are planned, including colour schemes and a settings TUI, so the list of features will grow in time, but as Microsoft’s aim is speed and simplicity, don’t expect too many bells and whistles. </p>



<p><em>Edit</em> is open source so anyone can modify, contribute, package or fork it.</p>



<h2>How to Run <em>Edit</em> on Ubuntu</h2>

<p><em>Edit</em> is free, open source software that works on Windows, Linux and macOS (so no, you don’t need to using Windows to make use of it). </p>



<p>Right now there is no official “installer” for Linux, and no unofficial DEB of PPA, though<a href="https://snapcraft.io/msedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there is a snap</a>. A couple of Linux distributions now package <em>Edit</em>, including Arch Linux, and Manjaro, so if you use one of those, you can install it properly.</p>



<p>To run <em>Edit</em> on Ubuntu you can download the latest binary from the<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> project GitHub releases page</a> (be sure to select the correct one for your architecture), extract the package, <code>cd</code> into the extracted folder, then launch the binary each time you want to use it:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Download the latest release</strong> (link above)</li>



<li><strong>Extract the archive</strong> (right-click in <em>Nautilus</em> &gt; <em>Extract</em>)</li>



<li><strong>Open a terminal app</strong> (such as the new <em>Pytxis</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/05/ubuntu-25-10-to-include-new-image-viewer-terminal-apps">in Ubuntu 25.10</a>)</li>



<li><strong>Navigate to the extracted folder:</strong> <code>cd /path/to/</code></li>



<li><strong>Run <em>Edit</em> directly:</strong> <code>./edit</code></li>
</ol>



<p>To install the unofficial snap build use <em>App Center</em> (search ‘msedit’) or run <code>sudo snap install msedit</code> from the command line, and use <code>msedit</code> to launch it. On my laptop, the snap takes ~5 seconds to open. The official binary is instantaneous. YMMV.</p>



<p>From there, the interface is easy enough to figure out.</p>



<p>Give it a try and let me know what you think!</p>
