    <h1>My books have moved to Gumroad</h1>
    
    
<p>
Just some random administrivia: quite some time back, I put together 
collections of posts and released them as two different ebooks: 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.gumroad.com/l/bozo-loop-epub">The Bozo Loop</a> (2012)
and
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.gumroad.com/l/stupid-hour-epub">The Stupid Hour</a> (2013).
</p>
<p>
They were initially put on Amazon, and also showed up in some other 
strange places for a while - Barnes and Noble, and briefly, right here 
on my own home-grown
&#34;<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/store/">store</a>&#34; that used Stripe for
billing.
</p>
<p>
As of earlier this week, they are no longer on Amazon at my direction.  
Instead, I put them on Gumroad as .epub files.  They are still DRM-free, 
so once you have a copy, you can shove them onto all of your devices 
without having something &#34;phone home&#34; to approve it first.
</p>
<p>
If you wanted a copy but didn&#39;t want to deal with Amazon or the Kindle 
ecosystem, hey, now&#39;s your chance.  If this works out, I might do some 
other things this way, too.
