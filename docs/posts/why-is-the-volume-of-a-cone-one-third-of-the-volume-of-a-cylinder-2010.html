    <h1>Why is the volume of a cone one third of the volume of a cylinder? (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a derivation of the volume of a cone which does not use calculus, Cavalieri&#39;s principle, the method of exhaustion, or any other infinitesimal arguments. </p>

<p>[<strong>Edit</strong> There is a flaw in this argument, see below]</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit 2</strong> The flaw has been fixed, by considering the ratio of the volume of a cone to its circumscribing cylinder under different scalings]</p>

<p>We can split a cone horizontally into two pieces, so that the upper part forms another cone with a smaller base, and the lower part is no longer a cone but an object called a &#39;frustum&#39;.</p>

<p>

<p>For a cone with base radius <span>$r$</span> and height <span>$h$</span>, we can use a parameter <span>$b$</span> with <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span> to define the height of the frustum as <span>$b h$</span>.
Because the whole cone and the upper cone form similar triangles in the vertical cross section, the upper cone with height <span>$ (1-b) h $</span> will have a base radius of <span>$ (1 - b) r $</span>. </p>

<p>                                       
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UPlB.png" alt="cross-section of cone"/></p>

<p>The volume of the frustum will be equal to the volume of the original cone, less the volume of the upper cone. We don&#39;t yet know what form the function representing the volume of a cone will take, so for now we will just write <span>$V_{cone} = V_{cone}(r,h)$</span> to remind us that it will be some function of the height and base radius. So the volume of the frustum is <span>$$V_{frustum} = V_{cone}(r,h) - V_{cone}((1 - b)r,(1 - b)h)$$</span></p>

<p>At this point we make the observation that the <em>ratio</em> of the volume of a cone to the volume of it&#39;s circumscribing cylinder must be invariant under a scaling on the coordinates (the ratio is homogeneous of degree 0).</p>

<p><span>$$\frac{V_{cone}(r,h)}{\pi r^2 h} = \frac{V_{cone}(sr,sh)}{\pi (sr)^2 sh}$$</span></p>

<p>for all <span>$s&gt;0$</span>. If we write <span>$V_{cone} = \hat{Q}\,F(r,h)\, r^2 h$</span>  where <span>$F(r,h)$</span> is some as yet unknown function and <span>$\hat{Q}$</span> is a constant, then</p>

<p><span>$$F(r,h) = F(sr,sh)$$</span></p>

<p>so <span>$F(r,h)$</span> is also homogeneous of degree 0.</p>

<p>Hence</p>

<p><span>\begin{array}{l@{}l}
V_{frustum} 
    &amp;{}= V_{cone}(r,h) - V_{cone}((1 - b)r,(1 - b)h) \\
    &amp;{}= \hat{Q} \, F(r,h) \,r^2 h - \hat{Q} \, F((1-b)r, (1-b)h) \, (1-b)^2r^2 (1-b)h \\
    &amp;{}= \hat{Q} \, F(r,h) \, r^2 h ( 1 - (1-b)^3) \\
    &amp;{}= Q \, r^2 h (3 b - 3 b ^2 +b^3)
\end{array}</span></p>

<p>where <span>$Q = \hat{Q} \, F(r,h)$</span></p>

<p>Now consider the following figure </p>

<p>                                       
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Vvbr.png" alt="cone with inscribed and circumscribed cylinders of height bh"/></p>

<p>It is clear that the volume of the frustum of height <span>$b h$</span> must be <i>bigger</i> than the inner cylinder of radius <span>$ (1-b) r$</span> and height <span>$b h$</span> and it must also be <i>less</i> than the volume of the outer cylinder with radius <span>$ r $</span> and height <span>$b h$</span>. </p>

<p><span>$$\pi (1-b)^2r^2 b h \lt V_{frustum} \lt \pi r^2 b h$$</span></p>

<p>Substituting the expression for <span>$V_{frustum}$</span> from above and dividing everything through by <span>$ b \pi r^2 h $</span></p>

<p><span>$$ (1-b)^2 \lt \frac{Q (3 - 3b + b^2)}{\pi} \lt 1$$</span></p>

<p>This must hold for all <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span>. </p>

<p>At this point, we could use the familiar argument about limits - in particular, as <span>$b$</span> gets closer to zero, the lower bound approaches the upper bound of <span>$1$</span>, so <span>$\frac{Q 3}{\pi} = 1$</span> or <span>$Q = \frac{\pi}{3}$</span>. </p>

<p>However, it is possible to find the value of <span>$Q$</span> in a different way, that does not involve some limit process. </p>

<p>First, observe that the value of <span>$Q$</span> has bounds placed on it by the geometry of the problem <span>$0 \lt Q \lt \pi$</span> since the cone must have some volume, and that volume must be less than the volume of a cylinder with radius <span>$r$</span> and height <span>$h$</span>. What we are going to show is that for all values of <span>$Q$</span> in this range, with just one exception, there is a choice of <span>$b$</span> with <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span> that causes the above inequality not to hold. In the spirit of Sherlock Holmes, &#39;..when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable [or in our case, expected], must be the truth&#39;.</p>

<p>We split the problem up into two parts. The upper bound of the inequality does not hold when</p>

<p><span>$$\frac{Q (3 - 3b + b^2)}{\pi} = 1$$</span></p>

<p>Solving for <span>$b$</span></p>

<p><span>$$b = \frac{3}{2}-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{Q}-\frac{3}{4}}$$</span></p>

<p>Now introduce a parameter <span>$\alpha$</span> and write <span>$Q= \pi / (1+\alpha+\alpha^2) $</span>. Then for <span>$0 \lt \alpha \lt 1$</span> we have <span>$\pi/3 \lt Q\lt\pi$</span> and the above equation reduces to <span>$b=1-\alpha$</span>, so <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span>.</p>

<p>The lower bound of the inequality does not hold when</p>

<p><span>$$(1-b)^2 = \frac{Q (3 - 3b + b^2)}{\pi}$$</span></p>

<p>Solving for <span>$b$</span></p>

<p><span>$$b = 1 - \frac{ (\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{Q}-\frac{3}{4}})}{\frac{\pi}{Q}-1}$$</span></p>

<p>Introduce a parameter <span>$\alpha$</span> as before, but this time write <span>$Q=\pi \alpha^2 / (1+\alpha+\alpha^2) $</span>. Then for <span>$0 \lt \alpha \lt 1$</span> we have <span>$0 \lt Q \lt \pi/3$</span> and the above equation again reduces to <span>$b=1-\alpha$</span>, so <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore we have <span>$0 \lt Q \lt \pi$</span> by the geometry of the problem, but whenever  <span>$0 \lt Q \lt \frac{\pi}{3}$</span> or <span>$\frac{\pi}{3} \lt Q \lt \pi$</span> there exists at least one value for <span>$b$</span> with <span>$0 \lt b \lt 1$</span> for which the inequality does not hold. The only remaining possibility on the interval <span>$0 \lt Q \lt \pi$</span> is <span>$Q=\frac{\pi}{3}$</span> (for all <span>$r,h &gt; 0$</span>), and so 
<span>$$ V_{cone} = \frac{\pi}{3} r^2 h$$</span></p>
