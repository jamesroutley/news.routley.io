    <h1>Apple Ramps Up R&amp;D Intensity to Pre-iPhone Levels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><section><article id="infographicArticle-2502" aria-labelledby="infographicArticleTitle"><div><div><div id="infographicDescriptionLong"><p>Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/11078/apple-vision-pro/" target="_blank">Apple Vision Pro</a>, which becomes available for pre-order on January 19, Apple ramped up its R&amp;D spending quite significantly. In fiscal 2023, which ended September 30, the company spend $29.9 billion on research and development, bringing its R&amp;D intensity, i.e. R&amp;D spending as a percentage of sales, to levels last seen before the iPhone launch in the early 2000s. Since fiscal 2020, Apple&#39;s research and development spending has increased by more than $10 billion, as work on the company&#39;s supposedly groundbreaking XR headset and its transition to Apple silicon took up a lot of capital.</p><p>When asked about the steep increase in R&amp;D spending over the past two years, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/847/apple/" target="_blank">Apple</a> CEO Tim Cook put it down to &#34;a number of things&#34;: things he couldn&#39;t talk about, the Vision Pro, AI, machine learning and investments in Apple silicon. He also pointed out that Apple&#39;s R&amp;D expenditure was &#34;very competitive&#34; compared to others, while CFO Luca Maestri added that the company&#39;s aggressive R&amp;D spending is one of the drivers behind its gross margin expansion, meaning that it partly pays for itself, so to speak.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/2502.jpeg" alt="Infographic: Apple Ramps Up R&amp;D Intensity to Pre-iPhone Levels | Statista" width="1200" height="1200" data-open-modal="#infographicModal" data-gtm="infographic__graphic" aria-describedby="infographicDescriptionShort infographicDescriptionLong"/></p><div><div id="infographicModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" data-vue-modal="" data-modal-options="{&#34;containerClasses&#34;: [&#34;padding-all-0 width--auto overflow-visible&#34;], &#34;closeButtonClasses&#34;: [&#34;modal-dialog--imgZoomClose&#34;]}" aria-hidden="true"><div><div><p><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/2502.jpeg" alt="Infographic: Apple Ramps Up R&amp;D Intensity to Pre-iPhone Levels | Statista" loading="lazy" data-close-modal=""/></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>
