<p>Here are the new capabilities that Apple is adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proximity pairing</strong> - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong> - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the ‌iPhone‌. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commission says that developers can test third-party TVs, smart watches, and headphones with the new features in iOS 26.3, with the functionality to be &#34;fully available in Europe&#34; in 2026.</p>
<p>iOS 26.3 offers &#34;another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens,&#34; according to the European Commission. iOS 26.3 is expected to launch at the end of January.</p>
<p>The changes to proximity pairing and notifications are only available for device makers and ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users in the European Union.</p>
