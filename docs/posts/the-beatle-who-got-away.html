    <h1>The Beatle Who Got Away</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>On their first night in Hamburg, the band members posed for a photograph, as if to prove that they had survived the crossing. In light blazers, dark pants, and tan cowboy boots, they had not yet settled on their look, and were staring in different directions. But, on the right, the bassist was locked in, radiating an attitude of pure rock and roll. Stuart Sutcliffe’s pose might have amused the others; he had been playing bass for only seven months, and was distinctly less virtuosic than the three guitarists. Yet he had done a great deal to propel this journey across the North Sea, into the slipstream of history.</p><p>Sutcliffe remains a spectral presence in Beatles lore, obscured by our knowledge that the band was destined to become a quartet. He joined early in 1960, and his departure, in 1961, forced <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/18/paul-mccartney-doesnt-really-want-to-stop-the-show">Paul McCartney</a> to pick up the bass, the instrument that God clearly wanted him to play. No band needs three guitarists.</p><div role="presentation" aria-hidden="true"></div><p>Yet Sutcliffe has come out of the shadows in recent years, thanks especially to the British writer Mark Lewisohn, who has been laboring for decades, like a medieval scribe, on what is sure to be the most detailed history of the Beatles ever written. “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Tune-Beatles-All-These-Years/dp/1101903295" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Tune-Beatles-All-These-Years/dp/1101903295&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tune-Beatles-All-These-Years/dp/1101903295" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tune In</a>,” the first volume of an expected trilogy, appeared in 2013, and devoted nine hundred and forty-four pages to their beginnings, through 1962. Among other breakthroughs, Lewisohn has shown how pivotal Sutcliffe was during the <em>Wunderjahr</em> of 1960. At the end of 1959, the band was an iffy proposition, changing its name every few months. Like Spinal Tap, they suffered from a chronic shortage of drummers, and they collectively owned a single amp. So dim were the group’s prospects that George Harrison joined a band with steadier gigs.</p><p>But Sutcliffe’s arrival was galvanic. Lennon, energized by his friendship with a brilliant painter, began to hear his own muse. Together, they came up with the perfect band name, and Sutcliffe’s charisma kept opening doors. His search for his voice guided theirs, and even after he left—and even after he died, in 1962, of a mysterious brain injury—he continued to speak to them.</p><p>I encountered that voice three years ago, on an arctic day, in a basement on Long Island. A friend had alerted me to a cache of art, letters, journals, and photographs by Sutcliffe, which were held in the house of his sister Pauline near a street named Blue Jay Way. The Beatles’ creation story is deeply entrenched, and teleological: it is simply <em>inevitable</em> that Lennon will meet McCartney, that their genius will conquer the world. But Pauline’s archive suggests that, without Sutcliffe’s arrival, they might never have found their way to the ferry. To elevate his role in the story doesn’t detract from his bandmates’ achievement. On the contrary, it forces new amazement that they made it out of Liverpool at all.</p><p>Born in 1940, the eldest child of his family, Sutcliffe grew up with a father at sea, and filled the void with reading, writing, and drawing in his sketchbooks. “We young artists are like young sailors,” he wrote in a notebook. “Unless we encounter rough seas and are buffeted by the winds, we’ll not become real sailors.” It was as if the North Sea were already beckoning.</p><p>The story has been told of Liverpool’s openness to American music, but it was also a city teeming with literary ideas—in the coffee bars near the Liverpool College of Art, where beatniks gathered to shout poems at one another, and in the garrets where they chattered late into the night. Sutcliffe entered the college in 1956, and quickly established himself as a star painter, splashing his canvases with a riot of color, like the artists he loved: Serge Poliakoff, Nicolas de Staël. When he met another student, John Lennon, a spark was kindled.</p><p>Cynthia Powell, a fellow-student and the woman who would become Lennon’s first wife, wrote about these years in her memoirs, and dwelled at length on the friendship between the two nearsighted artists, who tried so hard to see what the world had to offer. Patiently, Sutcliffe taught Lennon how to think through the act of composition, planning a painting so that it would create a rich universe of its own. Less patiently, Lennon expanded Sutcliffe’s sense of sound, raving about the latest singles from across the Atlantic.</p><p>They shared a love of words, too. In his youth, Lennon had created <a data-offer-url="http://beatlesliverpoollocations.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-daily-howl.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://beatlesliverpoollocations.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-daily-howl.html&#34;}" href="http://beatlesliverpoollocations.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-daily-howl.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a mock newspaper, the <em>Daily Howl</em></a>, which he wrote out at home, by hand. Sutcliffe read everything he could get his hands on, from Kant and Spinoza to Kerouac, Dostoyevsky, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/soren-kierkegaards-struggle-with-himself">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher who counselled his readers to set aside intellectual concerns and “leap.”</p><p>The first leap came soon enough. At the end of 1959, Sutcliffe was selected for a prestigious art exhibition, and sold a painting. Suddenly, he had ninety pounds burning a hole in his pocket. Lennon, who had been playing skiffly rock and roll with McCartney, Harrison, and an assortment of drummers, pressed Sutcliffe to convert his capital gain into a new bass. On January 21, 1960, Sutcliffe bought a Hofner 333, and soon joined the combo.</p><p>From that moment, the story accelerates. Sutcliffe was not a natural musician, but he practiced until his fingers bled, and helped in other ways to fill out the picture. (Harrison would remember him as the band’s “Art Director” in those years.) He helped scare up a second amplifier from the college, and the band’s sound grew richer. They needed connections, too, and when a new café and venue, the Jacaranda, opened nearby, Sutcliffe was ready. The café’s owner—a plumber named Allan Williams—wanted someone to paint over graffiti in the women’s bathroom. Sutcliffe delivered a series of murals of, as Williams later put it in his memoir, “Rock n’ Roll Scenes.” Williams was delighted.</p><p>Sutcliffe had begun living in an artist’s loft, across the street from the Anglican cathedral that towered over Liverpool. Lennon immediately moved in, and Harrison and McCartney were a constant presence, eager to escape parental supervision. McCartney later remembered it as a magical place (“Very studenty!”), where they could stay up all night, playing the latest records from America, until the sun shone on the cathedral.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><figcaption><span>A watercolor of John Lennon playing guitar, by Stuart Sutcliffe, from around 1960. </span><span>Art work courtesy Stuart Sutcliffe Estate</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But, even as they cohered, the band lacked a name. (They had outgrown options like the Quarrymen, and Johnny and the Moondogs.) Sutcliffe kept long vocabulary lists—<em>gregarious, ascetic, sublimate</em>—and one night, in April, he and Lennon concocted a pun that nodded at once to the Beat Generation and to one of their favorite acts, the Crickets, the band led by Buddy Holly. McCartney later remembered the exact moment when his friends, walking along the cathedral, announced, “Hey, we want to call the band the Beatles.” Harrison gave the credit to “Sutcliffe/Lennon.”</p><p>In the weeks that followed, the Beatles rehearsed in Sutcliffe’s rooms. Williams, enchanted by their style, and by Sutcliffe’s artistic disposition, began to take an interest. In late May, he booked the group on a tour of a windswept stretch of the Scottish coast, backing a teen-idol type, Johnny Gentle. When the group returned, they were granted a regular spot playing gigs at the Jacaranda. But the big break came in August, when Williams got a call from a German club owner who needed five English musicians to perform in Hamburg.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
