The F word

<div id="post-body-2098651784755638092">
<p>Back in 2005, when I first joined the SUNY Buffalo CSE department, the department secretary was a wonderful lady named Joann, who was over 60. She explained that my travel reimbursement process was simple: I&#39;d just hand her the receipts after my trip, she&#39;d fill out the necessary forms, submit them to the university, and within a month, the reimbursement check would magically appear in my department mailbox.</p><p>She handled this for every single faculty member, all while managing her regular secretarial duties. Honestly, despite the 30-day turnaround, it was the most seamless reimbursement experience I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p>But over time the department grew, and Joann moved on. The university partnered with Concur, as corporations do, forcing us to file our own travel reimbursements through this system. Fine, I thought, more work for me, but it can&#39;t be too bad. But, the department also appointed a staff member to audit our Concur submissions.</p><p>This person&#39;s job wasn&#39;t to help us file reimbursements, but to audit the forms to find errors. Slowly but surely, it became routine for every single travel submission to be returned (sometimes multiple times) for minor format irregularities or rule violations. These were petty violations no human would care about if the goal were simply to get people reimbursed. The experience degraded from effortless to what could be perceived as adversarial.</p><p>This was a massive downgrade from the Joann era.</p><h2>The Source of Friction</h2><p>This story (probably all too familiar to many) illustrates the danger of not setting the right intention regarding friction. If the goal isn&#39;t actively set to help and streamline the process (if the intention isn&#39;t &#34;how do we solve this?&#34;), the energy of the system inevitably shifts toward finding problems. Friction becomes the product.</p><p>This dynamic is not just true for organizations, it is also true for each of us.</p><p>We have to manage the stories we tell ourselves. These stories, whether we tell them knowingly or unknowingly, determine how we manage/conduct ourselves, which in turn determines our success. Just as organizations can start to manufacture friction, individuals can do the same internally. You can install an internal auditor in your own mind.</p><p>When intention shifts away from growth, things degrade. You stop asking how to move forward and start looking for violations. You nitpick and reject your own efforts due to small defects. You begin to find ways to grate against your own progress.</p><p>I wrote about this concept previously in my post &#34;<a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2021/03/your-attitude-determines-your-success.html">Your attitude determines your success</a>&#34;. That post tends to get two very different reactions. It gets nitpicked to pieces by cynics (the auditors), and it gets a silent knowing nod from people in the know (the builders). Brooker recently wrote <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/06/20/career.html">career advice</a> along the same lines, reinforcing that high agency mindset. In a similar vein, I wrote about recently to <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/optimize-for-momentum.html">optimize for momentum.</a></p><p>“When there is a will, there is a way,” as the saying goes. Get the intention right and friction dissolves. Get it wrong and you may end up weaponizing process, tooling, and auditing against your own goals.</p>

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/10/hints-for-distributed-systems-design.html">Hints for Distributed Systems Design</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
This is with apologies to Butler Lampson, who published the &#34; Hints for computer system design &#34; paper 40 years ago in SOSP&#39;83. I don&#39;t claim to match that work of course. I just thought I could draft this post to organize my thinking about designing distributed systems and get feedback from others. I start with the same  disclaimer Lampson gave. These hints are not novel, not foolproof recipes, not laws of design, not precisely formulated, and not always appropriate. They are just hints.  They are context dependent, and some of them may be controversial. That being said, I have seen these hints successfully applied in distributed systems design throughout my 25 years in the field, starting from the theory of distributed systems (98-01), immersing into the practice of wireless sensor networks (01-11), and working on cloud computing systems both in the academia and industry ever since. These heuristic principles have been applied knowingly or unknowingly and has proven...

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/tla-modeling-tips.html">TLA+ modeling tips</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
Model minimalistically Start from a tiny core, and always keep a working model as you extend. Your default should be omission. Add a component only when you can explain why leaving it out would not work. Most models are about a slice of behavior, not the whole system in full glory: E.g., Leader election, repair, reconfiguration. Cut entire layers and components if they do not affect that slice. Abstraction is the art of knowing what to cut . Deleting should spark joy.  Model specification, not implementation Write declaratively. State what must hold, not how it is achieved. If your spec mirrors control flow, loops, or helper functions, you are simulating code. Cut it out. Every variable must earn its keep. Extra variables multiply the state space (model checking time) and hide bugs. Ask yourself repeatedly: can I derive this instead of storing it? For example, you do not need to maintain a WholeSet  variable if you can define it as a state function of existing variables: WholeSet =...

<div>

<p>
I talked about the importance of reading foundational papers  last week. To followup, here is my compilation of foundational papers in the distributed systems area. (I focused on the core distributed systems area, and did not cover networking, security, distributed ledgers, verification work etc. I even left out distributed transactions, I hope to cover them at a later date.)  I classified the papers by subject, and listed them in chronological order. I also listed expository papers and blog posts at the end of each section. Time and State in Distributed Systems Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System.  Leslie Lamport, Commn. of the ACM,  1978. Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of a Distributed System.  K. Mani Chandy Leslie Lamport, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, 1985.

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/optimize-for-momentum.html">Optimize for momentum</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
Progress comes from motion.  Momentum is the invisible engine of any significant work. A project feels daunting when you face it as a blank page. It feels easier when you built some momentum with some next steps. So, momentum makes the difference between blocked and flowing. Think of a stalled truck on a desert road. You can&#39;t lift it with superhuman strength. But by rocking it with small periodic forces at the right rhythm (matching its natural frequency) you can get it rolling. Each tiny push adds to the previous one because the timing aligns with the system&#39;s response. The truck starts to move, and then the engine catches. Projects behave the same way. A big project has its own rhythm. If you revisit it daily, even briefly, your pushes line up. Your brain stays warm. Context stays loaded . Ideas from yesterday are still alive today. Each session amplifies the last because you are operating in phase with your own momentum. When you produce something every day,  you never feel...

<div>
<div>
<p>
2025 was the year of the agent. The goalposts for AGI shifted; we stopped asking AI to merely &#34;talk&#34; and demanded that it &#34;act&#34;. As an outsider looking at the architecture of these new agents and agentic system, I noticed something strange. The engineering tricks used to make AI smarter felt oddly familiar. They read less like computer science and more like … self-help advice . The secret to agentic intelligence seems to lie in three very human habits: writing things down, talking to yourself, and pretending to be someone else. They are almost too simple. The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Writing One of the most profound pieces of advice  I ever read as a PhD student came from Prof. Manuel Blum, a Turing Award winner. In his essay &#34;Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student&#34;, he wrote: &#34;Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton. With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.&#34; If you try to hold a complex argument enti...

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/06/learning-about-distributed-systems.html"> Learning about distributed systems: where to start?</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
This is definitely not a &#34;learn distributed systems in 21 days&#34; post. I recommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed systems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more months to build competence after that.   If you are practical and coding oriented you may not like my advice much. You may object saying, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I learn distributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by deploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.&#34; I think that is the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code and programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar territory, and will give you a false sense of security. But, nothing can be further from the truth.   Distributed systems need radically different software than centralized systems do.    --A. Tannenbaum  This quotation is literally the first sentence in my distributed systems syllabus. Inst...

I notice I haven&#39;t written any advice posts recently. Here is a collection of my advice posts pre 2020. I&#39;ve been feeling all this elderly wisdom pent up in me, ready to pour at any moment. So here it goes. Get ready to quench your thirst from my fount of wisdom. No man, think for yourself, only get what works for you. It is called foundations, not theory Foundations of computer science (or rather any field of study) are the most important topics you can learn. These lay down the frame of thinking/perspective for that area of study. Yet, I am saddened to hear these called as &#34;theory&#34;, and labeled as &#34;unpractical&#34;. This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Take a look at how I recommend studying distributed systems . Don&#39;t you dare call this &#34;theory&#34; and &#34;unpractical&#34;. This lays the bedrock that you build your practice on. Don&#39;t skimp on the foundations. Don&#39;t build your home on quicksand. Keep your hands dirty, your mind cl...

This paper (CIDR&#39;26)  presents a comprehensive analysis of cloud hardware trends from 2015 to 2025, focusing on AWS and comparing it with other clouds and on-premise hardware. TL;DR: While network bandwidth per dollar improved by one order of magnitude (10x), CPU and DRAM gains (again in performance per dollar terms) have been much more modest. Most surprisingly, NVMe storage performance in the cloud has stagnated since 2016. Check out the NVMe SSD discussion below for data on this anomaly. CPU Trends Multi-core parallelism has skyrocketed in the cloud. Maximum core counts have increased by an order of magnitude over the last decade. The largest AWS instance u7in now boasts 448 cores. However, simply adding cores hasn&#39;t translated linearly into value. To measure real evolution, the authors normalized benchmarks (SPECint, TPC-H, TPC-C) by instance cost. SPECint benchmarking shows that cost-performance improved roughly 3x over ten years. A huge chunk of that gain comes from AWS G...

Twenty years ago, in 2004-2005, I spent a year at MIT’s Computer Science department as a postdoc working with Professor Nancy Lynch. It was an extraordinary experience. Life at MIT felt like paradise, and leaving felt like being cast out. MIT Culture MIT’s Stata Center was the best CS building in the world at the time. Designed by Frank Gehry, it was a striking abstract architecture masterpiece ( although like all abstractions it was a bit leaky ). Furniture from Herman Miller complemented this design. I remember seeing price tags of $400 on simple yellow chairs. The building buzzed with activity.  Every two weeks, postdocs were invited to the faculty lunch on Thursdays, and alternating weeks we had group lunches. Free food seemed to materialize somewhere in the building almost daily, and the food trucks outside were also good. MIT thrived on constant research discussions, collaborations, and talks. Research talks were advertised on posters at the urinals, as a practical touch of M...
