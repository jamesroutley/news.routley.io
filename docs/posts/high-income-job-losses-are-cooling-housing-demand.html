				<div data-id="3ce7b7c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>The national labor market is softening, with implications for local housing markets. Most major metros are adding jobs more slowly than normal. We analyzed employment performance by metro and industry, comparing today’s growth to long-term trends since 2010. Red represents job losses, yellow shows slower-than-normal growth, and green represents faster-than-normal growth.</p>

									<p data-ogsc="">The job market drives housing demand, but the type of jobs created or lost impacts the type of housing. High-income sectors—Information, Professional Services, and Financial Activities—are shrinking across most major metros. Workers in these industries drive for-sale housing demand more than rental demand. Nationally, high-income sector employment remained flat YOY in August, well below its long-term compound annual growth of +1.6%.</p><p data-ogsc="">The Education and Healthcare sectors account for the bulk of new jobs added in most metros and are growing faster than normal in almost every market. Many of these jobs pay lower wages on average and often generate rental demand more than homebuying activity. Nationally, education and healthcare employment rose +3.3% YOY in August, well above its long-term compound annual growth of +2.1%</p>								</div>

However, this improvement reflects recovery from weak post-Great Financial Crisis baselines rather than genuine outperformance.</li><li data-ogsc=""><strong data-ogsc="">Charlotte </strong>(+2.6% YOY) is a standout performer, maintaining robust job growth supported by Professional Services expansion (+4.5% YOY)—a rare bright spot for for-sale demand.</li><li data-ogsc=""><strong data-ogsc="">Austin</strong> (+0.8% YOY) and <strong data-ogsc="">Denver </strong>(+0.0% YOY) are growing much more slowly than their historically strong employment trends (+3.8% and +2.3%, respectively). Tech and Professional Services jobs are declining in both markets, and even healthcare—which is expanding faster than normal in most metros—shows weak growth here. This reduction in high-paying jobs is weakening demand for both home purchases and rentals.</li><li data-ogsc="">The <strong data-ogsc="">Bay Area</strong> continues to lose jobs across high-income sectors (-0.4% YOY), driving modest overall employment declines. These job losses have slowed compared to a year ago but remain negative YOY. Despite generating substantial spending and wealth, the AI-driven tech boom hasn’t added meaningful employment to the region.</li></ul>								</div>
