    <h1>Show HN: iPhone 2005 weird &#34;Blob Keyboard&#34; simulator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I teach tech design history, and one of the key stories I cover is the development of the original iPhone keyboard by Ken Kocienda. Reading about it in his book &#34;Creative Selection&#34; is great, but I wanted my students (and now you!) to actually <i>feel</i> this step in the process.</p><p>So, I built a web simulator of the &#34;Blob Keyboard&#34;, Kocienda&#39;s very first attempt at a touchscreen keyboard that actually works, from September 2005:</p><p>Try the Blob Keyboard: <a href="https://juliendorra.github.io/blob-keyboard-simulator/blob-keyboard-simulator.html" rel="nofollow">https://juliendorra.github.io/blob-keyboard-simulator/blob-k...</a></p><p>- Tap for the middle letter</p><p>- Swipe left or right for the side letters</p><p>More on the github repo: <a href="https://github.com/juliendorra/blob-keyboard-simulator">https://github.com/juliendorra/blob-keyboard-simulator</a></p><p>The Blob Keyboard prototype emerged during a UX crisis for iPhone team (their software keyboard just didn&#39;t work at all, fingers being too big, and the Newton failure loomed over them), highlighting how innovation is rarely a straight path. It was developed on a tethered touchscreen display codenamed &#34;Wallaby&#34;.</p><p>To make this simulator as authentic as possible, I referenced images from Kocienda&#39;s book and even got direct feedback and guidance from Ken Kocienda himself on Bluesky.</p><p>What to expect (orâ€¦ what not to expect):</p><p>This is a reconstruction of a very early prototype with limitations reflecting that specific moment. The goal was to test first if typing with accuracy was even possible, as all the rest was moot if it failed!</p><p>It&#39;s NOT QWERTY: They were still hoping to get us out of QWERTY, but then familiarity won.</p><p>No Backspace: You can&#39;t delete.</p><p>No Cursor Movement: The text field is just a simple display.</p><p>No Caps or Numbers: Only lowercase letters.</p><p>No Smooth Animations: Keys just &#34;pop&#34; instantly when pressed. Kocienda noted that your eye fills in the gaps, giving a sense of movement.</p><p>Best Experience:</p><p>While it works with a mouse/trackpad on desktop, it&#39;s designed for touchscreens to better replicate the original Wallaby hardware interaction. Use it on your phone!</p><p>This project aims to provide a tangible glimpse into a turning point moment in iPhone development and the iterative nature of design. It&#39;s like stepping back in time and trying out that early demo on Kocienda&#39;s desk.</p><p>I would love to hear your reactions and thoughts on experiencing this piece of UI history! What other significant prototype do you wish you could experience?</p></div></td></div></div>
