For this song, I found an AI powered mastering program, but it was really difficult to compare different versions, and to really understand <em>what the mastering was doing.</em></p><p>So - I made this little version comparer, and put it online. It was really enlightening to hear the different versions:</p><ul><li>Explore <a href="https://mastering-aaronstrick.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Mastering</a></li></ul><p>I&#39;m always encouraging people to buy their name as a domain and host a simple page. There are a number of things that hold people back. Perceived high cost. Perceived low value. Technical barriers. They&#39;re not sure what they&#39;d put, and if they did know, the don&#39;t know how.</p><p>Putting the first iteration of this site together in 2008 was basically what launched my career. So, I&#39;m often happy to buy them a domain (or show them how), and execute a basic version of their vision. My favorite example of this is maybe the site I made for my friend <a href="https://phoeberachles.com" target="_blank">Phoebe</a>.</p><p>And so it was with Briana. I <a href="https://briana-aaronstrick.vercel.app/" target="_blank">slapped something together</a>, and it lived for a few years. But I&#39;m happy to share that she&#39;s now graduated from a quick Strick Web Slap, and she now has a site she maintains herself!</p><p>As such, I&#39;ve made some edits to the <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/projects/briana-feigon">project page</a>.</p><p>While I&#39;m sad I can no longer say that I &#34;made <a href="https://brianafeigon.com" target="_blank">brianafeigon.com</a>&#34;, I&#39;m excited she&#39;s taken it into her own hands!! Way to go B!</p><ul><li>Some minor style tweaks</li></ul></section></div></div>
