      European aerospace giant Airbus has warned flights will be disrupted after it requested immediate software updates to thousands of its planes
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The disruption has fallen on a major holiday weekend in the US, which is home to four of the biggest A320 model operators: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines

      Over 6,000 planes are thought to be affected

      The issue was discovered after a JetBlue aircraft en-route from Mexico to the United States experienced a &#34;sudden drop in altitude&#34; in October
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      It’s thought the incident was caused by intense solar radiation, which corrupted data in a computer used to help control the aircraft

      <p>Former Qantas captain Dr Ian Getley, who holds a PHD in cosmic and solar radiation in aviation, says flights can be affected by coronal mass ejections (CME), which is when plasma is ejected from the sun into space.</p><p>The higher the severity of the CME, the more likely it is that issues could arise with satellites and aircraft electronics above 28,000 ft (8.5 km), he tell us.</p><p>A CME releases heavily charged particles that shoot into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p><p>These create more charged particles in the upper atmosphere, which in turn can interfere with aircraft electronics. </p><p>The former pilot says his research began after a 2003 flight between LA and New York, where he experienced this phenomenon first hand.</p>

      <p>This issue affects around 6,000 aircraft.</p><p>For the majority of planes, the fix will involve installing new computer software. This should normally take about three hours.</p><p>But around 900 older planes will need computers replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed.</p><p>How long that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether there will be enough parts to meet demand.</p>

      <p>It was experienced on one flight, when an aircraft flying from Cancun to New Jersey was affected by a sudden and intense solar storm.</p><p>The radiation corrupted data in the ELAC - a computer used to operate control surfaces on the wings and horizontal stabilizer.</p><p>The fault caused the plane to go into a sudden descent.</p><p>Airbus says the plane had recently had its software updated. The issue had never arisen with the previous software.</p><p>But now, it insists it is acting out of an abundance of caution.</p><p>It took the issue to regulators itself and asked airlines to make changes.</p>
