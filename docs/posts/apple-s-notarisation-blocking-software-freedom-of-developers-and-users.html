    <h1>Apple&#39;s &#34;notarisation&#34; – blocking software freedom of developers and users</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="content"><p id="category"><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/news.en.html">News</a></p><p><span>on: </span><time>2025-11-05</time></p><p>The EU’s Digital Markets Act is supposed to shake up the power of
tech giants by giving developers and users more choice. Apple’s
“notarisation” of mobile apps contradicts these objectives. A
civil-society complaint against Apple’s monopolistic control over app
distribution aims to change that.</p><figure><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/ee/3d/407431339a047caf4fc5f1ea05db.png" alt="Abstract image of an apple shape outlined by a jagged, snake-like red and black form on a gray background"/><figcaption>CC-BY-SA 4.0. by <a href="https://rahak.net/work.html">Rahak</a> for FSFE </figcaption></figure><p>The EU’s <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/dma/dma"><strong>Digital
Markets Act (DMA)</strong></a> aims for a structural reset of
power in digital markets, a shift from corporate control toward
<strong>device neutrality</strong>, where users decide
what runs on their devices. For Free Software, this legislation can be a
unique opportunity by finally opening closed ecosystems - like iOS - to
Free Software alternatives. Apple has reacted aggressively against the
DMA, <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.en.html">litigating
against regulators</a>, and <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf">unfairly
excluding Free Software from iOS and iPadOS</a> by blocking the
unfettered installation of software (sideloading), prohibiting
alternative app stores, and hindering interoperability.</p><p>The FSFE has recently contributed to a <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/digital-markets-act-apple-impedes-interoperability-and-user-choice/">complaint
initiated by civil-society organisations</a> targeting Apple’s
non-compliance with the DMA, urging the European Commission to enforce
the DMA’s rules related to interoperability and the app store, giving
users and developers effective choice over which apps and app stores
they want to use on their devices. This complaint is important for
software freedom, contextualising the diverse approaches towards
curation of software distribution.</p><h3 id="id-the-action-taken-calling-out-the-illegality-of-apple’s-“notarization”-of-mobile-apps">The action taken: calling out the illegality of Apple’s
“notarization” of mobile apps</h3><p>Imagine that you are a Free Software developer willing to make your
program available in the iPhone. You want to have your software
curated in a non-profit Free Software-friendly app store (like F-Droid
for Android). This is important for you because you prefer to not have
Apple controlling what your software does and to whom it should be made
available. </p><p>This all sounds good, until you realise that your plan is not
possible in iOS. There is no non-profit Free Software app store
available for iPhones and iPads. Apple blocks non-profit app stores with
extremely high financial requirements and prohibits unfettered
installation of software. Even for the Free Software commercial ones,
such as the <a href="https://altstore.io/">Alt Store</a>, Apple still
applies a complete review and control, through an encryption layer over
distributed source code.</p><p>On October 22, <a href="https://www.article19.org/">ARTICLE 19</a>
and <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/">Gesellschaft für
Freiheitsrechte</a> (GFF) filed a complaint against Apple for
non-compliance with the DMA to tackle these issues. The complaint
highlights the following conduct as illegal under the DMA:</p><ul><li>Apple does not allow the unfettered installation of third-party
software (sideloading);</li><li>Apple prevents third-party app stores to effectively running on iOS and
iPadOS;</li></ul><ul><li>Apple does not provide effective free-of-charge interoperability
with the company’s features controlled via iOS and iPadOS.</li></ul><p>The core of the complaint is twofold:</p><ol><li><p>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">complete
review of apps</a> – known as <strong>“notarisation” process</strong> -
a mandatory step for distributing any software on its
platforms, represents the very gatekeeping behaviour the DMA was written
to prevent. </p></li><li><p>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf">requirements
for third-party app stores</a>.</p></li></ol><p>Both requirements are extremely unfair and disproportionately affects
non-profit Free Software projects, SMEs, startups, and individual
developers. This discriminates by size and renders the market
inaccessible to smaller new entrants.</p><h3 id="id-the-implications-of-apple’s-notarisation-for-software-freedom">The implications of Apple’s notarisation for software freedom</h3><p>For <strong>Free Software developers</strong>, the
implications are even more severe. Apple’s notarisation regime requires
developers to hold a paid Apple Developer account, accept restrictive
legal terms, and submit binaries to a closed, opaque process. Once
approved, the binaries are re-signed by Apple and distributed under
digital restriction management (DRM). </p><p>This breaks users’ rights when it comes to Free Software freedoms.
Users can no longer verify that the source code they read corresponds to
the binary they run, nor can they freely redistribute software that
Apple refuses to notarise. What makes this process absurd is that Apple
applies this notarisation process to all apps running on iOS, no matter
which channel of distribution. This means that a developer of an
alternative app store for iOS has actually no control over the apps they
can distribute in their store, as Apple still holds gatekeeping power
through notarisation.</p><p>Under the DMA, gatekeepers must enable the installation of
third-party app stores and refrain from imposing unnecessary technical
restrictions. Yet Apple’s notarisation enforces the very dependency the
DMA prohibits: it reasserts Apple’s role as the
mandatory intermediary for every app on its platforms.
This undermines competition, discourages independent developers, and
excludes non-commercial, community-run projects that cannot afford to submit to Apple’s terms or
refuse to submit to them. Allowing this practice to persist
would water down the DMA’s promise before it is even tested.</p><h3 id="id-blocking-alternative-app-stores-with-extremely-high-requirements">Blocking alternative app stores with extremely high requirements</h3><p>Apple’s requirements for enabling third-party app stores are very
hard to meet. They have effectively prevented non-profit Free Software
app stores from working in iOS and iPadOS. The provision of a 1 million euro standby
letter of credit or 1 million downloads within a year in the EU
overburdens not only non-profits, but also individual developers,
startups, and SMEs. When these conditions are put into context, such
requirements do not reflect industry standards and expectations. They
derive from Apple’s monopolistic behaviour with respect to mobile devices. Such
impositions do not exist in Apple’s laptops and desktop computers, where
unfettered installation (sideloading) is a reality. The complaint
concludes that both requirements go beyond the limits of what is
necessary under the DMA. Apple ignores less restrictive alternatives
(e.g. insurance and escrow frameworks), and provides no justification
for doing so.</p><h3 id="id-the-solution-decentralised-software-curation">The solution: decentralised software curation </h3><p>The complaint surges the European Commission to impose fines and to
find an alternative to Apple’s control over software distribution,
including non-profit stakeholders in the process. The alternative to
Apple’s notarisation already exists, and it works.
<strong>Decentralised curation</strong>, as practised
by repositories like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a>,
shows that security and software freedom coexist inherently. Instead of
concentrating trust in a single private authority, decentralised systems
distribute it: through transparent verification pipelines, reproducible
builds, and community audits. Users choose whom to trust, and curators
are accountable to the public, not to corporate shareholders. This model
embodies the DMA’s vision of interoperability and openness far better
than Apple’s notarisation.</p><p>Such a model aligns with the DMA’s ambitions: interoperability,
transparency, and user choice. Decentralised curation can support
multiple overlapping trust networks, from individual developers to NGOs,
universities, or public institutions, each maintaining their own
repository policies. Instead of “millions of apps” buried in opaque
ranking algorithms, users could benefit from clearly defined,
community-led collections where the emphasis is on transparency,
privacy, and respect for user rights. Security is achieved not through
corporate secrecy but through diversity, peer review, and verifiable
integrity.</p><h3 id="id-what’s-next">What’s next?</h3><p>If the DMA is to live up to its potential, regulators must treat
Apple’s notarisation for what it is: a mechanism of control disguised as
a security feature. This civil-society complaint demonstrates that
Apple’s understanding of security undermines transparency, competition,
and user autonomy - hampering software freedom for everyone. It is not
genuine security, it is merely gatekeeping by another name. The European
Commission must ensure that compliance with the DMA means genuine
openness. The right to install, share, and verify software freely in any
device is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of
<strong>freedom</strong>.</p><p id="discussion-link"><a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/@fsfe/115496552737948705">Discuss this </a></p></div></div></div>
