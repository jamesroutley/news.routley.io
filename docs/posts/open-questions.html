(And how can solid mucus form so rapidly during illness when airflow is the same or lower?) Are they connected to lymph nodes, or play a role in the immune system?

              <blockquote>
                <p>Jeanne Calment holds the verified record for human longevity at ~122.5 years at her death over 22 years ago: Calment is history’s first &amp; only 122 year old; and also the first &amp; only 121 year old; and also the first &amp; only 120 year old. No challenging centenarian has come close to her record, and arithmetically, they will not for years to come: she will have held the record for a minimum of 3 decades, despite countless countervailing factors. Some <a href="https://mclare.blog/order-statistics#sampling-gompertz-distribution-extremes" title="Order Statistics: efficiently sampling Gompertz distribution extremes">statistical simulations</a> suggest that Calment-like record gaps are not expected from the distribution of human life expectancies, and as time passes, her record becomes increasingly anomalous.</p>
                <p>This truly remarkable longevity raises the question of whether Calment’s longevity is due to the same factors as all other centenarians: did she benefit from some unique factor like genetic mutations, or, as accused in late 2018 of being, is she, in fact, merely a fraud which has fooled previous verification?</p>

            <p>Why did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Jeanne Calment</a> live so many more years than other centenarians (to 122 years &amp; 164 days), breaking all records and setting a life expectancy record which decades later has not just not been broken, but <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/349155/how-often-does-it-happen-that-the-oldest-person-alive-dies/388131#388131" data-link-icon="stackexchange" data-link-icon-type="svg">not even approached?</a> As of 2019-08-17, the oldest person record is held by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Tanaka" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Kane Tanaka</a>⁠, then age 116 years, 227 days (2,128 days less than Calment), who would have to survive until 2025-06-14 to match Calment; in other words, even if Tanaka turned out to be the first person to break Calment’s record, Calment’s record would have stood from ~1995 to 2025, a remarkable minimum of 30 years.</p>

            <p>Which is extraordinary considering that she smoked &amp; loved her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">port wine</a> &amp; chocolate (the secret to longevity‽), medicine has continuously advanced, the global population has increased, life expectancy in general has increased, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Gompertz curve</a> implies that, with mortality rates approaching 50%, centenarians should die like flies and ever closer in age to each other and not have occasional enormous permanent &gt;3 year gaps between the record setter (Calment) and everyone since then. (I did some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz%E2%80%93Makeham_law_of_mortality" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Gompertz</a> curve simulations, and Calment-like records <a href="https://mclare.blog/order-statistics#sampling-gompertz-distribution-extremes" id="gwern-order-statistics-sampling-gompertz-distribution-extremes" title="&#39;Calculating The Gaussian Expected Maximum § Sampling&#39;, Branwen 2016">do not easily fall out of a Gompertz curve</a>⁠.)</p>
            <p>It isn’t necessarily odd that the first well-validated longest-lived person might exceed previous records from sparse poorly-kept datasets by a large margin (much as it is not odd now to see Olympics sports or weather records shattered by large margins<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>), but it <em>is</em> odd that decades are passing and still no validated centenarians have reached, much less surpassed, Calment’s record. (I had a similar question about the “Dream Market” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_market" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">darknet market</a>⁠, as its longevity was extremely anomalous, especially when one looks at how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_curve" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Type 1</a> <a href="https://mclare.blog/dnm-survival" id="gwern-dnm-survival" title="&#39;Darknet Market mortality risks&#39;, Branwen 2013">DNM life expectancies appear to be</a>⁠.) Typically, if one looks at record datasets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_run_world_record_progression" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">mile run world record progression</a>⁠, as one would expect from order statistics, the ‘gap’ between each successive record holder is smaller and smaller, particularly as the number of ‘competitors’ increases; in running, the number of runners has increased dramatically over time, it has become a major sport/​profession with concomitant improvements in training and so on, and this resulted in records being regularly set but by smaller intervals each time, as the extreme of what is humanly possible is approached. Similarly, with longevity, we should see early on large gaps between successive <em>verified</em> record holders as a small number of reasonably-reliably verified super-centenarians from the most industrialized &amp; bureaucratized countries (as opposed to the enormous number of frauds/​errors pre-documentation: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062986/" id="young-et-al-2010" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Typologies of Extreme Longevity Myths"><span><span title="et al">Young</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2010</span></span></a>⁠/ ​<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080.full" id="newman-2020" data-link-icon="chi-dna" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Super-centenarians and the oldest-old are concentrated into regions with no birth certificates and short lifespans"><span><span>Newman</span><span>2019</span></span></a>) reach the longevity frontier, with gaps regularly shrinking as the rest of the world ‘comes online’ with proper documentation, hundreds of millions of people start competing for the record, improved medicine pushes out the average life expectancy &amp; makes it much more probable to reach an extreme, there is greater scientific &amp; public interest in tracking the extremes, and so on. Instead, what we see is this steady order statistic effect of shrinking record breakers—<em>except</em> for Jeanne Calment, who smashes the record and continues to hold it despite decades of challengers from an exponentially growing population.</p>
            <p>The easiest answer is that she is a fake like so many supposed centenarians, but against that, she doesn’t fit the usual fake profiles of existing only on paper like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11258071" data-link-icon="BBC" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans" title="More than 230,000 Japanese centenarians &#39;missing&#39;">fraudulent Japanese centenarians</a>⁠; being male; or being in a Third World illiterate country where old age is extremely culturally valued, dates exhibit blatant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple%27s_index" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">age heaping</a>⁠, no contemporary paper records exist or their paper trail only began late in life, etc.—she was female, born in Third Republic France in a highly bureaucratic well-organized well-documented literate society which did not especially value extreme old age, was apparently fairly social &amp; not an unknown recluse, was known for longevity in her lifetime (as opposed to afterwards), was vetted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology_Research_Group" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">GRG</a> &amp; others, etc.</p>

The fraud theory originally postulated that the motive for the fraud would be evading the estate taxes which would have been due (on top of the estate taxes paid due to two deaths in the family just 3 years before) &amp; Jeanne Calment’s later annuity (which would’ve been considerably underpriced since she was supposedly much older); aside from the observation that Calment is such an outlier and was remarkable healthy &amp; youthful-looking for her ostensible ages (but more consistent with how old the daughter Yvonne would’ve been), Novoselov notes the suspiciousness of the Calment family archives being destroyed by them, some anomalies in Calment’s passport, oddities in family arrangements, apparent inconsistency of Calment’s recollections &amp; timing of events &amp; photos, facial landmarks like ear features not seeming to match up between young/​old photos, and an obscure 2007 accusation in a French book that a French bureaucrat and/​or the insurance company had uncovered the fraud but the French state quietly suppressed the findings because of Calment’s national fame.<a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/the110club.com/38c89fe688c6746f18ae7f537967d2e632468eea.html#p40059804" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://the110club.com/jeanne-calment-oldest-person-ever-t14396-s60.html?sid=c807dba66d2f0f2e801672d106f54c42#p40059804" title="(Original URL: https://the110club.com/jeanne-calment-oldest-person-ever-t14396-s60.html?sid=c807dba66d2f0f2e801672d106f54c42#p40059804 )">Robert Young</a> has criticized some of the points, several claims like the estate tax motive have been abandoned by fraud theorists entirely, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/was-jeanne-calment-the-oldest-person-who-ever-lived-or-a-fraud" id="collins-2020" data-link-icon="thenewyorker" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Was Jeanne Calment the Oldest Person Who Ever Lived---or a Fraud? Some researchers have cast doubt on the record of the celebrated supercentenarian">there are considerable problems with the fraud theory now</a>⁠. (Presumably DNA testing offers a definitive answer, if the Calment family cooperates, and allows access to <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/www.connexionfrance.com/c2b418103b1dc9292c5799f1bdc2bb9ae68476a0.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122" title="Blood test could clear-up &#39;oldest person&#39; debate (Original URL: https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122 )">extant blood samples</a>⁠.)</p>
            <p>Overall, the fraud theory seems highly unlikely to explain the Calment anomaly, but the renewed attention &amp; attempts to vindicate her record have unfortunately also shed little light on what alternative explanations might be true.</p>

              <li>
                <p>What happened to the famous <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">genome sequencing cost curve</a> around late 2012, which halted the exponential price decreases for years, keeping whole-genome sequencing prices high, and thus delaying whole-genome sequencing replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">SNP</a> genotyping in genetics research by up to a decade (with untold medical consequences)? Was it just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina,_Inc." data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Illuminati’s</a> fault &amp; a failure of anti-trust law?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Why do humans have such a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_load" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">mutation load</a> on common genetic variants for harmful traits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">schizophrenia</a>?</p>
                <p>Common SNPs make up a large fraction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">variance</a>⁠, even for traits which are fitness-affecting and regularly turn up as consistently under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(natural_selection)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">negative selection</a>: schizophrenia is a particularly good case of this—highly harmful to fitness &amp; life expectancy, bad wherever found, no apparent offsetting benefits found in either schizophrenics or relatives, clearly under negative selection, only modestly driven by <em>de novo</em> or very recent mutations, not under mutation-selection balance like a trait like intelligence (which is largely fitness-irrelevant and so unsurprisingly has a lot of standing variance) and yet, still exacting a staggering toll of 1% of the population. Why?</p>
                <p>“Culture or technology slow down evolution” doesn’t wash when human fitness differentials are so large and so many people died young or as infants, and how did the many deleterious variants get pushed up to such high frequencies in the first place? Particularly given that my understanding is that almost all interesting SNPs date back many tens of thousands of years, possibly millions, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">GWAS</a> analyses indicate that causal variants are largely shared across all human races, undermining demographic accounts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">genetic drift</a>⁠.</p>

Are we missing an enormous range of infections directly causing bad things (or indirectly through autoimmune mechanisms), or is the immune system just sort of like intelligence in being a general health trait?</p>

In many areas, researchers focus on futile efforts to estimate the exact contribution of each of a myriad of factors, despite lacking anywhere near enough data, and the resulting null results are uninterpretable: did those factors not matter, or were they just woefully statistically-underpowered?</p>

I have yet to run into a clear reference to them before the 1970s–1980s, typically vaguely ascribed to convention dynamics, and they may primarily postdate even that (see WP &amp; <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/History">WikiFur</a> &amp; 2 <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9p6e55/when_did_furries_people_who_dress_up_in_animal/" data-link-icon="reddit" data-link-icon-type="svg">Reddit</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/62buiw/historical_the_day_the_furry_fandom_died/" data-link-icon="reddit" data-link-icon-type="svg">discussions</a>).</p>
                <p>But it is not as if anthropomorphization or novels featuring animals or funny artwork of animals were only invented in 1970s or 1980; for example, the Playboy bunnies were 1960s, the <em>Batman</em> character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Catwoman</a> was 1940 (just barely preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_People_(1942_film)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>Cat People</em></a>), Disney had centered around anthropomorphization since 1928, Japanese catgirls were 1920s (although one could trace it back to Cordwainer Smith publishing in 1960s, assuming one didn’t tap into the general eroticization of cats which arguably goes back all the way to the Egyptian use of ‘miw’ for cats and then girls, and the fertility cat-goddess Bastet, serving along the way as a symbol of promiscuity, and Egyptian cartoons from thousands of years ago comically depict cats &amp; rats, see Malek’s <em>The Cat in Ancient Egypt</em>) and probably one could trace many examples much further back than 1970. So why did it come into existence then, rather than long before, and what has made it so common? Why does it follow the apparent demographic patterns it does?</p>
                <p>If it indeed did arise in the 1970s due to some generic combination of economic development, popularity of comic books, technology, or cultural shifts, did many other paraphilias arise in the same time period? Indeed, where do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">paraphilias</a> in general come from?</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>How does fetish economics work in general? Anecdotally, creators in fetishes (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_fetishism" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">feet</a>⁠, furry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futanari" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">futanari</a>) report it being highly lucrative despite them not enjoying it themselves—indeed, it’s lucrative <em>because</em> they don’t enjoy it and only do it for the money, requiring extraordinary premiums.</p>
                  <p>The imbalance is long-standing, and common to many fetishes. An absolute lack of supply is clearly not the reason, and a “risk premium” based on stigma appears inadequate for an imbalance that looks more like excess demand rather than extreme scarcity of supply. I suggest that fetishes do have high demand, as an inherent property of being extreme differences in preferences, and this uses up all fellow-fetish creators and then runs up into very high reservation prices from outsider creators, thereby resulting in unusual prices at the margin.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Furry art has a reputation for being easy money if you can tolerate the work, and more than one creator has anonymously reported that the commissions revolt them but there’s no way to make thousands of dollars a month as an illustrator as easily; I have heard about at least 2 computer game developers who marvel at the amount of money they can make off foot or other fetish games (often technically trivial, being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">visual novel</a>-style games using free software like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren&#39;Py" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Ren’Py</a>⁠, requiring mostly artwork &amp; writing), easily up to $4000/​month. (In one of those cases, they wrote a fic to mock the fetish, but the positive reactions—accompanied by demands of “take my money!”—convinced them to start making &amp; selling <em>actual</em> games.) These disparities do not seem to be new or reflect trendy topics; there appear to be large increases in commissioned artwork, for example, but driven by innovations in market mechanisms &amp; supply-side factors (eg. the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Patreon</a>⁠, or 2-sided commission markets like <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/www.otakustudy.com/e0af64c9cd6007f8ea54dafb7fa280747b96c772.html" id="worboys-2020" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.otakustudy.com/books/2020/08/skeb-artwork-commissioning-website-review/" title="A Review of Skeb.jp---An Artwork Commissioning Website (Original URL: https://www.otakustudy.com/books/2020/08/skeb-artwork-commissioning-website-review/ )">Skeb.jp</a>—which benefits from the huge progress in machine translation, and easier international payments). The demand was always there, but could not be easily tapped. A related question is BDSM; one is always hearing about female doms (but not subs) making extremely large amounts of money, much more than regular sex workers—it makes sense if there are more female subs than female doms, and vice versa fewer male subs than male doms, but then why the extreme premiums when it seems balanced?</p>
              <p>This sort of massive premium is a little odd on the face of it: why is supply &amp; demand so imbalanced, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_supply" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">supply</a> so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">inelastic</a>? If a fetish is X% of the population, one would expect X% of programmers, artists, etc, to share that fetish. If there are a lot of people who want foot-based games, then one would expect there to be a smaller but still large number of people willing to supply such games, and the problem solves itself; if there are not many fetishists, they may go wanting, but there also won’t be all that much money in catering to them either, it would simply be an odd niche that perhaps some creators happen to occupy, but not strikingly lucrative.</p>
              <p>While we don’t know much about why paraphilias change over time or why a paraphilia may develop in the people it develops in, we definitely don’t know any reason to expect a fetish to be underrepresented in artists/​programmers and overrepresented elsewhere. There probably <em>are</em> differences (simply on <a href="https://mclare.blog/everything" id="gwern-everything" title="&#39;Everything Is Correlated&#39;, Branwen 2014">“everything is correlated”</a> grounds), but we don’t know which (in the 3 Fs mentioned, artists/​programmers do not seem underrepresented, if anything, perhaps the opposite), nor do we know that they are <em>so</em> large that they could drive these premiums.</p>
              <p>A lack of generic supply is also a questionable explanation. “Those lucky vanilla heterosexual types have all the porn in the world and can go their entire lives without spending a cent, but you drew the short end of the stick.” Sure, if there were some dire shortage in <em>absolute</em> terms, like only a dozen pictures across the Internet of your fetish, you may find it worthwhile to pay for more yourself. But this is hard to reconcile with the facts. Can we really say that there is a dire shortage of each fetish when image boorus or porn video sites devoted to each type, like e621, can collect millions of images/​videos within a few years?<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (<a href="https://mclare.blog/danbooru2021" id="gwern-danbooru2021" title="&#39;Danbooru2021: A Large-Scale Crowdsourced and Tagged Anime Illustration Dataset&#39;, Branwen 2015">Danbooru</a>⁠, for example, adds &gt;0.5m images/​year—and it has a reputation for being <em>selective</em>!) ≪X%, accumulated over time worldwide, can still be vastly more than any individual can reasonably consume in a lifetime. None of these fetishes seems likely to have a true shortage, per individual, of spank material; if they feel themselves supply-constrained and having difficulty buying more, there must be more going on.</p>
              <p>One possibility is that the premium is a <strong>risk premium</strong>, compensating for participating in a fetish <em>regardless</em> of how much one enjoys it. Perhaps even talented foot fetish artists are reluctant to do more than play footsie with that fandom, because it might get out and handicap them socially or financially? It is difficult to port a reputation in only one direction: if the Z fetishists, who are X% but are frustrated at getting ≪X% of total supply, know an artist offering commissions is mainstream artist Y, and want Y’s services because they can see Y does great work, and Y like that fetish and so doesn’t need to demand a premium due to the greater intrinsic costs, Y may still be worried about “Y does fetish Z” getting out and either demand a big premium or set up under brandnew pseudonym A (if they do at all—any good artist will worry about their art style being identified; <em>ex ungue leonem</em>), constraining output due to lack of reputation.</p>
              <p>There is a definite hierarchy of how stigmatized fetishes are, and this seems like a highly plausible hypothesis. Feet aren’t too bad; models in interviews sound kinda nonchalant about it, taking an “it’s weird and I don’t really get it, but it sure pays the rent” perspective. Futanari is definitely weirder, and furries weirder still, having long been the butt of Internet status hierarchies. And it does seem like the supply problem gets more acute as you go down, which is consistent with the risk premium hypothesis. But is this a big enough effect to drive such wacky price dynamics? Are futanari or foot visual novels <em>so</em> discriminated against that all the creators flee and yet, one can pick up thousands of dollars by simply rolling their eyes and ignoring these stigmas with no visible consequence? (And if we believe most creators have fled, where <em>do</em> all those millions of images and videos and games come from? Just how many would there be if all of the creators stayed‽)</p>
              <p>If you don’t find that adequate, what else could be going on? Since we are dealing with deviant individuals here (in both senses), we might look for generic distribution effects—in particular, our old friend, <em>tails</em>. (Of distributions.) We might argue a priori about X% parity and proportional representation among each fetish or preference, which is a safe argument, but that doesn’t mean that the total distributions of those fetishes need look anything like each other It would be bizarre to expect every sexual preference or fetish to be distributed equally, when we already know counterexamples like lesbianism vs male homosexuality, and the mere fact of differing stigmas would be expected to create differences.</p>
              <p>Imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">normal distribution</a> of “willingness to pay for custom porn of Z”. For regular porn, it is a wide distribution centered around the population mean. But when it comes to, say, feet, there may be some willingness to pay among non-fetishists for images that happen to include feet (perhaps as part of some more general pose or scene), but the foot fetishists will be their own distribution with a mean shifted far to the right (and probably much narrower, with a smaller standard deviation)—many are still unwilling or unable to pay, but many will be, and because of tail effects, there will be, counterintuitively, <em>multiplicatively</em> many more.</p>
              <p>This is another way of saying that fetishes tend to be <em>intense</em>. Such preferences, arising from whatever source, seem to be fairly discrete. There are not going to be terribly many people who feel lukewarm about a fetish and find it sorta-hot-but-ok-maybe-not-really. This correlates with the stigma: the further away a fetish is, the less everyone else can understand it. The intensity is where the disparity in demand comes from: the fetish may have their fair share X% of artists, but they are an intense minority which demands ≫X%. This demand eats up the X% instantly, and goes hungrily looking for more. And, since the fetish is intense and the remaining supply all tend to feel intensely the <em>other</em> way about the fetish (being all the way in the other distributions many standard deviations away from Z), suddenly, at the margin, the clearing price skyrockets. (As an extreme example, consider <em>guro</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_fetish" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">crush</a>⁠.) Creating X−2% or X−1% of supply is relatively easy (even, free); creating X% is easy; but creating X+1%, that requires pulling in a lot of creators from elsewhere and <em>that</em> is increasingly and eventually extremely expensive. Personal preferences are rigid and come from mysterious unknown causes, so both supply and demand here are locked in place indefinitely, without the typical long-run effect where high demand elicits permanent supply increases. (There are comparable examples like science funding: for all that scientists complain about lack of funding, they are individually locked into their particular research topic to the extent that the <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/science/2020-myers.pdf" id="myers-2020" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="The Elasticity of Science">NIH has to increase grants by 40%</a> to pull in novel researchers!) To the extent that risk premium reduces supply, this merely exacerbates the prices.</p>
              <p>The tail effect model predicts that this situation will be stable long-term because it is rooted in human psychology. It further predicts that the premium will be due more to the personal level of disgust experienced by outsider artists than to fetish popularity or risk or stigma because the risk premium is confounded: the stigma will predict the premium, but not <em>cause</em> it, because both are caused by the same thing. Exogenously reducing the social stigma (without people changing their gut response) or reducing it in other ways like providing more anonymous ways to work may ease the supply situation a bit, but will not lead to any major changes in the market. (In comparison, improving mechanisms like market websites or assurance contracts, or automating artwork using neural networks, might well have large effects as it lets the demand more efficiently extract supply. Neural networks don’t care.)</p>

              </div>
              <p>Psychedelics and hallucinogens induce a bewildering range of sometimes extraordinary effects; but if there’s any common trait to trip reports &amp; descriptions across hundreds of different psychedelics, it’s that they tend to ‘weaken boundaries’. One loses one’s ordinary sense of being a discrete, separate person, identifiable &amp; distinguished from other people, and one begins to feel as one with the people nearby, humanity, earth, God(s), universe, the multiverse, or even grander &amp; more ineffable unities.</p>
              <p><span>Anti-psychedelics to make you soberer than sober.</span> So far so good. But after reading enough Erowid trip reports, I began to wonder: if some drugs can <em>weaken</em> identity boundaries, then shouldn’t there be some drugs which <em>strengthen</em> it? (A drug which makes you not drunk on hallucination, but <a href="https://wiki.lspace.org/Knurd">‘knurd’</a>⁠, soberer than sober, as Terry Pratchett put it.) And if there are many fewer such drugs than psychedelics, perhaps even zero, then why? (We can imagine an ‘inverse’ or <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/04/samsara/" data-link-icon="SSC" data-link-icon-type="text,tri">‘anti-Buddhism’</a><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>—whose scripture is doubtless Ayn Rand—and which preaches the gospel of greed, focusing on strengthening one’s personal identity, cultivating appetites and preferences, and developing agency; so why not imagine an ‘anti-psychedelic’?) If psychedelics like the ones <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Shulgin</a> reports can have so many oddball effects like ‘make everything sound like it’s at a great distance’ (I vaguely recall one of Shulgin’s reports mentioning), then surely some of them can reverse their usual dissolving effect. Why can’t I feel, with the same absolute certainty that I feel ‘all is one’, that I am a unique snowflake utterly unlike any other human being or organism? Why is there no drug that dehumanizes other humans, turning them into clockwork mechanisms and zombies and <a href="https://xkcd.com/610/" data-link-icon="XKCD" data-link-icon-type="text,quad,sans">sheeple</a>⁠, while I’m the only <em>real</em> person? A drug which refines identity down to feeling separate parts, memes, cells, biomes, selfish-genes, molecules, atoms…</p>
              <p><span>…Or for meeting mitochondrial, not machine, elves.</span> Or, if that doesn’t really make sense (maybe one already conceives of oneself as maximally separate, in the way the integer 1 is already non-identical to the integer 2 and can’t be made ‘more non-identical’), why can’t any ‘unification’ happen <em>internally</em>? Why does the psychedelic experience always seem to be external, in unifying me with things ‘outside my skin’, as it were? Why, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DMT</a>⁠, does one travel to another universe to meet the machine elves, instead of traveling down inside a skin cell to meet the mitochondria elves, or pause for a chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_transposon" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">jumping transposons</a> on chromosome 13? Why don’t I meet a Parliament of Organs inside, where my kidneys bicker while my liver sighs? Or to take a more cognitive tack, is there a drug which would let me step back and observe the wheels of my mind go around—see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">working memory</a> distinct from short-term memory, the long-term memory pulling up &amp; rewriting memories, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">inner monologue</a> comes from, cruder associative cognition acting before slow serial processes binding many regions in a shared computation…? All of these seem logically &amp; psychologically possible, and not even that strange compared to many drug effects or psychiatric conditions.</p>
              <p>Anti-psychedelic candidates:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Stimulants</strong> If we ask what the ‘opposite’ of psychedelics is, most people would suggest stimulants: cocaine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">caffeine</a>⁠, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">nicotine</a>⁠, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">amphetamines</a>⁠, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">modafinil</a>⁠, etc.</p>
                  <p>Are they ‘anti-psychedelics’ in this sense of identity-strengthening? I’ve never taken cocaine, but the others don’t give me the feeling of freezing the way psychedelics give me the feeling of melting. And perhaps more importantly, even if we claim they do, they seem <em>far</em> weaker. Most caffeine, nicotine<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>⁠, or modafinil use comes nowhere <em>near</em> the effect of quite ordinary psychedelic trips; one has to use extraordinary doses, potentially risking lethal overdoses, to start seeing psychedelic-level effects.</p>
                  <p>Cocaine and amphetamines (and dopaminergic stimulants in general) can cause a degree of psychosis, but it takes a lot of sustained abuse to begin psychedelic-tier effects like seeing ‘the shadow people’ hallucinations under amphetamines. (And even the most extreme hospitalization-level amphetamine psychosis don’t seem to reach the peaks &amp; depths of <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/5-meo-dmt-a-review-by-a-confused" data-link-icon="substack" data-link-icon-type="svg">a single 5-MeO-DMT trip</a> casually will.)</p>
                  <p>Psychedelics are just really amazingly powerful. If these are the best we can find for ‘anti-psychedelics’, then we still have a puzzle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Dissociatives</strong>: Another possibility is more sedative or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">dissociative</a> drugs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_dextromethorphan" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DXM</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ketamine</a>⁠.</p>
                  <p>I am not personally familiar with DXM nor have I read much about it, but I am skeptical that the effects of dissociation match here. Inducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">depersonalization</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">derealization</a> so you feel like you &amp; the world no longer exist is an interesting effect (however unpleasant), but that sounds more identity-annihilating than strengthening. Likewise, to the extent DXM produces frightening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">schizophrenia</a>-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_thought" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">intrusive thoughts</a> &amp; inner voices which come involuntarily from nowhere, that’s it breaking down your identity, not strengthening it—you should know where they come from and be able to control or at least understand them.</p>

                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><strong>MDMA</strong></a> is an interesting candidate.</p>
                  <p>While I associate it mostly with cuddle-puddle and therapy and loss of ability to perceive threats/​danger, which looks like ‘dissolving’ to me, I am told that when people rolling on MDMA introspect about themselves, they sometimes spontaneously develop an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Internal Family Systems Model</a>-like internal dialogue with reified parts of their mind, talking to sub-personalities or personifications. If true, MDMA would seem to count as an ‘anti-psychedelic’ at least sometimes, and would be an interesting psychiatric therapy approach. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">MAPS</a> has apparently mentioned this possibility.)</p>

                  <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_divinorum" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>Salvia divinorum</em></a></strong>: mentioned to me as sometimes having experiences of one’s mind dividing into multiple co-occurring parts, and sounding like a candidate.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p><span>Few candidates.</span> Overall, while there are some good candidates, there does not appear to be any large pool of well-known drugs which have astonishing anti-psychedelic effects on par with psychedelics. Even if a few like MDMA or <em>Salvia</em> can do it, this is strikingly rare compared to regular psychedelics, where it seems like hundreds of RCs come onto the market each decade.</p>
              <p><span>Breaking, not making.</span> Why this imbalance? The most obvious answer is that “it is easier to destroy than to create”. A lack of boundaries is the default, and identity is constructed with difficulty. Both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">theory of mind</a> and a sense of self are great cognitive achievements, and easily undone.</p>
              <p><span>Shattering the network.</span> On a neurological level, simply weakening global connectivity and the intricate coordination between brain regions will reliably produce dissolution. But it is much more difficult to improve the dynamic coordination of brain regions, making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">global workspace</a> more efficient and integrated. After a certain level of disconnection (induced by psychedelics or anesthesia) breaking the unified brain down into modules, one is unconscious, affected regions are no longer able to store verbalizable information in long-term memory for later reporting, or the cut-off regions are so autonomous that they become a blind-spot or agnosia (like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">split-brain</a> syndrome<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>).</p>
              <p><span>Brains are hard to fix.</span> In this sense, ordinary consciousness <em>is</em> in fact as about unified as is possible. There are no more brain regions which can be usefully integrated, and the existing regions are coordinated as skillfully as possible given one’s particular genetic endowment, environment, and cognitive development. Some stimulants tweaking the brain usefully, or some oddball side effects which create subjective states faking it, is as good as you can expect. It’s hard to improve a generic human brain, like it’s hard to improve every car’s mileage by dumping random chemicals into their gas tanks without even knowing what model or if they are a diesel engine instead.</p>

              <p>Face-to-face meetings, even brief ones, appear to cement personal connections of trust and liking to an extent not achieved by even years of more mediated contact like phone calls or Internet text discussions / emails / chat; this appears to be true in almost every context, even ones like British inventors meeting their heroes (in a different field) just once, with large step functions in connections despite the apparent near-zero marginal information conveyed by a brief physical visit after long-term interactions &amp; track records. (This might be related to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom&#39;s_2_sigma_problem" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Bloom’s 2 sigma problem</a>”<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>⁠.)</p>

              <p>Given the crucial role of trust and shared interests in success stories like Xerox PARC or the Apollo Project or creative collaborations in general, why are there so few extremely successful pairs of identical twins, and relatively few examples of duos like the Winklevoss twins <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Winklevoss" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Cameron</a>⁠/ ​<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Winklevoss" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Tyler Winklevoss</a>? Even broadening further to siblings, there are not that many–famous families like the Kardashians, individually famous people but not many famous collaborations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_brothers" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Chudnovsky brothers</a> (profiles: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/11/capturing-the-unicorn" data-link-icon="thenewyorker" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Capturing the Unicorn: How two mathematicians came to the aid of the Met">1</a>⁠, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/03/02/the-mountains-of-pi" data-link-icon="thenewyorker" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="The Chudnovsky Brothers and the Mountains of Pi">2</a>), or Hollywood’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Coen brothers</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Wachowski brothers</a>⁠. The reader will struggle to think of more than a handful, or even any other examples (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Bee Gees</a>⁠, over half a century ago? some random football or baseball people?).</p>
              <p>As identical twins are ~0.5% of the population (eg. of the USA’s &gt;332m people ~2021, there should be &gt;830,000 twin-or-higher sets<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>), their mental &amp; physical health differences are <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/genetics/heritable/2021-willemsen.pdf" id="willemsen-et-al-2021" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Twin-Singleton Comparisons Across Multiple Domains of Life">only slightly different</a> from singletons, and a large fraction of the population has at least one sibling, and the benefits seems so clear (thus they <em>should</em> lead to not merely being common but enormously overrepresented among elites by the usual tail/​order statistic effects)—where are they?</p>
              <p>Identical twins should have collaborative superpowers, between shared genetics &amp; upbringing, in their much-envied abilities to completely implicitly trust each other, predict what the other would agree to or be interested in, and so on (collaboration taken to the point of identical twins reportedly sometimes developing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophasia" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">private language</a> or creole in childhood); siblings should also have similar (but much smaller) advantages in collaboration compared to working with strangers. Is the answer something relatively boring like “the slight health/​IQ penalty for being an identical twin plus the low base-rate of identical twins plus their remaining variance meaning that one of the pair won’t clear various thresholds means you wouldn’t expect to see many and this is consistent with what we see” or is there some deeper lesson here about greatness/​creativity/​risk-taking? (The most amusing explanation, of course, would be “most successful people are in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>secretly</em></a> identical twins”.)</p>
              <p>The boring answer of remaining-variance suggests this might be another case of <a href="https://mclare.blog/note/pipeline" id="gwern-note-pipeline" title="&#39;Leaky Pipelines&#39;, Branwen 2014">log-normal pipeline</a>⁠/ ​<a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/genetics/heritable/emergenesis/index" title="&#39;emergenesis tag&#39;, N/A 2023">‘emergenesis’</a>-like multiplicative rather than additive dynamics meaning that a little is just too little. Yes, identical twins are indeed quite similar on some traits like height or IQ, and so you do expect roughly proportional amounts of twin pairs which will be highly talented; but talent is merely the starting point.</p>
              <p>All models of elite <em>accomplishment</em> (as opposed to mere possession of talent) place great stress on the roles of interest &amp; motivation (in addition to other factors like sheer luck). Someone who isn’t particularly driven to accomplish anything, probably won’t, and punching the clock 9-to-5 will rarely cut the mustard, particularly in any kind of competitive field. Such motivation is itself <a href="https://mclare.blog/subculture#a-winner-is-you" id="gwern-subculture-a-winner-is-you">pretty weird and aberrant</a>⁠; you have to be a strange person to have a ‘rage to mastery’ for many things, like genuinely wanting to devote your life to hitting a small fuzzy ball around a concrete parking lot, or play a game meant for children for the rest of your life as your greatest achievement. One can argue that since motivations/​interests/​hobbies/​leisure-pursuits/​entertainment-references are <a href="https://mclare.blog/amuse" id="gwern-amuse" title="&#39;Amusing Ourselves to Death?&#39;, Branwen 2018">all themselves heritable</a>⁠, but this overlooks that the heritability tends to drop the specific the trait you measure: interest in “literature” can be expected to be larger than interest in “Ancient Greek epic poetry”; there is also a base-rate problem, because it is common to be ‘interested in literature’ but the more you break it down, the tinier the base rate gets, and it is not helpful for identical twins to go from, say, a 0.01% probability of being obsessed with Greek poetry to a 0.5% probability, even if that corresponds to a rather large effect parameterized in odds or R<sup>2</sup>… There will still be basically zero pairs of identical twins both obsessed with the <em>same</em> thing. And if they are not obsessed with almost identical topics, there will be little scope for any genuine long-term collaboration. Even if they both go into the same field like mathematics, but one goes into probability theory and the other goes into, say, transfinite ordinal research, regardless of whatever ‘collaborative superpowers’ they may have, there just won’t be much to talk about professionally rather than at the dinner table, and their colleagues in that area will still be the most useful to seriously work with.</p>
              <p>So in this model, we’d expect to see identical twins with similar-ish professional interests, yet, not <em>so</em> similar that they remain a single unit. That does strike me as consistent with what I see: it’s not that unusual for biographies to mention an accomplished sibling or identical twin (“famed physicist John Smith’s daughter Kate is a world-renowned marine biologist and his son a violinist…”), and there are many eminent families (can’t throw a stone without hitting one), but as predicted, it’s still relatively unusual for parent/​child or sibling pairs to engage in the <em>same</em> work (like the Thompsons on acoustics, the Bachs on Baroque music, or the Bernouillis on probability &amp; mechanics).</p>

              <p>Is <a href="https://mclare.blog/beauty" id="physical-beauty" title="&#39;Progress In Beauty&#39;, Branwen 2016"><strong>physical beauty</strong> relative or absolute</a> and if the latter, is it objectively increasing over time? Photographs of exceptionally beautiful women from the 1800s or early 1900s, or nude/​erotic paintings from before then, strike most people are being drab and unattractive. Given the stability and cross-cultural <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/www.jonathanstray.com/97467f7930b9decf9a1d28071aa425861266436f.pdf" id="langlois-et-al-2000" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://www.jonathanstray.com/papers/Langlois.pdf" title="&#39;Maxims or Myths of Beauty?

              <p>What is going on?

(Large gains in means would not be unprecedented: when we look at photos of children or people from those time periods, one common observation is how short, scrawny, and stunted they look—and indeed, as an objective fact about an accurately-measured cardinal measure with absolute values, they <em>were</em> short &amp; scrawny, and things really have improved that much.) If physical beauty is not zero-sum, how far can it go?

Or might, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Flynn effect</a> and height, we already be experiencing a reversal due to the obesity crisis or other factors like mutation load and we have already seen ‘Peak Beauty’ (at least for the average person, of course CGI/​growing populations/​cosmetic tech implies that models &amp; actors will continue their evolution into superstimuli)?</p>

              <p>Whatever happened to Blake Benthall (“Defcon”) of Silk Road 2? In almost all other cases, arrested DNM staff/​operators have been extradited, tried, plea-bargained or convicted, and largely done with within a few years and were well-documented publicly throughout. In the case of Benthall, however, 4 years later, not only is the resolution of his case unknown, his PACER docket hasn’t updated since shortly after his arrest though the case remains open &amp; charges pending. In <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nea4kw/silk-road-2-admin-defcon-blake-benthall-tax-crimes-cooperate" data-link-icon="VICE" data-link-icon-type="text,quad,italic">May 2019</a> leaks finally indicated Benthall was still alive and it seemed like he would be prosecuted <em>only</em> for tax evasion‽ If he has been cooperating with LE, what on earth did he have to offer them all this time when the SR2 server was seized in its entirety, and SR2 quickly became ancient history for the DNMs and any personal connections or inside info have long since gone stale?</p>

                <li>On a similar note, how did the FBI <em>really</em> find the Silk Road 1 server in Iceland—which was so key to finding the Pennsylvania backup server and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Ross Ulbricht</a> himself in SF? Agent Tarbell’s story never made sense (sounding suspiciously like an obfuscated SQLi attack, raising questions about legality) and he decamped bizarrely quickly for the private sector after what should have been a career-defining triumph, nor has the FBI ever gone into any detail about it (it did not come up at trial due to major strategic errors by the defense). It is also highly suspicious that some fake IDs Ross Ulbricht bought to rent servers were intercepted &amp; he was interviewed in SF by LE not long before the server was supposedly located—quite a coincidence in timing. The SR1 investigation was riddled with corruption and questionable actions, and the finding of the SR1 server smells like another case, of a rogue agent or perhaps parallel construction.

              <p>Tea drinkers universally agree that microwaving water for green/​oolong<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> tea instead of using a kettle (whether electric or not) results in worse-tasting tea, despite the same temperature &amp; water source; I describe this inferior tea as tasting ‘flat’ like decaffeinated tea. Why? (I have not done a <a href="https://mclare.blog/water" id="gwern-water" title="&#39;Self-Blinded Mineral Water Taste Test&#39;, Branwen 2017">blinded randomized test</a> like I have of mineral water types, because I’m wary of trying to physically randomize cups of boiling water, so let’s take this as a given.)</p>
              <p><span>What chemical difference?</span> It’s puzzling that the method of heating the water should make any difference to the subsequent tea, since no matter how you get to 100℃, it ought to be the same boiling H<sub>2</sub>O. It cannot add or subtract any chemicals, or be physically different—can it?</p>
              <p>Online speculation sometimes suggests “deoxygenation” as the chemical issue. I’m not sure how this would work. Cold moving water doesn’t contain much dissolved oxygen to begin with (apparently on the order of only 10 parts per million), and hot still water would contain much less. Does oxygen gas make any taste difference at all at such low levels? And it’s not obvious that the route of heating should lead to any difference in final oxygen gas content—much less make a <em>huge</em> difference much later in the steeped tea that could explain this.</p>
              <p><span>Physics of taste.</span> A more plausible mechanism involves the difference you can literally <em>see</em>: the bubbles during boiling. Microwaved water, because it heats the entire volume of water evenly compared to a hot heating element at the bottom of the kettle, will have many fewer bubbles from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">boiling</a>⁠; an example of this is the dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheating" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">superheating</a> effect where a container of boiling-temperature water may be still until you disturb it slightly, at which point it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_evaporation" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">‘explodes’</a> boiling-hot water/​steam at you. The boil can’t happen without ‘nucleation’ sites to form the seed bubbles. A striking example of how important nucleation sites can be is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_geyser" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Diet Coke and Mentos eruption</a> effect—it has nothing to do with any chemistry of ‘acidic Diet Coke reacting with basic Mentos’ or anything like that, it is solely driven by the physical fact that a Mentos mint turns out to have thousands of seed bubbles trapped in tiny cracks, which lets the pressurized CO<sub>2</sub> gas dissolved in the Diet Coke liquid instantly boil out. Other examples come from food science, where it is well-known that the surface area and texture of food particles are far more important to how they <em>taste</em> than their total volume or mass, because we perceive by molecules docking in taste buds on the tongue &amp; smell receptors in the nose, and the actual mass is irrelevant; so one can <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/28/the-race-to-redesign-sugar" data-link-icon="thenewyorker" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="The Race to Redesign Sugar: Forget artificial sweeteners. Researchers are now developing new forms of real sugar, to deliver sweetness with fewer calories. But tricking our biology is no easy feat.">engineer low-calorie sugar</a> by making sugar particles with a high surface area and low total mass, which will fit in the same number of sweet taste receptors as the original high-calorie formulation with large heavy sugar particles. Bubbles are even critical to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerated_water" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">water aeration</a>⁠, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_aeration#Fine_bubble_aeration" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">fine bubbles</a> maximize surface area &amp; time-in-water.</p>
              <p><span>Effervescent-tasting.</span> So, the problem with microwave water vs boiling water might be the boiling <em>bubbles themselves</em>! A lack of bubbles, however small they are, may destroy the flavor. It might be the equivalent of wearing nose-clips and then being surprised how hard it is to distinguish potatoes from strawberries, because the aroma is gone. Or perhaps the effervescence is pushing more flavor into the tongue’s taste buds.</p>
              <p><span>Microwave for bubbles?</span> This could be tested by finding a container so rough that microwaved water boils normally (or perhaps a small rough obect at the bottom? not Mentos mints since they would dissolve &amp; change flavor, but something similar), or by injecting lots of small bubbles into microwaved water (something like an atomizer or aerosolizer).</p>

              <p><strong>What happened to short stories?</strong> Short stories used to be one of the most dominant mediums, published in countless magazines, and making the fame (and fortune) of writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald. A newbie writer could easily write solid short stories in relatively small amounts of time, giving them feedback and money and a corpus and a reputation while gradually preparing them for the rigors of an extended novel, Particularly in SF/​F, the classic career path was to publish several short stories in the SF magazines that most fans would subscribe to (like <em>Astounding</em> or <em>Asimov’s</em>), staple them together into a first novel, and start a trilogy. One could even become a millionaire off sales to places like the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>.</p>
              <p>All of that has completely vanished. Most of the SF magazines are gone, and the remainder have transitioned to Internet formats and are kept alive for other reasons. Short stories are written for the love of it, and are now the most academic and stuffy of all literary genres; the idea of reading shorts for <em>entertainment</em> is unfathomable. (As anyone who has sat down and tried to read a few contemporary stories in the magazines which still publish any, like <em>The New Yorker</em> or <em>The Paris Review</em>, can attest.)</p>

              <p><span>Classical Chinese examples.</span> I couldn’t help but notice while reading translations of various pre-Communist or pre-Buddhist works, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classics" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Chinese classics</a>⁠, that this rhetorical style seems to show up a lot there too—although I don’t have examples on hand, the very terms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Books_and_Five_Classics" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">“Four Books and Five Classics”</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Classics" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">“Thirteen Classics”</a>⁠, or the fact that children started with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Character_Classic" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>Three Character Classic</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Family_Surnames" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>Hundred Family Surnames</em></a>⁠, gives you an idea what you’re in for.</p>
              <p><span>Outlier.</span> Of course numeric epithets, number symbolism, and outright numerology are extremely common outside India/​China (eg. Christianity has its trinity, 7, and 12 disciples everywhere), but nowhere else seems to take it to <em>such</em> levels—not even highly-sinicized countries like Korea or Japan. (Quick—name 3 Western examples besides “the Ten Commandments”!)</p>
              <p>So, where did this numeric rhetoric style originate, and what purpose did it serve? Oddly, I can’t recall any of the translators discussing the rhetoric at all! much less tracing its origin and development.</p>
              <p><span>Monosyllabic rhetoric?</span> One thought I had was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Mandarin Chinese</a> speakers reportedly have a larger digit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">memory span</a> because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Mandarin digits</a> are monosyllabic, enabling faster mental rehearsal. Analogously, monosyllabic numbers might make them more rhetorically attractive because they are faster to say and rhyme (eg. no ‘seven’) or being tonal, make a phrase only by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-syllable_article" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">varying tone</a> (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">“Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den”</a>). But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Pali</a> numbers appear to be <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/f1d60c3087e51de845f3dc6590facf2f0576b284.html" id="ānandajoti-2016" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Textual-Studies/Grammar/Pali-Numbers.htm" title="&#39;Pāḷi Numbers (Saṅkhyā)&#39;, Ānandajoti 2016 (Original URL: https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Textual-Studies/Grammar/Pali-Numbers.htm )">often be multi-syllabic</a>⁠, so that undermines this hypothesis.</p>
              <p><span>Oral mnemonics.</span> A more likely candidate is some aspect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>oral tradition</em></a> leaving its mark—just as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_chant" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Vedas</a> were chanted initially, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Pāli Canon</a> was not written down in Buddha’s lifetime but centuries after (with transmission by regular recitation encouraging the use of techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatha_(India)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>gatha</em></a> summary verses), or the <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/01/17/having-had-no-predecessor-to-imitate/index.html" id="menard-2020" title="&#39;Having Had No Predecessor to Imitate, He Had No Successor Capable of Imitating Him&#39;, Menard 2020">Homeric poems accreted</a> heroic epithets &amp; catchphrases to make memorization &amp; improvisation easier, or as even <a href="https://mclare.blog/doc/www/intellectualmathematics.com/cf943d37aacbf26ffc438dd895de211d902b97c0.html" id="blåsjö-2020" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://intellectualmathematics.com/blog/singing-euclid-the-oral-character-of-greek-geometry/" title="&#39;Singing Euclid: the oral character of Greek geometry&#39;, Blåsjö 2020 (Original URL: http://intellectualmathematics.com/blog/singing-euclid-the-oral-character-of-greek-geometry/ )">Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>’</a> repetitive recitation of premise/​step/​theorem reflects oral instruction in geometry, numeric epithets may be useful for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">mnemonic</a> nature. Perhaps early Indian/​Chinese culture was not so much literate as <em>a</em>literate (minimizing use of texts eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_and_wooden_slips" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">bamboo texts</a> being almost mnemonics rather than fully-written out texts), for long enough that the oral traditions left a permanent imprint and that set the path of the later culture? (While younger traditions like Christianity happened to be ‘born literate’, as it were, and optimized less for orality as they could be fixed into text much faster.) If you had to write on silk, bamboo, palm leaves, or wooden slips where manufacturing everything could take many man-days, and had no access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">papyrus</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">vellum</a> (much less paper), you would be terse too!</p>
