<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/halide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halide</a> may have been featured during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 16</a> keynote, but it seems that wasn’t enough to protect it from an over-zealous App Store reviewer. <a href="https://www.lux.camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lux</a> co-founder Ben Sandofsky shared that the latest version of Halide was rejected from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> …</p>



<p>The reason? Because it seemingly wasn’t clear why a camera app needs access to the camera in order to take photos.</p>



<p>When you run Halide, the app of course requests access to the camera. Developers are required to explain why they require access to features like this, and Lux’s explanation seems reasonably clear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But it appears that Apple decided that wasn’t sufficiently clear, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandofsky/113181384256449181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandofsky explained</a> on Mastodon.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest Halide update was rejected because, after seven years, a random reviewer decided our permission prompt wasn’t descriptive enough.</p>



<p>I don’t know how to explain why a camera app needs camera permissions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2466517/app-store-review-is-still-broken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macworld’s</a></em> Macolope suggested clearer, if less grammatical, text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs for the app that you just downloaded to take photographs for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Halide is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/16/halide-gets-camera-control-support-also-available-from-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the apps to support</a> the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/19/familiarize-yourself-with-the-camera-control-button-before-your-iphone-16-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camera Control button</a> on the iPhone 16.</p>
