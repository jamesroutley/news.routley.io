    <h1>How often do full-body MRIs find cancer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Feb. 11, 2026<span>Updated Feb. 12, 2026, 9:00 a.m. ET</span></p><div><p>Picture this: At your annual physical with your primary care provider, you also receive a full-body scan and a more extensive panel of bloodwork. Just to make sure that you are 100% fine, nothing is wrong with you, you can go on your way and not worry a second longer about your health. Or if there is something, even tiny, now you can fix it before it gets worse.</p><p>Sounds perfect, right? That&#39;s a future many envision thanks to a <a href="https://hamy.xyz/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/14/canyon-ranch-resort-medical-tests/75558047007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">health and wellness longevity culture</a> brimming with innovation aimed at keeping us healthier for longer.</p><p>&#34;Sometimes, even if we have a great lifestyle, it&#39;s important to get a baseline, because we don&#39;t really understand,&#34; says <a href="https://prenuvo.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">Andrew Lacy</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://hamy.xyz/story/life/health-wellness/2026/01/06/whole-body-mris-aneurysm-cancer/87791863007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">full-body MRI</a> company Prenuvo. &#34;Everyone&#39;s genetics are unique. And some people can be fit and have liver problems or fit and have sort of inflammatory bowel problems. And knowing this is just really helpful.&#34;</p><p>As exciting as it seems, others in the medical community are skeptical – particularly about full-body MRIs. <a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/manjiri-dighe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">Dr. Manjiri Dighe</a>, Professor of Radiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, says that &#34;whole body MRI is in its clinical infancy. While it is non-invasive and highly sensitive, it lacks the large-scale longitudinal data needed to prove that it saves more lives than it complicates through overdiagnosis.&#34; With low availability and high cost, for the average person, it remains a luxury item not an &#34;evidence-based medical necessity.&#34; The tests range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on which sections of the body are scanned, and are not covered by insurance.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/29/USAT/88414257007-prenuvo-mri-3.png?width=660&amp;height=496&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/29/USAT/88414257007-prenuvo-mri-3.png?width=1320&amp;height=992&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Research shows these full-body tests often find something, but much less often find actual disease."/></figure><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34338948/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">Research</a> shows these test often find something, but much less often find actual disease.

Over the last five to 10 years, he began asking himself more and more: Why do these remarkable machines he and his colleagues devoted their lives to building and improving only help patients when they&#39;re sick?</p><p>&#34;They&#39;re remarkable tools to guide therapy, to diagnose and so on,&#34; he says. &#34;But by and large, we use them after people have had symptoms or some other signs of disease, and in too many cases, it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/29/USAT/88414255007-690-b-85-d-85-dc-99-bc-2-f-70-ce-84-c-scans.jpg?width=660&amp;height=578&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="As exciting as it seems, others in the medical community are skeptical – particularly about full-body MRIs."/></figure><p>He shifted his thinking to focus more on <a href="https://hamy.xyz/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/14/canyon-ranch-longevity-program/75296883007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">proactive medicine</a>, and he began advising MRI company Ezra (later acquired by Function, where he now works full-time). At Function, in addition to preventative, full-body MRI screening to detect early stage cancers, aneurysms and abnormalities, patients can also seek out extensive panels of blood tests to interpret all their results with proper perspective.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s all about context,&#34; he says. &#34;And I think that&#39;s what addresses a lot of the concerns about false positive rates and downstream tests.&#34; That&#39;s where a lot of criticism comes for preventative testing. How often are you performing unnecessary tests on low-risk individuals, when whatever you find wouldn&#39;t have developed into anything serious? And how much is that costing someone financially and emotionally over time?</p><h2>Fear of &#39;missing something&#39; often feels bigger than actual risk</h2><p><a href="https://www.mskcc.org/profile/andrew-vickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">Andrew Vickers</a>, attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, knows some people will find real problems with whole-body MRIs. But is there evidence to show it&#39;s doing more harm than good? &#34;You&#39;re finding something that never would have caused you any problem in your life, and in cancer, we call that overdiagnosis,&#34; Vickers says. The harder we look for cancers, the more we will <a href="https://hamy.xyz/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/14/canyon-ranch-health-anxiety/75450427007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">over-diagnose</a> them. And if someone is over-diagnosed, gets a biopsy and develops an infection, that&#39;s a direct harm.</p><p>&#34;These unnecessary additional exams and treatments would further burden our healthcare system, which is already overburdened,&#34; Dighe adds. &#34;For the general asymptomatic population, the statistical probability of a false positive is significantly higher than the probability of finding a curable, life-threatening cancer.&#34;</p><p>Humans crave reassurance. And when social media algorithms feed that reassurance, it&#39;s easy to see why these tests seem smart to try.</p><p>More than 87% of influencer posts on social media about such tests (including full-body MRI, multi-cancer early detection tests and more) <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">offered a positive spin</a>, according to a JAMA study published in February 2025; about 84% were overt promotions.</p><p>A closer look at numbers shows &#34;the confirmed cancer detection rate is approximately 1.6% in general screening populations, with 11% receiving treatment triggered by whole-body MRI findings when including both malignant and benign conditions requiring intervention,&#34; says <a href="https://x.com/MinaMakaryMD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">Dr. Mina S. Makary</a>, associate professor of radiology at <a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/general-health/full-body-mri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center</a>, referencing a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40884613/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">2025 European Radiology study</a>. &#34;The fear of &#39;missing something&#39; often feels larger than the <a href="https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/whole-body-mri-preventive-medicine-current-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u">actual statistical risk</a>,&#34; Makary adds. &#34;Also, we need to recognize that false reassurance is possible. A negative scan doesn’t mean you’re disease-free. Some cancers and conditions simply aren’t visible yet or aren’t reliably detected on a one-time full-body MRI.&#34;</p><p>Lacy argues the test &#34;just gives you so much runway and options to affect the trajectory of that disease&#34; if you indeed have something in an early stage. He remembers giving away a free scan at a hospital, the winner a 38-year-old nurse. The machine found lung cancer. She had never smoked.</p><h2>In medicine, more information not always better</h2><p>Sodickson envisions a future where we will monitor our health through blood tests, imaging and wearables even more closely. An early warning system built in that tells us what&#39;s wrong before our symptoms do. For now, he doesn&#39;t recommend getting a scan &#34;then trying to scramble and make sense of all the data yourselves. What&#39;s important to think about is making this more of a repeating habit.&#34; Ideally, costs will continue to go down over time for this kind of testing. Insurance may cover them someday.</p><p>&#34;Most of those things that could be anxiety-provoking go away or are much less concerning, if you get a second scan and you see that things aren&#39;t changed,&#34; he adds. &#34;So most of the <a href="https://hamy.xyz/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/09/what-is-anxiety/82827082007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">anxiety</a> someone lives with can be dealt with by just getting another time point and seeing a trend rather than seeing a snapshot.&#34;</p><p>These tests also serve as warning signs for less serious but still concerning conditions like spinal degeneration. &#34;Just being able to tell someone in their 20s, hey, you got to watch out here, because, you shouldn&#39;t really have this level of degeneration at your age,&#34; Lacy says, forces them to watch their posture and pay attention.</p><p>Sodickson has had many MRIs in his life, including Ezra scans and a Function blood test. Surprises awaited him, too. But &#34;I feel like I actually have someone looking out for me now, rather than just blindly going through my life and maybe one day waking up with with a disease I never knew I had a susceptibility to.&#34;</p><p>While these tests could be life-saving for those with certain conditions, for many clinicians to widely recommend them, they&#39;d want to see cost-effectiveness and a true mortality benefit, Dighe says. &#34;In medicine, &#39;more information&#39; is not always &#39;better information.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Lacy is betting on the future. &#34;The health system can and will adapt to early detection, and I think it&#39;s sad to suggest the alternative, which is we don&#39;t know how to handle this, and we&#39;re not sure we can adapt, and therefore we shouldn&#39;t allow patients to have more information about their health.&#34;</p><p>No matter what you decide for yourself, consult a licensed medical professional for advice.</p></div></div>
