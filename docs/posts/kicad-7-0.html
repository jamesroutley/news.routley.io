<p>The KiCad project is proud to announce the release of version 7.0.0.
KiCad 7 is a significant upgrade from KiCad 6, and comes with a
number of exciting new features as well as improvements to existing
features. The KiCad project hopes you enjoy version 7! Head to the
<a href="https://www.kicad.org/download/">KiCad download page</a>
to get your copy of the new version (note that some packages may still be in
the process of being released at the time this announcement is published).
Many thanks to all of the hard working folks who contributed to KiCad during
the version 7 development cycle.</p>
<p>In accordance with the KiCad stable release policy, KiCad 6.x will no longer be
maintained, and we will release bug fix versions of KiCad 7.x over the next year
as we develop KiCad 8.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_version_7_changes">Version 7 Changes</h2>
<div>
<p>KiCad 7 is a big release despite coming only a year after KiCad 6 — in the
past year, developers have made more than 6000 commits, fixing over 1200
reported issues and adding a number of new features. This post highlights some
of the larger new features, but there are many other smaller improvements and
fixes made by almost 200 different contributors.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_general">General</h3>
<div>
<h4 id="_release_schedule_change">Release Schedule Change</h4>
<p>While we missed our official annual release schedule date of January 31st,
the annual release schedule went pretty well for our first attempt. We
will continue to improve our stable release process going forward as we
adapt to the new schedule.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_custom_fonts">Custom Fonts</h4>
<p>Custom font support is now available in the schematic, PCB, and worksheet
editors to allow the use of any system font.</p>

<h4 id="_3dconnexion_spacemouse_support">3Dconnexion SpaceMouse Support</h4>
<p><a href="https://3dconnexion.com/">3Dconnexion</a> has contributed support in the schematic,
symbol library, PCB, and footprint editors and 3D viewer for their line of
SpaceMouse products. For those unfamiliar, 3D mice are alternative input
devices that give a unique way of navigating both 3D and 2D canvases that some
users find more ergonomic or intuitive than traditional mice. Users with a
3Dconnexion SpaceMouse may find this a welcome addition to KiCad’s capabilities
to support their needs.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<img src="https://www.kicad.org/img/icons/note.png" alt="Note"/>
</td>
<td>
Currently this integration only works on Windows and macOS, where
3Dconnexion provides official support. The KiCad team is exploring
integration with libspacenav to provide support for Linux and older
SpaceMouse products that are no longer supported by 3Dconnexion.

<div>
<h4 id="_sentry_crash_reporting_data_collection">Sentry Crash Reporting Data Collection</h4>
<p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> is an open source platform to capture application
events, crash dumps, and other analytics.</p>
<p>Both their <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">hosted platform</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native">integrated SDK</a> to handle crash
reporting in C++ applications are open source on GitHub under the MIT license.</p>
<p>Sentry has sponsored KiCad by providing the core team with access to their SaaS
platform to receive crash reports from KiCad users. During the Version 7
development cycle, KiCad has enabled <strong>opt-in</strong> Sentry crash reporting for
Windows users (we are exploring expanding Sentry to more platforms in a
future release). Users will be prompted once when KiCad is first started, and
may choose whether or not to enable Sentry. Users may also switch Sentry data
collection on or off at any time in the KiCad preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we want to collect data from users?</strong></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The primary use in KiCad will be to capture crash reports. If KiCad crashes,
the Sentry tool will automatically send a report to the KiCad team containing
information such as stack traces and core dumps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future we may also use it to gather performance metrics of algorithms
across the wider user base to answer questions such as &#34;how long does it take
on average to run the Fill All Zones command?&#34;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>What data is collected if Sentry is enabled?</strong></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A randomly-generated user ID (GUID) is created for each KiCad installation
and is used to identify Sentry reports that come from the same installation
(for example, if one user experiences a given crash three times).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This user ID can be reset at any time by the user through KiCad preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along with this user ID, Sentry collects crash dump information and extracts
relevant portions such as call stacks and stack frames. The rest of the
crash dump is discarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To aid in avoiding the collection of personally-identifying information
(PII), all Sentry reports pass through a &#34;sentry-relay&#34; server owned by KiCad
before being transmitted to the Sentry SaaS platform. This prevents user IP
addresses from being disclosed to Sentry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No KiCad design files are ever captured by Sentry.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>More details about Sentry in KiCad</strong></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new CMake variable, <code>KICAD_USE_SENTRY</code>, has been added where a
value of OFF will disable the inclusion of the Sentry SDK entirely. The
current default value is OFF, as only Windows support is tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sentry will only store at most 1 raw crash dump per report for analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data in Sentry is retained for up to 90 days, and then is deleted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The introduction of Sentry resolves a long-standing desire of the KiCad team
to capture crash dumps without user involvement, and the use of Sentry offers
us a very easy solution to do it and help make KiCad better for everyone.</p>
<p>Throughout the development of KiCad 7, the Sentry tool has already proven its
usefulness by allowing the development team to resolve over two dozen crash
bugs that were not previously reported by users. We look forward to this
feature allowing us to continuously improve KiCad’s reliability over time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_pcm_automatic_updates">PCM Automatic Updates</h4>
<p>The Plugin and Content Manager now can automatically check if an updated
version of an installed package is available and prompt the user to update.
Content. Each time KiCad is launched, the plugin status is automatically
queried in the background and displayed:</p>

<h4 id="_macos_apple_silicon_support">macOS Apple Silicon support</h4>
<p>KiCad now builds and can be packaged correctly as native Apple silicon
processors (M1, M2, etc). This means that KiCad no longer has to run in
emulation mode under the latest Apple hardware.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_command_line_interface">Command Line Interface</h4>
<p>The separate <code>kicad-cli</code> binary has been implemented to allow scripting of
many of the KiCad editor outputs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.kicad.org/img/blog/2022/cli.png" alt="cli"/>
</p>
<p>Figure 6. Command Line Interface with Help Invoked</p>
</div>
<p>The KiCad command line interface brings all the necessary functions to
automate export elements of schematic and pcb designs.</p>
<p>The currently available commands are:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>kicad-cli sch export bom
kicad-cli sch export python-bom
kicad-cli sch export netlist
kicad-cli sch export pdf
kicad-cli sch export svg
kicad-cli pcb export drill
kicad-cli pcb export dxf
kicad-cli pcb export gerber
kicad-cli pcb export gerbers
kicad-cli pcb export pdf

</div>
</div>
<p>You can use the <code>-h</code> argument to find out more about the command specific
options.</p>
<p>These changes have also enabled the STEP export to work headless on Linux,
unlike the original <code>kicad2step</code> binary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_schematic_and_symbol_editors">Schematic and Symbol Editors</h3>
<p>Support for a simple rectangle and circle primitives has been added to the
schematic and symbol editors to round out the shapes already provided.</p>
<div>

<h4 id="_orthogonal_dragging">Orthogonal Dragging</h4>
<p>What is orthogonal dragging? In 6.0 and earlier, a drag operation in the
Schematic Editor moves symbols while keeping wires attached to the symbol.
However, it was a literal form of &#34;attach&#34; and wires would end up at odd
angles and directions.</p>
<p>An example can be seen here of the old behavior:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.kicad.org/video_clips/blog/2022/v6-drag.gif" alt="v6 drag"/>
</p>
<p>Figure 8. Old Basic Dragging</p>
</div>
<p>Orthogonal dragging forces all wires to extend and move forming right angles
as expected for a schematic.</p>
<p>The new behavior is demonstrated in this animation:</p>

<h4 id="_symbol_editor_pin_table_enhancements">Symbol Editor Pin Table Enhancements</h4>
<p>The Symbol Editor Pin Table got a number of new features, including the ability
to:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Filter pins to a unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change unit of a pin from the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create or remove pins in a group symbol by adding/removing the pin number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the number of grouped pins.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_off_grid_erc_warnings">Off Grid ERC Warnings</h4>
<p>A new ERC check to warn when symbols are placed using an a incompatible grid.
A grid mismatch can lead to situations where connections are not truly made
and with a cascade of other issues such as pins being passive can lead to
scenarios where you end up producing bad PCBs.</p>

<h4 id="_wires_at_45_degree_angles">Wires at 45 Degree Angles</h4>
<p>KiCad 6 originally included a single toggle between fixed right-angle wires
and &#34;any angle&#34; mode. This change introduces a wire mode for 45 degree start
and end to help in drawing crisp schematics.</p>
<p>You can start drawing a wire and hit the key combination of <code>Shift + Spacebar</code>
to cycle between wire drawing modes. Icons on the left side toolbar indicate
the current mode.</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_do_no_populate_support">Do No Populate Support</h4>
<p>Support has been added for explicitly marking symbols in a schematic as
Do Not Populate (&#34;DNP&#34;). The resulting symbols are grayed out in the schematic
and marked with a red cross. DNP symbols are excluded from any KiCad-generated
placement files.</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_simulation_model_editor">Simulation Model Editor</h4>
<p>There is now a simulation model editor. This is a new dialog available as a
&#34;Simulation Model&#34; button in the symbol properties of any schematic symbol.
It allows configuration of simulation model parameters in a GUI rather than
spice text inserted on schematic. The resulting configuration gets passed
to the simulator as expected. Everything from configuring a symbol as &#34;standard&#34;
spice model (resistors,caps,diodes,bjts) to assigning custom models in libraries
(it will even load the library and let you select individual models contained
within) is supported. It also allows for customization of the schematic pin
to spice model pin mapping.</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_database_libraries">Database Libraries</h4>
<p>A long requested feature by many users of KiCad has been the ability to link
symbol selection to a database which is common in other schematic CAD tools.
KiCad can now add connectivity to external databases via ODBC functionality
across KiCad’s three main platforms.</p>
<p>The database library system allows creating a centralized database of symbol
to footprint associations along with any metadata about your parts that can
be shared across your schematics by you and others connected to the same
database.</p>

<p>An ongoing
<a href="https://forum.kicad.info/t/kicad-the-case-for-database-driven-design/34621">forum discussion</a>
about the feature shows how some users are starting to make use of databases
in their KiCad workflows.</p>
<div>
<h5 id="_dynamic_field_columns_in_symbol_chooser">Dynamic field columns in symbol chooser</h5>
<p>The database libraries support also introduced the ability to display and
search custom fields in the symbol chooser.</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_hyperlinks_on_schematics">Hyperlinks on Schematics</h4>
<p>Hyperlinks are now supported inside schematics. This means a text object on a
schematic page can detect if the text is a hyperlink property. Hyperlink text
makes the text object become clickable.</p>
<p>Supported hyperlinks are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>http://</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>file://</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_pdf_improvements">PDF Improvements</h4>
<div>
<h5 id="_pdf_bookmarks_table_of_contents">PDF Bookmarks (Table of Contents)</h5>
<p>Support has been added for populating the bookmarks section (also known as the
Table of Contents) of a PDF viewer with useful information.</p>
<p>A schematic PDF generated by the plot action in the schematic editor, will
contain bookmarks populated with a list of sheets and links to symbols within
the sheet. Clicking on items on the bookmark list will jump to the relevant
page and location.</p>
<div>

<div>
<h5 id="_embedded_symbol_information">Embedded Symbol Information</h5>
<p>Support has been added the export of symbol information in schematics to the
plotted PDF. This is a list of symbol field data displayed when the symbol
is clicked in a PDF viewer. Unfortunately, the functionality required for this
to work is implemented per PDF spec but support across PDF viewers is not
consistent. Only Adobe PDF Reader/Acrobat are known to display the list
correctly.</p>

<p>It is now possible completely unroute a footprint.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h5 id="_automatically_complete_trace_route">Automatically Complete Trace Route</h5>
<p>Traces can now be partially drawn and the board editor can complete the trace
the rest of the way to the nearest ratsnest end. It will stop and force you
to manually route if it can’t find a route.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h5 id="_attempt_to_finish_selection">Attempt to Finish Selection</h5>
<p>Related to the trace route completion feature above, selected items can in the
board editor can attempt to automatically route traces between them. It will
iterate each unrouted part of the item and attempt to connect it to the nearest
rats nest.</p>

<h4 id="_search_panel">Search Panel</h4>
<p>A new panel added to board editor enables typing query strings with wildcard
s and filtering out objects on the design while displaying the remaining results
in a list. The list can be clicked on to select objects on the editing canvas.</p>

</div>
<p>This panel allows quick access to many of the properties of objects, and allows
you to edit multiple objects at the same time. Access to more properties will
be added over time, and future KiCad releases will expand the properties panel
to the schematic and library editors.</p>

<h4 id="_improved_footprint_spread_and_pack_move_footprint_tool">Improved Footprint Spread and Pack &amp; Move Footprint Tool</h4>
<p>The algorithm that placed footprints on the PCB was improved to result in a
more compact layout.</p>
<p>Before the algorithm of this change:</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 28. Initial Footprint Placement with the New Algorithm</p>
</div>
<p>A powerful new tool was added that allows for a selection a logical portion of
a schematic in the schematic editor and with a new right click menu option or
the <code>P</code> hotkey in the board editor, selected symbol footprint can now use the
&#34;Pack and Move&#34; algorithm to create one compacted group rather than having to
manually locate and drag footprints in the board editor.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_step_exporter_changes">STEP Exporter Changes</h4>
<p>The STEP exporter now uses the same PCB parsing engine as the rest of KiCad.
This change now brings the addition relative 3d model paths to the footprint.
Simply start the paths with the expected ./ or ../ and the 3D viewer and STEP
exporter will attempt to find the model relative to the footprint file. This
change should allow better portability of footprint libraries and 3d models.</p>
<p>The &#34;3D Path Aliases&#34; have been removed from KiCad. These were an independent
system from the &#34;Environment Variable&#34; system also used for paths. It had it’s
own file format and usage syntax which both introduced unexpected bugs. Unifying
the system makes the usage of Environment Variables standard throughout KiCad.
&#34;3D Path Aliases&#34; will be automatically migrated to an environment variable on
launch. However, the alias may get renamed if the alias had characters beyond
uppercase A-Z,0-9 and underscores due to the limitations of environment
variables across platforms.</p>
