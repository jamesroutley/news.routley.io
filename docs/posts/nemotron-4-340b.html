    <h1>Nemotron-4-340B</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p dir="ltr">NVIDIA today announced Nemotron-4 340B, a family of open models that developers can use to generate synthetic data for training large language models (LLMs) for commercial applications across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail and every other industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">High-quality training data plays a critical role in the performance, accuracy and quality of responses from a custom LLM — but robust datasets can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through a uniquely permissive <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/licenses/nvidia-open-model-license-agreement-june-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open model license</a>, Nemotron-4 340B gives developers a free, scalable way to generate synthetic data that can help build powerful LLMs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Nemotron-4 340B family includes base, instruct and reward models that form a pipeline to generate synthetic data used for training and refining LLMs. The models are optimized to work with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NeMo</a>, an open-source framework for end-to-end model training, including data curation, customization and evaluation. They’re also optimized for inference with the open-source <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM</a> library.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nemotron-4 340B can be downloaded now from <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-666b7ebaf1b3867caf2f1911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugging Face</a>. Developers will soon be able to access the models at <a href="http://ai.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ai.nvidia.com</a>, where they’ll be packaged as an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA NIM</a> microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Navigating Nemotron to Generate Synthetic Data</h2>
<p dir="ltr">LLMs can help developers generate synthetic training data in scenarios where access to large, diverse labeled datasets is limited.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Instruct</a> model creates diverse synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data, helping improve data quality to increase the performance and robustness of custom LLMs across various domains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, to boost the quality of the AI-generated data, developers can use the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-4-340B-Reward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Reward</a> model to filter for high-quality responses. Nemotron-4 340B Reward grades responses on five attributes: helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity and verbosity. It’s currently first place on the <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench">Hugging Face RewardBench leaderboard</a>, created by <a href="https://allenai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI2</a>, for evaluating the capabilities, safety and pitfalls of reward models.</p>

An evaluator model, (2) Nemotron-4 340B Reward, then assesses this generated text — providing feedback that guides iterative improvements and ensures the synthetic data is accurate, relevant and aligned with specific requirements.</figcaption></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Researchers can also create their own instruct or reward models by customizing the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-4-340B-Base" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemotron-4 340B Base</a> model using their proprietary data, combined with the included <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpSteer2 dataset</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fine-Tuning With NeMo, Optimizing for Inference With TensorRT-LLM</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Using open-source NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, developers can optimize the efficiency of their instruct and reward models to generate synthetic data and to score responses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All Nemotron-4 340B models are optimized with TensorRT-LLM to take advantage of tensor parallelism, a type of model parallelism in which individual weight matrices are split across multiple GPUs and servers, enabling efficient inference at scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nemotron-4 340B Base, trained on 9 trillion tokens, can be customized using the NeMo framework to adapt to specific use cases or domains. This fine-tuning process benefits from extensive pretraining data and yields more accurate outputs for specific downstream tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A variety of customization methods are available through the NeMo framework, including supervised fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as low-rank adaptation, or LoRA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To boost model quality, developers can align their models with <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeMo Aligner</a> and datasets annotated by Nemotron-4 340B Reward. Alignment is a key step in training LLMs, where a model’s behavior is fine-tuned using algorithms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure its outputs are safe, accurate, contextually appropriate and consistent with its intended goals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses seeking enterprise-grade support and security for production environments can also access NeMo and TensorRT-LLM through the cloud-native <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform, which provides accelerated and efficient runtimes for generative AI foundation models.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Evaluating Model Security and Getting Started</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model underwent extensive safety evaluation, including adversarial tests, and performed well across a wide range of risk indicators. Users should still perform careful evaluation of the model’s outputs to ensure the synthetically generated data is suitable, safe and accurate for their use case.</p>
