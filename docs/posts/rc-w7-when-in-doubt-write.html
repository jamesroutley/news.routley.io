      <div><p>It&#39;s Week 7 at RC. It&#39;s great meeting the Spring 2 batch, and basking in the collective excitement. My advice for those who just joined is to write. Even if it&#39;s just one sentence, even if it&#39;s only for yourself.</p><p>This perhaps also applies to myself; I haven&#39;t been making as good notes this week which makes writing this post harder. Reminder to self to keep this consistent.</p><p>I started on CodeCrafters&#39; Build Your Own Docker module. I&#39;m reminded of excellent talks by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc">Liz Rice</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXWaECk9XqM">Bryan Cantrill</a> on the topic.</p><p>I thought about what I did in the first six weeks, and wrote a series of tweets on it. I&#39;m almost looking forward to my next RC batch so I can look back on this.</p><blockquote>
