			<h2>What is this?</h2>
						<p>
			You can edit/change the games in the list below. You can upload your own images, and even re-program the game play using
			<a href="https://canvaslanguage.com/showcase" target="_blank">SCL</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you&#39;ve made your new game, you can have it activated to run on a domain of your choice by visiting the
			<a href="https://playscl.com/publish" target="_blank">Publishing</a> page. For example, if you have an account a itch.io, you
			can activate your game for your itch page.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			This is a demo of how editable and customizing games work using <a href="https://canvaslanguage.com/" target="_blank">Canvas Language</a>. If you choose a game below, you&#39;ll be taken to a dev studio where you can edit your game
			and download a project file, for re-upload later.
