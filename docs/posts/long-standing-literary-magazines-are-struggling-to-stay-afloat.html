    <h1>Long-standing literary magazines are struggling to stay afloat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The Believer was once at the top of the literary magazine game.</p><p>A leading journal of art and culture, The Believer published the work of icons like Leslie Jamison, Nick Hornby and Anne Carson. It won awards, it launched careers -- it created a home for off-beat, quirky writing. When the Black Mountain Institute at the University of Nevada bought the magazine, observers spoke of Las Vegas as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/books/believer-black-mountain-institute-literary-las-vegas.html" target="_blank">potential new hub for literary arts</a>. </p><p>Then, in October of last year, the college announced it was shutting the magazine down in early 2022, citing the &#34;financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.&#34; In <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/announcement/black-mountain-institute-realigning-outreach-initiatives" target="_blank">a statement explaining</a> the decision, the dean of the school&#39;s College of Liberal Arts called print publications like The Believer &#34;a financially challenging endeavor.&#34;</p><p>The news came months after an incident where the editor in chief exposed himself during a video call with staff and subsequently resigned. Staffers&#39; complaints about him were also detailed in a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-08-18/joshua-wolf-shenk-nude-zoom-incident-complaints" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a> report.</p><p>Still, the announcement caused ripples throughout the literary world -- Jamison, known for her book of essays, &#34;The Empathy Exams,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/lsjamison/status/1450833624853622791" target="_blank">tweeted that she was &#34;heartbroken&#34;</a> over the news when it was announced. </p><p>The Believer&#39;s shuttering isn&#39;t isolated. Across the country, universities are slowly, quietly, cutting funding and shutting their literary publications down. Even magazines not connected to universities are closing their doors or changing publication strategies -- a trend made worse by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_298E7065-A10B-6F00-4565-D5512E8DA837"><h3>Colleges everywhere are cutting lit mags</h3></p><p>Literary magazines aren&#39;t exactly flashy -- they aren&#39;t covered in photos of beautiful people draped in designer clothing; they don&#39;t contain the latest celebrity tell-all. </p><p>But in the world of literary arts, they&#39;re essential. For early-career poets, essayists and fiction writers, these magazines are a way to get published, find an agent and get paid. They serve as a stepping stone -- no one, after all, just jumps into a book deal. Credits through literary magazines present a pathway. </p><p>In Jamison&#39;s tribute to The Believer, for example, she thanked the magazine for publishing her landmark essay &#34;Empathy Exams&#34; when nobody else would. (CNN reached out to staff at The Believer and Black Mountain Institute for comment, but did not receive a response.)</p><p>It&#39;s not just about career building, though. The magazines are a runway, where new literary styles are tested and emerge. New voices break through. If only large, established magazines continue to exist -- like The Paris Review or the New Yorker -- the diversity of the literary world will suffer, as Alaska Quarterly Review co-founder and editor-in-chief Ronald Spatz told CNN.</p><p>The Alaska Quarterly Review, which comes out of the University of Alaska Anchorage, is one of the country&#39;s smaller literary publications and also among the more notable ones. In print since 1980, it has published the early works of fiction powerhouses like Kate DiCamillo and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/entertainment/little-fires-everywhere-review/index.html" target="_blank">Celeste Ng</a>. </p><p>Then, in 2020, the University of Alaska system obliterated a slew of liberal arts disciplines <a href="https://www.alaska.edu/research/review/BOR%20ASA%20Consent%20Ag.%2012.B.%206.4.20.pdf" target="_blank">across multiple campuses</a> -- including Anchorage&#39;s MFA in Creative Writing, and a number of other programs ranging from sociology to geography. </p><p>The Alaska Quarterly Review was not spared, Spatz said, noting that while he had some money stockpiled from fundraising, the magazine still had to lay off its only employee -- who still stayed on as a volunteer. (The magazine&#39;s staff is made up of volunteers, he said.)</p><p>&#34;As soon as the pandemic hit and as soon as everything was cut because of the pandemic, I needed to kick it into high gear,&#34; Spatz said. </p><p>He applied for <a href="https://mellon.org/news-blog/articles/literary-arts-emergency-fund-awards-more-35-million-282-organizations-magazines-and-presses-across-us-historic-relief-effort/" target="_blank">emergency grants</a> and launched a fundraising series, and the publication has money for now. But AQR is a small operation, and the magazine&#39;s situation is &#34;existential,&#34; Spatz said.</p><p>&#34;We are fighting for our survival,&#34; he said. &#34;The situation right now is only going to get worse for us.&#34;</p><p>CNN reached out to the University of Alaska Anchorage for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220207134948-02-literary-magazines-antioch.jpg" alt="An issue of The Antioch Review is seen on February 7, 2022.

Eventually, there won&#39;t be enough to go around.</p><p>The trend is reverberating at many literary magazines tied to universities. The Antioch Review, for example, is currently on a pause while Antioch College &#34;continues to navigate the challenges related to COVID-19,&#34; <a href="https://antiochcollege.edu/antioch-review/" target="_blank">its website states</a>. The Review did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>The Sycamore Review, which currently operates out of Purdue University, is in similarly dire straits. Purdue University has made plans to <a href="https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_b04b6564-5772-11ec-8b9e-7f950e2bb4d0.html" target="_blank">defund the Creative Writing MFA program</a>, thus killing the Sycamore Review, which is entirely run by MFA students, in the process, said Blake Chernin, editor-in-chief of the Review and a current MFA candidate. The decision by the university, as it stands, is an existential threat to the magazine.</p><p>&#34;My personal feeling is that the Sycamore Review is in great danger,&#34; Chernin said. </p><p>Like Spatz with the Alaska Quarterly Review, Chernin and others at the Sycamore Review are working on plans to weather the storm for a few years. Meanwhile, their case has seen national attention. A petition to save the Creative Writing program and the magazine has <a href="https://www.change.org/p/purdue-college-of-liberal-arts-save-the-creative-writing-program-at-purdue" target="_blank">more than 9,000 signatures</a>, and the Association of Writers and Writing Programs has supported the cause, writing that it <a href="https://twitter.com/awpwriter/status/1471183958826180623" target="_blank">&#34;strongly opposes&#34;</a> Purdue&#39;s decision.</p><p>CNN reached out to Purdue University for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_CB2EA358-E6DF-85F8-083A-D55250C989EB"><h3>How lit mags went from being coveted to abandoned</h3></p><p>Money has always been the most difficult part of maintaining a literary magazine. In 2018, <a href="https://lithub.com/literary-magazines-are-born-to-die/" target="_blank">Literary Hub bluntly wrote</a>: &#34;Literary magazines are born to die.&#34; Even earlier, in 2011, poet Megan Garr <a href="http://versaljournal.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-1-to-100-was-always-going-to-fail.html" target="_blank">admonished the business model </a>of literary magazines, noting the impossible question editors must face: How to keep the magazines afloat when very little actual money is coming in.</p><p>And it&#39;s not just university-affiliated literary magazines that have been steadily dropping. Tin House, one of the most prestigious American literary magazines, attributed the 2019 shutdown of its print magazine <a href="https://tinhouse.com/on-the-closing-of-tin-house-magazine/" target="_blank">due to cost</a>. </p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no money in lit mags,&#34; said Travis Kurowski, a professor at York College who has studied literary publishing and its history. &#34;Someone has to do it for the love of it.&#34;</p><p>But there was a point, in the past, when literary magazines seemed like a valuable thing to invest in. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for example, bought The Believer voluntarily -- the magazine and its importance was seen <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/black-mountain-institute-new-home-believer-magazine" target="_blank">as an asset to the school. </a></p><p>That was a common trend after World War II, Kurowski explained. Universities were seeing a boom in students because of the GI Bill, and they wanted these literary magazines as a way to show their devotion to the arts and humanities. <a href="https://thesouthernreview.org/about" target="_blank">The Southern Review</a>, which was cultivated at Louisiana State University (before being shut down, and then being brought back again) was a point of pride for the school, just as an art gallery or a football team would be.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220207141702-04-literary-magazines-gi.jpg" alt="New students flooded universities after the implementing of the GI Bill. Here, a new crop of ex-soldier students receive supplies for a term."/></p><div><p>New students flooded universities after the implementing of the GI Bill. Here, a new crop of ex-soldier students receive supplies for a term.</p><!-- --> <p><span>Credit: </span><span>Bettmann/Getty Images</span></p></div></div></div><p>For a long time, this was a positive relationship, Kurowski said. Universities would fund these magazines, lengthening their lifespan, while adding a jewel to their theoretical crowns.</p><p>Most magazines were never long-term profitable, though some -- in a time before television -- did have high circulation. But with the advent of the internet, Kurowski said, came the expectation that writing should, and could, be free. Why pay for a literary magazine when you could read things for free online?</p><p>This brings us to the current moment. Whenever institutions need to scale back budgets, a literary magazine is an enticing thing to cut. These same conversations were happening during the financial crisis around 2008, Kurowski said.</p><p>And literary magazines aren&#39;t like murder mysteries or other mass market stories with broad appeal -- they don&#39;t fund themselves, Spatz said. There&#39;s an idea rising in higher education that the market should decide what gets funded, which then leaves more artistic pursuits like literary magazines out.</p><p>&#34;There is an absolute lack of understanding as to how essential the arts are, and the literary arts especially,&#34; Spatz said.</p><p>The cruciality of literary magazines -- and literary arts in general -- cannot be overstated, he argued. </p><p>&#34;[The literary arts] are so essential to just about everything. How we think, how we speak, who we are in terms of identity,&#34; Spatz said. &#34;And to let the market decide ... would in fact eliminate all kinds of diversity and stories and narratives.&#34;</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_7CB037A5-0E42-0606-CCDA-D55387499007"><h3>Change could be good for lit mags, others argue</h3></p><p>Even as magazines close, others argue that this moment isn&#39;t necessarily the end of literary magazines. Writing -- good writing, beautiful writing -- will always exist. We need it, said Elissa Schappell, who co-founded Tin House.</p><p>&#34;Human beings are animals that live through narrative. Nothing is going to replace that experience, that intimate relationship you have with a story or a poem or an essay,&#34; she told CNN. &#34;That&#39;s how we need to experience the world.&#34;</p><p>And who hasn&#39;t had that experience -- of a word, or phrase, or passage burrowing itself deep? The written word carries weight.</p><p>Given that, the idea that literary magazines will simply cease to exist is not one that Schappell buys. Culture changes, and it reinvents itself. At one time there were gramophones; now there&#39;s streaming. But music never went away.</p><p>&#34;Literary magazines need to change, they need to reflect the era we&#39;re living in,&#34; she said. &#34;But I don&#39;t think anything is ever going to replace that experience that happens between the reader and the text.&#34;</p><div><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220207141707-05-literary-magazines-schappell.jpg" alt="Vanesa Londoño, Elissa Schappell, Sigrid Nunez, and Tayari Jones attend The Ucross Foundation&#39;s Inaugural New York Gala &amp; Awards Dinner at Jazz at Lincoln Center in 2018.

There are more general interest magazines sprouting up, like Protean, a politics and art magazine founded in 2018. Others are online side projects shepherded by big-name writers, like Roxane Gay&#39;s briefly published Gay Magazine, or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/us/hanif-abdurraqib-macarthur-fellow-q-and-a-cec/index.html" target="_blank">Hanif Abdurraqib&#39;s</a> 68to05, launched in 2020.</p><p>And more and more, small online-only literary magazines like CALAMITY or X-R-A-Y pop up, looking specifically for all things weird and quirky. </p><p>The issue, of course, still lies in the money. Many of these smaller corners of the internet can&#39;t afford to pay writers, like a larger magazine with institutional funding can. And writers have to eat and pay bills, too.</p><p>Through crowdfunding, Protean is able to pay its contributors as well as keep its content free. But investors aren&#39;t always delighted by that business practice.</p><p>&#34;The path forward for independent magazines is to build a society that can offer a path forward for independent magazines: i.e., a society not monomaniacally driven by profit,&#34; said Tyler Walicek, editor-in-chief of Protean, via email. &#34;Devaluing the labor of writers, editors, and artists -- and continuing to subject all but the most fortunate to a grinding, alienating existence of low wages, high rents, and marginalization -- will ensure that the culture remains deprived of their contributions, and that media priorities continue to be determined by elite interests.&#34;</p><p>But in the grief, there&#39;s excitement, too, Schappell said. Even without a traditional literary magazine, there is still the continued discovery of new and emerging writers and ideas. </p><p>Just as the end of the gramophone didn&#39;t represent the end of music, the art will continue. It might even be better. </p></div></div></div>
