<p>Not long after I joined Creative Strategies in 1981, I received a call from IBM looking for forecasts on the PC market. At that time, the PC market was in its infancy, and it was anyone&#39;s guess then as to its future growth.</p>


<p>However, they had seen a quote I made to a major tech publication stating that I thought PCs could be a significant growth market and be transformational for the business market. I based that theory on my familiarity with the first spreadsheet product on the Apple II called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc" aria-label="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>. I saw how large companies bought Apple IIs and VisiCalc for their accounting departments. (Full disclosure- my wife worked for VisiCorp, the company that made VisiCalc; thus, my familiarity with the product was firsthand.) </p>

<p>That led to a set of research assignments from IBM, and for many years I worked with them on various projects related to the growth of the PC market at the product and channel level.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting programs I was asked to help with was the design of their original laptop in late 1985. At that time, IBM only made large PCs with separate monitors, mostly in battleship grey. </p>


<p>Earlier that year, at CEBIT, a major technology show in Hannover, Germany, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2810195/developing-toshiba-s-first-laptop.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2810195/developing-toshiba-s-first-laptop.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.computerworld.com/article/2810195/developing-toshiba-s-first-laptop.html" aria-label="Toshiba introduced">Toshiba introduced </a>what became the first actual commercial clamshell laptop design called the T100. </p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"></fbs-ad>
<p>I was at that CEBIT show and the launch of the T100, and I asked to &#34;borrow&#34; it to help me cover the show. Of course, Toshiba denied this request, although they did get me one to test once I was back in the U.S.</p>

<p>IBM was deeply interested in the Toshiba T100 design, and the IBM design group in Austin, TX asked me to consult on the project. So for about a year, I would go between Austin and Atlanta, where part of IBM&#39;s technical design was developed, and Boca Raton, where the marketing strategy was developed.</p>

<p>This led to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/transform/" target="_blank" title="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/transform/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/transform/" aria-label="IBM introducing the 5140">IBM introducing the 5140</a> in 1986. </p>

<p>This first product was still in the luggable category of personal computers, but soon after it was released, IBM launched its first series of clamshell-based laptops. IBM&#39;s first clamshell </p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>IBM PS/2 L40 SX - IBM&#39;s first &#34;clamshell&#34;</p></fbs-accordion><small>IBM</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2_Model_L40_SX" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2_Model_L40_SX" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2_Model_L40_SX" aria-label="IBM PS/2 Model L40 SX.">IBM PS/2 Model L40 SX. </a></p>
<p>Most of IBM&#39;s earliest models had only minor success until 1992, when IBM introduced its first line of ThinkPad models.</p>
<p>In 1988, the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2017/10/16/meet-the-father-of-the-thinkpad-laptop.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2017/10/16/meet-the-father-of-the-thinkpad-laptop.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2017/10/16/meet-the-father-of-the-thinkpad-laptop.html" aria-label="father of the ThinkPad, Arimasa Naitoh">father of the ThinkPad, Arimasa Naitoh</a>, a Lenovo Fellow located in Japan, received a call about the need to spearhead a new portable computing venture in IBM&#39;s research center in Yokohama, Japan. At the time, he was based in White Plains, NY but moved back to Japan to develop what has become the iconic ThinkPad line of portable computers. </p>
<p>I got to watch the development of the ThinkPad from the beginning. Mr Naitoh&#39;s leadership, assisted by <a href="https://www.idsa.org/members/hill-david-lenovo-corp" target="_blank" title="https://www.idsa.org/members/hill-david-lenovo-corp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.idsa.org/members/hill-david-lenovo-corp" aria-label="David Hill">David Hill</a>, who was instrumental in creating the unique ThinkPad design, made IBM at that time one of the most important portable computer companies in the market. </p>
<p>This chart shows the design history of the Thinkpad and why it is still a big part of Lenovo&#39;s success in portable computing:</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>A visual history of ThinkPad&#39;s design</p></fbs-accordion><small>Lenovo</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under IBM&#39;s leadership, the ThinkPad became one of the best-selling laptops in the enterprise. Still, from its introduction to when Lenovo bought IBM&#39;s PC business in 2005, they had only sold 25 million ThinkPads.</p>
<p>However, the ThinkPad&#39;s growth under Lenovo&#39;s leadership has been remarkable. Today, Lenovo has sold over 200 million ThinkPads, and the company continues to innovate around the ThinkPad design to improve it. Although many key players inside Lenovo had a significant impact on ThinkPad&#39;s growth, its most considerable thrust and success came under the leadership of Dilip Bhatia, Vice President of Global Marketing, User and Customer Experience, and former Vice President and General Manager of ThinkPad. </p>
<p>A great example of their innovative design and thinking comes with their new line of foldable ThinkPads called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuFRjIxypYQ" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuFRjIxypYQ" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuFRjIxypYQ" aria-label="ThinkPad X1 Fold">ThinkPad X1 Fold</a>. </p>
<p>Although foldable technology is still in its infancy, Lenovo&#39;s willingness to blaze new trails with new and innovative designs has been the trademark of Lenovo&#39;s design teams since they first introduced the line of ThinkPads in 1992. </p>
<p>Watching the overall growth of the mobile computing market, especially the birth and evolution of the ThinkPad, has given me a deeper appreciation for the men and women who worked so hard to make portable computing the largest PC market today. And the Lenovo team has played a major role in helping the mobile computing industry grow exponentially over that last few decades.</p>
<p>For those interested in the history of the ThinkPad, I recommend Mr. Naitoh&#39;s book on the subject-</p>
