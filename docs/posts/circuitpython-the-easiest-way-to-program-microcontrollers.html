      <h2>More reasons to use CircuitPython</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>Quick and Easy</h3>
          <p>
            Create a file, edit your code, save the file, and it runs immediately.
            There is no compiling or uploading needed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Beginner Friendly</h3>
          <p>
            CircuitPython is designed with education in mind. It&#39;s an easy way to start
            learning how to code and you get immediate feedback from the board.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Easy Code Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Since your code lives on the disk drive, you can edit it whenever you
            like. You can even keep multiple files around for easy experimentation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serial Console + REPL</h3>
          <p>
            These features allow for live feedback from your code and interactive programming.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>File Storage</h3>
          <p>
            The internal storage for CircuitPython makes it great for data-logging,
            playing audio clips, and otherwise interacting with files.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Strong Hardware Support</h3>
          <p>
            There are many libraries and drivers for sensors, breakout boards
            and other external components.
          </p>

      <h2>CircuitPython is based on Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python is the fastest growing programming language. It&#39;s taught in schools
        and universities. It&#39;s a high-level programming language which means it&#39;s
        designed to be easier to read, write and maintain. It supports modules and
        packages which means it&#39;s easy to reuse your code for other projects. It
        has a built in interpreter which means there are no extra steps, like
        compiling, to get your code to work. And of course, Python is Open Source
        Software which means it&#39;s free for anyone to use, modify or improve upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        CircuitPython adds hardware support to all of these amazing features. If you
        already have Python knowledge, you can easily apply that to using CircuitPython.
        If you have no previous experience, it&#39;s really simple to get started!

      <h2>CircuitPython libraries on single board computers</h2>
      <p>
        Most CircuitPython libraries also work on <a href="https://circuitpython.org/blinka">single board computers (SBCs)</a>, such as the Raspberry Pi.
        Linux runs &#34;desktop&#34; Python (commonly known as CPython) instead of CircuitPython.
        Our CPython Blinka library provides CircuitPython&#39;s low level hardware APIs, such as `digitalio`.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blinka and CircuitPython libraries are just a `pip install` away.

      <h2>Thanks</h2>
      <p>
         CircuitPython wouldn&#39;t exist without the awesome work of
         <a href="https://micropython.org">Damien George and the MicroPython community</a>.
         They did the hard work to reimplement Python on microcontrollers and
         continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you to <a href="https://www.adafruit.com">Adafruit</a> for
        continuing to support CircuitPython&#39;s beginner-focused development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, thank you to the CircuitPython community members who have spent
        time testing, triaging, fixing and enhancing CircuitPython, its libraries
        and its documentation. Together we&#39;re all making something incredible.
