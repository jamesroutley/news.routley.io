<p>Google has agreed to stop advertising YouTube TV as &#34;$600 less than cable&#34; after losing an appeal of a previous ruling that went against the company. Google said it will &#34;modify or cease the disputed advertising claim.&#34;</p>
<p>The case was handled in the advertising industry&#39;s self-regulatory system, not in a court of law. The National Advertising Review Board (NARB) <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/narb-google-youtube-tv">announced today</a> that it rejected Google&#39;s appeal and recommended that the company discontinue the YouTube TV claim.</p>
<p>YouTube TV launched in 2017 for $35 a month, but the base package is $72.99 after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/youtube-tv-jumps-in-price-again-its-now-72-99-per-month/">latest price hike</a> in March 2023. Google&#39;s &#34;$600 less than cable&#34; claim was challenged by Charter, which uses the brand name Spectrum and is the second-biggest cable company after Comcast. The National Advertising Division (NAD) previously ruled in Charter&#39;s favor but Google <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/google-youtube-tv">appealed the decision</a> to the NARB in August.</p>
<p>&#34;Charter contended the $600 figure was inaccurate, arguing that its Spectrum TV Select service in Los Angeles only cost around $219 a year more than Google&#39;s YouTube TV service,&#34; according to a <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388447/youtube-tv-told-to-stop-boasting-it-costs-600-les.html">MediaPost article</a> in August.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g3WtdwtIok&amp;t">Google ad</a> claimed that YouTube TV provided $600 in &#34;annual average savings&#34; compared to cable as of January 2023. A disclosure on the ad said the price was for &#34;new users only&#34; and that the $600 annual savings was &#34;based on a study by SmithGeiger of the published cost of comparable standalone cable in the top 50 Nielsen DMAs, including all fees, taxes, promotion pricing, DVR box rental and service fees, and a 2nd cable box.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Disclosures “not clear and conspicuous”</h2>
<p>Agreeing with the NAD decision, an NARB panel found that the price comparison provided by Google did not justify the &#34;$600 less&#34; claim. The panel &#34;determined that the commercial disclosures were not clear and conspicuous&#34; and &#34;concluded that at least one reasonable interpretation of the challenged claim is that YouTube TV is $600 less than any comparable service available from companies traditionally associated with cable services.&#34;</p>
<p>The NARB also said that Google&#39;s &#34;comparison does not align with the challenged claim&#34; for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many households can subscribe to basic Spectrum service without renting cable boxes, therefore Google failed to justify the cost of two set-top boxes in its price comparison, and</li>
<li>In certain markets, cable providers offer regional sports networks (RSNs) but YouTube does not, therefore Google did not have a valid reason for adding the cost of Spectrum&#39;s Sports View option to the price comparison.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The NARB announcement quotes Google&#39;s response in which it agreed to stop making the advertising claim. Google said it &#34;disagrees with NARB&#39;s determination that people watching the challenged commercials will somehow understand &#39;cable&#39; to mean something other than traditional cable television,&#34; but &#34;intends to modify or cease the disputed advertising claim.&#34; Google also said that at a later date, it &#34;may reconsider the claim based on updated information.&#34;</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars today, Google said it had no further comment.</p>
