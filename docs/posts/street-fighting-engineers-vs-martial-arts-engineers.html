    <h1>Street Fighting Engineers vs Martial Arts Engineers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>I have worked with 2 types of 10x engineers so far.</p><ul><li><p>Martial Artists</p></li><li><p>Street fighters</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>They are specialists in specific problem domains like scaling backends, optimising web/app performances, improving search etc.</p></li><li><p>They take an artistic pride in their skill and pursue it for its own sake.</p></li><li><p><span>They usually want to be left alone with the specific problem. So, they shine in a sanitised work environment. An environment where the rest of the problem  space </span><strong>(business, adoption etc)</strong><span> is abstracted away from them.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>A sanitised work environment:</strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Like in combat sports, a sanitised work environment needs </span><strong>referees</strong><span> (managers) who keep score and reward accordingly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>There are basic ground rules </span><strong>(clear requirements)</strong><span> which the opponents </span><strong>(problems)</strong><span> are NOT allowed to break. eg: below the belt punches, </span><strong>(changing priorities every week)</strong><span> etc. </span></p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>They are generalist problem solvers and have a more well rounded skill set like Fullstack engineering, product ownership, people skills etc.</p></li><li><p><span>They are attached to the skill to the extent that it is useful to survive  </span><strong>( solve a problem).</strong><span> </span></p></li><li><p><span>They are motivated by survival </span><strong>(product’s survival or company’s itself)</strong><span> and a reputation in a closed group.</span></p></li><li><p>They have a good understanding of the nearby environment and will take advantage anything that can help them.</p></li><li><p> A sanitised environment will mean limiting their advantage. They thrive in a more uncertain work environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>An uncertain work environment:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Like in street fights, there is no one over seeing your work closely and the cost of slacking off can be fatal.</p></li><li><p><span>There is no guarantee of opponent sticking to the rule book </span><strong>(problems arising outside your domain like alignment, adoption)</strong><span> and they too will take a cheap shot or leverage the environment when needed </span><strong>(hacky implementations, launching quick v1 with ops etc)</strong><span>.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Ask yourself the following:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Do you have a reasonably predictable roadmap for next 6-12 months.</p></li><li><p>Do you have an effective and stable management in place which takes care of career and personal growth of the engineers.</p></li><li><p>Do you have a scaling problem or a technically challenging system to refactor or maintain.</p></li></ul><p>if you have answered NO to more than 1 question above, you need a street fighter.</p><ul><li><p><span>Martial Artists can have demonstrable honours like belts (</span><strong>open source contributions</strong><span>, </span><strong>recognisable works in recognisable organisations, proud technical achievements etc. ).</strong><span> They may even have skill/technology name in their title with a decent work experience.</span></p></li><li><p>The street fighters mostly have scars and reputation in closed groups. To find them you have to talk to folks in that closed group.</p></li><li><p>Both are equally valuable and rare.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Engineers can also be anywhere in the spectrum between these two types.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
