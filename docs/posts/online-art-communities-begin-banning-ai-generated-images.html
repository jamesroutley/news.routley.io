    <h1>Online art communities begin banning AI-generated images</h1>

<p>As AI-generated art platforms like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion explode in popularity, online communities devoted to sharing human-generated art are forced to make a decision: should AI art be allowed?</p>

<p>On Sunday, popular furry art community Fur Affinity <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/journal/10321622">announced</a> that AI-generated art was not allowed because it ‚Äúlacked artistic merit.‚Äù (In July, one AI furry porn generator was uploading <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ggqq/this-furry-porn-ai-generator">one image every 40 seconds</a> before it was banned.) Their new guidelines are very clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>Content created by artificial intelligence is not allowed on Fur Affinity.</p><p>AI and machine learning applications (DALL-E, Craiyon) sample other artists‚Äô work to create content. That content generated can reference hundreds, even thousands of pieces of work from other artists to create derivative images.</p><p>Our goal is to support artists and their content. We don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs in our community‚Äôs best interests to allow AI generated content on the site.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the 27-year-old art/animation portal Newgrounds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210828003313/https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/terms-of-use/art-guidelines">banned</a> images made with <a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/">Artbreeder</a>, a tool for ‚Äúbreeding‚Äù GAN-generated art. Late last month, Newgrounds <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/terms-of-use/art-guidelines">rewrote their guidelines</a> to explicitly disallow images generated by new generation of AI art platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>AI-generated art is not allowed in the Art Portal. This includes using tools such as Midjourney, Dall-E, and Craiyon, in addition fractal generators and websites like ArtBreeder, where the user selects two images and they are combined into a new image via machine learning.</p><p>There are cases where some use of AI is ok, for example if you are primarily showcasing your character art but use an AI-generated background. In these cases, please note any elements where AI was used so that it is clear to users and moderators.</p><p>Tracing and coloring over AI-generated art is something best shared on your blog, as it is much like tracing over someone else‚Äôs art.</p><p>Bottom line: <strong>We want to keep the focus on art made by people and not have the Art Portal flooded with computer-generated art.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs not just long-running online communities: <a href="https://inkblot.art/">InkBlot</a> is a budding art platform funded on Kickstarter in 2021 that went into open beta just this week. They‚Äôve already taken a ‚Äúno tolerance‚Äù policy against AI art, and updating their terms of service to exclude it.</p>

<p>Platforms that haven‚Äôt taken a stand are now facing public pressure to clarify their policies. </p>
<p>DeviantArt is one of the most popular online art communities, and increasingly, members are complaining that their feeds are getting flooded with AI-generated art. One of the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/forum/art/general/2679051/">most popular threads</a> in their forums right now asks the staff to ‚Äúcombat AI art‚Äù by limiting daily uploads, either by segregating it under a special category or to ban it entirely.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/DeviantArt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DeviantArt</a> You were kind of the last art site dedicated to art, but everyday I check the site now more and more its Ai. 10 out of 25 on your front page is Ai gen images. I guess this actually might be the end of a lot of art sites? I hope someone steps in and makes a new site <a href="https://t.co/1Kez5FFQQF">pic.twitter.com/1Kez5FFQQF</a></p>‚Äî Zakuga Art (@ZakugaMignon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakugaMignon/status/1567280766471512066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>ArtStation has also been quiet as AI-generated images grow in popularity there. ‚ÄúTrending on ArtStation‚Äù is one of the most popular prompts for AI art because of the particular aesthetic and quality of work found there, which nudges the AI to generate work scraped from it, leading to a future ouroboros where AI models will be trained on AI-generated art found there.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time I go to DA or Artstation these days the front pages are flooded with unmodified AI generated slop. Its ugly and makes the sites feel lesser. I go to these places to be inspired, not demoralized.</p>‚Äî RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1568076247200313345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>However you feel about the <a href="https://waxy.org/2022/08/opening-the-pandoras-box-of-ai-art/">ethics of AI art</a>, online art communities are facing a very real problem of scale: AI art can be created orders of magnitude faster than traditional human-made art. A powerful GPU can generate thousands of images an hour, even while you sleep.</p>
<p><a href="https://lexica.art/">Lexica</a>, a search engine that solely indexed images from Stable Diffusion‚Äôs beta tests in Discord, has over 10 million images in it. It would take a lifetime to explore everything in it, a corpus made by a relatively small group of beta testers in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Left unchecked, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine AI art crowding out illustrations that took days or weeks for someone to make.</p>
<p>To keep their communities active, community admins and moderators will have to decide what to do with AI art: allow it, segregate it, or ban it entirely.</p>
