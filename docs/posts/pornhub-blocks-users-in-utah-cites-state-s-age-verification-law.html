    <h1>PornHub blocks users in Utah, cites state’s age verification law</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                        <p>SALT LAKE CITY — PornHub has blocked access to users from Utah that wish to view their content. </p>
<p>In a video message displayed on the site, a spokeswoman for PornHub said that legislative action taken during the 2023 Utah Legislative Session has prompted the company to block access to Utahns.</p>
<p>“Giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users,” the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>According to the bill’s description, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/SB0287.html"> S.B. 287 Online Pornography Viewing Age Requirements</a> imposes “obligations and liabilities for a commercial entity that provides pornography or other materials harmful to minors.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the bill requires a porn site to verify that a user in Utah is at least 18 years old. It also “imposes liability for publishers and distributors of material harmful to minors” who don’t comply with the age verification requirement.</p>
<p>S.B. 287 was signed into law by Gov. Cox on March 14, 2023. It take affect May 3, 2023.</p>
<p>As the law is written now, a website like PornHub that does not verify a user’s age “shall be liable for damages resulting from a minor’s accessing the material including court costs and reasonable attorney fees as ordered by the court.”</p>
<p>According to the spokeswoman, requiring ID isn’t an effective way to protect users. Instead, she said such a requirement puts children and privacy at risk. Specifically, according to PornHub, requiring identification will “drive traffic to sites with fewer safety measures.”</p>
<p>PornHub said that a better solution is to identify users by their device.</p>
