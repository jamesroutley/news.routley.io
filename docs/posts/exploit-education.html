    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="body"><div><div id="body-inner"><p>exploit.education provides a variety of resources that can be used to learn
about vulnerability analysis, exploit development, software debugging, binary
analysis, and general cyber security issues.</p><h2 id="virtual-machines-available">Virtual machines available</h2><h3 id="nebula">Nebula</h3><p><a href="https://exploit.education/nebula/">Nebula</a> covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that
cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file
system race conditions.</p><p>Nebula is an ideal place to get started for people new to Linux exploitation.</p><h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3><p><a href="https://exploit.education/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> introduces basic memory corruption issues such as buffer
overflows, format strings and heap exploitation under “old-style” Linux system
that does not have any form of modern exploit mitigation systems enabled. It
has both 32 bit and 64 bit levels available, for both X86 and ARM systems.</p><p>Phoenix is the next progression from Nebula.</p><h3 id="fusion">Fusion</h3><p><a href="https://exploit.education/fusion/">Fusion</a> continues the memory corruption, format strings and heap
exploitation but this time focusing on more advanced scenarios and modern
protection systems.</p><p>Fusion is the place to start if you are familiar with Linux exploitation and
wish to learn more about exploitation prevention systems.</p><h3 id="main-sequence">Main Sequence</h3><p><a href="https://exploit.education/main-sequence/">Main Sequence</a> is the Capture The Flag event from Ruxcon
2012. It provides a variety of challenges such as penetration tool usage,
binary analysis, basic cryptographic analysis, client side exploitation,
password cracking and general website hacking.</p><h3 id="protostar">Protostar</h3><p><a href="https://exploit.education/protostar/">Protostar</a> has effectively been replaced by <a href="https://exploit.education/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> - it is kept
here for archival reasons. Protostar introduces basic memory corruption issues
such as buffer overflows, format strings and heap exploitation under
“old-style” Linux system that does not have any form of modern exploit
mitigation systems enabled.</p></div></div></section></div>
