<p>As of late 2017, there were almost 85,000 &#34;uncleared&#34; levels in the original Wii U <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/super-mario-maker-not-everyone-can-be-miyamoto-but-everyone-can-try/"><em>Super Mario Maker</em></a> (<em>SMM</em>)—levels that had never been beaten by anyone except for their original uploaders. As of this writing, a group of persistent players gathered under the banner of <a href="https://twitter.com/Team0Percent">&#34;Team 0%&#34;</a> has spent years narrowing the list of uncleared levels to a single entry—a devious, <em>Super Mario World</em>-styled Bob-omb bounce-and-throw gauntlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siz4oB4CGKo">named &#34;Trimming the Herbs&#34;</a> (the second-to-last uncleared level went down on Thursday, March 14, as noted on <a href="https://www.issmmbeatenyet.com/#stats">the excellent &#34;Is SMM Beaten Yet?&#34; tracker</a>).</p>
<p>Given enough time, Team 0% would undoubtedly be able to bring down <em>SMM</em>&#39;s &#34;final boss,&#34; as it were. But the collective effort to finally and completely &#34;beat&#34; <em>SMM</em> has an external deadline: April 8, the day Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/wii-u-3ds-online-servers-to-shut-down-in-six-months/">it plans to finally shut down the aging Wii U&#39;s gameplay servers</a>.</p>
<p>The next three weeks will determine whether Team 0% can live up to its moniker or if this one final level will leave the team just short of its ultimate achievement. &#34;I’d never think we would be this close to actually achieving this goal,&#34; Team 0% founder Jeffie told Ars Technica recently. &#34;How often does a community of gamers do something like this?&#34;</p>
<h2>“An incredibly stupid idea”</h2>
<p><em>Super Mario Maker</em>&#39;s dramatic final race against the clock started in September 2017 when player The0dark0one scraped Nintendo server data to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioMaker/comments/6xsan9/the_top_149733_levels_with_the_lowest_clear_rate/">create a definitive list of then-uncleared levels</a>. A few months later, around Christmas time, Jeffie stumbled on that Reddit-posted list and &#34;had an incredibly stupid idea,&#34; as he recently put it to Ars Technica. &#34;What if we clear everything?&#34;</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOTvgEPC77k?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Attention from popular streamers helped Team 0% attract new recruits to the cause.</p></figcaption></figure>
                                            
                                                        <p>After pitching the idea on a general <em>Super Mario Maker</em> server, Jeffie gathered a few other players willing to join the effort <a href="https://discord.gg/team0percent">on a fresh Discord server</a>. Rather than just picking through the tens of thousands of uncleared levels randomly, the newly assembled team at first aimed for a more manageable target: the ~13,000 uncleared levels that had been uploaded in 2015, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/super-mario-maker-not-everyone-can-be-miyamoto-but-everyone-can-try/">the game&#39;s first calendar year</a>.
</p><p>&#34;At the time, it seemed like a challenging yet realistic goal,&#34; Team 0% administrator (and early participant) Black60Dragon told Ars.</p>
<p>Those 2015 level uploads &#34;were pretty interesting because it was right at the start of the game,&#34; he added. &#34;There weren&#39;t many difficult [gameplay] techniques invented yet, there weren&#39;t established &#39;level building rules.&#39;&#34; The early levels &#34;had a lot of awkward setups, trolls, etc, from people just experimenting. There were also a lot more glitch levels back then before Nintendo patched a lot of them out.&#34;</p>
<p>Amazingly, the new Team 0% was able to blast through all 13,000 uncleared 2015 levels in just eight months. But by that point, the team had to contend with thousands of <em>newer</em> uncleared levels that had been uploaded while they were clearing the backlog. At the time, the task resembled <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/stables.html">the cleaning of the Augean stables</a>, but with a team of horses continually pooping faster than any mortal could shovel.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;Some people thought it was a dumb idea for a long time and didn’t join until much later.&#34;</p><p><span>Team 0% founder Jeffie</span></p></blockquote>
<p>That began to change in March 2021 when Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/support/articles/super-mario-maker-for-wii-u-discontinuations-faq">cut off new uploads of original <em>Mario Maker</em> levels</a> (while still allowing play of existing levels). That&#39;s when &#39;&#34;things really got serious,&#34; Black60Dragon said, as the large-but-no-longer-growing heap of levels made the idea of fully &#34;beating&#34; <em>Super Mario Maker</em> a static and achievable goal.</p>
<p>&#34;At first it was just a small handful of people, but the closer we got to the goal and the more realistic it looked, the more people started wanting to [join] in,&#34; Black60Dragon said. Over time, <a href="https://youtu.be/lOTvgEPC77k?si=CGsx4fe3DqxHrM0m">attention</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GydctP3DfW0">popular streamers</a> would also help attract more attention to the Team 0% effort.</p>
<p>&#34;Some people thought it was a dumb idea for a long time and didn’t join until much later,&#34; Jeffie added.</p>
