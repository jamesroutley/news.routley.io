<p>If you are on LinkedIn, you might have come across users complaining about the platform using their data to train a generative AI tool without their consent.</p><p>People began noticing this change in the settings on Wednesday, September 18, when the Microsoft-owned social media platform started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/linkedin-is-already-training-its-ai-on-user-data-says-it-will-update-tos-soon" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/linkedin-is-already-training-its-ai-on-user-data-says-it-will-update-tos-soon">training its AI on user data before</a> updating its terms and conditions.</p><p>LinkedIn certainly isn&#39;t the first social media platform to begin scraping user data to feed an AI tool without asking for consent beforehand. What&#39;s curious about the LinkedIn AI saga is the decision to exclude the EU, EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), and Switzerland. Is this a sign that only EU-like privacy laws can fully protect our privacy?</p><h2 id="the-eu-backlash-against-ai-training-3">The EU backlash against AI training</h2><p>Before LinkedIn, both Meta (the parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and X (formerly known as Twitter) started to use their users&#39; data to train their newly launched AI models. While these social media giants initially extended the plan also to European countries, they had to halt their AI training after encountering strong backlash from EU privacy institutions. </p><p>Let&#39;s go in order. The first to test out the waters were Facebook and Instagram back in June. According to their new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">privacy policy</a> – which came into force on June 26, 2024 – the company can now use years of personal posts, private images, or online tracking data to train its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/meta-ai-is-coming-to-your-social-media-apps-and-ive-already-forgotten-about-chatgpt" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/meta-ai-is-coming-to-your-social-media-apps-and-ive-already-forgotten-about-chatgpt">Meta AI</a>.</p><div><p>Did you know?</p><div><figure><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-pin-nopin="true"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-320-80.jpg" alt="A phone on a table showing the Facebook and Instagram logos" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLMRH4VGU8XKoVHDFjj4d.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock / mundissima)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-admits-it-has-scraped-all-facebook-posts-since-2007-to-train-ai" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-admits-it-has-scraped-all-facebook-posts-since-2007-to-train-ai">admitted</a> to having used people&#39;s public posts to train AI models as far back as 2007.</p></div></div><p>After Austria&#39;s digital rights advocacy group <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-urges-11-dpas-immediately-stop-metas-abuse-personal-data-ai" target="_blank" data-url="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-urges-11-dpas-immediately-stop-metas-abuse-personal-data-ai" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Noyb filed 11 privacy complaints</a> to various Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in Europe, the Irish DPA requested that the company pause its plans to use EU/EEA users&#39;
