<p><b><SPAN size="+3">What things cost in Ancient Rome</SPAN></b>
</p></center>

<p><SPAN size="+1">When studying Ancient Rome, it is only natural to wonder
what the price of everyday items might have been.Â  In order to fully
understand the price of an item, you must also consider the wages workers
received at the time the item was purchased.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Before you study the information below, it is helpful
to understand that professions were valued differently in ancient times
than they are today.Â  Likewise, the value of items was different then
than now.Â  For instance, in today’s world, one might spend 20% of
their total income on food, but in ancient times the cost may have been
50% or more of one’s total income.Â  In fact, during parts of the history
of Rome, food costs were so high that without free wheat subsidies from
the government, the common people would not have been able to survive!Â 
These subsidies were known as ‘doles’ and according to AEJ Morris’s History
of Urban Form [1970 George Godwin LTD], up to 1/3 of the citizens of the
capital city received this public assistance.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Grain formed the foundation of the common Roman’s diet.Â 
It was not uncommon for grain to be the only thing a poor Roman ever ate.Â 
The cost of baking bread was very high to a poor Roman, so if no access
to a communal, public oven could be had, the grain would be crushed and
made into a porridge known as ‘puls’ that was likely similar in taste and
texture to modern polenta.Â  While we take it for granted today, meat
was an extravagant luxury that most Romans could not afford to indulge
in.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Clothing was another expensive proposition.Â  One
‘libra’ (Roman pound, just under Â¾ of a modern pound -Â  326
grams), of fine silk cost more than a dozen human beings.Â  It seems
absurd to us today, but such was the case, because Ancient Romans lacked
the production machines of today that make cheap fabric possible.Â 
For the commoners, fashion was not a consideration- clothing was utilitarian,
had to be durable, and was patched until finally the garment became the
thing from which patches were taken for its replacement.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Historically, the cost of living has expanded to consume
all of the income that is available to the majority of the people in the
society.Â  As technology has enabled faster production, technology
has also introduced new things to consume the income the increased productivity
creates.Â  The ancient Romans did not have many things to pay for in
comparison to life today, yet it was every bit as much a struggle for them
to survive as it is today- and probably, it was even more of a struggle
for them.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">As you read the data below, consider what you might have
been in Ancient Rome.Â  Would you have been a carpenter?Â  A mason?Â 
Would you have been fortunate enough to receive an education and become
an advocate (ancient equivalent of the modern lawyer)?Â  Pick your
profession, and then take a look at the kind of food and clothing you would
have been able to afford.Â  You might gain a new appreciation for modern
life!</SPAN>
</p><p><b><SPAN size="+1">All the prices and wages are listed in denarii communes,
which were not actually silver denarii as we usually think of when discussing
ancient Roman coinage.Â  Denarii communes, or d.c., were notational
currency.Â  What this means is, an exchange rate was given, telling
how much of the currency in circulation at that time (nummii) it took to
equal one d.c.Â  This made it easy to change the value of the money
in circulation, without having to rewrite and redistribute the entire Edict.Â 
A series of exchange tables are at the end of this page.</SPAN></b>

</p><p><SPAN size="+1">A teacher in ancient Rome would have lived in the home
of a wealthy patrician, who would have provided the teacher with food and
clothing appropriate to the house.Â  The teacher would not have had
much spending money, but would have lived comfortably just the same.Â 
These are salaries in denarii per month, per student.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">elementary teacher ..............................................................................................50</SPAN>
</p><p><b><SPAN size="+1">Soldiers in Ancient Rome</SPAN></b>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Soldiering was one of the best ways a Roman male could
provide for his family.Â  The base wage was low, not enough to live
on.Â  Four times a year, a soldier received a “Donative” greater than
his annual base pay.Â  Additionally, soldiers received an annual “Annona”
subsidy for grain purchases.Â  The best soldiers hoped to be recruited
to the Praetorian Guard, the soldiers who guarded the Emperor.Â  These
soldiers were paid roughly 3 times the base wage of the average soldier,
and likely enjoyed many additional privileges as well.</SPAN>
</p><p><SPAN size="+1">Soldiers had high expenses in their profession, but they
still came out much better than the average citizen even after expenses.Â 
The soldiers were expected to pay for much of their own equipment, rations,
and clothing.Â  They even had to pay part of the cost of burial for
their fallen from their unit.</SPAN>

<p><SPAN size="+1">The Edict of Maximum Prices was an attempt to control
runaway inflation and poverty in the Empire.Â  The penalty for exceeding
the prices of the Edict was severe: death.Â  Not satisfied to execute
just the seller, Diocletian decreed that the buyer was to be executed as
well.Â  As a final measure, if a seller refused to sell his goods at
the stated price, the penalty was death.</SPAN>
