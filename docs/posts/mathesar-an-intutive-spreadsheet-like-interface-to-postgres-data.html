    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, January 29, 2025</em></p><p>A while back I wrote (<a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-03-01/">post 1</a>, <a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-03-02/">post 2</a>) about how TagTime (and the then-called TinyPing) analyze time by assuming that each ping is worth 45 minutes, then getting a daily average and a 95% confidence interval. This can give you a pretty good idea of how you&#39;re spending your time, but I only did it for a simulated person with a perfect schedule.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read about this before, here&#39;s the basic idea:</p><ol><li>The system randomly asks you what you&#39;re doing.</li><li>It biases that random choice in a way that the long-term average time between pings is 45 minutes (or whatever you like)</li><li>Eventually, you can get an idea of what a &#34;normal&#34; day looks like by doing a little math.</li></ol><p>Anyway, let&#39;s do the analysis now that I&#39;ve got a bit over a month of data.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>What you&#39;ll see below:</p><ul><li>The &#34;tag&#34; is what I&#39;m doing. This is a dot-separated hierarchy (e.g. <code>work.meeting.standup</code>.) For analysis, I split that into three tags (<code>work</code>, <code>work.meeting</code>, and <code>work.meeting.standup</code>) so I can see the proportions in different categories.</li><li>The average daily time is the percentage representation of the tag in the data set times the number of minutes in the day. (E.g. if I had 100 pings, 30 of which were tagged <code>sleep</code>, I&#39;d have <code>30 / 100 * 1440</code> to get 432 minutes, or 7h12m.)</li><li>The margin of error is a 95% confidence interval of the average daily time, rounded to the nearest minute.</li></ul><p>In this data, I&#39;ve censored a few things—either because they felt too personal to share in a space like this or because they reveal the contents of work projects—but otherwise I&#39;ve checked this against other accurate sources I have (e.g. my watch for sleep tracking) and it all seems to be accurate!</p><p>So, here are the top places I&#39;ve been spending my time recently:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Average Daily Time ± Margin of Error</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unknown</td><td>7h17m ± 43m</td></tr><tr><td><code>sleep</code></td><td>6h58 ± 43m</td></tr><tr><td><code>work</code></td><td>2h56m ± 31m</td></tr><tr><td><code>beeps</code></td><td>48m ± 17m</td></tr><tr><td><code>tv</code></td><td>28m ± 13m</td></tr><tr><td><code>lunch</code></td><td>25m ± 12m</td></tr><tr><td><code>work.meeting</code></td><td>24m ± 12m</td></tr><tr><td><code>breakfast</code></td><td>16m ± 10m</td></tr><tr><td><code>k8s</code></td><td>14m ± 9m</td></tr><tr><td><code>coffee</code></td><td>12m ± 9m</td></tr><tr><td><code>driving</code></td><td>9m ± 8m</td></tr><tr><td><code>dishes</code></td><td>8m ± 7m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are a lot of improvements I could make here. For example, I&#39;ve had a lot of time off recently due to holidays. If I applied that insight and re-analyzed <code>work</code> for only weekdays I worked, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get more like 7.5 to 8 hours per day. Overall, though, I&#39;m pretty happy with this level of insight!</p><p>If you&#39;d like to try this for yourself, <a href="https://github.com/bytes-zone/beeps">you can get the source or pre-built binaries on GitHub</a>.</p></article></div>
