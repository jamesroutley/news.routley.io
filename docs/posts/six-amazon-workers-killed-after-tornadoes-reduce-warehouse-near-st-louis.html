Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fifty-people-likely-killed-tornadoes-kentucky-governor-2021-12-11" target="_blank">Tornadoes</a> ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses that stretched more than 200 miles.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The Amazon plant was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Witnesses said workers in the plant were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,&#34; said Alexander Bird, who works at the warehouse across the street.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#34;People had to think on their feet quick.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_url="/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/"><div><div><p>A collapsed roof is seen at an Amazon distribution center after a tornado hits Edwardsville, in Illinois, U.S. December 11, 2021.

Police were yet to officially release the names of the dead.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">&#34;Everyone assumes they will be safe at work,&#34; said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. &#34;We don&#39;t think that they will never come home.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Pritzker said he had been in contact with Amazon executives, who pledged financial support for the community.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Earlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1469735669442711552?s=20" target="_blank">posted on Twitter</a> that the company was &#34;heartbroken over the loss&#34; of its staff members and would continue to work closely with the local authorities on the rescue efforts.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">&#34;It gives me shivers,&#34; Kathie Burnett, 67, said. She was a delivery driver at Amazon until two weeks ago when she quit because of health reasons.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">&#34;I would have been standing right in the middle of that track,&#34; she said pointing to what remained of the facility. &#34;There would have been 100 trucks in there last night and you didn&#39;t see one this morning, did you?&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Richa Naidu in Edwardsville, Illinois, Nathan Layne in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengalaru; Writing by Leela de Kretser; Editing by Caroline Stauffer, Diane Craft, Daniel Wallis and Chris Reese</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
