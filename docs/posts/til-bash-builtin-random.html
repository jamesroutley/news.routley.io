          <p>TIL that bash has a builtin <code>RANDOM</code> that can return a random integer between 0 and 32767. This means you can easily simulate printing a random number per second with something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>while </span><span>true</span><span>;</span>  <span>do </span><span>echo</span> <span>$((</span>RANDOM <span>%</span> <span>10</span><span>))</span><span>;</span> <span>sleep </span>1<span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pretty cool because I’ve frequently used python instead for things like these, which is easy in itself but this is way simpler!</p>

<p>While reading about this from <code>man bash</code>, I also came across <code>SRANDOM</code> and turns out that while <code>RANDOM</code> is limited to 16 bit ints only and can be seeded, <code>SRANDOM</code> can generate 32 bit ints and cannot be seeded. 
This is also very easy to verify. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RANDOM=42
for i in 1 2 3; do echo $RANDOM; done
17772
26794
1435
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give you the same output each time you run it after setting <code>RANDOM=42</code> for example. But with <code>SRANDOM</code> the output will be different each time!</p>

<p>Another interesting thing I observed is that <code>SRANDOM</code> does not work (returns an empty output) on my OSX shell running <code>GNU bash, version 5.2.37(1)-release (aarch64-apple-darwin24.2.0)</code>. But I was able to get it to work on a linux box.</p>
