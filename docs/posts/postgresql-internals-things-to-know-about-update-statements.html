    <h1>PostgreSQL Internals: Things to Know About Update Statements</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently finished reading <a href="https://postgrespro.com/community/books/internals">PostgreSQL 14 Internals</a> by Egor Rogov.
It is one of the great books that teach applied computer science without watering down the difficult parts.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting topic is PostgreSQL’s execution of <code>UPDATE</code> statements.
Updates in relational databases are inherently complex.
They can be affected by conflicts, anomalies, and deadlocks.
However, some behavior is specific to PostgreSQL. This can lead to surprises.</p>
<h2 id="1-write-amplification">1. Write Amplification</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL generally does not update rows in-place.
This is a design decision in PostgreSQL’s implementation of multi-version concurrency control (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/mvcc.html">MVCC</a>).
The design can lead to <em>write amplification</em>: a small update can lead to a larger amount of data being written to disk.</p>
<p>Consider a table that stores user profiles in a social networking service:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> user_profile (
    id UUID,
    last_active TIMESTAMPTZ,
    description TEXT
);
</code></pre></div><p>Each column has a different size:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> takes 16 bytes</li>
<li><code>last_active</code> takes 8 bytes</li>
<li><code>description</code> has a variable length, which could be hundreds of bytes <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>description</code> column takes 200 bytes on average, the write amplification factor when updating <code>last_active</code> is approximately 28.
For each logical byte that needs to be updated, 28 bytes are written to disk <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
This is because PostgreSQL writes the whole updated row to a different location on disk.
Considering row metadata, the real write amplification factor is even higher.</p>
<p>Write amplification can lead to increased disk I/O and wasted storage space.
There are more sources of write amplification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexes may have to be updated. This can be the case even if the updated column is not indexed <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL writes all changes to a write-ahead log (WAL) to ensure durability <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If disk I/O is approaching limits, it may be worth investigating row sizes, update statements, and unused indexes <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="2-lost-updates">2. Lost Updates</h2>
<p>The SQL standard mandates that lost updates be prevented at any isolation level <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.
Nonetheless, it is trivial to simulate a lost update in PostgreSQL.
Consider an additional <code>followers_count</code> column and two transactions (Read Committed) that perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>BEGIN</code></li>
<li>Read the row (e.g., <code>SELECT followers_count AS curr FROM user_profile WHERE id = &#39;...&#39;</code>).</li>
<li>Compute a new value <em>in application logic</em> (e.g., <code>curr + 1</code>).</li>
<li>Write the new value to the database (e.g., <code>UPDATE user_profile SET followers_count = &lt;new value&gt; WHERE id = &#39;...&#39;</code>).</li>
<li><code>COMMIT</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In step 2, two concurrent transactions may read the original <code>followers_count</code> value.
This causes a lost update because the count is effectively only incremented once.</p>
<p>This behavior may well be interpreted as a violation of the SQL standard.
However, the application logic which calculates the new value is not considered part of the transaction.
The database merely stores the new value as requested.
Still, the behavior is clearly an anomaly: it cannot occur if the transactions run sequentially <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When using a higher isolation level, PostgreSQL fully prevents lost updates.
Consider two concurrent transactions executing the following statements using the Repeatable Read isolation level:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>BEGIN</span>;
<span>SELECT</span> followers_count <span>FROM</span> user_profile <span>WHERE</span> id <span>=</span> <span>&#39;...&#39;</span>;
<span>-- Returns 300. Compute new value in application: 300 + 1 = 301
</span><span></span><span>UPDATE</span> user_profile <span>SET</span> followers_count <span>=</span> <span>301</span> <span>WHERE</span> id <span>=</span> <span>&#39;...&#39;</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Now, only one of the transactions can commit.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- Session 1
</span><span></span><span>COMMIT</span>;
<span>-- =&gt; COMMIT
</span><span></span>
<span>-- Session 2
</span><span>-- =&gt; ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
</span></code></pre></div><p>The application can handle this error by retrying the transaction.
A simpler solution using the weaker Read Committed level is to let the database compute the new value:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>UPDATE</span> user_profile
<span>SET</span> followers_count <span>=</span> followers_count <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>=</span> <span>&#39;...&#39;</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This statement prevents lost updates at the Read Committed isolation level <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.
The second transaction waits for the first transaction to abort or commit, and then proceeds with execution.
Therefore, no error is raised, and the overhead of retrying transactions can be avoided <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="3-deadlocks">3. Deadlocks</h2>
<p>Deadlocks are another source of confusion in PostgreSQL.
In theory, deadlocks are often explained using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock">four required conditions</a>: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.
This would be the case if</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction A updates Row 1, then wants to update Row 2.</li>
<li>Transaction B updates Row 2, then wants to update Row 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until one of the transactions aborts, there is a circular dependency and hence a deadlock.
The textbook scenario requires two update statements in each transaction, but in reverse order.
Surprisingly, deadlocks can also occur with two transactions that each contain only a single update statement.
The reason is that row locks are acquired in a non-deterministic order.</p>
<p>Consider the following transactions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- Session 1
</span><span></span><span>UPDATE</span> user_profile
<span>SET</span> followers_count <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>WHERE</span> followers_count <span>IS</span> <span>NULL</span>;

<span>-- Session 2
</span><span></span><span>UPDATE</span> user_profile
<span>SET</span> last_active <span>=</span> NOW()
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span> (<span>/* list of ids */</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>The first transaction runs a sequential scan and updates all rows that match the <code>WHERE</code> clause.
Affected rows are locked in the order of the sequential scan.
The second transaction can use the index on <code>id</code> to find the rows to update.
An index scan might access affected rows in a different order.
Hence, it is possible that a circular dependency between locks arises.</p>
<p>This particular scenario is most likely to occur when updating a large number of rows in a single transaction.
Updating rows in smaller batches can help to avoid deadlocks.
Batching can also fix performance issues caused by holding locks for an unnecessarily long time.
If performance is not an issue, it may be enough to retry transactions that have been aborted because of a deadlock.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many engineers have a good theoretical understanding of isolation levels, anomalies, and deadlocks.
However, PostgreSQL—like any other database—is a specific implementation with its own quirks.</p>
<p><em>PostgreSQL 14 Internals</em> offers many more insights beyond the execution of update statements.
The book is a valuable resource for anyone working with PostgreSQL.
It covers data storage, query execution, caching, and indexing in great detail.
I recommend it to anyone who uses PostgreSQL in production.</p>
