<p><span>News in batteries and electrification has been coming fast and furious lately. Recently, Su Yi, the head of CATL’s marine division, stated, </span><span>“CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, and is now advancing toward ocean-going applications.”</span></p>
<p><span>“In the near future — perhaps within the next three years — we will achieve pure-electric vessels navigating the open seas.”</span></p>
<p><span>CATL is <a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6500.html">determined to provide </a></span><span>zero-carbon</span><span> marine transportation. CATL has not been content to merely make batteries, but has dedicated efforts towards application in several sectors, including </span><a href="https://www.ess-news.com/2025/12/05/catl-large-scale-commercialization-567-ah-battery-energy-storage-cells/"><span>grid storage</span></a><span>, passenger vehicles, and ships. CATL’s marine division has been in operation since </span><a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6174.html"><span>2017</span></a><span>, expanding efforts in shipping. In 2023, it introduced a comprehensive battery replenishment solution including battery swapping, charging, and a cloud-based system providing shared mobile application of containerized power for optimal efficiency and economics. Those efforts resulted in <a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6174.html">several major</a></span><a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6174.html"> <span>products</span></a><span>, containerized mobile power, high-voltage high-power charging systems, and the cloud information platform. This comprehensive system provides a seamless solution for electric ships.</span></p>

<p><span>Recent battery price drops indicate that possibilities for long range electric shipping are improving. The expected timeline for electric shipping dovetails with the expected timeline for sodium-ion battery (SIB) volume production and resulting </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/22/the-sodium-ion-battery-revolution-has-started/"><span>cost reductions</span></a><span>. The material costs of SIBs are expected to lower costs significantly, opening up applications and speeding up electrification. While passenger transport has been successfully electrified, with EVs surpassing ICE parity with battery costs well below $100/kWh enabling widespread adoption, </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/14/island-ports-enable-long-distance-electric-shipping/"><span>ships</span></a><span> can increasingly take advantage of lower-cost batteries for expanded electrification. Studies have shown that long-distance </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/09/06/electric-shipping-looking-at-the-numbers-where-we-are-today/"><span>electric ships</span></a><span> with up to 5,000 km of range can be successfully utilized using today’s battery capabilities, without significant weight and volume. CATL appears to be aware of this. Marine division head Su Yi notes CATL’s “</span><a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/pure-electric-ships-to-likely-sail-oceans-in-three-years-says-gm-of-catls-maritime-business"><span>full-spectrum</span></a><span><a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/pure-electric-ships-to-likely-sail-oceans-in-three-years-says-gm-of-catls-maritime-business"> growth</a>” strategy, with goals to electrify maritime and aviation sectors. Sodium-ion technology may remove the last barrier to widespread maritime electrification. </span></p>
