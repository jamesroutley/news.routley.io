<p>If money is the object, payment is the force. Payment puts money to work. So, less the friction in the process of making payments, the easier it is to put money to work.</p>

<p><i>Payment is the force</i></p>

<p>One would think that making payments online should have been solved for well beyond doubt in 2023 but one would need to think again. Here are a few checkout experiences that caused me to drop off.</p>
<p>I’m evaluating checkout experiences across popular websites on these four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation of payment methods</li>
<li>Handling of user inputs</li>
<li>Copywriting on the checkout page</li>
<li>Navigation on the payment sheet</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s jump right in!</p>

<p>Perhaps the most under noticed phenomenon in fintech over the last decade is the commoditization of payments. A decade ago, it was super revolutionary to accept payments online with a few lines of code. That is not the case any more. Commoditization of payments has led to a sharp increase in the diversity of payment methods.</p>

<p>The order in which you present your available payment methods can directly impact your conversion rates by 5-8%. This is usually a tradeoff between processing fees and conversion rate. The only question you will have to answer is whether it is worth promoting the more expensive payment method if it offers a better checkout experience (and a better conversion rate). Here’s an example from Walmart where the Paypal one click checkout can be presented above the card form or even alongside the checkout button that brings the user to this payment page.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://growth.design/psychology#progressive-disclosure" rel="nofollow">progressive disclosure</a> is usually a good idea to make your user get a feel of your product while onboarding, it does not make any sense to do that for card payments. Why would you display only the card number input field at the start? In this case it is better to display all the card input fields because that would make the UI look more like the card itself (in terms of the arrangement of the card number, expiry and CVV). Also, these pages display the card brands like they are clickable icons which is not the best way to do it.</p>
