    <h1>No-GIL mode coming for Python</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
The Python Steering Council has <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474">announced
its intent</a> to accept <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP
703 (Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython)</a>, with
initial support possibly showing up in the 3.13 release.  There are still
some details to work out, though.
</p><blockquote>
	We want to be very careful with backward compatibility. We do not
	want another Python 3 situation, so any changes in third-party code
	needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL
	builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions
	will still need to be addressed). This is not Python 4. We are
	still considering the requirements we want to place on ABI
	compatibility and other details for the two builds and the effect
	on backward compatibility.
