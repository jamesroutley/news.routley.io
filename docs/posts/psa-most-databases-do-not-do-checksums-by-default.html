    <h1>PSA: Most databases do not do checksums by default</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><small>This is a follow up to my post: <a href="https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-bit-flip/">PSA: SQLite does not do checksums</a></small></p><p>My friend, who claims to be a bigger fan of SQLite than me (debatable), said that my previous <a href="https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-bit-flip/">blog post</a> was unfair. My fren is right in a way. I wrote about SQLite because that’s what I’m most familiar with and what I use every day. But here’s a follow-up: most databases don’t have checksums enabled by default. As explained earlier, even a single bit flip can be devastating, and your database or application won’t even know about it. Alice would have lost money even on Postgres.</p><p>I thought I would make a list of databases which don’t have checksums, but it turns out it’s easier to make a list of databases which enable it by default. Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, and many others don’t have checksums by default!</p><p>So, here’s a short list of databases that do enable checksums by default:</p><ul><li>TigerBeetle</li><li>FoundationDB</li><li>Oracle (I have no idea which version, check the documentation)</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>ClickHouse</li><li><a href="https://x.com/MarkCallaghanDB/status/1855341370199953671">MySQL with InnoDB</a></li></ul><p>Did I miss any? <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1855256734400663597">Let me know</a>.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><ul><li>TigerBeetle’s <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/about/safety.md">safety page</a> is a great read on this topic.</li><li>Redundancy Does Not Imply Fault Tolerance: Analysis of Distributed Storage Reactions to Single Errors and Corruptions - <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast17/technical-sessions/presentation/ganesan">link</a></li></ul></article></div></div>
