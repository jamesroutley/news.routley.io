    <h1>Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><img alt="Black smartphone with clock app on screen and &#39;Punkt&#39; branding on back" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0906/3147/1490/files/punkt_mc03_smartphone_main_image_ec4174e6-52bc-4a63-b97c-59fe5974d345.webp?v=1767194285"/></h2>
<p><em><b>Made in Europe</b>, the MC03 has an updated and more sustainable design and evolved features, with security and privacy at its heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 January 2026, Lugano, Switzerland / CES, Las Vegas.</strong> <strong> <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/"> Punkt.</a> </strong>, the Swiss-based pioneer of beautifully designed, minimalist smartphones that give users privacy without friction, will be present at CES with its latest model, the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/products/mc03-premium-secure-smartphone">MC03</a>. This unique device, powered by AphyOS and housed within a German-built precision handset, follows through on Punkt.’s well known commitment to intentional tech use and data ownership.</p>
<p>Like its forerunner, the MC02, the new model is a subscription-based smartphone that offers users the tools and apps that are most important to them in an environment where they control access to their data and usage.</p>
<p>Using the Punkt. MC03, users can put privacy first with two defined repositories for depositing data. The first is named <b>Vault</b>, a protected enclave containing only trusted, Punkt.-approved apps and offering maximum privacy by default with a calm, design-focused user interface. The second, termed <b>Wild Web</b>, provides the freedom to install any app, but with strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls and can prevent data triangulation and unauthorized data flows.</p>
<p><i>“Privacy is being sought by people more than ever before, particularly as we enter the age of AI,”</i> said <b>Petter Neby, Founder and CEO at Punkt</b>. <i>“They are stressed and overwhelmed by the determination of Big Tech to track and monetise their every online movement. Punkt. offers them a solution – a modern, premium device without the need to compromise on their privacy.”</i></p>
<p>The MC03 features a new look and feel to its operating system allowing users to stay laser-focused on getting the best experience. AphyOS cuts out tracking and profiling technology, bloatware, hidden apps and unwieldy background services. It eliminates spying and runs hardened code to block attacks, assisted by a bank-grade Secure Element.</p>
<p>With the MC03, Punkt. is building a secure smartphone ecosystem where privacy is not an add-on, but the default. Supported by trusted partners such as <a href="https://threema.com/en"><b>Threema</b></a> and, new for MC03, <a href="https://proton.me/"><b>Proton</b></a>, these services feature in the device’s Vault space.</p>
<p>Trusted services including <b>Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN</b> and <b>Proton Pass</b> are available in an environment designed to minimize data exposure and tracking.</p>
<p>Punkt. and Proton are ideal partners, both leading within the <b>Swiss Tech movement</b> (<i>with Swiss Tech you pay to retain your data, with Big Tech you pay with your data</i>), operating independently and built around the principle that users, not platforms, control their own data.</p>
<p><b><i>Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton</i></b> said, <i>“People deserve choice. Choice over the phone they use, the software they rely on and who they share their data with. By working with likeminded companies like Punkt., we can give users more ways to regain control of their privacy.”</i></p>
<h3>Among other features of the MC03:</h3>
<p><b>The App Hub</b></p>
<p>Two app stores are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>A curated privacy-friendly store vetted by AphyOS and Punkt.</li>
<li>Access to all widely available apps, activated only when chosen by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Premium Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Manufactured at the Gigaset facility in Germany, the device delivers cutting-edge engineering for quality, security, repairability and sustainability, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>120Hz OLED HDR display</li>
<li>Removable 5200mAh battery</li>
<li>IP68 water and dust resistance</li>
<li>64MP main camera</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Digital Nomad</b></p>
<p>The MC03 retains its built-in VPN, Digital Nomad, protecting connectivity and privacy wherever users are.</p>
<p><b>Ledger</b></p>
<p>Users control app-specific privacy, from full access to full restriction. Ledger also includes a Carbon Reduction feature, giving insights into the energy impact of installed apps and control over background activity.</p>
<p><i>“The MC03 builds on the success of the MC02 in privacy, control and security,”</i> continued Petter Neby. <i>“It delivers modern features with simplicity and minimal distraction.”</i></p>
<p>The Punkt. MC03 is priced at CHF / $ / €699.</p>
<p>If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product. With MC03, you pay to retain your data rather than paying with it.</p>
<p>A 12-month subscription to AphyOS from Apostrophy is included. After that, continuation requires a paid subscription:</p>
<p>Monthly at CHF / $ / €9.99</p>
<p>Subscription bundles are available, including a <b>3-year subscription at 45% discount</b> and a <b>5-year subscription at 60% discount</b>.</p>
<p>The MC03 is available to pre-order now, with deliveries in Europe at the end of January and North America from Spring 2026.</p>
