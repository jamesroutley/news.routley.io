    <h1>Lichess: Block Ads and Trackers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Lichess is safe, because it is free of ads and trackers.</strong></p>

<p>But browsing the rest of the  Internet exposes us to the following threats:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Advertisement</strong> sells our screen estate and influences us</li>

<li><strong>Tracking</strong> sells our personal information to increase advertisement effectiveness</li>

</ul>

<p>These don&#39;t benefit us, the website users, in any way. In fact, they use a lot of our computing power and bandwidth against us.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are simple and legal ways to protect ourselves from these invasions.</p>

<h2>Protect your computer</h2>

<h3><a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a></h3>

<p>Hands-down the best ad-blocking <strong>browser extension</strong>. It&#39;s free software (GPLv3), blazing fast, and will effectively block most malware. We heartily recommend that everyone installs it. uBlock is available for most browsers on Windows, MacOS and Linux. <strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com">Install it now!</a></strong></p>

<p>Note that other browser extensions, such as the popular &#34;AdBlock&#34;, are unsafe: they have accepted money to expose you to some ads. Don&#39;t fall for it, just use uBlock Origin instead.</p>

<h3><a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS server that can block ads and trackers throughout the <strong>whole system</strong>. This includes video ads and ads in your favorite apps, browsers and games. It can be used as a replacement or, better, a complement of uBlock Origin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to set up, <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html#instruction">check out the instructions on the AdGuard website</a> on how to do this.</p>

<h3>Custom hosts file (advanced)</h3>

<p>An alternative to AdGuard for system-wide blocking is to directly manage your <em>hosts </em>file. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/readme.md">list of dangerous hosts to block</a>, with links to raw hosts files available. To modify your current hosts file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.</p>

<h4>Where to find your hosts file:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-a-Mac">mac OS</a> (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">Linux</a></strong>: /etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong>macOS Catalina (10.15+):</strong> /private/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-Windows">Windows</a></strong>: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>

</ul>

<h2>Protect your Android device</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">personalDNSfilter</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS proxy for Android. Your device will be unable to connect to anything that will send you ads or track what you do. You can download and install personalDNSfilter from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dnsfilter.android/">F-Droid</a>, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dnsfilter.android">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">directly download the package</a>.</p>

<h2>Protect your iPhone or iPad</h2>

<h3><a href="https://blockbear.com/">BlockBear</a></h3>

<p>Blocks ads and trackers directly, but only within the Safari browser.</p>

<h2>About blocking ads</h2>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that blocking ads is <strong>NOT </strong>theft. Don&#39;t fall for this creepy idea, which is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.</p>

<p>Ads and trackers violate our privacy, make websites much slower, and deliver dangerous malware. We say no to them.</p>

<p>We have the right to decide what we download from the Internet, what we send to it, and what we display on our screen.</p>

<p>We have the right to refuse downloading source code that works against us. It&#39;s our bandwidth and computer, and no-one can decide for us what to use them for.</p>

<p>A service that has valuable features should be able to sell us a subscription, without blackmailing us with ominous ads.</p></div></div>
