    <h1>JSONB â€“ Request for evaluation and comment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>JSONB (<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/json1.html#jsonbx">https://sqlite.org/draft/json1.html#jsonbx</a>) is a new binary
storage format for JSON that is <em>proposed</em> for the next release
(3.44.0) sometime toward the end of the calendar year.  The advantages
of using JSONB rather than RFC-8259 text JSON are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JSONB is slightly more compact, taking up about 5% or 10% less
 disk space, on average.</p></li>
<li><p>JSONB is faster.  The <code>json_extract()</code> function and
 the <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> operators are more than twice as fast when their
 left-hand operand is JSONB instead of text JSON.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The JSONB enhancement is mostly feature-complete in that all of the planned
new interfaces have been implemented.  You are encouraged to download
a pre-release snapshot from the Download page (<a href="https://sqlite.org/download.html">https://sqlite.org/download.html</a>) and try it out,
if you can.  Report back on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Size and performance improvements or regressions in your application</li>
<li>Suggestions for improvement to the interfaces</li>
<li>Suggestions for documentation improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Your assistance in testing this new feature, so as to make it better, 
is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Note that the JSONB enhancement is still under active development.  The
code has not yet landed on trunk.  There is a lot of optimization left to
be done.  The on-disk JSONB format and details of the new interfaces are
all subject to change, so do not do anything with this prototype that needs
to be long-lasting, as anything might change out from under you.</p>
