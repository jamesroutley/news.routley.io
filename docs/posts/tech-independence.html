<section id="why">
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
Tech independence is <strong>not depending on any particular company or software</strong>.
</p><p>
The only tools you need are the common open source basics built into any Linux or BSD operating system — <strong>free public-domain tools that are not owned by anyone</strong>, and can run on any computer.
</p><p>
<strong>Learn a few of these basic tools</strong>, and you can run your own private server on any computer forever, for the rest of your life.
Host your own website and email.
Keep your own contacts and calendars synced with your phone.
Back up and sync your photos, movies, and music to your own private storage.
No more subscriptions needed.
</p><p>
You can <strong>ignore</strong> all the companies offering “<strong>solutions</strong>”, even if they are free, because they take away <strong>self-reliance</strong>.
The point is to <strong>know how to do it yourself</strong>, not to have somebody do it for you.
It’s worth a little up-front work, like learning how to drive.
</p><p>
Below are <strong>simple step-by-step instructions</strong> that work.
Instead of drowning you in options, it uses an operating system called <a href="https://sive.rs/openbsd">OpenBSD</a> and a hosting company called <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9541378-8H">Vultr</a> because I’ve used them for years and I know they are good and trustworthy.
But you could do this same setup with <strong>any free Linux or BSD operating system</strong>, with <strong>any hosting company</strong> that gives you “root” access to your own private server.
You could even do it on <strong>an old laptop in your closet</strong>.
</p><p>
So if a company turns evil or goes out of business, no problem!
You can set up a new server anywhere else in an hour, point your domain name to the new IP address, and it’s done.
<strong>That’s tech independence</strong> — never dependent on any particular provider or software.
It’s very empowering.
The instructions below will show you how.
</p>
</section>

<section id="register">

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://porkbun.com/" target="_blank">Porkbun.com</a>.</li>
<li>Search for a domain name you like until you find one that’s available.</li>
<li>Create a new account, and pay.</li>
<li>Congratulations. You’ll use this domain name in many of the steps below.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="dns0">

<ol>
<li>Wherever you registered your domain name, log in there to change your domain’s DNS nameservers.</li>
<li>It’s usually set by default to the company where you registered.  So for example a domain registered at GoDaddy will have default nameservers of something.godaddy.com.</li>
<li><strong>Replace</strong> those defaults with these two:
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.vultr.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.vultr.com</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="storage1">

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6930328" target="_blank">Vultr.com</a>.</li>
<li>Create an account and give it your credit card.</li>
<li><a href="https://my.vultr.com/blockstorage/add/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the “<a href="https://my.vultr.com/blockstorage/add/" target="_blank">Add Block Storage</a>” page.</li>
<li>Click “<strong>Block Storage (HDD)</strong>”, which says “Globally Available”</li>
<li>Below that, a list of cities. Click the one closest to you.</li>
<li>Below that, a slider lets you choose how much storage you need. If not sure, just leave it as $1 for 40 GB.</li>
<li>Below that, in a subtle box that says “label” <strong>type the word <code>encrypted</code></strong>.</li>
<li>Below that, click the “<strong>Add Block Storage</strong>” button.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="ssh">

<ol>
<li><strong>Open a terminal</strong>.<ul>
	<li><strong>Windows?</strong> Start → Windows PowerShell → Windows PowerShell</li>
	<li><strong>Mac?</strong> Applications → Utilities → Terminal</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</strong></code> and hit [enter] or [return].</li>
<li>When it says, “<code>Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519):</code>”, hit [enter] or [return].</li>
<li>When it says, “<code>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</code>”, hit [enter] or [return].</li>
<li>When it says, “<code>Enter same passphrase again:</code>”, hit [enter] or [return].</li>
<li>See the line that starts, “<code>Your public key has been saved in</code>” and ends in “<code>id_ed25519.pub</code>”?  <strong>That’s the file you need</strong> for the next step.
</li><li><strong>In a text editor, open “<code>id_ed25519.pub</code>”</strong>.<ul>
	<li><strong>Windows?</strong> Type <code><strong>notepad .ssh/id_ed25519.pub</strong></code></li>
	<li><strong>Mac?</strong> Type <code><strong>open -e .ssh/id_ed25519.pub</strong></code></li>
	</ul></li>
<li>It should be a single line like this:</li>
<li>You’ll use this in the next step: “<a href="#server1">Create your server</a>”.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="server1">

<ol>
<li>In your <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6930328" target="_blank">Vultr.com</a> account:</li>

<li>Below that, under Server Size, click “25 GB SSD <strong>$5/month</strong>”</li>
<li>A blue pop-up appears underneath, up-selling “For only $1.00 more you can...”.  Click “No thanks”.</li>
<li>Scroll down to “<strong>SSH Keys</strong>”, click “Add New”, then under “Name” type <code><strong>mykey</strong></code>.</li>
<li>From <a href="#ssh">the previous section</a>, step 3, <strong>copy</strong> (⌘-C or Ctrl-C) <strong>the contents of “id_ed25519.pub” and paste it into this box</strong> called “SSH Key”. It should be a single line like this:</li>
<li>After pasting it into the box, click [<strong>Add SSH Key</strong>].</li>
<li>Under <strong>SSH Keys</strong>, <strong>click the box</strong> with the picture of the key called “mykey” to give it <strong>a tick mark in the top-right corner</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll up to “<strong>Enable Auto Backups</strong>”, click the “on” toggle button to <strong>turn it OFF</strong>.</li>
<li>A scary pop-up says “Are you sure....”. Tick the box next to “I understand the risks”, then click the red button “Disable Auto Backups”.</li>
<li>Under “Additional Features”, untick the box next to “Enable IPv6”, to disable it.</li>
<li>Under “Server Hostname &amp; Label”, <strong>type your domain name</strong> in both “server hostname” and “server label”.</li>
<li>At the bottom, click the big blue button [“<strong>Deploy Now</strong>”].</li>
<li>Stretch your legs for a minute while waiting for your server status to change from “Installing” to “Running”.</li>
<li><strong>Copy and save</strong> its <strong>IP Address</strong> on your computer.</li>

<p>Enter your domain name and the username that you create, below, and this will customize all following instructions for you.</p>

<p id="nowbut">Now when you see this button: <span></span> <strong>click it</strong> to <strong>copy that line</strong> so you can <strong>paste it into your terminal</strong>, without error.</p>
</section>

<section id="storage4">

<p>The <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> script will eventually prompt you, “Now upload anything while I wait...”.  Here’s how.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Type <code><strong>rsync -avz Documents <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span>:/mnt/</strong></code> and you will see it uploading your Documents folder to your private encrypted storage. Use this same format to upload any other folders, replacing “Documents” in the command. If you are happy synchonizing on the command line like this, you can skip over the next FreeFileSync section.</p>
<h3><a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></h3>
<p>Everyone using <strong>Windows</strong> should <strong>use <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></strong>. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://freefilesync.org/download.php">Download FreeFileSync</a> and please give an optional donation there if you can afford to. Donating also unlocks more features. Thanks to Jon Lis for the recommendation.</li>
<li>Install and open FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Top-center: click the grey <strong>[Browse]</strong> button and find the folder with the stuff you want to upload.</li>
<li>Top-far-right: click the white <strong>cloud icon</strong> then <strong>SFTP</strong> at the top.</li>
<li>Server name or IP address: <span>yourdomain.name</span></li>
<li>Left side: click <strong>(*) Key File</strong></li>
<li>Username: <span>yourusername</span></li>
<li>Browse to find your <strong>private</strong> key, called <strong>id_ed25519</strong> from the “<a href="#ssh">Create an SSH key</a>” section. (Not the file that ends in “.pub”, but the one next to it.) NOTE: Because the /Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh directory is “hidden” by Windows and Mac by default, I find it easier to just type the path directly, like this:<ul>
	<li><em>The username, for this next line, should be your username on your home computer, not your remote server.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Windows?</strong> Type <code><strong>C:\Users\<span>yourusername</span>\.ssh\id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	<li><strong>Mac?</strong> Type <code><strong>/Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh/id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Directory on server</strong>: <strong>/mnt</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-right: click the <strong>green gear wheel</strong>.</li>
<li>Left button: click “<strong>MIRROR →</strong>”</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-center: click “<strong>COMPARE</strong>”, and make sure your files are there.</li>
<li>Top-right: click “<strong>SYNCHRONIZE Mirror →</strong>” then <strong>[Start]</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Verify and unmount</h3>
<ol>
<li>When it’s done uploading, <strong>log in to your server</strong> again, from your terminal.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code></li>
<li>You should see a long list of the files you uploaded.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>m-x</strong></code> to detach your encrypted storage.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code> again, and now you should see nothing there! Congratulations! You now see <strong>how this will work in the future</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m</strong></code>” to <strong>attach</strong> your encrypted storage.</li>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> your files with rsync or FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m-x</strong></code>” to <strong>detach</strong> the storage, for security.</li>

Your phone currently keeps its contacts and calendars with Google or Apple.
Now you can get them off the cloud and keep them privately on your own server.
</p><p>
My <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> setup script installs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> server for contacts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> server for calendars.

</ol>
</section>


<section id="mail3">

<p>To do email from your phone, computer, or anywhere else, you now have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a> server, called <a href="https://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a>.
So on any device, you can <strong>add a new IMAP Mail account</strong>, with these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account type: IMAP</li>
<li>Email address: <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span></li>

<ol>
<li>On your home computer, in your main home directory, <strong>make a directory/folder called “htdocs”</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/template.html">Download this file called “template.html”</a> and save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/style.css">Download this file called “style.css”</a> and also save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><strong>Make a copy</strong> of the “template.html” file, and <strong>name the copy “index.html”</strong>. This will be your home page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit the index.html file</strong> in a text editor (NotePad or TextEdit) and change my default text to whatever you want.</li>
<li>When you need to add a new page, just <strong>copy the template again</strong>, call it “about.html” or whatever, and make a link to it from the home page.  The header of each page will link back to index.html : your home page.</li>
<li>If you want to <strong>change the look</strong> of your site, just edit the style.css file.  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+tutorial">Search the web for “CSS tutorial”</a> if needed.</li>
<li><strong>To upload it</strong> to your public server, do one of the next two steps:</li>
<li>Apple Mac? <strong>Open a new terminal window</strong> on your computer, type </li>
<li>Windows? <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a> again, but now change the “<strong>Directory on server</strong>” to <strong>/var/www/</strong> (you can find it by clicking [browse] or typing it directly) then upload this htdocs directory there.</li>
<li>Go to https://<span>yourdomain.name</span> in your web browser, <strong>refresh the page</strong>, and you should see your updated website.</li>
<li>Any trouble, just know that the goal is to get that index.html file into this location on your server: <code><strong>/var/www/htdocs/index.html</strong></code> because that’s where the web server is expecting it to be. That’s where we put the original test file, so your new <code>index.html</code> file should replace that one.</li>
<li>If you want <strong><a href="https://sive.rs/su">short URLs</a></strong>, without the .html, you can (for everything except index.html) because I set the default type to be HTML. Just remove the “.html” from your HTML filenames, update your links, and voilà!</li>
</ol>
It’s important to know how to make a simple website by hand, and not let people sell you on complex solutions that are the equivalent of saying you need a jumbo jet when you really need a bicycle.
For real tech independence, start by typing your HTML files yourself.
Only later, after you have many <em>many</em> pages, consider a more complicated solution.

<section id="web2">

<p>
Your website is configured to list all files in the /pub/ directory of your website.
So basically anything in /var/www/htdocs/pub/ is public.
Upload any files you want to share.
</p><p>
It replaces Dropbox and similar services for sending big files.
Just upload the file to /var/www/htdocs/pub/
then find it in your web browser, copy its URL, and send someone the URL.
</p>
<p>
If the files you want to share are already on your computer, then just <strong>make a pub/ directory inside htdocs/</strong> (so, <strong>htdocs/pub/</strong>), put your files in there, then use FreeFileSync or rsync to upload them as you did in the previous section called “<a href="#web1">Simple website</a>”.
Consider them part of your website.
</p><p>
Or if you have a URL from somewhere else online that you want to download to your server, just do it as we did in the numbered steps above.
Then use FreeFileSync or rsync to download from your server to your computer first, before your next upload sync.

<li>Or if you don’t want to run your own email server, use <a href="https://mailbox.org/">Mailbox.org</a> or <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> but <strong>only</strong> by using your own domain name. Be <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span> from now on. Don’t depend on anyone else’s domain for your email or you’ll be stuck with them.</li>

<p>
If you need hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes of storage, I recommend Hetzner’s “<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Storage Box</a>”.
It’s the best storage value I’ve found.
Also consider <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal">Backblaze Personal Backup</a>.
</p><p>
I personally use Vultr’s storage (as described above) for sensitive information I definitely want completely encrypted.
Then I use Hetzner’s Storage Box for all my photos, videos, music, and other big files that don’t absolutely need to be encrypted.

<p>Unless you want to read email directly on your server, skip this step.</p>
<ol>
<li>ssh in to your server, then <strong>type <code>mutt</code></strong></li>
<li>You should see the subject headers, with the first email highlighted. <strong>Type <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> a few times</strong> to go down and up the list of emails.</li>
<li>To <strong>read an email, hit [enter] or [return]</strong> when it is highlighted.</li>
<li>To go <strong>back to the list, type <code>i</code></strong> (for “index”)</li>
<li><strong>To reply, hit <code>r</code></strong> then:<ul>
	<li>It shows “<code>To:</code>” so you can edit or add recipients. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It shows “<code>Subject:</code>” so you can edit the subject. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It asks “<code>Include message in reply? ([yes]/no/?):</code>”. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> for the usual norm of echoing someone’s email back at them below your reply. Or <code>n</code> for not.</li>
	<li>Now you are inside the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor"><strong>vi</strong> text editor</a> which is not self-explanatory, so I’ll walk you through a simple reply:</li>
	<li>Hit <code><strong>i</strong></code> (no [return] or [enter]) to go into “insert mode” and <strong>type your message</strong>. You’ll notice it’s on the same line as some other text, so you might want to start by hitting [return] or [enter] a few times, then <strong>up-arrow</strong> to go back to the first line again.</li>
	<li>When done typing your message, <strong>hit your [esc] key</strong> in the very top-left corner of your keyboard. Nothing will change on the screen, yet.</li>
	<li>Type <code><strong>:wq</strong></code> (the “:” at the beginning is important) then [enter] or [return].</li>
	<li>Then you’ll see the “Compose Menu” which I think of as the “last chance before sending” screen. <strong>Hit <code>y</code> to send it</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To <strong>send a new email</strong>, hit <code><strong>m</strong></code> then repeat those steps like you did for a reply, except now the “<code>To:</code>” and “<code>Subject:</code>” are blank and waiting for you to create. (For “<code>To:</code>”, type the email address of the person you’re emailing.)</li>
<li>To <strong>quit</strong>, hit <code><strong>q</strong></code></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt</a> is a great program for reading and sending email on the command line. It’s been my email client for 20 years. <a href="http://mutt.org/doc/manual/">Read its manual here</a> if you want to go deeper. It does everything.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor">vi text editor</a> is a useful tool to edit text on a server. It takes a few minutes to learn, but it’s worth learning because it’s installed by default on every Linux/BSD server.</p>

You honestly don’t have to do anything to maintain your server.
It will just work as-is for decades!
But if you like to keep it up-to-date, it only takes a minute, so run these next steps any time.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>syspatch</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>fw_update</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>pkg_add -u</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysupgrade</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that last “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step did <strong>not</strong> give an “Error retrieving … 404 Not Found” error, that means your OpenBSD operating system is upgrading itself. They release an upgrade every 6 months. In that case, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/">go to this OpenBSD page</a> and follow the link at the top that says “<strong>Upgrading to</strong> (7.4, etc)” to see if there’s anything else you should know.
</p><p>
If the “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step updated your operating system and your server rebooted, then there is just one more step:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysmerge</strong></code></li>
<li>Follow any instructions. Don’t worry about messing up because you can always start over, as described below.</li>
<li>Re-do the <code>syspatch ; fw_update ; pkg_add -u</code> steps, above.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="redo">

<p>I’ve tested the steps above very carefully and repeatedly. They work. So if you hit a major problem, something not happening like it says it should, please do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type “<code><strong>cd ; m-x ; exit</strong></code>” in any terminals you still have open, until they are all closed.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://my.vultr.com/">your Vultr account</a>.</li>
<li>See your server instance?  See to the far right, a subtle <strong>···</strong>?  Click that.</li>
<li>From its pop-up menu, click the last option: “<strong>Server Destroy</strong>”.</li>
<li><strong>Tick the box</strong> next to “[X] Yes, destroy this server.”</li>
<li>Click the big red <strong>[Destroy Server]</strong> button.</li>
<li>This will not destroy your encrypted storage. That’s another reason we kept it separate from the start. So <strong>if</strong> you already uploaded a bunch of your files and want to save them, they should still be there.</li>
<li>On your own computer, <strong>in the terminal, type: <code>rm .ssh/known_hosts</code></strong></li>
<li>Go back to the section called “<a href="#server1">Create your server</a>” and try again.</li>
</ol>

It’s one of the most wonderful things about OpenBSD: <strong>everything you need to know is in those <code>man</code> pages!</strong>
No need for YouTube, Google, ChatGPT, or any other advertising-driven sources of information.
