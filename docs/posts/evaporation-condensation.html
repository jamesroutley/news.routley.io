        <p>It seems to come to me only when I am quite far from it - that is, when the chances of my trying to tame it are next to nothing - so that what I am left with is trails -</p><p>it&#39;s the sun beating down on the white willow, and the blank zone,</p><p>misreading of bird-talk - buffalo saddles moving in between the crumbling hills in the badlands, more jewels everywhere in the cracks between streams,</p><p>You come back to me at the strangest moments - sitting on the overground underground, and browsing telephone poles.</p><p>common heart ache - what fills us is still mountainsong - the cry of an independent, indignant, fighting, beauty-making warrior heart. here I am held fast, making the same choices that I seek to condemn.</p><p>Only with this racket I can start to hear it all, as we move above the noise floor.</p><hr/><p>now we run between sweet and salty seas,</p><p>we&#39;re walking, just us three, and the ghost of every one we&#39;ve known</p><p>and we&#39;re counting our steps as thin drops of water fall from a sky that promised no rain</p><p>promise me it will never rain,</p><p>promise me that the we&#39;ll stay dry among the falling waters</p><p>promise me that even when we&#39;re soaked and shaking,</p><p>that we&#39;ll return to this place in our minds</p>
