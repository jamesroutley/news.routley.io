    <h1>Swatch Internet Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Internet Time was invented and marketed by the Swiss watch company Swatch in the late 1990&#39;s.</p><div><figure><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x337/internet-time--illustration.png?1" width="600" height="337" alt="Illustration image" srcset="//c.tadst.com/gfx/900x506/internet-time--illustration.png?1 1.5x,//c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/internet-time--illustration.png?1 2x"/></p><figcaption><p>Internet Time system divides the day into 1000 &#34;.beats&#34;.</p></figcaption></figure><h2>Simple Internet Time .beat converter</h2><h2>New Time Unit - the .beat</h2><p>Instead of dividing the virtual and real day into 24 hours and 60 minutes per hour, the Internet Time system divides the day into 1000 &#34;.beats&#34;. Each .beat is 1 minute and 26.4 seconds.</p><h2>New Meridian</h2><p>Internet Time is based on a new Meridian (as opposed to the Greenwich Meridian). This new Meridian goes through Swatch&#39;s office in Biel, Switzerland and is called the BMT Meridian.</p><h2>BMT - the reference for Internet Time</h2><p>Biel Mean Time (BMT) is another invention of Swatch. It is linked up to the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cet">Central European Winter/Standard time</a>, which is <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc">UTC</a> + 1 hour. When it is Midnight in BMT, the Internet Time is @000 beats, Noon is @500 beats.</p><figure><h3>Time Unit Conversions</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Beat Unit</th><th>Conversion</th><th>Unit</th><th>Beat Conversion</th></tr><tr><th>1 .beat</th><td>= 0.001 day</td><th>1 day</th><td>= 1000 .beats</td></tr><tr><th>1 .beat</th><td>= 0.024 hours</td><th>1 hour</th><td>= 41.666 .beats</td></tr><tr><th>1 .beat</th><td>= 1.44 minutes</td><th>1 minute</th><td>= 0.6944 .beats</td></tr><tr><th>1 .beat</th><td>= 86.4 seconds</td><th>1 second</th><td>= 0.01157 .beats</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Advantages of the Internet Time System</h2><ul><li>It uses the normal decimal system, instead of the ancient 24 hour, 60 minute, 60 second system which makes time telling more complicated.</li><li>.beat time calculations are easy, @345 + 456 .beats = @801, compared to e.g. 3:45:20 + 2 hours, 25 minutes, 45 seconds, where the seconds, minutes and hours must all be added.</li><li>No need for time zone conversions - the Internet Time is the same everywhere.</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages of the Internet Time system</h2><ul><li>The use of the Biel Meridian introduces an unwanted additional Meridian - the Greenwich Meridian is the standard Meridian of the world.</li><li>Wrong use of mean time - The Biel Meridian is not at exactly 15 degrees east longitude, which it should have been if the BMT (Biel Mean Time) should be 1 hour ahead of UTC / GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)</li><li>The second, and not the beat is the basic unit of time in the International System of Units (and using .beats instead, would complicate the system).</li><li>The Internet Time system might seem like more of commercial marketing attempt, than a real system.</li><li>Milliday would be a more accurate name than beat.</li></ul><h2>Unlikely to Change</h2><p>As the current hour/minute/second system is already widely adopted, it is very unlikely that the Internet Time system will be able to replace it, even on the Internet. There is already a common time system without time zones and daylight saving time in wide use today - <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html">UTC</a>, which should be used instead.</p><p><strong>Topics: </strong><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/timekeeping">Timekeeping</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/time-zone">Time Zone</a></p></div></div>
