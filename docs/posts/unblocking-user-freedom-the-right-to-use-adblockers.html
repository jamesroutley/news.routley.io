<p>Companies increasingly aim to control how users interact with their 
content online, threatening user freedom. As more companies crack down 
on browser extensions and other third-party software used by internet 
users to customise their experiences, two recent German court cases on 
adblockers could strengthen the legal case for user control over 
technology.</p>

<p>Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. 
They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and 
the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try 
to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? 
Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they 
help achieve user freedom?</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their 
websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue 
for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when 
visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any 
website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary 
user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would 
lead to an internet where unsolicited information 
and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court 
decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a 
reality in Germany.</p> 

<h2 id="id-is-it-legal-to-use-adblockers-the-lawsuit-in-question">Is it legal to use adblockers? The lawsuit in question</h2>

<p>Using an adblocker is the main way in which many internet users 
bypass ads and pop-ups when accessing websites. Adblockers usually come 
in the form of browser extensions and plugins that filter out unwanted 
ads for an ad-free internet browsing experience.</p> 

<p>As the use of these adblockers increases, some companies have begun 
considering whether it is legal for  users to be able to block their 
ads. This was the case in Germany when Axel Springer SE (Axel 
Springer), one of Germany’s largest publishing companies, engaged in 
lawsuits against Eyeo GmbH (Eyeo), the creator of <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/about#whymoney">Adblock Plus</a> (a 
Free 
Software adblocking tool licensed under the GPLv3). These lawsuits have 
resulted in a legal battle for user freedom and an open internet.</p>

<p>In the case of Adblock Plus, ads are blocked according to filter rules 
maintained in a so-called “black list”, which users use as a default 
setting. The extension offers ad providers the possibility of having 
their ads excluded from this black list (and included in a “white 
list”) by complying with <a href="https://acceptableads.com/standard/">“acceptable advertising 
standards”,</a> disclosing 
their annual turnover, and paying a sum to Eyeo. Users will only see 
ads that have been included in the white list, but they also have the 
option of blocking ads from both white and black lists altogether.</p>

<div>
<p>Axel Springer filed several suits in Germany against Eyeo on the grounds 
that the Adblock Plus extension interfered with their business, 
alleging that by blocking its advertisements, Eyeo had engaged in 
anti-competitive measures. According to Axel Springer, Eyeo’s business 
model constituted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Targeted obstruction and aggressive business practice; and </li>
<li>A violation of freedom of the press.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="id-the-right-not-to-be-advertised-to">The right not to be advertised to</h3> 
<p>After ruling that the option to use adblockers is a decision that internet users should be able to make, 
the courts in Germany ruled that user rights not only include the 
freedom to express an opinion and to receive information, but also the 
rights to refrain from expressing an opinion and to refuse to receive 
imposed information. In doing so, the rulings considered a user’s 
interest in being spared from obtrusive advertising.</p>

<p>Accordingly, internet users are simply exercising their right to not 
have certain forms of advertising displayed when visiting internet 
websites when they choose to make use of an adblocker. Adblock Plus’s 
business model, according to the courts, was therefore a marketable 
service offer which was not primarily aimed at impairing the 
competitive development of Axel Springer. In the opinion of the courts, 
Adblock Plus also does not directly interfere with the business, as 
users retain autonomy to do as they wish with the settings of the 
add-on after installation. Users can block or wish to see only the ads 
in the whitelist. Adblock Plus is therefore merely a product whose use 
is decided solely by the internet user.</p>

<h3 id="id-the-html-argument-does-the-use-of-adblockers-constitute-a-modification-of-a-computer-program">The HTML argument: does the use of adblockers constitute a modification of a computer program?</h3>

<p>Axel Springer also submitted an argument to the German courts that their
websites would be protected under German copyright law as a copyrighted 
computer program, and that their HTML code would similarly be covered 
under this ambit because of the control components it included. Because 
of how Adblock Plus interacts with its website, Axel Springer therefore 
claimed that copies and adaptations of the code in its website were 
violations of copyright made without permission.</p>

<p>In both the initial court ruling and the decision on the subsequent appeal in favour 
of Eyeo, the court disagreed with Axel Springer and held that the use 
of Adblock Plus solely affects the program flow through external 
commands, without altering the program’s essence or generating a 
changed version. Thus, the use of the extension results in a mere 
browser configuration carried out by users according to their 
preferences.</p>

<p>The courts noted that internet users do not require permission from 
website owners when they want to make the website look better for 
themselves. Modern websites are made up of many separate parts that can 
be technically distinguished from each other, including text, images, and 
videos, as well as software that is embedded in the HTML page. For the 
courts, it wasn’t enough that these software components were used in 
the website’s HTML page to mean that the website itself was a 
protectable computer program. We can therefore infer that adblockers 
do not infringe upon a program’s protections.</p>

<h2 id="id-downsides-of-the-case">Downsides of the case</h2> 
<p>Nevertheless, some aspects in the judgments are still not ideal in 
promoting the average user’s rights. While user freedom  means that 
users are able to use the tools that they wish to when browsing the 
World Wide Web, the court nevertheless preserved Axel 
Springer’s right to exclude users with an activated adblocker from 
accessing its content. This can be understood as an approval on the use 
of adblock detection tools by companies like Axel Springer.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the court also mentioned that Axel Springer can convert 
its content into a paid access model, justifying this measure as an 
element inherent for competition. We fear that this tacit approval can 
result in paywalls and adblock detection tools becoming the basic 
standard on the internet.</p> 

<p>More importantly, tools to detect the use of adblockers go against <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058">Art. 
5(3) of the ePrivacy directive</a>, which mandates that websites must seek 
consent before accessing or storing information about a user’s device. 
The EU commission has confirmed that, Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive 
<a href="https://forum.adblockplus.org/viewtopic.php?t=45001">is not 
just limited to cookies but ‘all types of information’ stored or 
accessed</a> in the user’s terminal device. This applies to the storage by 
websites of scripts in users’ terminal equipment to detect if users 
have installed or are using adblockers.</p> 

<h2 id="id-a-win-for-user-freedom">A win for user freedom?</h2> 

<p>With many service providers and websites on the internet following the 
trend of restricting users with adblockers from accessing their services, these court 
decisions in Germany help build precedents that uphold and recognize 
principles of user freedom.</p> 

<p>Indeed, these decisions support the principles of a <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/ngi.en.html">Next Generation 
Internet</a>, including ensuring that internet users can make individual 
choices and exercise their freedom of expression, in ways in which they 
can freely develop and use new extensions and browser features to 
enhance their online experience and user control.</p>  

<p>Despite the steps forward for user control found in these judgments, 
they do not go as far as we would hope to secure user freedom when 
using the internet, and are still subject to appeals and therefore may 
not be final. We will keep an eye on the legal proceedings in this case 
and keep you updated when new developments occur. In the meantime, the 
court cases can be read on the <a href="https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;nr=8849">Bundesgerichtshof</a> 
and <a href="https://www.landesrecht-hamburg.de/bsha/document/JURE220021753">Landesgerichts</a> 
websites. If you are aware of any similar cases or other developments to 
support user freedom in any other member states in the EU, then please
