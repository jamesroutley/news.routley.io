    <h1>Ask HN: I want to create IMDB for open source projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am interested in developing a web application that bears resemblance to IMDb but for open-source projects. The primary goal of this application will be to serve as a directory for discovering open-source projects.</p><p>While GitHub is an exceptional platform, it does not provide all the functionality I need. Therefore, I plan to add a search function that enables users to filter projects.</p><p>1. What do you think about this idea?
2. However, I am uncertain about how to plan the product. Can you assist me with this?</p></div></div></div>
