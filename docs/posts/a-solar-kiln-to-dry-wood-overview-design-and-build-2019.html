I would have get more wood from those trees, but the base trunks were full of nails, wires, even a damn horseshoe was inside that cheery :) </p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1569503567387_24983"><div>

<p>Having no kiln in my area to dry this wood properly I decided to build one myself, mostly for experimentation and the satisfaction to make my own workable wood from the beginning of laying down the tree and having it properly cut and dried in your workshop ready to make a project from it. </p><p><strong>The solar kiln</strong> is based on the well know Virginia Tech design, adapted for my own needs and materials I could find easily on local hardware stores. Mine is a small one, with a gross storage space inside of about 1.5 m in length, 0.85 m wide and 0.65 high (~5’ x 2.75’ x 2’ ). Why this small, first, I do mainly small projects, so 1.5 m (5’) long boards are more than enough for me, second, at this length I can easily transport with a small car some trunks to the mill, take some trees from peps who cut down theirs from the gardens etc, and maybe third reason, storage space after drying, once you have it dried to 7-9% you must keep it somewhere inside, or use it, otherwise leaving it outside the MC (moisture content) will return to 12-14%.</p>

During daytime, the sun will heat up the inside, an electrical fan will push the heat towards the wood stack heating them so they will release moisture, then recirculating the air trough the back, up again through the roof and so on until the evening when the vents needs to be opened for some minutes so the HOT/HUMID air formed inside will come out through the upper vents, and COLD/DRY air gets in through the bottom ones. Throughout the night the wood will rest, the moisture from the middle of the wood board will go towards the outsides, where it is more dried because it was heated whole day long, until they get even sort of. This in fact is one of the main advantage of a solar kiln compared to an industrial one, with permanent heating, the wood will have time to rest, no fast drying so will be prone to cracking and defects and an even moisture content. </p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1569503567387_37168"><div>

I have in plan for the next year when I will upgrade the kiln, to make the doors smaller by placing the bottom vents fixed, then the doors on top of them, make a steel frame on the floor to stack the boards on a more flat and sturdy area and put straps to tighten them so they will not twist (now I haven’t bothered with to much weights on the stack, the cherry was sitting for 4 months outside on air drying, did twist a bit, so it wasn’t so much to be done at this stage as it was dried), and also to insulate the floor, now is just an OSB board, maybe is ok in the summer, the heat loss there probably is not so meaningful, but I will add either a layer of wool or polystyrene sheet to get more efficiency if I will be using in spring and fall too.</p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1569503567387_43715"><div>

<p>This summer I have managed to dry two batches of that 25 mm (1”) thick cheery wood. It was already sitting about four months outside, stacked in a cool and no direct sun place, so it had about 12-14% MC. In eight days was able to bring the MC down to around 8%, I was lucky to catch some very hot days in August, outside temperature rising to about 36-38 C (100 F) and daytime RH to 25-30%, so in the kiln I could bring up the wood temperature at a maximum of 70C (158F) during the peak time at around 3-5 pm. More is described in the <a href="https://www.adrianpreda.com/blog/solar-kiln-run">next post</a>,  charts, hourly measurements, details etc.  </p>
