    <h1>Recurse Center: Week 4</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In my fourth week I focused on the Recurse Game Jam, which ran from Monday to Thursday. I teamed up with <a href="https://metavee.github.io/blog/">Robin</a> on her game <a href="https://github.com/metavee/puzdug-x86">puzdug-x86</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a> puzzle dungeon in x86 assembly. The game includes fog of war, player movement, mostly-static enemies, a win and loss condition, and color ASCII graphics. Robin had set out to make a game that fit in the boot sector, and we did briefly have a build that worked on a DOS-less Qemu instance! Unfortunately there is a 512 byte limit for the boot sector which we quickly shot past; the final product for the game jam was a whopping 1KB (how excessive üòÑ).</p>
<p>I loved working in such an unfamiliar and challenging environment as assembly. There‚Äôs a serenity to making a game with such an uphill climb, because it took pressure off my mind to make the game impressive. Shipping anything written in assembly is impressive enough, I think!</p>
<p>I also‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>Used Siri Shortcuts to parse a web endpoint for my local train times, and <a href="https://ryanisaacg.com/posts/path-times">blogged about it.</a></li>
<li>Finished up my <a href="https://ryanisaacg.com/posts/learning-lsps">first LSP blog post.</a></li>
<li>Made Hindsight, my ‚Äú20 second break after 20 minutes of screen‚Äù app, a little smarter. Previously it checked if the Zoom app was running to avoid interrupting me in a call; now it checks to see if my camera is on instead.</li>
<li>Went down a rabbit hole with wasm and dynamic linking. I didn‚Äôt end up achieving what I wanted to, but I learned some things that will hopefully make for an interesting blog post soon.</li>
