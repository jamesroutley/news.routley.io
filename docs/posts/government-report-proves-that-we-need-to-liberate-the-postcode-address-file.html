When Royal Mail was privatised, it did not just put the responsibility for postal deliveries into private hands, but the ownership and management of the UK Postcode Address File (PAF) too.</p><p>The PAF is a critically important national dataset. It’s not personal data – it’s a database that lists literally every physical postal address in the country, and it’s a very useful thing to have access to.</p><p>For example, it means that shopping sites can autocomplete your address on the checkout page when given just a postcode, and more importantly, researchers and developers can use it to learn more about our world, and build the tools, services and platforms of tomorrow.</p><p><span>Long term readers will know that I might have mentioned it before </span><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/t/paf" rel="">a few times</a><span>. The problem is it’s not an easy dataset to get hold of, as it cost a lot of money. This is because the data has to be licensed from Royal Mail – so it could cost you upwards of £6000 per year if you want to use address data inside, say, a website or app.</span></p><p><span>I’ve said </span><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/heres-the-plan-to-actually-liberate" rel="">before</a><span> that this is crazy. It’s tantamount to a </span><em>tax on innovation</em><span>. It’s a major barrier facing bedroom coders and small businesses that makes it harder to build the next big thing. And for the government, it’s a road block to economic growth.</span></p><p>That’s why in my view, the PAF should be released for free as open data, so that anyone who wants to can build cool stuff with accurate address data.</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/free-the-paf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe14cb7a6-0ee2-4adb-9436-6cd634e6e139_705x410.jpeg"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe14cb7a6-0ee2-4adb-9436-6cd634e6e139_705x410.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="This one weird trick could fix the British economy" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p>And I’m not the only one who thinks like this.</p><p>What makes the PAF situation maddening is that politicians already know the current status quo isn’t working.</p><p><span>For example, in George Osborne’s last budget in 2016, he </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2016-documents/budget-2016" rel="">rustled up</a><span> £5m to “develop options for an authoritative address register that is open and freely available,” and argued that “making wider use of more precise address data and ensuring it is frequently updated will unlock opportunities for innovation”.</span></p><p>But despite this commitment, eight years later, the PAF remains locked away, in private hands, behind a prohibitively expensive paywall.</p><p>So, I know what you’re thinking: What does the Ship of Theseus have to do with this?</p><p><span>Though it’s not clear exactly what the entirety of that £5m was spent on, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act</span><span>, I’ve managed to get my hands on the results of a key research paper that it paid for.</span></p><p>What it shows is a study where the (government owned) Ordnance Survey (OS) was instructed to attempt to recreate the PAF dataset – but crucially without using any intellectual property owned by Royal Mail.</p><p>In other words, the OS was asked to build a new UK Address database from scratch, so that it could conceivably be freely released as open data, with no licensing fees attached, for anyone to use.</p><p>It sounds like a great idea then, except for one thing: The result was, well, pretty disastrous.</p><p>As far as I can tell, until now the full report has never been published. And that’s probably because it illustrates beyond reasonable doubt why there is no other way around it. If Britain wants to unlock those opportunities for growth and innovation, then the only option is take back control of the Postcode Address File and release it as open data.</p><p>Now let’s dig into it and I’ll explain why.</p><p><em>If you like ultra-nerdy politics and policy stuff, then you will like my newsletter. Subscribe (for free!) to get more of This Sort Of Thing directly in your inbox. I swear not all of it is about postcodes.</em></p><p><span>So how do you build an address database without using expensive Royal Mail data? To start with, OS went back to one of the sources that Royal Mail uses to feed into the PAF, called the National Address Gazetteer (NAG)</span><span>.</span></p><p>The NAG is a different database of addresses that is compiled using data supplied by local authorities, government departments and the Ordnance Survey itself. When a new building is built locally, your council will submit changes to the NAG.</p><p>And by “something” I really do mean “something” – as unlike the PAF, which just contains building addresses, the NAG contains pretty much everything, including the addresses of utilities infrastructure (like electric substations), bus stops and parks.</p><p>Then to make matters even trickier, because the NAG is compiled by hundreds of different organisations sending in updates in a slightly freewheeling way, the data inside is also inconsistent and not standardised like it is in the PAF.</p><p><span>In other words, unlike the PAF, the NAG is </span><em>messy</em><span>. It’s the raw ore that comes out of the mine, where the useful minerals are mixed in with other rocks and dirt. What Royal Mail does with the PAF is basically refine it into solid gold bars of useful data.</span></p><p>So the first thing the OS team needed to do for their new database was a similar process. They had to figure out how to remove all of the unnecessary stuff in the NAG. And the way they did this first pass was by applying an algorithm to figure out what were useful buildings and what was other street junk.</p><p><span>To do this, they compared the NAG data with the graphic “</span><a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-mastermap-topography-layer" rel="">Master Map</a><span>” that the OS maintains of the entire country</span><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic" width="416" height="416" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;normal&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:750,&#34;width&#34;:750,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:416,&#34;bytes&#34;:107158,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/heic&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa53df464-b988-4ce1-88f2-2eac36996e3e_750x750.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>OS maps like this were used to try and populate the new database.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This filtering was more technically complex than it sounds. For example, if I’m understanding the report correctly, it appears that the OS literally analysed the vectors – the shapes of different objects on its map – to try and work out which entries in the NAG corresponded to buildings and individual addresses, and which were just, say, telegraph poles and postboxes.</p><p>Needless to say, this was quite a fuzzy matching process. In some cases, OS was forced to intuit addresses it couldn’t identify for certain. For example, it assumed that if it saw a group of three houses on a street, with number 10 and number 14 on either side, that number 12 sits between them.</p><p>And then there were some cases where the algorithm couldn’t work out what was in a given location at all. In those cases, the OS first attempted to manually fix the database by having a human eyeball the map and the associated data, and in some cases, the OS even sent staffers out to survey buildings in person.</p><p>The result of all of this hard work is pretty impressive: Over the course of the pilot OS managed to assemble a dataset of over 21 million fully complete address records – with a further ten million partially complete. In theory, that makes the new dataset roughly the same size as the PAF. So could it be that the government discovered a way to replicate the PAF without paying Royal Mail a penny?</p><p>There was just one problem. The data was crap.</p><p><span>To test how good the new database was, OS compared its creation to </span><em>another</em><span> address database – called AddressBase.

It could have actually built something more accurate with a slightly different approach.</p><p>For example, OS chose to not include other sources of “third party” address data in its new PAF-free dataset. It could have conceivably bought millions of addresses from companies like Experian, and mashed those addresses in too.</p><p><span>Or it could have done something really clever, like propose that whenever someone renews their driving licence or files their taxes at HMRC, that the government could collect all of the submitted addresses together, and fold them into the new address dataset. Over a long enough time, this would build up to contain every address in the country</span><span>.</span></p><p>And zooming out even further, when considering an alternative the PAF, the problem isn’t just the completeness of the data. Accuracy is important (see above!), but equally the people who want to use address data might value other factors, such as how regularly the database is updated, how quickly errors can be fixed, or whether specific categories of address are accurate.</p><p><span>But I think that to an extent, none of this really matters at this point. What this study proves is something much more important: That recreating the PAF, without using Royal Mail data, is </span><em>really, really hard</em><span>. It would be expensive, time consuming and result in a worse product overall. Oh, and it wouldn’t even be legally allowed to include, er, postcodes, as they are specifically owned by Royal Mail – which would render the data useless for a significant number of potential use-cases.</span></p><p>So really the Ordinance Survey has demonstrated that if we actually want the widely-recognised benefits of open address data, there is only one option: The government needs to take back control of this critical national dataset from Royal Mail. For growth and innovation, we need to liberate the Postcode Address File, because there is no other choice. Rebuilding the Ship of Theseus just isn’t a viable option.</p><p><em><span>Huge, huge thanks to my </span><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/i-had-a-meeting-with-the-shadow-business?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">comrades-in-PAF</a><span>: </span><a href="http://peterkwells.com" rel="">Peter Wells</a><span> for explaining the implications of this study to me, and whose analysis I’m mostly stealing above, and </span><a href="https://anna.ps" rel="">Anna Powell-Smith</a><span> for confirming that I’m not talking rubbish.</span></em></p><p><em>If you enjoy ultra-nerdy politics, policy, tech and media takes, then subscribe (for free) to get more stuff like this direct to your inbox – it’s not always about postcodes.</em></p><p><em>And if you *really* like my work, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription, as it is only with your support that I can do journalism like this.
