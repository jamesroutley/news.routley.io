    <h1>Whatever happened to cheap eReaders?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
					<p>Way back in 2012, The Guardian reviewed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/08/beagle-e-reader-review">an eInk reader which cost a mere £8</a>.</p>
					<p>The <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Txtr_beagle">txtr beagle</a> was designed to be a stripped-down and simplified eReader<sup id="fnref:txtr"><a href="#fn:txtr" role="doc-noteref" title="You can see some internal photos on this Mastodon thread.">0</a></sup>.</p>
					<p>As far as I can tell, it never shipped. There were a few <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Txtr_beagle">review units sent out</a> but I can&#39;t find any evidence of consumers getting their hands on one. Also, that £8 price was the <em>subsidised</em> price when purchased with a mobile contract.  Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828235409/http://gb.txtr.com/beagle/">website ceased working long ago</a>.</p>
					<p>But it got me intrigued. Moore&#39;s law is supposed to drive down the cost of electronics. So where are all the dirt-cheap eReaders?</p>
					<p>The cheapest Kindle for sale on Amazon UK right now is about £100.  Back in 2012, it was about £70. Taking <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator">inflation into account</a>, that price has stayed static.  Brands like Kobo are also in the £100 to £150 range.</p>
					<p>About the cheapest retail eReader is the <a href="https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/pocketbook-basic-lux-4-ink-black-6-8gb-wi-fi-e-reader-pb618-p-ww/version.asp">PocketBook Lux 4</a> for £85 or the (terribly reviewed) <a href="https://amzn.to/44dgZ9Y">Woxter Scriba</a> for £70.</p>
					<p>AliExpress has loads of second-hand and obsolete models at cheap-ish prices. But a surprising dearth of new eReaders.</p>
					<p>Going wholesale, <a href="https://www.alibaba.com">Alibaba</a> has a range of models, some of which clock in at around £30.</p>
					<p><img alt="Range of eReaders in a store. Each around £30." height="603" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/30-quid-eReaders.webp" width="1280"/></p><p>But, of course, that&#39;s before shipping and tax. They won&#39;t come with any manufacturer&#39;s warranty and don&#39;t expect any software updates. Also, good luck getting accessories!</p>
					<p>So what&#39;s stopping new eReaders being released at a cheap(er) price?  I think it comes down to four main things.</p>
					<h2 id="reading-is-a-niche-hobby">
						<a href="#reading-is-a-niche-hobby">Reading is a niche hobby</a>
					</h2>
					<p><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/entertainment/articles/51730-40-of-britons-havent-read-a-single-book-in-the-last-12-months">Around 40% of UK adults didn&#39;t read a single book last year</a>.  That survey combines reading books and listening to audiobooks. Of the 60% who do read/listen, about 14% primarily listen. Of those that read, around 60% do so on paper books.</p>
					<p>If reading is niche, reading electronically is a tiny niche! This is somewhat of a chicken-and-egg argument. If an eReader were the same cost as a mass-market paperback, I&#39;m sure many more paper-book readers would become converts.</p>
					<p>The whole point of an eInk reader is that it is a distraction-free environment. Yeah, you <em>could</em> scroll TikTok on one, but it isn&#39;t a pleasant experience. An eReader is designed for one thing only, unlike a phone or tablet. Do enough people want to carry yet-another-bloody-device just for reading?</p>
					<h2 id="eink-is-expensive">
						<a href="#eink-is-expensive">eInk is expensive</a>
					</h2>
					<p>The company which makes eInk hold several patents on the process. They&#39;re not a patent troll; they&#39;re building a business and selling mega-hectares of the stuff. Understandably, they have an interest in keeping prices high.  They don&#39;t want to cannibalise their own market.</p>
					<p>A basic 6 inch screen with wiring costs around £20 wholesale - that&#39;s from Alibaba, so doesn&#39;t include tax and shipping.  That&#39;s before you&#39;ve added any electronics or a operating system.</p>
					<p>Speaking of which…</p>
					<h2 id="android-is-a-bottleneck">
						<a href="#android-is-a-bottleneck">Android is a bottleneck</a>
					</h2>
					<p>The promise of the Android Open Source Project was a free Operating System for anyone to use. The reality has been a little different.  Most people want to be able to use basic Android functionality - like download operating system updates or reading apps.  But Google doesn&#39;t allow that for eInk devices.</p>
					<p>As I understand it, <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/9/android-9-cdd#7_1_6_screen_technology">Google requires Android devices to have colour screens</a> and, so I&#39;ve read, won&#39;t certify eInk eReaders for newer versions of Android.</p>
					<p>So manufacturers have to source parts which have drivers for older versions of Android. Or they have to develop their own OSes.</p>
					<h2 id="books-are-fungible">
						<a href="#books-are-fungible">Books are fungible</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Back when Apple sold iPods, they knew that the majority of purchasers would buy MP3s direct from Apple. The perfect symbiotic relationship! But the walled-gardens cracked and now people can buy their music from anywhere.</p>
					<p>Amazon keeps this model for its eBooks. Unless you&#39;re prepared to get technical, you can only read Amazon books on your Amazon Kindle paid for with your Amazon wallet.</p>
					<p>Games consoles are often sold at a loss because the manufacturer knows they&#39;ll make it up in game sales and subscriptions.</p>
					<p>A low-price manufacturer is unlikely to also run a book store and wouldn&#39;t be able to cross-subsidise their hardware with content sales.</p>
					<h2 id="alternatives">
						<a href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Some people have tried <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/10/31/building-an-open-hardware-ebook-reader/">building open source eReaders</a> but they&#39;re either abandoned, <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-6plus#products">not suitable for production</a>, or <a href="https://pine64eu.com/product/pinenote-community-edition/">ridiculously expensive</a>.</p>
					<p>Buying second hand is relatively cheap - often under £50. But eInk screens can be brittle, and older ones may have scratches or cracks which are effectively unrepairable.</p>
					<h2 id="how-cheap-is-cheap">
						<a href="#how-cheap-is-cheap">How cheap is cheap?</a>
					</h2>
					<p>I&#39;d love a £8 eReader. Something I could throw in a pocket and not worry about damaging. An eReader which was the same price as a hardback book - around £20 - would be amazing.</p>
					<p>But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get there soon. The monopoly on screen technologies sets a retail floor of around £30, before the rest of the hardware is taken into account. Niche hardware is viable - but only with decent OS support. Other than Kobo and Amazon, no book retailer wants to stray outside their core competency to develop and subsidise hardware.</p>
					<p>So I guess it&#39;s buy second-hand, or wait for the patents to expire.</p>
