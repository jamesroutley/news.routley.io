    <h1>InVision design collaboration services shutdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tweet-selection"><div><p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>InVision Community, </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>Today I am writing to share that after careful consideration we have made the difficult decision to discontinue InVision’s design collaboration services (including prototypes, DSM, etc) at the end of 2024. For important information, details, and guidance on next steps read our </span><a href="https://support.invisionapp.com/"><span>FAQs</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>As you may know, our Freehand visual collaboration product was acquired by Miro earlier this fall. Miro has <a href="https://miro.com/blog/future-miro-freehand">exciting plans for Freehand</a> and will be communicating with Freehand customers directly moving forward.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>We recognize the decision to end-of-life our design collaboration services will impact your creative process and workflows. We wanted to share our plans with ample notice so that you can plan accordingly. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>In the coming months, the services you know and love will not be changing. For our Enterprise customers, our Sales team will be working with you directly to answer any questions you may have about this transition and direct you to alternative solutions, should they be required. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>For our self-serve (non-Enterprise) customers, you will be able to continue using InVision until the end of 2024. However, we have discontinued our annual subscription offerings. Instead, you will be able to use the services on one of our monthly subscription options. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>We understand that this announcement may be met with a spectrum of emotions, and we want to assure you that our primary focus is on making this transition as smooth as possible. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>On behalf of all InVisioners, I want to convey our appreciation for the trust and support you’ve shown us. Your commitment to InVision has been our heartbeat for the last 12 years and we are genuinely thankful for the privilege of being part of your creative process. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>We’re so grateful to all of you who invested time and energy into making InVision the incredible company that it’s grown to be. Together we reimagined how designers collaborate, raised the importance of design thinking, and, in the process, helped revolutionize the design industry. </span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>And so we close this chapter with heartfelt gratitude and with the comfort that the state of the design industry is stronger than ever, leaving the InVision community in good hands.</span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>Thank you once again,</span></p>
<p data-text-variant="body-copy-400"><span>Michael Shenkman</span><span><br/>
</span><span>CEO, InVisionApp, Inc.</span></p>
