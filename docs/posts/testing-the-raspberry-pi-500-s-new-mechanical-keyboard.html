<p>Instead of a traditional review of a new Pi product, I thought I&#39;d split things up on my blog, and write two separate posts; this one about the Pi 500+&#39;s new mechanical keyboard, and a separate post about <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/full-egpu-acceleration-on-pi-500-15-line-patch">hacking in an eGPU on the Pi 500+</a>, for a massive uplift in gaming performance and local LLMs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500-plus/">Raspberry Pi 500+</a> was announced today, sells for $200, and adds on the following over what was present in the regular Pi 500:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built-in M.2 NVMe SSD (256GB, 2230-size Pi branded drive) in a 2280-size slot</li>
<li>16 GB LPDDR4x RAM (over the Pi 500&#39;s 8)</li>
<li>Low-profile RGB-backlit mechanical keyboard with Gateron KS-33 Blue switches</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a full video covering the Pi 500+ up on YouTube, and you can watch it below, as well:</p>

<h2>A Mechanical Keyboard</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-pulling-keycaps.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-acd918cc-8cac-468c-8b12-2720cdf8e690" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;acd918cc-8cac-468c-8b12-2720cdf8e690&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 500+ replacing keycaps"/></p>

<p>Like any modern mechanical keyboard, the Pi 500+&#39;s uses standard keycaps, mounted on top of <a href="https://www.gateron.co/products/gateron-low-profile-mechanical-switch-set">Gateron KS-33 Low Profile Blue</a> switches.</p>

<p>The keycaps feel nice, the larger keys like Space, left Shift, Enter, and Backspace all have extra bracing, and I had no problem pulling keycaps with a few different key pullers.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-rgb.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-025b9421-7ca7-49d5-a0fe-5c62d8dd813b" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;025b9421-7ca7-49d5-a0fe-5c62d8dd813b&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 500+ RGB lighting effect"/></p>

<p>Each key has an individually-controllable RGB LED below, and the keyboard comes preprogrammed with a dozen or so lighting effects. More can be configured in Raspberry Pi&#39;s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/keyboard-computers.html#raspberry-pi-500-customisation">keyboard configuration tools</a> (I used a preview version of it in my testing).</p>

<p>The keyboard runs on an RP2040, like many other modern mechanical keyboards, running a Pi fork of the popular QMK firmware. It <em>should</em> be compatible with tools like <a href="https://usevia.app">VIA</a>, for browser-based keyboard configuration, but that will require a slightly different process, and possibly a keyboard firmware update.</p>

<h2>How does it feel and sound?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-59-dba.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-bb287810-d7c0-4d65-a306-153afc9f57a7" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;bb287810-d7c0-4d65-a306-153afc9f57a7&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 500+ Mechanical Keyboard Typing Sound 59 dBa"/></p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a clickety-clack keyboard, with the blue switches Raspberry Pi chose (note: the plastic inside is grey, not blue).</p>

<p>I personally favor quieter key switches, and you can see I was getting about 60 dBa measured 1&#39; away, but as long as you&#39;re not in a computer lab full of these things, the noise is tolerable.</p>

<p>It feels surprisingly good; I could type on this keyboard <em>much</em> easier than I can on the Pi 400/Pi 500&#39;s flat keyboard, which feels like an old, cheap laptop keyboard.</p>

<p>One nice thing about using standard mechanical switches, though, is you can choose other keycaps to alter the look and feel of the Pi 500+&#39;s keyboard.</p>

<h2>Swapping out keycaps</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-replacement-style-1.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-f57454e9-9717-4522-b7ad-5e2e38c0761b" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;f57454e9-9717-4522-b7ad-5e2e38c0761b&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 500+ with alternate slim keycaps 1"/></p>

<p>I promise, the image above was not edited in any way; pictured above are <a href="https://amzn.to/4gOhvzu">dagaladoo Low Profile Double Shot PBT keycaps</a>, and from this camera angle it looks like someone just took full-height keycaps and squished them down to 25% height!</p>

<p>It took about 20 minutes to swap out all the keycapsâ€”though I left the power button in place. The Pi 500+ keyboard firmware keeps that key green when power is on, and red when power is off, and it&#39;s nice to have it shine the light through on the little light pipe built into Raspberry Pi&#39;s key.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> install full-height keys on the low-profile switches, but many will bottom out when pressed. This works on some keys, like my spare Keychron set (pictured below), but it didn&#39;t feel great, so I would stick with low profile keycaps.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-keycap-full-height.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-87cfbf66-5cf1-4532-870a-1bcc8f0a7a3a" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;87cfbf66-5cf1-4532-870a-1bcc8f0a7a3a&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Escape key full height on Raspberry Pi 500+"/></p>

<p>I also tried a set of <a href="https://amzn.to/4pJUHoA">KBDiy 9009 Retro Keycaps</a>, and as I describe in the video, typing on those felt like typing on some kind of dry sugar candy. It wasn&#39;t a bad feeling, it was just weird:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi500plus-keyboard-replacement-style-2.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-63e9b48d-194b-43e9-b02f-eacb1f5945c9" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;63e9b48d-194b-43e9-b02f-eacb1f5945c9&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 500+ with alternate slim keycaps 2"/></p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to be able to alter the look and feel of the Pi 500+ by swapping out keycaps. And the underlying keyboard construction seems a <em>lot</em> nicer than the Pi 500 and Pi 400 that came before. (The Pi 500+ weighs almost 600g, nearly double the Pi 500&#39;s 385g.)</p>

<p>The fact the keyboard top shell is completely separate from the Pi 500+&#39;s main body means someone might even be able to hack in an even more solid mechanical keyboard.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The new keyboard is a vast improvement over the previous Pi keyboards. It&#39;s not as nice as a high-end mechanical keyboard, but I would compare it favorably to a midrange or low-end keyboard like the Razer Huntsman.</p>

<p>Not being able to change out the switches is a let-down, as the clickety-clack of blue switches isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s cup of tea. But having any option besides the &#39;2000s chicklet&#39; style of prior generations is good.</p>
