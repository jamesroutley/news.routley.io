    <h1>Reviewing the Cryptography Used by Signal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Last year, I <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/05/14/its-time-for-furries-to-stop-using-telegram/">urged furries to stop using Telegram</a> because it doesn’t actually provide them with any of the privacy guarantees they <em>think</em> it gives them. Instead of improving Telegram’s cryptography to be actually secure, the CEO started spreading misleading bullshit about Signal<a href="#trademark">®</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve been flooded with people asking me about <a href="https://soatok.blog/encrypted-messaging-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various other encrypted messaging apps</a> and accused by Internet reply-guys of having malicious intentions. Some of the more egregiously stupid accusations were that I was somehow being paid to promote Signal.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Not only am I not being paid to promote Signal, I refuse to ever be paid to promote <em>anything</em> ever! <strong>I’ve been <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/07/02/my-furry-blog-is-not-an-opportunity-to-develop-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/05/18/avoiding-the-frigid-hellscape-of-online-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/12/26/roasted-christmas-spam-from-muhu-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/12/29/for-your-infurmation/#:~:text=Ad%20revenue%3A%20Still%20%240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To be clear, being accused of being a paid shill for recommending Signal isn’t exactly unique to Signal, it also happens with other technologies.</p>



<p>For example: Have you ever wondered by influencers (streamers, vloggers, etc.) always promote “<a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VPN services</a>” instead of Tor (which is free)?</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s not just “today’s sponsor”, either.</p>



<p>Bad security advice, usually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207173047/https://infosecforactivists.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketed as infosec advice for activists</a>, absolutely <em>loves</em> to recommend specific VPN companies. Interestingly, they frequently make no mention of Tor. When you point this out, the same crowd will <a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/25M1U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try to weasel in FUD about Tor</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soatok</strong>: That they recommend a VPN and not Tor in their first table immediately makes me suspicious.</p>
<cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250211092400/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42941848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archive.org mirror</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>First Reply:</strong> Why? I’ve personally seen more news articles about Tor users getting de-anonymized than I have VPN users. […]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rhetorical sleight-of-hand here isn’t particularly clever.</p>



<ul>
<li>Tor uses onion-routing to provide anonymity to Internet traffic.</li>



<li>VPNs just provide an encrypted tunnel to another ISP, and therefore do not offer anonymity.</li>



<li>You can’t <em>deanonymize</em> VPN users because they were never <em>anonymized</em> to begin with!</li>



<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VPN providers that lied about “no logs”</a> never faced any meaningful consequences.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tor is at least as private as any VPN. If you’re worried about exit nodes, only use Tor to access Onion Services or websites that use HTTPS.</p>





<p>As a security engineer that specializes in applied cryptography, I’m generally not interested in the “Tor vs VPN” debate.</p>



<p>I’m <em>much</em> more interested in the “WireGuard vs OpenVPN” debate (on the side of WireGuard), and what lessons about software security the rest of the industry could learn from WireGuard.</p>



<p>In fact: If someone is promoting a VPN service in 2025 and that service doesn’t use WireGuard as its underlying protocol, they are almost certainly LARPing at security expertise rather than offering valuable advice.</p>



<p>But I digress.</p>



<p>Like Tor, Signal doesn’t cost you anything to use. Nobody makes money by telling you to use either of those things. </p>



<p>Despite having no financial incentive for doing so, security and privacy experts (including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/tech/secure-chat-apps-signal-tor-browser/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the EFF’s director of cybersecurity, Eva Galperin</a>) constantly stake their reputation by recommending Tor and Signal.</p>



<p>And therein lies the question: Is Signal’s cryptography <em>actually</em> good? And how can we be sure of that?</p>



<p>To know this, we first need to discuss cryptography audits.</p>





<h2 id="audits">Audits For Normies</h2>



<p>Audits are a type of engagement between a vendor and a team of security consultants with specific expertise in the technologies involved.</p>



<p>How an audit works is, loosely:</p>



<ul>
<li>The vendor (or a third party, such as <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSTIF</a>) hires the consultants for a timeboxed assessment of the security of the product or service in question.</li>



<li>The consultants (ideally with the source code in hand) will then try to find any way to subvert the normal operation of the product/service, especially in a way that’s useful for an attacker.</li>



<li>Any findings that result from the consultants’ work are compiled together into an Audit Report, with specific recommendations for remediating the issues they identified.</li>



<li>The vendor responds by either fixing each issue, or documenting them as known limitations if a fix is impractical.</li>



<li>Optional: The Audit Report is made public.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regardless of the expertise of the consultants, every audit suffers from the same limitations:</p>



<ol>
<li>The engagement has a specific timebox, which means that coverage will be finite.</li>



<li>The engagement is performed over a finite number of snapshots of the source code (typically, one commit hash), so each subsequent commit to the codebase erodes the relevance of the audit.</li>



<li>The consultants are human beings, and therefore imperfect.</li>
</ol>



<p>Furthermore, performing an audit of a product or service without a clear threat model can lead to a lot of disagreement about the relevance or severity of any findings.</p>



<p>This cuts both ways: High-severity issues could actually be nothingburgers to the users of the app, or “informational” findings could be a dealbreaker to your users. Lacking clarity about the security goals and assumptions can hamstring any efforts to providing security assurance.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, sometimes you will see encrypted messaging apps proudly proclaim, “We were audited” when facing criticism, except:</p>



<ul>
<li>Their last audit was 5+ years (and/or over 1000 commits) ago.</li>



<li>They only have the one public audit report.</li>



<li>The company and/or person that did the audit has no other online footprint, including other audits, and only seemed to pop up to opine about this one vendor.</li>



<li>The audit report <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/09/28/the-bi-symmetric-encryption-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads more like sales copy</a> than a critical analysis of the product’s security.</li>



<li>The timebox for the audit is tiny compared to the quantity and complexity of the software in question.</li>
</ul>



<p>It <strong>isn’t</strong> important that the company providing the audit be one of the more recognizable names (e.g., for cryptography: <a href="https://cure53.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cure53</a>, <a href="https://kudelskisecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kudelski Security</a>, <a href="https://leastauthority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Least Authority</a>, <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NCC Group</a>, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail of Bits</a>, and myriad blockchain / smart contract security firms that sometimes demonstrate real cryptography chops). </p>



<p>Plenty of smaller security consulting teams do excellent work.</p>



<p>What a more recognizable brand gives you, however, is a reasonable amount of quality control: They’re generally better resourced to ensure that the appropriate experts are assigned to each project, so you’re less likely to end up with a useless rubber-stamp Audit Report than you might from a one-person shop in over their head.</p>



<p>It’s probably better to use the list above to inform your heuristics for assessing the credibility of an Audit Report, rather relying on, “Did the biggest name sign off on it?”</p>



<h3>Why Are You Telling Us All This?</h3>



<p>Because, like the title says, I’m going to review the cryptography used by Signal.</p>





<p>This series is morally equivalent to the sort of work you’d get from an audit, if it were timeboxed over a weekend rather than several weeks.</p>



<h3>Objectives For This Series</h3>



<p>I’m writing this series in the same spirit as <a href="https://decentsecurity.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SwiftOnSecurity’s Decent Security</a> guides:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everyone can be secure.</strong></p>



<p>It is with those four words this website is founded. Computer, smartphone, and online security does not require a degree or years of experience. All it requires is someone show you the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My spin on the Decent Security mission statement is a bit more ambitious, if narrowly scoped:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can understand applied cryptography.</strong></p>



<p>Although the bar for designing and implementing cryptography must be very high to prevent <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/31/hell-is-overconfident-developers-writing-encryption-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overconfident developers from making preventable mistakes that hurt users</a>, being able to critique the security of private messaging apps is a skill anyone is capable of learning.</p>



<p>Verifying the security claims made by an encrypted messaging app does not require a Ph.D in mathematics or an encyclopedic knowledge of software vulnerabilities. All it requires is someone teaching the fundamentals, and then indulging in a bit of self-exploration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Time will tell if I’m successful or not.</p>



<p>Additionally, Key Transparency <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/commit/949760d2ae6590ffaaa6f8eb1161be2598a24aa9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has recently landed in libsignal</a> (though it has not been consistently implemented in the Signal app yet).</p>



<h3>A Note On Timeboxing</h3>



<p>I did the header image and wrote this blog post earlier, but I did the entirety of this cryptography review over the course of a single weekend. That was the original timebox I set for myself.</p>



<p>I do feel that, if I had allocated more time to it, I might have been able to explain some of the later components in greater detail.</p>



<p>However, as I was writing this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217134434/https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musks-x-blocks-links-to-signal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter decided to ban links to signal.me</a> in an attempt to censor Signal users. Thus, I decided to pull the trigger and stay true to my original timebox.</p>
