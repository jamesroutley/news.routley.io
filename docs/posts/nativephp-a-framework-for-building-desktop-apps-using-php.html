    <h1>NativePHP: A framework for building desktop apps using PHP</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>⚠️</span>

                        NativePHP is currently an <em>alpha</em> release and is not ready for production applications
                        yet.
                    </span>

<p>NativePHP is a new framework for rapidly building rich, native desktop applications using PHP. If you&#39;re already a PHP
developer, you&#39;ll feel right at home. If you&#39;re new to PHP, we think you&#39;ll find NativePHP easy to pick up and use.
Whatever your path, we think you&#39;re going to be productive quickly.</p>
<p>NativePHP is taking the world by storm, enabling PHP developers to create true cross-platform, native apps
using the tools and technologies they already know: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and, of course, PHP.</p>
<p>And they said PHP was dead.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-nativephp"><a href="#what-exactly-is-nativephp"><p>#</p></a>What exactly is NativePHP?</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, NativePHP is a combination of elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>A collection of easy-to-use classes - abstractions - to enable you to interact with a variety of host operating
system features.</li>
<li>A set of tools to enable building and bundling your native application using either the Electron or Tauri browser
environment.</li>
<li>A static PHP runtime that allows your app to run on any user&#39;s system with zero effort on their part.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-nativephp-isnt"><a href="#what-nativephp-isnt"><p>#</p></a>What NativePHP isn&#39;t</h2>
<p>NativePHP is not an especially opinionated way to build native apps. Right now, we only support a Laravel driver, but
we&#39;re already working on making it work whatever framework you&#39;re using - and even if you&#39;re not using a framework at
all.</p>
<p>NativePHP is not a GUI framework. We don&#39;t want to tell you how to build your app. You can choose whatever UI toolset
makes you and your team feel most productive.</p>
<p>Building a React front-end? No problem. Vue? Sure. Livewire or Inertia? Doesn&#39;t matter! Plain old HTML and CSS?
You got it. Tailwind? Bootstrap? Material UI? Whatever you want.</p>
<p>NativePHP is not some new custom fork of PHP. This is the good old PHP you know and love.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-the-box"><a href="#whats-in-the-box"><p>#</p></a>What&#39;s in the box?</h2>
<p>NativePHP comes with a bunch of useful features out of the box, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window management</li>
<li>Menu management</li>
<li>File management</li>
<li>Database support (SQLite)</li>
<li>Native notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this and more is explored in the rest of these docs.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-build-with-nativephp"><a href="#what-can-i-build-with-nativephp"><p>#</p></a>What can I build with NativePHP?</h2>
<p>Honestly, anything you want. We believe NativePHP is going to empower thousands of developers to build all kinds of
applications. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>You could build a menubar app that lets you manage your cron jobs, or a cool new launcher app, or a screen recorder
that puts cowboy hats on every smiley-face emoji it sees.</p>
<p>(You should totally build that last one.)</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next"><p>#</p></a>What&#39;s next?</h2>
