<p><strong>One of the highlighted Expedition 41/42 experiments is a new Rodent Habitat to be deployed aboard ISS. Space Shuttle missions flew these habitats on a regular basis to examine changes in mice and rats during short duration flights, but no such facility existed for ISS to conduct studies on a longer time scale of up to a month or more. To comply with ISS standards for both, operations and safety, the Rodent Habitat used on the Shuttle had to be modified.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first experiment, known as Rodent Research-1 is a pure demonstration that only serves the purpose of verifying the hardware is functional and the mice are receiving the proper support (air, light, food, water, waste removal) that allows them to live for several months aboard the Space Station as later experiments may be up to three months in duration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodent Habitat itself is built to comply with the Express Rack standards for easy integration into ISS laboratory systems. The payloads consist of a Rodent Habitat for installation aboard ISS and a Rodent Transporter that facilitates the animals during ascent aboard the SpaceX Dragon. An Animal Access Unit AAU allows crew members to deliver the mice from the transporter to the habitat and to retrieve the animals for science operations. All components were developed at NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center.</strong></p>
