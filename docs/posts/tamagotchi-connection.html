<p>The <b>Tamagotchi Connection</b>, known as <b>Tamagotchi Plus</b> in Japan and <b>Tamagotchi Connexion</b> in the UK, is a virtual pet in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi" title="Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a> line of digital toys from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai" title="Bandai">Bandai</a>. The Tamagotchi Connection is unique from prior models in that it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" title="Infrared">infrared</a> technology to connect and interact with other devices<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and was first released in 2004, 8 years after the first Tamagotchi toy. Using the device&#39;s infrared port, the virtual pet (referred to as a Tamagotchi) can make friends with other Tamagotchis, in addition to playing games, giving and receiving presents and having a baby.
</p><p>Versions 1 to 4 of <b>Tamagotchi Connection</b> have 6 levels of friendship that can be viewed in the Friends List:
</p>
<ul><li>Acquaintance (one smiley-face)</li>
<li>Buddy (two smiley-faces)</li>
<li>Friend (three smiley-faces)</li>
<li>Good friend (four smiley-faces)</li>
<li>Best friend (two love-hearts, two smiley-faces, during connection they may kiss)</li>
<li>Partner (four love-hearts, during connection they will kiss and may have babies)</li></ul><p>
Versions 5 and 6 have different levels.</p><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clich%C3%A9_2007-07-17_15-08-25.jpg"><img alt="text" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Clich%C3%A9_2007-07-17_15-08-25.jpg" decoding="async" width="260" height="345" data-file-width="260" data-file-height="345"/></a><figcaption>Four Tamagotchi toys</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Tamagotchi cannot find a partner from another device to have babies with, a matchmaker will come, allowing the Tamagotchi to have a baby with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a>-controlled Tamagotchi character. This applies to versions 1 to 4 and 6 only. Version 5 introduces a Dating Show game in which the user must play to gain a CPU partner.

<p>The Tamagotchi Connection v2 introduces &#34;Gotchi Points&#34;, an in-game currency used to buy shop items. Also, more games are unlocked as the Tamagotchi ages. It has 6 stages of life:
</p>
<ul><li>Egg - This only occurs once the device has been reset, either by pressing the reset button on the rear of the device or by installing a new battery. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.</li>
<li>Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jump.</li>
<li>Child - The child unlocks the game Bump.</li>
<li>Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Flag and Heading.</li>
<li>Adult - The adult unlocks the game Slot.</li>
<li>Senior. The senior can only be unlocked if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days. This applies to all versions.</li></ul>

<p>Aside from different games, The Tamagotchi Connection v3 makes few changes in comparison to the v2. Like the v2, the older the Tamagotchi gets, the more games it has access to, and there are still six stages of life.
</p>
<ul><li>Egg - Like the v2, the egg is the first stage and occurs when the device has been reset. When the clock has been set, the egg will hatch in one minute.</li>
<li>Baby - The baby unlocks the game Get Music.</li>
<li>Child. The child unlocks the game Bump.</li>
<li>Teenager. The teenager unlocks the games Flag and Heading.</li>
<li>Adult. The adult unlocks the games Memory and Sprint.</li>
<li>Senior. Like on the v2, the Senior can only be unlocked if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days.</li></ul>
<p>Other differences from the v2
</p>
<ul><li>There is no &#39;Treat&#39; option in the food.</li>
<li>There are new &#39;Password&#39; and &#39;Souvenir&#39; options.</li>
<li>When you are connecting with another v3, visiting is a new option.</li>
<li>There are new &#39;Point&#39; and &#39;Family&#39; options in the friendbook.</li></ul>

<p>As in previous versions, Tamagotchis play games for a certain number of &#34;Gotchi Points&#34; and unlock more games as it ages.
</p>
<ul><li>Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.</li>
<li>Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jumping Rope.</li>
<li>Child - The child unlocks the game Mimic.</li>
<li>Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Shape, Dance and Flag.</li>
<li>Adult - As an adult, the Tamagotchi can get a job which unlocks various mini-games, depending on what job the player chooses for the Tamagotchi.</li>
<li>Senior - Much like previous versions, the Senior life stage can only be achieved if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days.</li></ul>
<p>The Tamagotchi Connection makes additional changes to gameplay instead of simply changing the games and other minor details. For example, the child and teenager can go to school and play mini-games, where an adult can get a job. Also, the &#34;Lamp&#34; menu item (allows the user to turn the &#34;light&#34; on or off) is no longer present. Instead, it is replaced with a &#34;Mail&#34; menu item where the player can check for any mail they will occasionally receive.
</p><p>New to the Tamagotchi Connection with the v4 is the ability for a child or teenager Tamagotchi to go to school and an adult to go to work. The player can choose which teacher they want once the Tamagotchi reaches the Teenage stage, and will train either &#34;Intelligence Points&#34;, &#34;Style Points&#34; and &#34;Kindness Points&#34; through mini-games. The player also chooses what job an adult Tamagotchi gets and will unlock mini-games based on this choice. It also introduces characters being separated by groups (Mame, Meme, Kuchi and Universal) and genders.

<p>The Connection v4.5 makes minimal changes to gameplay from the v4, short of adding new games; however, the way to obtain the Universal family is different.
</p>
<ul><li>Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.</li>

<p>The Tamagotchi Connection v5 is the English version of the FamiTama and is the first Tamagotchi to be exactly the same (besides language) worldwide since the Tamagotchi Plus. It was released in Asia on January 6, 2008, in Australia on January 10, 2008, and was released worldwide later in February 2008. The v5 introduces the ability to raise families, with 3-5 parents and kids. It also has a new website that it shares with the Famitama, the &#34;Tama and Earth Expo&#34;. According to the package, &#34;The Tamagotchis set up this expo to learn more about Earth.&#34; It contains a central pavilion and 4 other pavilions representing each of the main areas of the Earth. It also included a TV option where the player can use Gotchi Points to shop on the Shopping Channel, find a mate with the Dating Show, or go travelling on the Travelling Show which replaces the pause function of previous generations. There is a design flaw with the v5 which prevents it from properly connecting to the other Tamagotchis in the series.
</p><p>Your tamagotchi can also then be sent to school. You can decide how your tamagotchi will act towards others and the actions it makes. For example, it can be mean to the other tamagotchis, or even pee on the floor while presenting a project and get embarrassed!
</p><p>Differences from previous versions:
</p>
<ul><li>Individual Tamagotchis cannot be named. Instead, a family name is selected and individuals are identified by their character type.</li>
<li>There is a family bond percentage</li>
<li>The Discipline is replaced with a Play option.</li>
<li>The Medicine chest is expanded to contain general items as well.</li></ul>

<li>Baby</li>
<li>Child</li>
<li>Teenager</li>

<p>The Tamagotchi Connection v6 is the final release in the Connection series and allows the Tamagotchi to become a pop star.
