	  <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A million years ago, in 2017, Teenage Engineering (<a href="https://disk.horse/the-perfect-thing">previously</a>) announced a new product in collaboration with Chinese tech company Baidu: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyWTx9ExAjQ">a robotic smart speaker called R</a>. It wasn&#39;t pure vaporware, either—a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoMxANGOoaI">gorgeous little behind-the-scenes video</a> from TE showed multiple prototypes. Clearly, at some level, a device like this is technologically feasible.</p>
<p>It would have been expensive, certainly—my totally uninformed guess is that the R would have retailed for between two and three grand.</p>
<p>But Baidu didn&#39;t move forward with the R, and I haven&#39;t seen any similar products even teased since, from TE or anyone else.</p>
<p>I have a DJI Osmo gimbal for my phone. It&#39;s a robotic selfie stick that smooths out rotation introduced by the movement of the user&#39;s hand. Its three motors are absolutely silent, it cost about a hundred bucks, and it&#39;s absolutely magical.</p>
<p>If I can buy a mass-market handheld three-axis robot for a hundred bucks, why can&#39;t I buy something like the R for a thousand? I don&#39;t know the answer, but I have a theory.</p>
<p>What would little a six-axis robot arm on my desk be useful for? Almost nothing.</p>
<p>What are we going to put on the end of the arm? Not a hand or gripper of any kind, obviously. We&#39;ve got a six motor budget, and we&#39;ve already used them all getting to six-axis movement.</p>
<p>You could attach a camera to the end, making it the world&#39;s smallest motion control rig. It&#39;d be great at keeping the camera pointed at you as you wander the room (except we already do that in software). It also could do those perfect, repeatable, swoopy camera moves straight out of Hollywood—as long as you don&#39;t mind doing them around nothing bigger than a coffee mug.</p>
<p>What about holding a little display? Sure—in fact, combine that with the camera and it could follow you around a room, making sure the display is always facing you. With six-axis control, it could even stabilize the display relative to your eyes, making it feel almost like an augmented reality HUD. That would be cool and weird—but even if it enables this very specific illusion, that doesn&#39;t solve a problem or do anything obviously useful. It also might give you motion sickness.</p>
<p>With a pen attachment, it could draw things—slower and worse than a printer, of course.</p>
<p>You could put some kind of a mouse-like blob on the end and use it as an extremely impractical input device.</p>
<p>I still think someone should make one, even though there&#39;s only one thing  it could really do better than anything else already cluttering my desk.</p>
<p>In addition to whatever else they do, our robots should also dance.</p>
