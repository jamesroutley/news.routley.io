    <h1>I Made a Crossword! (Sat. Nov 16, 2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A while ago, I wrote some crossword puzzle creation software, and I had some time recently to create with it.</p>



<p>So, here’s my crossword for Saturday, 2024-11-16!</p>

<p>I give this one a 3/5. There are a few single-letter clues and three “?” clues (Clues ending in “?” are a real stretch – basically, I crossworded myself into a corner and had to make something up.) Not great but also not terrible 🙂</p>



<p>I also think my clue-writing needs some practice, but that’s why I’m doing this! Let me know if you try it and run into any clues that you think could be improved.</p>
