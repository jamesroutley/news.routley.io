    <h1>Hetzner Cloud – Singapore location available</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This page tracks major releases and incremental improvements for the Hetzner Cloud platform.</p></div><div><section><h2 id="2024-08">August 2024</h2><div><div><div><div><p><span><h3 id="2024-08-06-hetzner-goes-singapore---new-location-available-">Hetzner Goes Singapore  – New location available 🇸🇬</h3><a href="#2024-08-06-hetzner-goes-singapore---new-location-available-"></a></span></p></div><div><p>In addition to our five existing locations, Singapore is now also available!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available for many products</strong>
Singapore is available for all cloud servers with AMD processors, and all cloud features.</li>
<li><strong>First location in Southeast Asia</strong>
Singapore, a data center hub, provides exceptional network connectivity that caters to both local and overseas connections. It also expands our offer to a total of six locations in four different countries and on three continents.</li>
<li><strong>Fair prices</strong>
This connectivity comes at a higher price for our products in Singapore compared to other locations. This also applies to charges for exceeding the included traffic limit. Of course, fair prices are still vital to us at Hetzner, and we always strive to provide attractive prices at all of our locations!</li>
<li><strong>Raffle</strong>
To celebrate the new location, we will hold a raffle with a chance to win a merch package. The top three winners will also receive either a Lego Hero or a Lego data center model. All you need to do to get your name in the hat is order a server in the new location in Singapore, test it for a month, and send a mail with your account number to &#34;<a href="mailto:socialmedia@hetzner.com">socialmedia@hetzner.com</a>&#34;. For more information, see our <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/legal/giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of participation</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>BETTER OVERVIEW</strong>
To give you a clearer overview, the activities are now sorted by month and you can easily switch between the months as you need.</li>
<li><strong>EASY NAVIGATION</strong>
More activities are automatically loaded as you scroll down, eliminating the need to switch between different pages and enhancing load times for a smoother user experience.</li>
<li><strong>DOWNLOAD AS CSV</strong>
We only show activities from the past 90 days. To view all activities at any time, you can now download the activities of the selected month as CSV file.</li>
</ul>
</div></div></div></div></section><section><h2 id="2024-06">June 2024</h2><div><div><div><div><p><span><h3 id="2024-06-17-removal-of-old-activities">Removal of old activities</h3><a href="#2024-06-17-removal-of-old-activities"></a></span></p></div><p>We are currently reworking the activities page and plan to introduce the changes at the beginning of July. From this time on, we will only show activities from the past 90 days and you will no longer be able to view activities that are older than that. If you still need your old activities, we recommend you manually save them yourself by the end of June. With the reworked activities page, you will get the new option to download the activities from the past 3 months as CSV file, which will make it easier for you in the future to save and access your activities.</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>New server plans with shared Intel® vCPUs are now available! The new servers will officially replace the current shared Intel® vCPU server plans which are now deprecated*.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four new server plans</strong>
CX22, CX32, CX42, CX52</li>
<li><strong>Prices down, performance up!</strong>
CX22 combines the best features of the two smallest deprecated server plans as it comes with the superior performance of CX21 at the more attractive price of CX11. The other three new server plans feature twice as many vCPUs and, on top of this, more attractive prices than their predecessors!</li>
</ul>
<p>*To give you time to adapt the new server plans, the old server plans (CX11, CX21, CX31, CX41, CX51) will remain available for order via API until <strong>6 September 2024</strong>. Existing servers are not affected by this deprecation and will continue to work.</p>

This option allows you to create a copy of an existing Firewall, making it quick and easy to set up Firewalls with similar rules. The duplicated Firewall is not applied to any servers after it was added and you can modify the cloned rules as needed.</p></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><h2 id="2023-12">December 2023</h2><div><div><div><div><p><span><h3 id="2023-12-08-new-main-navigation-on-small-screens">New main navigation on small screens</h3><a href="#2023-12-08-new-main-navigation-on-small-screens"></a></span></p></div><div><p>As part of our ongoing effort to improve our responsive design, we redesigned our main navigation for small screens.</p>
<ul>
<li>We removed the left menu bar in projects. You can now use the menu icon in the top right to switch between resource overviews.</li>
<li>The user menu now comes in an improved design that makes it easier to navigate on the phone.</li>

The new servers will officially replace the current dedicated AMD vCPU server plans which are now deprecated*.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great performance per price</strong>
The new servers come with the same performance as the deprecated server plans — but at far more attractive prices!</li>
<li><strong>More Traffic</strong>
Up until now, all server plans included 20 TB of traffic by default. Depending on the plan, the new servers now come with up to 60 TB!</li>
<li><strong>Maximum performance</strong>
Every dedicated vCPU instance has its own dedicated CPU resources. This allows them to handle high traffic and CPU-intensive tasks with ease. Additionally, the servers deliver highly predictable performance and response times.</li>
</ul>
<p>*To give you time to adapt the new server plans, the old server plans (CCX12, CCX22, CCX32, CCX42, CCX52, CCX62) will remain available for order until 26 September 2023. Existing servers are not affected by this deprecation and will continue to work.</p>

This new endpoint replaces the deprecated <strong>&#34;GET /actions&#34;</strong> endpoint and you can use it to list all actions of a specific resource (e.g. of all servers or of all Load Balancers). Starting on 1 October 2023, the <strong>&#34;GET /actions&#34;</strong> endpoint will no longer be available. After that, it won&#39;t be possible anymore to list all actions across all resources.</p>
<p>Also starting on 1 October 2023, all action endpoints will only return actions from the past 90 days.</p>

At the moment, the <strong>id</strong> fields are only 32 bit wide. However, this is no longer sufficient. As a result, we will use larger IDs in future. This change will not affect IDs of existing resources.</p>
<p><strong>Starting on 1 September 2023, the first IDs will use 52-bit integers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using our API, make sure your code can handle 52-bit integers properly. Otherwise, you might run into issues.</li>
<li>If you are using hcloud-go on a 32-bit platform, you will need to upgrade to a new version as the current one does not support 52 bit. Check out the official hcloud-go documentation for more information on an upcoming release.</li>

<li><strong>New CAX plans</strong>
The 4 new CAX plans all come with shared vCPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Limited availability</strong>
At the moment, the new servers are only available in Falkenstein.</li>
<li><strong>Great performance per price</strong>
In comparison to other servers in the same price bracket, the Arm64 architecture makes it possible to get way more compute cores.</li>
<li><strong>High number of cores</strong>
Due to the impressive number of cores, the servers can make quick work of even the most CPU-intensive tasks.</li>

Because of the new options, servers and IPs are now billed separately.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose from 3 networking options</strong>
Server with two public IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). Server with one public IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). Server without any public IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Servers without any public network</strong>
Adding the server to a private network will enable you to create the server without any public IPs and thus without a connection to a public network.</li>
<li><strong>New flexibility with Primary IPs</strong>
After a server was created, you can still add, remove, or swap the server’s Primary IPs. To keep your Primary IP even if you delete the server it is assigned to, you can simply disable the “Auto Delete” option.</li>
</ul>
