    <h1>Local-First Foundations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, January 22, 2025</em></p><p>I&#39;m writing a book about local-first software tentatively called <a href="https://bytes.zone/projects/local-first-from-scratch/">Local-First From Scratch</a>. This is a snippet from that book—an intro to why you should care about local-first software and what it gets you. I thought it ended up being a pretty good summary of what the whole project is about, so I wanted to share it as a blog post as well!</p><hr/><p>If you picked up this book, you might have some idea about what &#34;local-first&#34; means<sup><a href="#lf-manifesto">1</a></sup>, but let&#39;s get on the same page: other than &#34;works offline&#34;, what are we aiming for?</p><p>In short, local-first software moves ownership of data from &#34;somewhere in the cloud&#34; to your local devices.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>This has a bunch of consequences. We like some of them:</p><ol><li>Updates are practically instant because the network does not have to be involved. No loading times or spinners! You can also work completely offline.</li><li>You are in control of your data and control who gets access to it.</li><li>A company going through an &#34;incredible journey&#34; acquihire doesn&#39;t mean you lose access to your work.</li></ol><p>Of course, <em>implementing</em> these ideas is a little harder than just storing data in a local SQLite database. There&#39;s a cost paid in complexity and figuring out new ways of doing things. For example, we&#39;d typically enable sharing by having a central server hold all the state. But we can&#39;t do that if the user is offline and can&#39;t reach the server<sup><a href="#local-first-business-case">2</a></sup> So local-first also raises some questions we need to answer:</p><ol><li>You probably have more than one device (phone, computer, etc.) Which one is the &#34;real&#34; copy?</li><li>If you want to share your work with someone else, how?</li><li>When you share—either with other devices or other people—how do you avoid conflicting writes?</li></ol><p>We want satisfying answers to these without giving up local control. The typical approach—and the one we&#39;ll implement in this book—is CRDTs.</p><hr/><p>That&#39;s it for the preview. Keep an eye out for the book hopefully later in 2025!</p></article></div>
