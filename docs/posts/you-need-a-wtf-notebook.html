                <section>
                    <p>I keep a <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/?ref=simplermachines.com">bullet journal</a>. I&#39;m not one of those people you see on Pinterest with the fancy spreads – I mostly just use black ink, the standard setup, and the occasional custom collection.</p><p>Every time I join a new team, I go to the next fresh page, and on top of that page I write: &#34;WTF - [Team Name].&#34; Then I make a note every time I run into something that makes me go &#34;wtf,&#34; and a task every time I come up with something I want to change.</p><p>For two weeks, that&#39;s all I do. <em>I</em> <em>just write it down. </em>I don&#39;t tell the team everything that I think they&#39;re doing wrong. I don&#39;t show up at retro with all the stuff I think they need to change. I just watch, and listen, and I write down everything that seems deeply weird.</p><p>This is a trick I picked up from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aramprice?ref=simplermachines.com">a team lead</a> a few years ago, who learned it from a previous lead of his in turn. It&#39;s one of my most powerful techniques for making changes on a team, and managing myself while I do it. So I&#39;m going to walk you through how I use that list, and how it helps me to build a reputation as someone who&#39;s really effective at getting stuff done, and avoid being someone who&#39;s complaining all the time.</p><p>There&#39;s always stuff that makes me go &#34;wtf&#34; on a new team. The team talks for an hour in retro about a serious problem, and then leaves without making any action items. The tests don&#39;t run locally and no one seems to notice. Big chunks of the build board are always red. Only one person can do some critical, time-sensitive thing. The team is spending a bunch of time on some feature, but when I ask around no one can seems to know why it&#39;s important or how it&#39;ll help a customer.</p><p>Once I&#39;ve got a nice big list, I start crossing things off. There are four reasons at this point that I might cross off something I&#39;ve put on that list:</p><ol><li>There&#39;s actually a good reason for it</li><li>The team is already working on a fix</li><li>The team doesn&#39;t care about it</li><li>It&#39;s really easy to fix</li></ol><p>If the tests don&#39;t run locally, for instance, that might be a known issue that there&#39;s an ongoing effort to address. The team might do all of their work on virtual machines, and have a simple chat command that provisions those machines for them. Or they might have a pretty good continuous integration system and good habits around making small changes, so not being able to run the tests locally isn&#39;t stopping them from deploying multiple times a day.</p><p>Sometimes, it&#39;ll turn out that there&#39;s a really simple fix for some of the things I&#39;ve identified. Maybe there&#39;s some documentation I can write, once I know where it is, or maybe there&#39;s an easy change once I find the right scripts. That&#39;s not always immediately obvious when I first see a problem. When I do see an easy fix, though, I&#39;ll just go ahead and make it.</p><p>After a few weeks, though, I&#39;ll still have a bunch of weird, unresolved issues on that list. At this point I&#39;ll start talking about it with other people on the team, the team lead, and my manager.</p><p>I&#39;ll ask why things on the list are that way, and how they got to be that way. I&#39;m trying to establish credibility as someone who&#39;s genuinely curious and empathetic, who&#39;s patient, and who respects the expertise of my coworkers. That&#39;s the reputation that&#39;s going to let me make changes later.</p><p>Generally, I&#39;ll find out that the things that problems I&#39;ve noticed are around for one of a few reasons.</p><ol><li>The team hasn&#39;t noticed it</li><li>The team has gotten used to it</li><li>The problem is relatively new, and the old problem it replaced was much worse</li><li>They don&#39;t know how to fix the problem</li><li>They&#39;ve tried to fix the problem before and failed</li></ol><p>On a lot of teams, when I ask some questions about things that turn out to be in the first few questions, the person I ask will just fix them immediately. Or they&#39;ll help me figure out how to fix them. If it&#39;s a technical problem, that means writing a story or a ticket together, and then we&#39;ll work on it. If it&#39;s more process or social, it means bringing the problem up at retro and talking about it with the whole team.</p><p>At this point I&#39;m looking for one or two problems that have been bugging one of my new teammates for a while, and that have relatively simple solutions. I&#39;m looking for something I can put on the retro board and know I won&#39;t be the only person who&#39;s bothered by that problem. Then, during the team conversation about the problem, I&#39;ll identify something that teammate suggests as an action item that we could try immediately. That way the team starts to see me as someone who helps them solve their problems.</p><p>The feeling that I want to create, the association I want people to have with me, is, &#34;Oh, Nat joined the team and little things started to get better, almost immediately. It feels like we&#39;re starting to make some progress. And it&#39;s not like they showed up and started telling me what to do, either. They&#39;re really listening to me, they&#39;re helping me explain myself to the rest of the team.&#34;</p><p>Pretty soon, I&#39;ll start to get in to the really sticky issues. The problems the team knows about but is afraid of dealing with. The things that aren&#39;t &#34;that bad,&#34; but that no one wants to talk about. Maybe they&#39;re missing the technical skills to deal with the problem. Maybe there&#39;s a knotty people problem at the center of it.</p><p>At this point I&#39;m going to be talking to my manager. I&#39;m going to bring them that list I&#39;ve been working on, and I&#39;m going to say something like, &#34;Now that I&#39;ve been on the team for a few weeks, this is what I&#39;m seeing. We&#39;re making progress on some of it, but some of these seem like they&#39;re going to take longer. I wanted to get your thoughts before I try to do anything about them. Is there something I&#39;m missing? Is there a particular area I&#39;d like you to focus?&#34;</p><p>The reaction I&#39;m looking for from my manager, at this point, is something like, &#34;Wow. This is really validating. I&#39;ve been concerned about these things but the team doesn&#39;t seem really bothered by them, so I didn&#39;t want to push too hard. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re bringing this up.&#34;</p><p>Then we can have a conversation about what their concerns and problems are. I can do some reflective listening to help them organize their thoughts, and I can talk about what I&#39;ve seen work well, or not, in the past. They&#39;ll start to see me as someone with good judgement, and someone they can come to for help solving their harder problems.</p><p>There&#39;s a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: &#34;Nat helps<em> <em>me</em></em> solve <em>my</em> problems. Nat get things <em>I care about</em> done.&#34; That&#39;s the reputation that&#39;s going to get me the results I want in next year&#39;s performance review. That&#39;s the reputation that&#39;s going to get me a referral a few years from now.</p><p>Before I started keeping this kind of list, I brought up problem I saw immediately, as soon as I noticed it. The reputation I got was, &#34;Nat&#39;s always complaining about things. Nat thinks we&#39;re never doing things right.&#34; People stopped listening to me. I was personally frustrated, and professionally ineffective.</p><p>There&#39;s no faster way to totally sink my credibility, as a new team member, by making a huge fuss over something that&#39;s not a problem, or that the team doesn&#39;t see as a problem, or that there&#39;s already an effort to fix, or that there&#39;s a really simple way to fix that I just didn&#39;t see at first. There are always so many problems on a team, so many things that could be better, that I&#39;m only ever going to solve a handful of them. Working on problems in the order I noticed them is rarely the most effective order. So the WTF Notebook gives me a place to park the impulse to <em>fix it now, damn it!</em> until I have more context for deciding what to work on first.</p><p>Instead, for two weeks, I just write things down.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr/><p>Periodic reminder that Code for America is usually hiring, and they pair and write tests. Until the end of this month they have a <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/jobs/posting/?gh_jid=3400762&amp;ref=simplermachines.com">Software Engineer</a> role up for a team that works San Francisco hours. If you&#39;re looking for a &#34;show up, write code, go home&#34; experience, and want to help Americans access food stamps and other safety net services, this is a team that can deliver it – especially if you have some experience with Rails or Spring.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you&#39;re interested in gnarly cloud infrastructure and software problems for the Department of Defense, check out <a href="https://rise8.us/careers?ref=simplermachines.com">Rise8</a>. If you&#39;ve heard about Kessel Run, or Pivotal&#39;s work with the Air Force generally, Rise8 is where many of those folks ended up. They also practice design thinking, test-driven development, and continuous deployment, but they&#39;re teaching them to folks who have never used these practices before, and pairing with military service people. Their job listings mention experience at Pivotal Labs by name.</p><p>If you&#39;ve got an active job search running and you&#39;re struggling to keep track of it all, check out <a href="https://dwf.bigpencil.net/job-search-obsidian-update/?ref=simplermachines.com">Davis Frank&#39;s guide to Job Search Journaling with Obsidian.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/jobs/">Job listings from previous issues</a></p><hr/><p>I&#39;ve mentioned <em><a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/seeing-state-how-certain-schemes-improve-human-condition-have-failed?ref=simplermachines.com">Seeing Like a State</a> </em>before but I reread it while we were on the road, and, and, man, seriously, if there&#39;s one book I wish everyone I talk to had read, it&#39;s this one. Nothing explains systems thinking in action better. Nothing has more useful anecdotes for illustrating how large organizations work, and why they work the way they do.</p><p>The other book I&#39;ve read by James C. Scott is <a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/against-grain-deep-history-earliest-states-1st-edition?ref=simplermachines.com"><em>Against the Grain</em>,</a> and if you&#39;re at all interested in the history of the earliest states and the initial development of human civilization, that book will absolutely blow your mind.</p><p>Ed Zitron&#39;s piece recently about <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/how-our-need-for-attention-online?ref=simplermachines.com">How Our Need For Attention Online Drives Us Crazy</a> articulated a bunch of half-formed thoughts I&#39;ve been chewing on and trying to figure out how to write about. It doesn&#39;t mention Slack explicitly, but I&#39;ve seen Slack drive a lot of these same processes at work.</p>
