    <h1>Monster Hunter Rise adds new DRM that breaks it on Steam Deck</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Capcom have rolled out an update to MONSTER HUNTER RISE, and sadly it has broken it on Steam Deck. As they continue attempting to change their DRM in older games.</p>
<p>They&#39;re swapping from Denuvo over to Enigma which seems to be the cause of the problems, and it&#39;s not the first title they&#39;ve tried this with. In the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1446780/view/3970553140557253784" target="_blank">Ver.16.0.2.0</a> Capcom updated it to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been reports of the game not running on Steam Deck after updating to Ver.16.0.2.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the actual changes list, Capcom didn&#39;t even state the change to the DRM, they&#39;re clearly trying to keep it quiet. This bugs me. Any form of anti-cheat and DRM should be clearly noted not just on Steam pages - but in update notes too. Consumers should be <em>properly</em> informed.</p>
<p>Shame that Capcom didn&#39;t think to test their game considering it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified. Although, verification is done by Valve directly, it doesn&#39;t actually mean a game developer supports it.</p>
<p>Hopefully Capcom will reverse the change, or Valve will find a solution in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> to get it working again. From reports I&#39;ve seen it affects Linux desktop too, not just Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Previously, Capcom added Enigma DRM to Resident Evil Revelations (released on Steam in 2013), which caused problems for players and Capcom ended up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/222480/view/3990818705013251073" target="_blank">reversing</a> the update (but said they would fix it and re-release it). This caused players to review-bomb the title with the most recent review score showing as Overwhelmingly Negative.</p>
