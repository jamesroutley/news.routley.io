<p><em>What you’re about to read is a fancified excerpt from <a href="https://changelog.com/shipit/44">Ship It! #44</a>. You should read the <a href="https://changelog.com/shipit/44#transcript">original transcript</a> or listen to the entire conversation for more context. To set the stage, this is Kelsey’s response to Gerhard asking what the biggest takeaway should be from their conversation.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>The reason we find ourselves as practitioners (as an industry as a whole) constantly migrating between different platforms, journeys, and digital transformations…</p>
<p>We do this because <mark>I don’t think we ever understood the fundamentals</mark>.</p>
<p>The fundamentals are very clear. If you’re thinking about application delivery, for example, we know what the fundamentals are.</p>
<p>Ideally, we’re versioning the source code we write, and using tools that enable us to build and package applications in a reproducible way. 15 years ago maybe you were just creating WAR files or ZIP files. Maybe you were sophisticated and you were creating RPMs or DEBs so you could use a package manager. Those practices have always been good ideas. Packaging is a by-product, or the artifact, of assembling code and your dependencies, and getting your applications ready for deployment in a repeatable way. If you did that 15 years ago, adopting something like Docker is not hard to do. You say…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Okay, we’re gonna take the existing RPM and use it to create a container image. Instead of running yum install on a server to install the RPM, we can now call the same command from a Docker file, and produce a container image.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s just another packaging step, and if you decouple packaging from deployment, then you get the ability to change just the last mile.</p>
<p>So even if you’re just using RPMs today, you can layer on container packaging. Even if you’re using something like Puppet to deploy those RPMs, once you have a container image, you can actually swap out the Puppet step for the Docker step, <mark>and it works</mark>.</p>
<p>But you have to understand the fundamentals and the boundaries between these concepts.</p>
<p>I think as an industry we’ve been pushing…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automate. Automate. Automate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we haven’t been saying…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand. Understand. Understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if you understand what you’re doing, <mark>you can automate if you want to</mark>.</p>
<p>Because if you really have a clean process that says…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Okay, we’ve automated the build process of a Docker container image, and look, we don’t really have more than two environments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the QA process can look like this…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Docker run this container image. It works. We go to production. Docker run the same container image. It works.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And maybe that’s all your team needs to do! And look, that’s okay. But I think understanding allows us to make that decision, and then we can decide what automation tool is the best for the job.</p>
<p>These fundamentals can be applied using different tools. The tools are not the fundamentals. It’s the ideas and concepts that we have been talking about today.</p>
