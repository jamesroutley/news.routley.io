    <h1>I Had a Dream</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>As I slept fitfully, still recovering from COVID, I had one of the more interesting dreams of my life:</p>



<p>I was desperately trying to finish some PowerPoint slides in time to give a talk. Uncharacteristically for me, one of the slides displayed actual code. This was a dream, so nothing was as clear as I’d like, but the code did <em>something</em> vaguely reminiscent of <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=710">Rosser’s Theorem</a>—e.g., enumerating all proofs in ZFC until it finds the lexicographically first proof or disproof of a certain statement, then branching into cases depending on whether it’s a proof or a disproof. In any case, it was simple enough to fit on one slide.</p>



<p>Suddenly, though, my whole presentation was deleted. Everything was ruined!</p>



<p>One of the developers of PowerPoint happened to be right there in the lecture hall (of course!), so I confronted him with my laptop and angrily demanded an explanation. He said that I must have triggered the section of Microsoft Office that tries to detect and prevent any discussion of logical paradoxes that are too dangerous for humankind—the ones that would cause people to realize that our entire universe is just an illusion, a sandbox being run inside an AI, a glitch-prone Matrix. He said it patronizingly, as if it should’ve been obvious: “you and I both know that the Paradoxes are not to be talked about, so why would you be so <em>stupid</em> as to put one in your presentation?”</p>



<p>My reaction was to jab my finger in the guy’s face, shove him, scream, and curse him out. At that moment, I wasn’t concerned in the slightest about the universe being an illusion, or about glitches in the Matrix. I was concerned about my embarrassment when I’d be called in 10 minutes to give my talk and would have nothing to show.</p>



<p>My last thought, before I woke with a start, was to wonder whether Greg Kuperberg was right and I should give my presentations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">Beamer</a>, or some other open-source software, and then I wouldn’t have had this problem.</p>



<p>A coda: I woke a bit after 7AM Central and started to write this down. But then—this is now real life (!)—I saw an email saying that a dozen people were waiting for me in a conference room in Europe for an important Zoom meeting. We’d gotten the time zones wrong; I’d thought that it wasn’t until 8AM my time. If not for this dream causing me to wake up, I would’ve missed the meeting entirely.</p>
