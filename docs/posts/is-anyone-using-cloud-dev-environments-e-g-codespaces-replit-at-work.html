    <h1>Ask HN: Is anyone using cloud dev environments (e.g. Codespaces/Replit) at work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A lot of devs I know are excited about Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) like GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, Codeanywhere, Coder, Replit, and CodeSandbox. They seem great, and simplify many aspects of the dev workflow: easy to onboard onto new projects, everyone on the project stays in sync, etc.</p><p>But I rarely hear of actual teams using them; it&#39;s usually individuals using CDEs for side projects.</p><p>Are you using a CDE at work? Would love to hear about your experience.</p></div></div></div>
