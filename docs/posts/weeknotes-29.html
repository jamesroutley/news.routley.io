    <ul>
<li>having all the gender feelings at once, and reminding myself that becoming &#34;beefy bimbo hello kitty&#34; through going to the gym is my current way of combating that?? so giving it a couple of months to a year to see if i feel better or worse. just read lu wilson&#39;s <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/coming-out/pros-and-cons/">most recent gender-related post</a> and have feelings, obviously, and am unsure what to do with them. being more openly confused about my gender is hard, but as a friend once said for a completely different reason, it&#39;s not as if people can&#39;t tell there&#39;s something up with me. it was not harsh in context, lol!

<li>these recent gender feelings started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSiIG8NXrI4">a video by lily alexandre</a> making me bawl, which i wrote about on instagram but was scared to say more openly. but it&#39;s a new year and i apparently feel braver. my word of the year is &#34;greathearted&#34; as i keep saying, bravery and generosity are the move.</li>
<li>oh yeah it&#39;s a new year!!!!! if you aren&#39;t already sick of hearing about my <a href="https://olu.online/25-hopes-for-2025">2025 goals</a> i also have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVbY8PNNmL/">bingo card version</a> and of course this year&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DERx6i0NUi4/">ins and outs</a> on instagram too.</li>
<li>went to battersea power station yesterday, it was so gorgeous on the outside and so annoying on the inside. why are there no maps?? does no one know how to build a shopping centre any more?</li>
<li>moved back over to obsidian properly. i&#39;m actually really liking it this time (save for the lack of columns, boo).</li>
<li>been doing a bunch of reading for my post and/or video on tech and religion. i don&#39;t think i am unreservedly enjoying any of it, but it&#39;s incredibly interesting and i&#39;m excited to see what i end up with.</li>
<li>trying to take more <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes in public</a> over at my digital garden, and if anyone has cadence suggestions (daily? weekly? other?) i&#39;d enjoy that cos i dunno how to structure time put into that at all.</li>
<li>i am enjoying decluttering though i&#39;ve got to the overwhelming stage i think but things are chugging along.</li>
<li>currently reading <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects">building large technical projects</a> and am considering signing up for <a href="https://csprimer.com">cs primer</a> again eventually. i think i struggle with motivation when i work alone on coding projects, but also need more experience building stuff from scratch, so in a bind. suggestions welcome.</li>
<li>watched bodies bodies bodies. it was alright.</li>
