    <h1>The math is haunted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past few months, I’ve been writing a lot of <a target="_blank" href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>.</p>
<p>Lean is a programming language, but it is mostly used by mathematicians. That is quite unusual! This is because Lean is designed to formalize mathematics.</p>
<p>Lean lets mathematicians <em>treat mathematics as code</em>—break it into structures, theorems and proofs, import each other’s theorems, and put them on GitHub.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/formalising-mathematics-an-introduction/">big idea</a> is that eventually much of the humanity’s mathematical knowledge might be available as code—statically checked, verifiable, and composable.</p>
<p>So what does using Lean feel like?</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="sorry-not-sorry"><a target="_self" href="#sorry-not-sorry">Sorry Not Sorry</a></h3>
<p>To give you a taste of Lean, here is a tiny theorem that says <code>2</code> is equal to <code>2</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  sorry</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>To a mathematician’s eye, this syntax looks like stating a theorem. We have the <code>theorem</code> keyword, the name of our theorem, a colon <code>:</code> before its statement, the statement that we’d like to prove, and <code>:= by</code> followed by the proof (<code>sorry</code> means that we haven’t completed the actual proof yet but we’re planning to fill it in later).</p>
<p>But if you’re a programmer, you might notice a hint of something else. That <code>theorem</code> looks suspiciously like a function. But then what is <code>2 = 2</code>? It looks like a return type of that function. But how can <code>2 = 2</code> be a <em>type</em>? Isn’t <code>2 = 2</code> just a boolean? And if <code>2 = 2</code> really <em>is</em> a type, what are the <em>values</em> of that <code>2 = 2</code> type? These are very interesting questions, but we’ll have to forget about them for now.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll start by inspecting the proof:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  sorry</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>(You can try it in a <a target="_blank" href="https://live.lean-lang.org/#codez=C4Cwpg9gTmC2AEwDuED6YCOrkXgLngCZ4BeI/MgIwE8AoeeAZ2ijqA">live editor</a> though it’s a bit flakier than a <a target="_blank" href="https://lean-lang.org/install/">local setup</a>.)</p>
<p>Put the cursor <em>before</em> the <code>sorry</code>, and notice a panel called <strong>Tactic state</strong> on the right. With the cursor before the <code>sorry</code>, the tactic state displays <code>⊢ 2 = 2</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state1.png" alt="Goal is 2 = 2"/></p>
<p>Here, <code>⊢</code> means the <em>goal</em>, i.e. the statement you’re supposed to be proving. Your current goal is to prove <code>2 = 2</code>, so the tactic state says <code>⊢ 2 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>Now put the cursor right <em>after</em> the <code>sorry</code> and notice the goal has disappeared:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state2.png" alt="No goals"/></p>
<p>The goal is gone! In other words, you’ve “proven” <code>2 = 2</code> by saying <code>sorry</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, this is nonsense. You can think of <code>sorry</code> as a universal proof—it closes <em>any</em> goal. It’s a lie. In that sense, <code>sorry</code> is exactly like <code>any</code> in TypeScript. It lets you suppress the proof checker but you haven’t actually shown anything useful.</p>
<p>Let’s try get rid of the <code>sorry</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state3.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Now you see that the proof is incomplete, and the goal is unsolved. To actually prove <code>2 = 2</code>, type <code>rfl</code> on the next line, which will successfully close the goal:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state4.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Here, <code>rfl</code> means “reflexivity”, from “reflection”, like a mirror image. Whenever you have a “mirrored” goal like <code>something = something</code>, <code>rfl</code> will close it. You can think of <code>rfl</code> as a built-in piece of knowledge that “a thing is equal to itself”.</p>
<p>With the goal closed, your proof is done.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now that you’ve proven <code>two_eq_two</code>, you may refer to this fact from other places.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two_again</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  exact two_eq_two</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p><em>Ah, modularity!</em></p>
<p>Here, <code>two_eq_two_again</code> delegates the rest of the proof to <code>two_eq_two</code> because the current goal (<code>⊢ 2 = 2</code>) is <em>exactly</em> what <code>two_eq_two</code> already proves. (To a programmer’s eye, this might look like returning the result of a function call.)</p>
<p>For a single-line example, this is contrived, but <code>exact some_other_theorem</code> is useful for breaking down a complex proof into smaller individual theorems.</p>
<p>The commands we’ve used—<code>exact</code>, <code>sorry</code>, <code>rfl</code>—are called <em>tactics</em>. A Lean proof (after <code>by</code>) is written as a sequence of tactics. Tactics let you <em>close</em> different goals—<code>rfl</code> lets you close goals like <code>x = x</code>, <code>exact some_other_theorem</code> lets you close goals you’ve already proven, and <code>sorry</code> lets you close any goal (at your own peril).</p>
<p>To prove a theorem, you would use just the right tactics until you close every goal.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="the-math-is-haunted"><a target="_self" href="#the-math-is-haunted">The Math Is Haunted</a></h3>
<p>So far, you have proven that <code>2 = 2</code>, which was not very interesting.</p>
<p>Let’s see if you can prove that <code>2 = 3</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_three</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  sorry</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Like before, <code>sorry</code> lets you close any goal, even <code>2 = 3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state5.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>But that is cheating, and we will endeavor to remove the <code>sorry</code>.</p>
<p>Replace <code>sorry</code> with <code>rfl</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state6.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Not so easy now! You could close <code>⊢ 2 = 2</code> with <code>rfl</code> because <code>2 = 2</code> is shaped like <code>something = something</code>. However, the goal <code>⊢ 2 = 3</code> <em>is not</em> shaped like <code>something = something</code>, and therefore <code>rfl</code> <em>does not</em> close the <code>⊢ 2 = 3</code> goal.</p>
<p><strong>That, actually, is a good thing.</strong> In most useful mathematical theories, <code>2 = 3</code> is a false statement, and we <em>don’t</em> want false statements to be provable in Lean.</p>
<p>But contrary to the popular belief, mathematics isn’t set in stone. Mathematics is what you make of it. You can have your own haunted mathematics where <code>2 = 3</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s introduce an <em>axiom</em> that says that:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>axiom</span><span> math_is_haunted</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>An <code>axiom</code> is just like a <code>theorem</code>, but taken on faith. You can think of it as <code>theorem math_is_haunted : 2 = 3 := by sorry</code>, but less apologetic.</p>
<p>Now you can use this <code>axiom</code> as a fact in other proofs:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>axiom</span><span> math_is_haunted</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_three</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  exact math_is_haunted</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Note this doesn’t cause any errors!</p>
<p>Here, the goal of <code>two_eq_three</code> happens to be exactly the same as the statement of the <code>math_is_haunted</code> axiom, so we’re using the <code>exact</code> tactic to close the goal.</p>
<p>Armed with <code>math_is_haunted</code> and some tactics, you can prove even more sinister things. For example, why don’t we prove that <code>2 + 2</code> is actually <code>6</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>axiom</span><span> math_is_haunted</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_add_two_eq_six</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> + </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>6</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  -- We&#39;ll write something here (this is a comment, btw)</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We start with the goal of <code>⊢ 2 + 2 = 6</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state7.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>We don’t have any tactic that can solve the goal of that specific shape. However, we <em>do</em> have <code>math_is_haunted</code>, which is a “proof” that <code>2 = 3</code>. If <code>2</code> is really the same thing as <code>3</code>, then to prove <code>2 + 2 = 6</code>, <strong>it should be enough</strong> to prove <code>3 + 3 = 6</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>rewrite</code> tactic lets us do just that—rewrite the goal, turning each <code>2</code> into a <code>3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state8.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>We <em>still</em> have an unsolved goal, but now it’s <code>⊢ 3 + 3 = 6</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>rewrite</code> tactic is like a “find and replace” within your goal. If you have a proof that <code>a = b</code>, giving that proof to <code>rewrite</code> will rewrite your goal so that all <code>a</code> become <code>b</code> instead. Since <code>math_is_haunted</code> “proves” that <code>2 = 3</code>, <code>rewrite [math_is_haunted]</code> turns the goal from <code>⊢ 2 + 2 = 6</code> into <code>⊢ 3 + 3 = 6</code>.</p>
<p>(For the programmer-minded friends, this isn’t some kind of string replacement. Some state-of-the-art pattern matching and type inference may be involved.)</p>
<p>And now that our goal is <code>⊢ 3 + 3 = 6</code>, our job is much easier. In fact, the <code>rfl</code> tactic alone will be enough to close <em>that</em> goal and thus complete the proof:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><code data-language="lean" data-theme="Overnight"><span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_eq_two</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>2</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>axiom</span><span> math_is_haunted</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>theorem</span><span> two_add_two_eq_six</span><span> : </span><span>2</span><span> + </span><span>2</span><span> = </span><span>6</span><span> := </span><span>by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  rewrite [math_is_haunted]</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  rfl</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The above example is checked with no errors, so we’ve proven <code>2 + 2 = 6</code>.</p>
<p>That’s unsettling! In fact, the <code>math_is_haunted</code> axiom is so bad that it lets us derive <em>a contradiction</em> (e.g. <code>2 + 2 = 6</code> and <code>2 + 2 ≠ 6</code> can be proven true at the same time), which, by the laws of logic, means that we can now <a target="_blank" href="https://live.lean-lang.org/#codez=JYWwDg9gTgLgBAWQIYwBYBtgCMB0AVJAYxmEICgy0BTaKkOGAdwgH0qBHFpiOALjgBMcALyC+orAE8ycOFABm6GWSQAPYBHogUqFsADOLVEgCuAOxhUAJnzGiAzBWq163FkitWuzNp33BVWyEAajs4ADZxOCkZOSpGKGBLOABtbTQ9Q2NzSysAXViFJUpUGig6Bh8PLzczDhZ/QP4QsUADIgiomNkzaBAWMxMQJ1KXOH1NKn6IM30qGapbQAAiOEDJABoVuFDJETgABhwAdkP7ABYtzYA9OFOhXglpWSkWQmmYKCQ4AFovuABlExgSCzOBJADk+jgPXg7xMVFiVFURBhVU83lYdT8AUqrGq6N8DWxPzgAEk4PIIOYbJ9XhYPlZSCRprFiXhSuUKeUNuDIbCFgAKYzGACUZCAA">prove anything.</a></p>
<p>In this case, we deliberately added <code>math_is_haunted</code> so it’s kind of our own fault. And yet, an incident like this has actually occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. It was discovered that the Set theory, which much of the mathematics was built upon, had a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">contradiction</a> flowing from one of its axioms. This was eventually “patched up” by choosing different axioms, but it has caused much anxiety, hair loss, and general soulsearching among the mathematical community.</p>
<p>Let us delete <code>axiom math_is_haunted</code> now. Naturally, this breaks the <code>two_add_two_eq_six</code> proof which depends on the naughty axiom:</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state9.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Again, that’s good! Broken things should not proof-check.</p>
<p>To fix it up, let’s change the statement to <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> which is actually correct (according to the axioms of natural numbers that Lean is familiar with):</p>
<p><img src="https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/state10.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>With the bad axiom out, math is no longer haunted! (Or at least we could <a target="_blank" href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/28303/if-the-zfc-axioms-cannot-be-proven-consistent-how-can-we-say-for-certain-that-a">hope so.</a>)</p>
<p>It might feel a bit weird being introduced to Lean with “nonsense math” since most math that people do in Lean is usually rather sensible. But I think this is a potent illustration of what working with a proof checker is actually about.</p>
<p>A proof checker only verifies the validity of the logical conclusions stemming from the chosen axioms. It lets you chain logical transformations—with <code>rewrite</code>, <code>rfl</code>, <code>exact</code>, and many other tactics—and prove increasingly sophisticated theorems about increasingly sophisticated mathematical structures.</p>
<p>If your axioms are sound and Lean itself is sound, your conclusions are sound. And that’s true whether your proof is just an <code>rfl</code> or millions of lines of Lean code.</p>

<p>For an extreme example, consider <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">Fermat’s Last Theorem</a>.

<p>After over 350 years, it was proven in 1994, and the proof is over 100 pages long.</p>
<p>There is an <a target="_blank" href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/FLT-announcement/">ongoing effort</a> to formalize the proof of this theorem in Lean, and this effort is expected to take many years. Although the statement itself is very simple, the proof will require establishing many <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/tree/main/FLT">mathematical structures and theorems</a>.</p>
<p>If you clone the FLT repo on GitHub and open <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/main/FermatsLastTheorem.lean"><code>FermatsLastTheorem.lean</code></a>, you’ll see a proof but it actually relies on <code>sorry</code>s, as revealed by printing its axioms:</p>

<p>But when all the sub-proofs are formalized and the project is complete, none of the proofs that <code>pow_add_pow_ne_pow</code> depends on will have <code>sorry</code>s in them, and <code>#print axioms PNat.pow_add_pow_ne_pow</code> will no longer include <code>sorryAx</code>.</p>
<p>I bet merging the PR that does that will feel satisfying!</p>

<h3 id="next-steps"><a target="_self" href="#next-steps">Next Steps</a></h3>
<p>Obviously, we haven’t proven anything useful today. It might seem like a lot of work to figure out something like <code>2 + 2 = 4</code>. And yet, and yet… You know there was something special in there. It felt <em>a bit</em> like programming, but also a bit like something else. If this got you curious about Lean, I can suggest a few resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <a target="_blank" href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4">Natural Numbers Game</a>. It is a very gentle <em>and</em> fun introduction to Lean. As a bonus, you’ll learn what natural numbers are actually made of.</li>
<li>The first chapters of <a target="_blank" href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">Mathematics in Lean</a> are accessible and don’t assume a mathematical background. I found them handy to get comfy with basic tactics.</li>
<li>My absolute favorite mathematical book, Tao’s Analysis, now has a <a target="_blank" href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/05/31/a-lean-companion-to-analysis-i/">Lean companion</a> that is being <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/teorth/analysis">continuously developed and updated on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>The “new members” channel on the Lean <a target="_blank" href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Zulip instance</a> is very welcoming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I don’t plan to write introductory tutorials (you’re much better served by the Natural Numbers Game and Mathematics in Lean), I’ll probably write more about specific “aha” moments, such as the “<code>2 = 2</code> is actually a type” thing I alluded to earlier. Lean combines a bunch of mindbending ideas from a rich history of mathematics <em>and</em> programming, and I felt a lot of joy rediscovering them. I hope more people will try Lean for no particular reason—it’s just <em>fun</em>.</p>
