Insider was not able to independently verify Himanshu&#39;s account. Himanshu did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p>

Agarwal&#39;s post had accrued over 6,4000 reactions and more than 480 comments by press time.</p><p>The mass layoffs at Meta&#39;s Canada office come eight months after the company announced plans to open a Toronto-based engineering hub that would create 2,500 jobs, <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/meta-expands-canadian-presence-plans-to-hire-thousands-across-the-country-868435219.html" data-analytics-module="body_link">per a Meta press release.</a></p><p>Jha, Agarwal, and Meta did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s requests for comment.</p><p>Meta employees from offices around the world have taken to LinkedIn to write &#34;badge posts&#34; — departure messages with their ID cards — upon being laid off from the company, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fired-meta-employees-are-writing-badge-posts-on-social-media-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link">Insider previously reported.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>&#34;Officially became a casualty of the mass-layoffs at Meta this morning... but honestly, I&#39;m not even the least bit salty,&#34; Chad Lesher, a former Meta strategy lead, wrote in a LinkedIn post on November 10.</p>
