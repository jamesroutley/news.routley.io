    <h1>Ask HN: Help me pick a front-end framework</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hopefully this can be a fruitful discussion since I think I have a quite clear but also reasonably common set of needs. I have a feeling that if you&#39;re &#34;in the world&#34; of frontend engineering you get a much more intuitive feeling for these tooling questions than I can get at a distance by reading SEO-spam developer blogs and State Of JS (although the latter does seem really helpful).<p>I&#39;m thinking of building a text-annotation based app _alone in my spare time_. The core usage loop is about viewing and interacting with &#34;visual markup&#34; applied to a body of text. So lots of tooltips/hoverbars I guess.</p><p>Some notes about my needs:</p><p>- This would be by far the most complex GUI I&#39;ve ever built.</p><p>- Relatedly, I expect to get the UX design horribly horribly wrong and start from scratch at least once.</p><p>- I also suck at making things look pretty and also don&#39;t find this problem very rewardinging to think or read about.</p><p>- All of the above point towards a framework that is pretty easy to get started in and prototype quickly.</p><p>- Because of limited time, and low confidence in UX design decisions, I would often follow the path of least resistance and the end product would be heavily influenced by the tools I used to build it.</p><p>----</p><p>- Despite what I said about quick rampup I&#39;m fine with learning new languages.</p><p>- Weak typing is a deal-breaker. If using JS, must have good TypeScript integration or similar. (Does anyone still write plain JS?)</p><p>------</p><p>- I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll want a native desktop app but an iOS/Android version could make sense. But I&#39;ll never have time if this can&#39;t share most of the code with the web version.</p><p>-------</p><p>- I don&#39;t really have the discipline for manual testing. Luckily I also find it satisfying to over-invest in test automation. I don&#39;t really know how this is done in frontend land but good tooling would be a big plus.</p><p>-----</p><p>- I&#39;m happy to sacrifice one or more of the other requirements in favour of tools that are likely to be maintained 10 years from now.</p><p>----</p><p>What are HNs thoughts?</p></div></div>
