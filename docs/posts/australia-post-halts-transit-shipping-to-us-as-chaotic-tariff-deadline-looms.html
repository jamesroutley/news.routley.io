    <h1>Australia Post halts transit shipping to US as &#39;chaotic&#39; tariff deadline looms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Australia Post is suspending some forms of shipping to the United States as a Trump administration tariff deadline creates &#34;chaos&#34; for postal networks and retailers globally.</p><p>The development means goods from other countries will no longer be able to be shipped to the US via Australia, a method known as &#34;transit&#34; shipping.</p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;In line with a number of other postal operators, Australia Post has temporarily suspended its transit service to the US and will no longer accept transit items containing goods destined for the United States of America,&#34;</blockquote><p><span> <!-- --> an Australia Post spokesperson said.</span></p></div><p>Australia Post&#39;s suspension comes as low-value goods imported into the US face additional tariffs from next week.</p><p>Until now, parcels of goods from Australia worth less than $US800 ($1,200) were not taxed when they arrived in the US, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-06/trump-tariffs-shein-temu-china-trade-amazon-online-retail/104893912" data-component="Link" data-uri="coremedia://article/104893912">under what was known as the &#34;de minimis&#34; exemption</a>.</p><p>The tax exemption is due to end on August 29 for imports from all countries globally, with parcels to be slugged with tariffs or flat fees.</p><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105673232" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105673232"><div><div><div><p><img alt="White postal sack with red express post labelling" sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6b2ea69ab5328eac1da59085094c695f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=5000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">E-commerce business have described confusion and chaos when trying to navigate the tariff changes.<!-- --> <cite>(<span>ABC News: Michael Lloyd</span>)</cite></p></figcaption></figure><h2 data-component="Heading">&#39;Chaotic&#39; moment for global postal services</h2><p>The decision — formalised in an executive order on July 30 — has caught many postal operators globally off guard.</p><p>Kate Muth, who leads the US-based trade association, International Mailers Advisory Group (IMAG), said many of its members are confused about how to collect the duties set to come into play from next week.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a bit chaotic here,&#34; she told ABC News from Washington, DC.</p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->A lot of uncertainty, a lot of concern about the postal stream being heavily impacted, and just a little over a week to get ready.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div><p>Australia Post is one of the global postal carriers that has elected to suspend transit mail to the US as it grapples with changes.</p><p>&#34;[Transit mail] is where a postal operator in one country will use the services of another postal operator to send it on to the final destination,&#34; Ms Muth explained.</p><p>&#34;For example, maybe the Philippines post uses Australia Post to send mail to the United States because Philippines has low volumes or infrequent flights.&#34;</p><p>The government-owned entity has not confirmed how many nations use Australia for transit mail, or what volume it handles for other countries, ultimately destined for the US.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Uncertainty around collection of tariffs</h2><p>ABC News has sighted an &#34;emergency information&#34; letter from the United Nations&#39; specialised postal agency informing members globally about Australia Post&#39;s decision.</p><p>&#34;This measure will take effect on 20 August 2025,&#34; the letter read.</p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->Any transit or misrouted items containing goods that are destined for the United States and arrive at Australia Post&#39;s international mail processing centres will be returned to origin.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div><p>The uncertainty with postage has also created chaos for Australian e-commerce retailers, with one Brisbane based brand, Apéro, deciding to halt shipping to the US this week.</p><p>&#34;The volatility in decision making, and the volatility of the market, and, quite frankly, the lack of ability of even Australia Post to be able to address these issues in a timely manner, puts us, and all of Australian fashion, in a really precarious position,&#34; Apéro co-founder Laz Smith told ABC News this week.</p><div data-component="EmphasisedText"><blockquote>&#34;<!-- -->We&#39;re just trying to react as quickly as we can.<!-- -->&#34;</blockquote></div><p>IMAG&#39;s Ms Muth said the overarching concern is that many postal carriers are not set up to &#34;collect and remit&#34; the duties specified by Donald Trump&#39;s executive order.</p><p>&#34;Australian Post is not set up to do that … they obviously have to work with either an airline carrier who is willing to do [this], and we have not heard of any airline carrier that&#39;s willing to,&#34;
