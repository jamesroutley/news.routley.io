    <h1>What I learned running a SaaS for a year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This time last year, I showed the internet a little prototype uptime checker I built using Next.js as the frontend, with services running on AWS Lambda. I gave myself <a href="https://onlineornot.com/building-saas-in-one-week-how-built-onlineornot">one week</a> to put it together.</p><p>I wrote a few articles about how the business was going throughout the year:</p><ul><li><a href="https://onlineornot.com/two-months-on-how-onlineornot-is-going">Two months in: How the SaaS that was built in 7 days is going</a></li><li><a href="https://onlineornot.com/six-months-on-how-onlineornot-is-going">Six months in: How the SaaS that was built in 7 days is going</a></li><li><a href="https://onlineornot.com/eight-months-of-onlineornot">8 Months of OnlineOrNot: From 7 Day MVP to Stable Product</a></li></ul><p>The gist of my approach is as follows:</p><p>I started with a single Lambda function that checks if static websites were still online, added an email alert if it&#39;s offline, wrapped authentication around it, integrated Stripe, and shipped it. Throughout the year, I kept adding features.</p><p>My trick for launching into 200 competitors providing the &#34;same&#34; service and still getting customers?</p><ul><li><p>I work two hours a day, every weekday on OnlineOrNot, and no other side projects. I managed to keep this going for about 10 months this year (with a cheeky 2 month burnout in the middle).</p></li><li><p>I focus particularly on features that solve customer pain (and I ask my customers what that pain is)</p></li><li><p>I&#39;m ruthlessly iterative. If I can&#39;t get a feature done in two hours, I figure out how to cut scope down to a two hour block, and ship that. Then iterate on it.</p></li></ul><p>Here&#39;s what I learned after a year:</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#youre-solving-a-problem-not-selling-a-saas-subscription">You&#39;re solving a problem, not selling a SaaS subscription</a></li><li><a href="#docs-are-part-of-your-user-experience">Docs are part of your user experience</a></li><li><a href="#build-for-mobile">Build for Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#ask-people-how-they-found-you">Ask people how they found you</a></li><li><a href="#use-analytics-set-up-funnel-tracking">Use analytics, set-up funnel tracking</a></li><li><a href="#sometimes-you-need-to-make-your-own-mistakes">Sometimes you need to make your own mistakes</a></li><li><a href="#pricing-is-bloody-hard-to-get-right">Pricing is bloody hard to get right</a></li><li><a href="#you-probably-focus-too-much-on-mrr">You probably focus too much on MRR</a></li><li><a href="#you-still-need-a-free-trial-for-paid-tiers">You still need a free trial for paid tiers</a></li><li><a href="#its-hard-to-bring-in-more-traffic-easy-to-change-what-your-current-traffic-does">It&#39;s hard to bring in more traffic, easy to change what your current traffic does</a></li><li><a href="#content-marketing-buys-you-time">Content marketing buys you time</a></li><li><a href="#ship-small-ship-often">Ship small, ship often</a></li><li><a href="#ship-first-worry-about-scale-later">Ship first, worry about scale later</a></li><li><a href="#you-dont-get-to-spend-as-much-time-working-on-the-problem-as-youd-think">You don&#39;t get to spend as much time working on the problem as you&#39;d think</a></li></ul><h2 id="youre-solving-a-problem-not-selling-a-saas-subscription"><a href="#youre-solving-a-problem-not-selling-a-saas-subscription" aria-label="what learned running saas for year permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>You&#39;re solving a problem, not selling a SaaS subscription</h2><p>When building a product, it helps to think from the perspective of your customers, rather than your own goal of selling subscriptions.</p><p>This takes you from a mindset of &#34;I&#39;m just going to keep building features, they&#39;ll all come eventually!&#34; to &#34;I should be helping my users solve this annoying problem&#34;.</p><p>SaaS is just one of many ways to solve a problem.

They tend to quickly create an account, add a few pages to monitor, then eventually get on their laptop/desktop to review their checks from time to time.</p><p>For about 6 months I didn&#39;t support mobile well, and folks that signed up on their phone churned rapidly. I eventually took the time to build responsive views for mobile, and now new mobile users are sticking around.</p><h2 id="ask-people-how-they-found-you"><a href="#ask-people-how-they-found-you" aria-label="what learned running saas for year permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Ask people how they found you</h2><p>One of the most valuable code changes I made this year was asking people as they signed up: &#34;How did you find out about OnlineOrNot?&#34;</p><p>You need to know where your users are finding you.</p><p>There are dozens of channels you could be using to attract potential customers, and it&#39;s useful to know whether to double-down on paid ads, content marketing, or shitposting on Twitter to bring in users.</p><h2 id="use-analytics-set-up-funnel-tracking"><a href="#use-analytics-set-up-funnel-tracking" aria-label="what learned running saas for year permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Use analytics, set-up funnel tracking</h2><p>Your marketing funnel helps you work out the health of your business. While it&#39;s nice to see how many people visit individual pages, it&#39;s even better to see how people flow across multiple pages.</p><p>When I say marketing funnel, I mean tracking the flow of people that visit your home page, eventually making it to your sign-up form, and finally making it inside the actual product. It helps you diagnose problems with your marketing copy, the sign-up form itself, as well as any onboarding you may have before the user actually sees your app.</p><h2 id="sometimes-you-need-to-make-your-own-mistakes"><a href="#sometimes-you-need-to-make-your-own-mistakes" aria-label="what learned running saas for year permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Sometimes you need to make your own mistakes</h2><p>I read quite a few business books, mainly from not wanting to repeat mistakes that others have made.</p><p>Sometimes though, you need to make mistakes for yourself.</p><p>As an example - it took me getting on the front page of Hacker News, having 6000 people visit my landing page, a few hundred people attempt to sign-up, and only single-digits making it through to the app for me to realise something might be wrong.</p><p>I had something like a 75% drop-off rate on my sign-up form alone.
