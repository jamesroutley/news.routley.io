<p>Great ideas are hard to find. Drawing makes it a lot easier. And fun. How?</p>



<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="286" height="200" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1_howtodrawideas.gif" alt="study, explore, develop, show" title="title image"/></figure></div>


<p>In a <a href="https://ralphammer.com/the-creative-switch/">creative process</a> drawing can play <strong>four different roles</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s say, we want to come up with<strong> ideas for a new flower pot</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="study"><strong>1. Study: Fill your mind</strong></h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="196" height="55" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2_study.gif" alt="study" title="section image"/></figure>



<p>To <strong>prepare</strong> for our ideation we first draw what we want to think about. These <strong>study drawings </strong>are realistic images. They force us to <strong>observe</strong> our subject closely and absorb as much knowledge as possible.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="541" height="165" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots.png" alt="Study drawings of plants and plant pots" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots.png 541w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots-300x91.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots-150x46.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots-455x139.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3_studyplantpots-267x81.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"/></figure>



<p>We clarify, pay attention to details, and make the invisible visible.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="538" height="223" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots.png" alt="Study drawings of plants and plant pots" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots.png 538w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots-300x124.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots-150x62.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots-455x189.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4_studyplantpots-267x111.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"/></figure>



<p>Illustrations <a href="https://ralphammer.com/a-lightbulb-is-not-an-idea/">make abstract thoughts accessible</a> to our <strong>emotional and bodily thinking</strong>—to our <strong>intuition</strong>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="566" height="162" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration.png" alt="an example for an illustration" title="illustration" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration.png 566w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration-300x86.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration-150x43.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration-455x130.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5_textillustration-267x76.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px"/></figure>



<p>So when we do text research, we add illustrations to make the new knowledge more <strong>concrete</strong> and <strong>real</strong>. Speaking of bodily <strong>experience</strong>: Don’t just look! If we want to learn about flower pots it helps to get our hands dirty and do some gardening. Hell, we might even try pottery! And of course we make sketches of everything we learn along the way.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="565" height="133" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant.png" alt="illustration how to repot a plant" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant.png 565w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant-300x71.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant-150x35.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant-455x107.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6_repotaplant-267x63.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"/></figure>



<p>The aim of the study phase is to understand <strong>what is there</strong> and <strong>what is going on</strong>. Since we can’t draw everything we are forced to make a choice. This helps us <strong>clarify our interests </strong>and what we actually want. </p>



<p>In our case, that means: what kind of flower pot we want to design.</p>



<h2 id="explore">2. Explore: Let it happen</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="212" height="127" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7_explore.gif" alt="explore" title="section image"/></figure>



<p>After we have taken in as much information as possible, we now want to go “crazy” and <strong>draw</strong> as <strong>many</strong> <strong>ideas</strong> as possible. </p>



<p>But what if our mind goes blank and we don’t have any? </p>



<p>Then we still need to draw. </p>



<p>Ok, but what?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="337" height="150" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8_doodles.png" alt="doodling" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8_doodles.png 337w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8_doodles-300x134.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8_doodles-150x67.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8_doodles-267x119.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px"/></figure>



<p>Anything! Just put that pen on the paper and <strong>keep it moving</strong>. Scribble, make random marks and shapes. This will kickstart our visual thinking process.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="522" height="137" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches.png" alt="rough sketches" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches.png 522w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches-300x79.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches-150x39.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches-455x119.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9_roughsketches-267x70.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"/></figure>



<p>And what are we thinking about? New plant pots of course! We draw everything that comes to mind. Everything! Those drawings just keep pouring <strong>from our mind through our hands on that sheet of paper</strong>. We have created a <strong>loop</strong> where our imaginations turn into drawings and those drawings initiate new imaginations.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="599" height="174" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas.png" alt="sketches of ideas" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas.png 599w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas-300x87.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas-150x44.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas-455x132.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10_potideas-267x78.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"/></figure>



<p>But these imaginations are fickle, they keep changing and might even disappear forever—if we don’t <strong>catch them with our pen</strong>. So we have to move <strong>fast</strong>! This is where all our hard work on those <a href="https://ralphammer.com/a-quick-beginners-guide-to-drawing/">drawing exercises</a> pays off. The better trained our hands and eyes are, the more <strong>spontaneous</strong> is the flow of ideas.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="203" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas.png" alt="sketches of ideas" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas.png 600w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas-300x102.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas-150x51.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas-455x154.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11_potideas-267x90.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"/></figure>



<p>And there is no need to worry about whether our drawings are ugly or unintelligible. At this point they are only here for us. We use drawing to have a <strong>productive private monologue</strong>, to think out loud on paper. The <strong>exploration</strong> phase is all about <strong>spontaneous</strong> drawings to <strong>get going</strong>, <strong>stimulate</strong> our imagination, and <strong>fixate</strong> all those ideas <strong>rapidly</strong>. It is not a beauty contest.</p>



<h2 id="develop">3. Develop: See how it works</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="233" height="127" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/12_develop.gif" alt="develop" title="section image"/></figure>



<p>Once we get into “sober mode” it is time to figure out which idea might actually work. So we <strong>arrange</strong> our ideas spatially, <strong>group them</strong> into similar ideas, and maybe add some <strong>annotations</strong>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="609" height="198" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured.png" alt="ideas for plant pots" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured.png 609w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured-300x98.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured-150x49.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured-455x148.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/13_ideasstructured-267x87.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px"/></figure>



<p>Then we make a selection and <strong>clarify</strong> what we are after. I decided to go for a plant pot that somehow supports the growth of the plant. These drawings are <strong>cleaner</strong> than our initial sketches.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="590" height="154" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified.png" alt="ideas for plant pots" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified.png 590w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified-300x78.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified-150x39.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified-455x119.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14_ideaclarified-267x70.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"/></figure>



<p>They are also more precise, especially since we want to explore the <strong>feasibility</strong> of our ideas.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="590" height="175" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility.png" alt="detailed drawing of plant pot" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility.png 590w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility-300x89.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility-150x44.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility-455x135.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/15_ideafeasibility-267x79.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"/></figure>



<h2 id="show">4. Show: Share what matters</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="90" height="70" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/16_show.gif" alt="show" title="section image"/></figure>



<p>To share our ideas with others we must <strong>focus on the essential</strong>.</p>



<p>The look and level of detail depend on the context. Our sketch here is made for an informal critique among designers. In a final product presentation we would use a series of images to lead the audience from the initial problem to the solution.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="334" height="242" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17_potrings.png" alt="presentation of plant pot idea" title="example" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17_potrings.png 334w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17_potrings-300x217.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17_potrings-150x109.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17_potrings-267x193.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px"/></figure>



<p>When ideas are still in their infancy—for example here I am not 100% sure we should go with the pot rings and want to discuss the idea with fellow designers—I recommend a very simple format: </p>



<ul>
<li>one headline</li>



<li>one image</li>



<li>one written sentence</li>
</ul>



<p>When we show an idea—as opposed to a final product—we usually want to<strong> make room for debate</strong>. The less we show, the more people can think and say. The drawing should be <strong>clear</strong> but <strong>not too elaborated</strong>. The text is kept <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>short</strong>. Too much information might suffocate precious feedback from others.</p>



<h2>Drawing ideas as an extension of our mind</h2>



<p><strong>Study</strong> drawings are <strong>rich with details</strong> to make us familiar with our subject. In the <strong>exploration</strong> phase we fixate fleeting imaginations on paper. These sketches are <strong>rough</strong>, <strong>spontaneous</strong>, and above all: <strong>fast</strong>!</p>



<p>To make sense of these sketches we <strong>clarify</strong> our ideas using <strong>elaborate clean</strong> drawings. When we <strong>show</strong> an idea to other people we keep it <strong>short</strong> and <strong>simple</strong>, to make room for debate.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="589" height="132" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow.png" alt="study, explore, develop, show" title="summary" srcset="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow.png 589w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow-300x67.png 300w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow-150x34.png 150w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow-455x102.png 455w, https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18_studyexploredevelopshow-267x60.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px"/></figure>



<p>Drawing ideas with pen and paper can build a bridge between our imagination and the reality we want to create. So get started with <a href="https://ralphammer.com/a-quick-beginners-guide-to-drawing/">these little drawing exercises</a>!</p>
