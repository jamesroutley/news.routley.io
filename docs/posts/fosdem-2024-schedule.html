<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>
  Like almost every other conference, FOSDEM invites speakers to gently start
  the day with talks concerning slightly less technical, but nevertheless
  interesting topics from the Open Source realm.
  The closing keynote at the end of the conference helps everyone digest the
  vast amount of insightful information collected over the weekend.
</p>




<h3>Main tracks</h3>
<p>
  The <q>main tracks</q> consist of series of talks that are organised by topic,
  where the FOSDEM program committee selects suggestions and actively invites
  speakers on those topics.
</p>


<p>
  For this edition the main tracks are:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Track</th>
      
        <th>Saturday</th>
      
        <th>Sunday</th>
      
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/main/">Main Track</a></td>

  </tbody>
</table>


<h3><a name="devrooms" id="devrooms"></a>Developer rooms</h3>
<p>
  The vast majority of events (talks, hacking sessions, open discussions) are
  held in so-called <q>developer rooms</q> (<q>devrooms</q>), which are
  organized and managed by open source projects themselves, or even
  associations between several such projects on a common topic in order to
  foster collaboration.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the list of the devrooms that are present at this edition of FOSDEM,
  in alphabetical order:
</p>



<h3>Lightning talks</h3>
<p>
  The lightning talk is a very popular format, used at many conferences, where
  speakers have a mere 15 minutes at their disposal to showcase an open
  source project, an idea, or a concept thereof.
</p>

<p>
  While that brief lapse of time may seem awkward, it almost always leads the
  presenters to concentrate on the absolute essence and what is really
  important, which is why it is often a much appreciated approach, as is the
  wide variety of the topics.
</p>


<p>
  There are currently <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/lightning_talks/">1
  lightning talks in the schedule</a>.
</p>


<h3>Stands</h3><p>
  Stands offer a unique chance to get in touch with developers or project
  members, and discover at a glance what they do.
</p>


<p>
  A list of projects that will be present with a stand can be found on the
  <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/">FOSDEM stands page</a>.
</p>


<h3>BOFs</h3><p>
  BOF stands for Birds Of a Feather who, as the saying goes, flock together.
  FOSDEM has three meeting rooms that may be booked in 30 or 60 minute blocks
  for discussions.  All the meetings are public so anyone who is interested can
  attend if there is enough space. 
</p>






<!--a name="certification"></a>
<h3> Certification Exams</h3>
<p>
  Several certification organizations provide FOSDEM visitors with the
  opportunity of taking certification exams during the conference.
</p>
<p>
  Further details are available on the <a href="page:/certification/">certification page</a>.
