    <h1>First Week at Recurse Center</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><p><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/rc">üè∑ rc</a></p><hr/><blockquote><span>&#34;</span>Don‚Äôt give up on it. Just stick with it. Don‚Äôt listen to people who always tell you it is hard, and walk away from it.&#34;</blockquote><hr/><p>It has been a whirlwind of a week for my first week at Recurse Center. The first two days were largely meet-and-greets with breakout rooms both in person and online for the folx who were remote. Everyone was so nice, and it was clear that RC had picked a group that was passionate about coding and learning. There were so many different ideas and projects I talked about, many sparking my interest in something new or stirring up long-forgotten ideas and projects that seemed worth working on. In a totally open and self-directed setting, it was overwhelming to try and focus. This is where those volitional muscles come in handy, along with thinking deeply about what excites you and why.</p><p>There was a pair programming workshop on day two, which was a ton of fun. I was paired with Jamine Palatnik to program the classic Conway‚Äôs Game of Life (something I‚Äôd not done before). We used Python for that. You can see a recording of the final product on <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-32-conways-game-of-life/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jamie‚Äôs blog</a>.</p><p>I spent days three and four far less focused and productive than I‚Äôd hoped to be. The other factor that I think contributes to my feeling overwhelmed, aside from the stream of new faces and ideas, is the in-person office environment itself. I‚Äôve worked remotely since 2014, with a brief few-month stint in an office in 2017, until this week. Combine that with coming from living in a small rural town, with rice fields and about five neighbors total, to a city like New York; I think I can give myself a little slack.</p><p>I did manage to get a few algorithm problems done and started on a Royal Game of Ur CLI game. I found it especially helpful to come in earlier in the morning before the bulk of people arrive. This gave me a small win for the day on an algorithm problem and also provided quiet time to collect my thoughts, set intents, and do a little bit of journaling.</p><p>As for what I hope to accomplish over the remainder of my time at RC, for now, I‚Äôm committed to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Write more on this blog &amp; be more public with my learning.</strong> <a href="https://www.maxmynter.com/pages/blog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Max</a> had an interesting take when we were discussing the shared about blogging to try and just commit to smaller ‚Äúmicroblogging‚Äù posts. I think it‚Äôs a pretty good one and might see how I can incorporate it in for next week with Mastodon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build a mini-operating system.</strong> Excited to test and deepen my OS knowledge and get to use RISC-V and C some more. <a href="https://pjg1.site/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Piya</a> and I will be using the book <a href="https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Operating System in 1000 Lines</a> as a jumping-off point to study and discuss the topics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Algorithm problems.</strong> I will continue to try and do a couple each week from <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://cses.fi/problemset/</a>, selecting from the various areas of algorithm types.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Engineering @ MIT (6.172).</strong> A group of Recursers is going to work on this course. I liked the fact that it uses C/Assembly and focused on how we, as programmers, can try to get the most out of our hardware with threading, parallel processing, and data packing, etc.</p></li></ul></div></div>
