    <h1>Yak-Shaving for a Rubber Duck</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m a professional programmer and a casual crocheter.
A few years ago, I made the most
<em>idiomatic</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> project possible for a programmer:
a hoodie for a rubber duck, made from yak wool.</p>

<h2 id="rubber-duck">Why a duck?</h2>
<p>There’s a debugging technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber-duck debugging</a>.
My phrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put a rubber duck on your desk.</p>
<p>Go through your code step-by-step, explaining it in terms that the duck understands.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the end, you’ll realize why the code doesn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t have to be a rubber duck: I’ll often use a journal
or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">peer</a> instead of an inanimate object.
But I still keep the duck on my desk.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I use rubber-duck debugging for computer programs, but I hear from <a href="https://edieeckman.com" target="_blank">Edie</a> that
it also works for people programs.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="why-yak-wool">Why yak wool?</h2>
<p>Another idiom in programming circles is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving" target="_blank"><em>yak-shaving</em></a>:</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
  
  
    <p>…yak shaving is what you are doing when you’re doing some
stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what
you’re supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal
relations links what you’re doing to the original meta-task.</p>

<p>The example I learned goes something like this:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>I need to take the bar exam, but it requires a Windows computer, and we only have Linux around the house.</li>
<li>To install Windows, I need an 8GB USB stick, but I don’t have one.</li>
<li>I could borrow one from Chris, but I had promised to knit his kid a sweater and haven’t, so it would be awkward to ask.</li>
<li>The kid is (somehow) allergic to acrylic <em>and</em> sheep wool <em>and</em> alpaca … but not yaks?</li>
<li>There isn’t yak wool for sale,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> but there is a farm nearby that will let me shave a yak for a reasonable amount of money.</li>
</ul>
<p>So… I’m shaving a yak to take the bar exam.</p>
<p>There’s a nuance in the usage I’m familiar with: the yak-shaving is <em>not strictly necessary</em> for
the original task. I don’t really need to shave the yak – I could just get a USB stick from the store –
but shaving the yak lets me put off installing Windows.</p>

<p>I didn’t <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding" target="_blank">spend a lot of time</a> <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#bikeshed-painting" target="_blank">picking a color</a>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>I made the body and hood by freehand single-crochet in the round.
I made the front pocket separately, and (clumsily) attached it after the fact.</p>
<p>According to my records,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> I used <a href="https://myak.it/" target="_blank">mYak</a> Baby Yak Medium yarn, in the “Oatmeal” colorway. (That’s not an affiliate link; I have no relation with mYak.)</p>
<p>If you’re interested in crochet, I <em>of course</em> recommend <a href="https://edieeckman.com" target="_blank">Edie Eckman</a>’s
courses, books, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EdieEckman" target="_blank">videos</a>. (Yes, we are related.)</p>
