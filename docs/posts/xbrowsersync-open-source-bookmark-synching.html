          xBrowserSync respects your privacy and gives you complete anonymity. No sign up is required and no personal
          data is ever collected. To start syncing
          simply download xBrowserSync for your desktop browser or mobile platform, enter an encryption password and
          click Create New Sync! You’ll receive an anonymous
          sync ID which identifies your data and can be used to access your data on other browsers and devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          xBrowserSync does not only sync but also enhances your productivity by enriching your native browser bookmarks
          with the addition of descriptions and
          tags, and an intuitive search interface enables you to find, modify and share bookmarks quickly and easily.
          xBrowserSync even adds descriptions and
          tags to new bookmarks for you automatically. And don’t ever worry about losing your data thanks to the
          included back up and restore functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The xBrowserSync desktop browser web extension syncs your browser data between desktop browsers. It works with
          the browser’s native bookmarking
          features so you can keep using the native tools whilst always staying in sync. If you like to organise your
          bookmarks into folders don’t worry,
          xBrowserSync respects your bookmark hierarchy and syncs it across your browsers.

          Get the xBrowserSync mobile app for your Android mobile device. Search through your synced bookmarks just as
          you would using
          the web extension, except adding new bookmarks is as easy as sharing from your favourite apps (browsers,
          YouTube, Spotify and many other apps that share URLs).
        </p>
      <p>
          Choose from a growing list of
          <a href="#services">public xBrowserSync services</a> to sync to, or run your very own xBrowserSync service for
          syncing in complete privacy. The xBrowserSync team runs the official <a href="https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api">xBrowserSync service</a> which is the default service that
          xBrowserSync uses, but anyone can <a href="https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api-repo">run their own service</a>
          and take complete control of their data.
        </p>
      <p>
          The number of xBrowserSync users are growing every day and the code base is active and being constantly
          improved. The current
          roadmap is to support all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge), and sync open tabs and
          history as well as bookmarks. If you would like to contribute to the development of xBrowserSync
          to help deliver functionality sooner, read more on how you can

        <h4>Host</h4>
        <p>
          The number of xBrowserSync users are growing every day and those users require xBrowserSync services to sync
          their
          data to. In order for xBrowserSync to remain free, we need volunteers who are willing to host a public
          xBrowserSync service on their own server for users to sync to. If you are interested in hosting a service,
          <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">clone</a> or download the xBrowserSync API
          source code from our <a href="https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api-repo">GitHub repo</a> and follow the
          instructions in the <a href="https://link.xbrowsersync.org/api-repoblob/master/README.md">README</a>. Once
          your service is up and running, <a href="#contact">let us know </a> the URL so it can be added to the <a href="#services">list of public xBrowserSync services</a>.
