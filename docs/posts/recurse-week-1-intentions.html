    <h1>Recurse week 1 Intentions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s the First day of my batch today. We <del>haven&#39;t had the kickoff meeting yet</del> but
I&#39;m taking some time to set intentions for the week.</p>
<p>This week is inevitably dedicated to figuring things out, and I don&#39;t think I
should expect to get a lot of programming done, but I do still want to set some
goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Figure out the shape of my days: I&#39;m 6 hours ahead NY time, so core hours fall
between 5-11pm. Can I get some work done in the morning? How can I ensure I&#39;m
productive in the evening? How do other remote recurses do it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out the shape of the full batch. I have some project ideas, but I&#39;m
going back and forth between depth and breadth. I&#39;m hoping that after intro chats
and meeting other recurses this week I&#39;ll have a better idea of what&#39;s possible
/ realistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would still like to get some small project done. A big explicit goal for me is
to build shipping muscle, meaning once I set out to do something, finish it,
write about it and present it. I would like to have something small and
presentable by the end of the week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of meta concerns I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can i make sure I get a healthy amount of movement in? Given the timezone
difference, I won&#39;t get a lot of time to skate/surf/bmx in the next 6 weeks.
I&#39;ve grabbed a jump rope, yoga mat and some resistance bands to make sure I get
some workouts during the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&#39;s a good ratio of blogging to coding? I want to use blogging as an
accountability method, but I know how easy it is to spend way too long on a
piece of writing...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, piece of writing done. Time to get to work.</p>
