    <h1>Anthropic hires OpenAI co-founder Durk Kingma</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Durk Kingma, one of the lesser-known co-founders of OpenAI, today <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dpkingma/status/1841134573595312344">announced</a> that he’ll be joining Anthropic.</p>

<p>In a series of posts on X, Kingma revealed that he’ll be working mostly remotely, from the Netherlands (where he’s based), but didn’t say which Anthropic org he’ll be joining — or leading. </p>

	
	


<p>Reached for comment, an Anthropic spokesperson pointed to Kingma’s posts.</p>

<p>“Anthropic’s approach to AI development resonates significantly with my own beliefs,” Kingma wrote. “[L]ooking forward to contributing to Anthropic’s mission of developing powerful AI systems responsibly. Can’t wait to work with their talented team, including a number of great ex-colleagues from OpenAI and Google, and tackle the challenges ahead!”</p>

<p>Kingma, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning from the University of Amsterdam, spent several years as a doctoral fellow at Google before joining OpenAI’s founding team as a research scientist. At OpenAI, Kingma focused on basic research, leading the algorithms team to develop techniques and methods primarily for generative AI models, including image generators (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/openai-unveils-dall-e-3-allows-artists-to-opt-out-of-training/">DALL-E 3</a>) and large language models (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Kingma left to become a part-time angel investor and advisor for AI startups. He rejoined Google in July of that year, and started at Google Brain, which became one of the tech giant’s premiere AI R&amp;D labs before it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/google-consolidates-ai-research-divisions-into-google-deepmind/">merged with DeepMind</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>Kingma’s hiring is yet another talent coup for Anthropic, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/">recruited</a> OpenAI’s former safety lead, Jan Leike, in May, and another OpenAI co-founder, John Schulman, in August. The company made an additional splashy hire in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/anthropic-hires-instagram-co-founder-as-head-of-product/">appointing</a> Instagram and Artifact co-founder Mike Krieger as its first head of product.</p>

	
	



<p>Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was once the VP of research at OpenAI, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8de92f3a-228e-4bb8-961f-96f2dce70ebb">reportedly</a> split with the firm after a disagreement over OpenAI’s roadmap — namely its growing commercial focus. Amodei brought with him a number of ex-OpenAI employees to launch Anthropic, including OpenAI’s former policy lead Jack Clark.</p>

	
	


<p>Anthropic has often attempted to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;text=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;via=techcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;summary=Jan+Leike%2C+a+leading+AI+researcher+who+earlier+this+month+resigned+from+OpenAI+before+publicly+criticizing+the+company%E2%80%99s+approach+to+AI+safety%2C+has+joined+OpenAI+rival+Anthropic+to+lead+a+new+%E2%80%9Csuperalignment%E2%80%9D+team.+In+a+post+on+X%2C+Leike+said+that+his+team+at+Anthropic+will+focus+on+various+aspects+of+AI+safety+and+security%2C+%5B%E2%80%A6%5D&amp;mini=1&amp;source=TechCrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="mailto:?subject=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/"></a></p>
