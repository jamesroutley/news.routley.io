  <p>For the first time, solar was the largest source of electricity in the EU last month, supplying a record 22 percent of the bloc’s power.</p><p>At least 13 countries saw solar output hit a new monthly high in June, according to an <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/solar-is-eus-biggest-power-source-for-the-first-time-ever/">analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember. Solar amounted to more than 40 percent of generation in the Netherlands and 35 percent in Greece.</p><p>Nuclear was the second biggest source of electricity across the bloc, followed by wind, natural gas, and hydropower. Coal generated just 6 percent of electricity, a new monthly low. Fifteen EU countries are now coal-free, including Austria, Belgium, and Ireland, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/ireland-shuts-last-coal-plant-as-europe-s-phaseout-accelerates">shuttered</a> its last coal plant last month. </p><p>Analysts say that the June surge in solar power <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/heat-and-power-impacts-of-the-2025-heatwave-in-europe/">helped</a> Europe weather a brutal heat wave, which saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/italy-limits-outdoor-work-as-heatwave-breaks-records-across-europe">temperatures</a> soar upwards of 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Solar power was most abundant at midday, when there was the greatest demand for air conditioning, helping to ease strain on the grid and prevent blackouts.</p><p>“Heat waves will not go away – they will only get more severe in the future,” said Pawel Czyzak, an analyst at Ember. “Luckily, there is no lack of sunshine during heat waves.”</p><p>Last month was the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/heatwaves-contribute-warmest-june-record-western-europe#:~:text=What&#39;s%20more%2C%20June%202025%20as,by%20just%200.06%C2%B0C.">warmest</a> June on record in Europe, and scientists say that climate change played a key role in the heat wave, pushing temperatures to dangerous extremes. An <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/all-publications/climate-change-tripled-heat-related-deaths-in-early-summer-european-heatwave.php">analysis</a> from Imperial College London found that warming was responsible for 1,500 of the estimated 2,300 heat-related deaths across Europe, meaning “the death toll was tripled due to the burning of fossil fuels.”</p><h2><strong>ALSO ON YALE E360</strong></h2><p><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/pakistan-solar-boom"><i><strong>Pakistan’s Solar Revolution Is Bringing Power to the People</strong></i></a></p>
