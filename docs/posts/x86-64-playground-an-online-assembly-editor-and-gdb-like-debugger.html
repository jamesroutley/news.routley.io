          x86-64 assembly.
</p> <p>
The Playground web app provides an online code editor where you
        can write, compile, and share assembly code for a wide
        range of popular assemblers such as GNU As, Fasm and Nasm.
</p> <p>
Unlike traditional onlide editors, this playground
          allows you to follow the execution of your program step by step,
        inspecting memory and registers of the running process from a GDB-like interface.
</p> <p>
You can bring your own programs!
        Drag and drop into the app any x86-64-Linux static executable to run and 
        debug it in the same sandboxed environment, without having to install anything.
</p> </section> <section> <h3>Who is this for?</h3> <p>The app is for anyone that wants to run amd64 assembly snippets or
          inspect the inner workings of simple Linux ELF files.</p> <p>It has been designed with the academic world of binary exploitation in mind;
            The debugger interface offers visualizations similar to the GDB+PwnGDB debugger plugin,
            and all the controls are labelled with the respective GDB commands.
</p> <p>Combined with <a href="https://godbolt.org">Compiler Explorer</a>, this app provides
            a noise-free environment to learn the basics behind the inner workings of a Linux process.
            When you are ready, it includes the guides and resources necessary to keep experimenting
            on your own linux environment, with the actual GDB debugger.
</p> </section> <section> <div> <div> <h3>Designed for the web </h3> <p>Have you ever seen a responsive debugger?
        The app places the mobile experience at the center of its design,
        and can be embedded in any web page
        to add interactivity to technical tutorials or documentations.
</p> <p>
Follow the guide to <a href="https://x64.halb.it/"> embed in your website </a> both the asm editor and debugger.

The app is open-source, and <a href="https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground">available on Github</a>.
  It&#39;s powered by the <a href="https://github.com/jart/blink/">Blink Emulator</a>,
  which emulates an x86-64-Linux environment entirely client side in your browser.
  This means that all the code you write, or the excutables you debug are never sent to the server.
</p> <p>
everything runs in your browser, and once the Web App loads it will work 
  without an internet connection.
