    <h1>How to communicate why your startup is worth joining</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Except for a handful of companies who send people to Mars or develop AGI, most startups don’t seem to offer a good reason to join them. You go to their websites and all you see is vague, baseless, overly generic mission-schmission/values-schvalues HR nonsense that supposedly should turn you into a raving fan of whatever they’re doing and make you hit that “Join” button until their servers crash. Well…</p><p>Some people think that’s because most startups aren’t worth joining. I disagree. This argument generalizes one’s own reasons for joining a startup onto every other human being out there, which is unlikely to be true. I think most startups, no matter how ordinary, <em>do</em> have a reason to join them; <em>a good reason</em>; even <em>many good reasons</em> — they just fail to communicate them well. They’re like a shy nerd on Tinder with an empty bio and no profile pic: a kind, intelligent, and thoughtful human being who, unfortunately, will be ruthlessly swiped left — not because he’s a bad match but because his profile doesn’t show why he’s a good one.</p><p>Visually, this “Tinder profile problem” looks like this:</p><div><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates not seeing why to join a startup" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/illustration-1-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Now, look what would happen if a startup communicated a bit better. Suddenly, our candidates could see a reason to join. If the reason is good, they might even swipe right.</p><div><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing one reason to join a startup" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/illustration-2-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>But most startups have <em>many</em> good reasons to join them. If only they communicated well, the outcome would be something like this:</p><div><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing many reasons to join; one candidate already running for it" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/illustration-3-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Now, you’re probably wondering just what exactly those reasons are.</p><p>Here’s a rough list:</p><ol><li>The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</li><li>The team is great</li><li>The culture is amazing</li><li>The business is doing well</li></ol><p>However, if you just copy this list and paste it on your jobs page, you will accomplish nothing. The candidates will never believe you. What you need to do instead is to <em>supply them with a system of concretes (facts) from which their minds will form these abstract conclusions.</em></p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Instead of declaring that “the founders are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent,” show them how so, like Sarah from Canny does by writing comprehensive year-in-review blog posts for <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four years in a row</a>.</li><li>Instead of proclaiming that “the founders are humble and can have fun,” show them how so, like Michael from Fibery did by becoming a hero of <a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this hilarious page</a>. (No businessy founder would ever agree to make this public. Michael did.)</li><li>Instead of purporting that “the team is great” or “you’ll work alongside very smart people” (God, I hate that one!), show them who exactly those people are, as PostHog does <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Wasp does <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In the rest of the post, I’ll go through the four broad reasons to join a startup one by one and show real-life examples of communicating them well. In the end, I will explain how these four reasons, communicated well, fuse into two compelling messages that will interest any candidate.</p><p>One last thing. For the sake of clarity and comprehension, I will write in the second person. Instead of saying “candidates would never believe them,” I will say “you would never believe them.” It’s much easier to read and understand.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well"></a><strong>Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well</strong><a href="#possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it"></a><strong>1. FOUNDERS — or, the founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</strong><a href="#1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Most startups have curious, interesting, ambitious, terribly smart founders; the kind most of us would love to work for if we had a chance. Sadly, only a few leverage this asset. In most cases, all you get is a small round pic with a fancy title and a few abstract, high-level sentences that cause no excitement whatsoever. What a shame!</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-canny-commmunicates-who-their-founders-are"></a><strong>How Canny commmunicates who their founders are</strong><a href="#how-canny-commmunicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="founder-stories-blog-category"></a><strong>Founder Stories blog category</strong><a href="#founder-stories-blog-category" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The first notable thing Canny does is the <a href="https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Founder Stories category</a> in their blog. By quickly skimming the posts, you can understand that Sarah and Andrew (the founders):</p><ul><li>Accept their mistakes, talk about them, and learn from them. Even if the issue is sensitive, like firing people. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/reflections-two-year-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reflections from the last 2 years as a founder</a>, <a href="https://canny.io/blog/hire-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First hire to first fire</a>.)</li><li>Are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent people. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup</a>, <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected</a>.)</li><li>Have very definite, clear values. But, more importantly, stand up to them, even if that means losing revenue. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/saying-no-big-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saying no to big customers</a>.)</li></ul><p>If they just pinned this list of virtues to their Jobs page, you would never believe them. Instead, Sarah and Andrew show what actions they take, how they work, how they think, <em>how they live</em> — and you make up their own mind about what kind of people Sarah and Andrew are from seeing all that. The difference is enormous.</p><p>Note their writing style. They don’t claim to be know-it-alls with titles like “How <em>to</em> bootstrap your startup.” Instead, they write “How <em>we</em> Bootstrapped <em>our</em> SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability.” They cover only what they know instead of overgeneralizing. This shows both expertise and humility.</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#39;s Founder Stories blog category" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/canny-founder-stories-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="personal-instagram"></a><strong>Personal Instagram</strong><a href="#personal-instagram" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The second thing Sarah and Andrew do well to communicate who they are is their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carryoncode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. They don’t post glamorous keynote appearances, as many entrepreneurs do. They share the actual day-to-day working life — both the fun and the struggle. It gives you a good idea of what they’re after in life. (Not keynotes.) That’s why it works, and that’s why people love it.</p><div><figure><img alt="A photo from Sarah and Andrew&#39;s personal Instagram" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/canny-instagram-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Side note: Sarah explains how she develops the Canny brand in <a href="https://canny.io/blog/building-your-brand-with-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>. If you want to build a good one, give it a read. She also wrote about how they attract top talent. You can read it <a href="https://canny.io/blog/startup-attract-top-talent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-fibery-communicates-who-their-founder-is"></a><strong>How Fibery communicates who their founder is</strong><a href="#how-fibery-communicates-who-their-founder-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="startup-diary-blog-post-series"></a><strong>Startup Diary blog post series</strong><a href="#startup-diary-blog-post-series" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>While you can get a pretty good idea of Michael (the founder) from the hilarious “<a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a>” page Fibery shipped last year, his <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/startup-diary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Diary post series</a> offers an even better insight into his soul. In these monthly posts, Michael honestly shares everything that’s going on with Fibery, including the good, the bad, and the ugly: firing people for poor performance, losing important customers, and failing to reach product-market fit. The fact that he’s already written 45 of those (as of Aug 2022) is also telling. And he’s not a native English speaker. If he can do that, why can’t you?</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#39;s Startup Diary blog category" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/fibery-startup-diary-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="crazy-challenges"></a><strong>Crazy challenges</strong><a href="#crazy-challenges" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Besides writing the Startup Diary, Michael also embarks on crazy challenges like <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/100-posts-about-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing 100 posts about products</a>. Only a passionate, driven person would commit to such a thing. You cannot help but respect him for it. (Before this challenge, he wrote 100 Medium posts in 100 days in 2018. You can read them <a href="https://mdubakov.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Just scroll a few screens to reach the old stuff.)</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#39;s 100 posts about products blog category" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/fibery-challenges-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you look carefully, you’ll notice that Michael’s thinking about building a company is different from Sarah’s. For example, he despises the gentle, soothing “Oh don’t worry that it didn’t work out; you did such a good work!” approach, which is ubiquitous in the modern startup world. Instead, he states that <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/dissatisfaction-leads-to-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissatisfaction leads to progress</a>, referring to the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Not quite my tempo”</a> scene from Whiplash. Does that make you like him more than Sarah?</p><p>It depends. If you believe that being soft and balanced is better, you’ll go with Sarah; if you believe that real progress comes only from working yourself to the bone, you’ll go with Michael (or Elon). The important thing is that both founders have their own, unique viewpoints of how things should be done, and that they communicate these viewpoints as-is instead of chopping their legs off to fit the latest Procrustean fad.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry"></a><strong>In-depth, original blog posts about the industry</strong><a href="#in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Some entrepreneurs say that doing a startup is like “jumping off a cliff and building your wings on the way down.” Some of it might be true. But if you want <em>reasonable</em> people to jump with you, you better tell them that you have a degree in engineering and know how to assemble wings in a free fall. Otherwise, the only team you’ll recruit is a suicide squad looking for a splashy hit.</p><p>To communicate his expertise, Michael writes in-depth, original, theoretical posts about the nature of knowledge management and organizational productivity. These posts are gems, both literally and metaphorically. (They’re filed under the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gems category</a> in the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery blog</a>.)</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-vision-v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery.io Vision v.1: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/the-next-wave-of-work-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Wave of Work Management Software</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/augmenting-organizational-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmenting Organizational Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/use-networks-to-prioritize-product-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Networks to Prioritize Product Features</a></li></ul><p>After reading these articles, you understand not only that Michael really knows how to build wings while falling off the cliff, but that he has already jumped a few times. (Prior to Fibery, Michael had worked on knowledge management for more than a decade. He also had built a successful project management software, <a href="https://www.apptio.com/products/targetprocess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targetprocess</a>.) You know that he’s an expert who can be trusted.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Michael writes differently from Sarah, they both leverage what they’re good at. Sarah does not try to produce treatises on software development philosophy, and Michael doesn’t gush out with his personal learnings from building a startup. That, I think, is the right way to do it.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are"></a><strong>How PostHog communicates who their founders are</strong><a href="#how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>PostHog’s founders James and Tim don’t write 100 posts in 100 days or run a personal Instagram. But they’ve come up with something else to communicate what kind of people they are. And it’s something unique.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="well-written-concise-bio"></a><strong>Well-written, concise bio</strong><a href="#well-written-concise-bio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>First, both founders have decent <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profiles</a> in the company handbook. These bios are short, clear, and humane. They’re also very specific. Where else have you seen the name of the CEO’s cat?</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#39; bio in the PostHog Handbook" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-bio-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="personal-readme-files"></a><strong>Personal README files</strong><a href="#personal-readme-files" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Second, both James and Tim have an extensive README file (<a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a>, <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>) on how to work with them. These files give you an insight into their productivity habits, interests, and quirks. In fact, after reading them, you will likely have a better idea of the founders than you’d usually get from working at a company for a month!</p><p>For instance, James’s file has sections like:</p><ul><li><strong>Short bio.</strong> Includes very specific details like: “I tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.”</li><li><strong><em>Very clear</em> areas of responsibility.</strong> No need to wonder what the hell the CEO is doing anymore!</li><li><strong>Quirks.</strong> These are remarkably humble and open-minded, like:<ul><li>“If I haven’t responded to something that you’ve sent me, that’s probably because I’ve read it and don’t feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don’t hear back in a reasonable time frame.”</li><li>“I’m a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.”</li><li>Explaining these quirks is an ingenious move. Besides explaining how to work with James, this section communicates that he’s profoundly self-aware and willing to accept and leverage his weaknesses. These qualities are very rare and incredibly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What I value.</strong> In stark contrast to most HR nonsense, these values are very clear, very specific, and written in English rather than HRese. (I just came up with this term: it means “legalese but for HR.”) Here are two examples:<ul><li>“Proactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn’t have hired you if I didn’t trust you. I’d rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don’t get anything done at all.”</li><li>“Directness impresses me. If you don’t like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.”</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to that, there’s also: How I can help you, How you can help me, My goals until end December 2022 (very specific!), Personal strategy, Execution todo (including “1 bike ride a week”!) and Archived todo.</p><p>In summary, this README page is a gem. I wish more founders had them.</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#39; README in the PostHog Handbook" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-readme-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are"></a><strong>How we at Wasp communicate who our founders are</strong><a href="#how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page"></a><strong>“Who we are” section of every job description page</strong><a href="#who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Matija and Martin (the founders of Wasp) embedded a concise description of who they are right into each <a href="https://www.notion.so/402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description page</a> in Notion. They knew that this is the first company artifact many candidates will see. So they saved candidates time and effort on digging up who the hell started Wasp.</p><p>Note the language and substance of this list. When you read it, you immediately get a sense of who Matija and Martin are as people — fun, easygoing, no-corporate-bullshit kinda guys. Now imagine it said something “more normal,” like: “The company was founded by seasoned entrepreneurs…” What impression would that make?</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Wasp&#39;s job description page" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/wasp-who-we-are-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="2-team--or-the-team-is-great"></a><strong>2. TEAM — or, the team is great</strong><a href="#2-team--or-the-team-is-great" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>It is startling how little most startups tell you about their teams. Often all you get is a chessboard of faces and titles, which gives you no idea who these people are <em>as people</em> or how working with them will feel like<em>.</em> Given how crucial a reason “great team” is for most candidates, improving how you communicate it seems like a low-hanging fruit.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-canny-communicates-who-is-on-their-team"></a><strong>How Canny communicates who is on their team</strong><a href="#how-canny-communicates-who-is-on-their-team" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="decent-team-page"></a><strong>Decent team page</strong><a href="#decent-team-page" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The Canny’s difference starts with a team page.

In most cases, all you get here is a generic “developer” or “marketer” without any personal details. Bios of robots, not people. No wonder nothing comes to mind, except perhaps for Agent Smith.

They’re Neos in the world of Smiths.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="remarkable-why-work-at-canny-blog-post"></a><strong>Remarkable “Why work at Canny” blog post</strong><a href="#remarkable-why-work-at-canny-blog-post" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>From there, it gets only better. Canny’s chief weapon for explaining their team is a blog post, the “<a href="https://canny.io/blog/work-at-canny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why work at Canny</a>” blog post. Sarah wrote it back in the summer of 2021. It is full of quotes from team members and photos of their workdays and vacations. <em>Real photos of real people</em>. No wonder the comments section under the post abounds with raving fans willing to join the team straight away!</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of comments under the Canny&#39;s Why work at Canny blog post" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/canny-why-work-post-comments-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Perhaps the best thing about this post is how little work it takes to create one. I imagine that collecting the data took some time, but the actual writing (it’s an 11-min read) took no more than a week. A week of work for a candidate magnet of such tremendous power? Sounds like a deal.</p><p><em>P.s. Sarah writes a lot more about their team in her yearly review posts, but I decided not to elaborate on those for the sake of clarity.

What I didn’t say is that each post communicates something about the team: who did what that month, random Slack posts (links, quotes, tweets, and images), etc. If someone new joined that month, Michael writes a few paragraphs explaining who that person is, where they come from, what they’re going to do at Fibery, and even attaches a photo.

CULTURE — or, the culture is amazing</strong><a href="#3-culture--or-the-culture-is-amazing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>While researchers still argue about the ultimate definition, most of us understand culture as “what working here feels like” and/or “how we do things here.” We also understand how crucial it is for those looking for work. It seems glaringly obvious that startups should work hard on communicating their culture. Yet, most companies don’t. Or, even worse, they flood their websites with meaningless HR fluff, which only scares interesting people away. In short, communicating culture well is another low-hanging fruit waiting to be picked.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-canny-communicates-their-culture"></a><strong>How Canny communicates their culture</strong><a href="#how-canny-communicates-their-culture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Canny does an outstanding job at communicating their culture. The primary tool they employ is, once again, their <a href="https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>. (Note how multifunctional it is: founders, expertise, team, and now culture.) The posts in the Founder Stories category convey very well what working at Canny feels like. Here are a few examples.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="why-work-at-canny-blog-post"></a><strong>“Why work at Canny” blog post</strong><a href="#why-work-at-canny-blog-post" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>I’ll risk repeating myself, but <a href="https://canny.io/blog/work-at-canny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> so beautifully explains Canny’s culture that I couldn’t resist. It mentions why and how they work remotely, how they do team retreats (with photos and a <a href="https://youtu.be/u4yOS1cuMSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> from Lisbon!), and how they had fun together playing weird Zoom games when travel was not an option due to Covid.</p><p>Pay attention to the imagery. It communicates a lot more information than any lengthy, elaborate description would. Indeed, a picture is often worth a thousand words.</p><div><figure><img alt="A photo of Canny&#39;s two team members hacking in Denver" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/canny-hacking-in-denver-min.jpeg"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post"></a><strong>“Lessons from a year of team retreats” blog post</strong><a href="#lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Instead of saying that “team is our priority” or “we invest in our people,” Sarah <a href="https://canny.io/blog/lessons-from-team-retreats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> what they’ve done to support their team. </p><p>Again, note how specific the imagery is.</p><div><figure><img alt="A photo from Canny&#39;s Lessons from a year of team retreats blog post" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/canny-year-of-retreats-min.jpeg"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Interestingly, Sarah’s post isn’t framed as “hey we do many team retreats, we’re awesome, come work for us.” If they wrote that, the reader would feel uneasy. They would sense bragging. That’s why the explicit message in the post is what Canny learned doing team retreats, not that they’ve done many. This explicit message, however, <em>implies</em> that they indeed have done many retreats! It sends a message that Canny cares for their employees without explicitly saying so. This is what true mastery looks like.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post"></a><strong>“The end of our digital nomad journey” blog post</strong><a href="#the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Although <a href="https://canny.io/blog/end-digital-nomad-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> describes Sarah and Andrew’s personal nomad experience, Sarah managed to reveal Canny’s culture through it.

It shows what working from home is <em>really</em> like. It’s the funniest thing I’ve ever seen done by a software startup. (Have you ever seen a CEO being licked by a dog?) It also shows how the Fibery team works and even how they use Fibery to build Fibery. Like Canny’s “Lessons from a year of team retreats” blog post, it does so implicitly. A true masterpiece.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="weird-humorous-site"></a><strong>Weird, humorous site</strong><a href="#weird-humorous-site" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Broadly, the whole <a href="https://fibery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> screams that Fibery is a place for misfits, rebels, and trouble makers; the place where such people will be valued and will feel like home; the place built around brutal honesty and spicy humor.</p><p>The “What (non-)customers say” section is worth a mention. Over my nine years in startups, I haven’t seen a site that a) lists <em>bad</em> customer reviews; and b) uses 💩 emoji as a filter. Again, this is telling.

Their primary tool is the <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostHog Handbook</a>, which covers virtually <em>every</em> aspect of what working at PostHog feels like: interviews, onboarding, training, management, communication, and even firing.

PostHog does not merely list their values as meaningless abstractions but supports them with evidence.

PROGRESS — or, the business is doing well</strong><a href="#4-progress--or-the-business-is-doing-well" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When you just closed an $80 million Series B or signed Facebook as a customer, communicating progress is easy. You just state these facts. However, most companies need to attract great people way before Series B. In fact, it is these very people who’re going to get you there. As most startups are secretive about how things are going, communicating that things are going <em>somehow</em> — no matter how negligible your progress in contrast to the big guys — becomes quite an advantage. It immediately de-risks the opportunity in the candidate’s eyes. So, if EXPERTISE is about convincing candidates that you know how to build the wings, PROGRESS is about showing them the half-built carcass on your way down. Both are important if you want great people to jump off the cliff with you.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-canny-communicates-their-progress"></a><strong>How Canny communicates their progress</strong><a href="#how-canny-communicates-their-progress" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>To give candidates a sense that things are moving, that this company is not some long slog but a place where progress is made every day, that they can become a part of something that’s growing and, therefore, can grow themselves, to do all that, Canny does two things.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="year-in-review-blog-posts"></a><strong>“Year in review” blog posts</strong><a href="#year-in-review-blog-posts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The first one is their “Year in review” blog post series.

As a result, candidates can get a good idea of how things are going <em>in less than a minute.</em> That’s something to aspire to.</p><p>Here’s the section titles:</p><ul><li>Jan 2020: The start</li><li>Feb 2020: Launch</li><li>Apr 2020: $3M Seed round</li><li>May 2020: First 1,000 users</li><li>Oct 2020: Billions of events supported</li><li>Nov 2020: Building a platform</li><li>Dec 2020: $9M Series A</li><li>Jun 2021: $15M Series B</li><li>Sep 2021: Product Market fit achieved for PostHog Scale</li></ul><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of PostHog&#39;s Story page" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/posthog-story-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="how-we-at-wasp-communicate-our-progress"></a><strong>How we at Wasp communicate our progress</strong><a href="#how-we-at-wasp-communicate-our-progress" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="blog-posts-covering-big-milestones-yc-15m-seed"></a><strong>Blog posts covering big milestones (YC, $1.5m seed)</strong><a href="#blog-posts-covering-big-milestones-yc-15m-seed" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>For each milestone, Matija and Martin (Wasp founders) write a blog post describing not only what they accomplished but also <em>how</em> they did it.</p><p>For example, when Wasp got into YC, they didn’t just post the news on Twitter. They wrote a blog about <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/02/23/journey-to-ycombinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their journey to Y Combinator</a>. It got thousands of views.</p><p>Same with fundraising. When Wasp closed a $1.5m seed, Matija documented and shared their fundraising learnings in <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/11/22/fundraising-learnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a>. It ended up on the HN frontpage. (Incidentally, this post communicates something important about the founders. It takes persistence to run 250+ meetings in 98 days.)</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Wasp&#39;s fundraising learnings blog post" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/wasp-fundraising-learnings-post-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="monthly-newsletter-with-updates"></a><strong>Monthly newsletter with updates</strong><a href="#monthly-newsletter-with-updates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>To keep the momentum, Matija also writes <a href="https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=8139c7de74df98aa17054b235&amp;id=f0c6ba5f1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a monthly newsletter</a>. It’s similar to Michael’s Startup Diary in substance, but has a different style. Wasp style. (Which, again, communicates our culture.)</p><p>Like PostHog’s Story page, Wasp’s monthly updates give candidates a bird’s eye view over everything that’s happened in the past two years. To anyone interested in connecting the dots, this page is a gem.</p><div><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Wasp&#39;s monthly newsletter archives" src="https://podviaznikov.com/img/worth-joining/wasp-monthly-newsletter-min.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="so-why-should-people-join-your-startup"></a><strong>So, why should people join your startup?</strong><a href="#so-why-should-people-join-your-startup" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><em>The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</em></p><p><em>The team is great</em></p><p><em>The culture is amazing</em></p><p><em>The business is doing well</em></p><p>By communicating all these reasons well, what Canny, Fibery, PostHog, and (we hope!) Wasp really end up transmitting is two powerful messages:</p><ul><li>The company is likely to succeed</li><li>Working there will be awesome</li></ul><p>These two messages are the real answer to “why people should join your company.” The trick, however, and the reason why I wrote this post, is that you can only transmit them indirectly. You can’t say “our founders are great.” You need to provide candidates with many-many facts about the founders, which their minds will then fuse into this abstract conclusion. Ditto for expertise, team, culture, and progress. Eventually, these first-level abstractions will blend into still broader ones: “the company is likely to succeed” and “working there will be awesome.”</p><p>Thus, there’s no single, ultimate answer to “why people should join your company.” There’s only a complex system of concrete, specific units of information from which candidates make the answer themselves. In other words, you can’t teach them why your company is likely to succeed and why working here will be awesome. But you can outline the facts and let them learn for themselves. I hope this post shows how to do that outlining well, and I hope you will apply this knowledge to bring talented people onboard and build great things.</p></div></div>
