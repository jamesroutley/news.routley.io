    <h1>Gimp 2.10.32 on Apple Silicon (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>It is a bit of an early Chistmas 🎅 for people using Apple Silicon machines
(Apple M1, M2…) as we release for the first time ever a stable version of <span>GIMP</span>
for this architecture!</p>
<p>It is a revision package for <span>GIMP</span> 2.10.32, already released a <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/06/14/gimp-2-10-32-released/">few months
ago</a>, re-built with
our new <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/11/18/gimp-2-99-14-released/#macports-based-builds">MacPorts-based
infrastructure</a>
on both <code>x86_64</code> (“macOS on Intel” architecture) and <code>AArch64</code> (“macOS on Apple Silicon”).</p>
<p>Note that we provide 2 <span>DMG</span> packages now, one for each architecture, not a single
universal package. The website will try and detect which architecture you are
on, but if it fails to detect properly (detection is not as easy on some
browsers), be careful to choose the version for the correct hardware (“<em>for
Intel</em>” or “<em>for Apple Silicon</em>“).</p>
<p>Additionally in this revised package, dependencies have been updated, in
particular babl and <span>GEGL</span>. It means that even for macOS on Intel, you will get
the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/11/18/gimp-2-99-14-released/#babl-and-gegl">recent
fix</a>
to the race condition bug which was sometimes causing crashes of <span>GIMP</span> (somehow
we mostly saw it happen on macOS).</p>
<p>This is why we recommend every person on macOS (whichever your hardware) to
update <span>GIMP</span> with this revision 1 of <span>GIMP</span> 2.10.32.</p>
<p>As usual, get these updates on <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/"><span>GIMP</span>’s download page</a>!</p>
