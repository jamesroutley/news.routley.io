    <h1>Recurse Center: Setting Goals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><p><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/rc">üè∑ rc</a></p><hr/><blockquote><span>&#34;</span>A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.&#34;</blockquote><hr/><p><a href="https://recurse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a>(aka RC) is an opportunity to explore and dive deeper into topics in a safe and supportive environment. It‚Äôs a chance to try some things, to make a ton of mistakes, and to learn a ton as well. I‚Äôm looking forward to the excuse to focus on becoming a better programmer full-time. It‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a long time now. Back when I was first getting started learning about coding and figuring out how to make my first web app with Ruby and Sinatra, I stumbled upon <a href="https://jvns.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Julia Evans‚Äô blog</a> while she was attending RC(then known as Hacker School). It sounded like a dream, but I was in no position to attend financially. Fast forward 10 years later and I finally managed to save enough to take the time off from working to pursue this. It feels like the ultimate geeky vacation, except instead of a spa treatment or lounging on the beach (eww sand) I get to learn all sorts of things, meet like-minded folks, and grow in my craft. Heaven!</p><p>At RC, your learning is self-directed. There‚Äôs no curriculum to follow or course to complete. It‚Äôs radically different from learning in the traditional education sense. You‚Äôre also responsible for committing to some form of accountability mechanism. For me, that will take the form of posting more regularly on this blog throughout the 12 weeks of RC. It‚Äôll mean setting aside more time to distill learnings into posts at a regular interval, something that I hope will help me in synthesizing and processing the new information. To this end, I‚Äôll be taking notes on what I‚Äôm learning and doing each day and will try to have at least one new blog post published each week.</p><p>We‚Äôre asked to set some goals and things we want to work on at RC. These projects should exist ‚Äúat the edge of your abilities‚Äù. Originally, I had the idea to work with FPGAs and make a GameBoy emulator. After doing some more research though, I backtracked because this project was too far outside of my current ability. It‚Äôs something I can work towards, but not a great fit for RC, as I‚Äôd risk getting lost in the sea of things that needed to be learned (HDL, electronics, etc) before even making progress towards my emulator. By working at the edge of your abilities, you can incrementally grow what you‚Äôre capable of during your time. So it was back to the drawing board.</p><p>The new set of ideas for projects and topics is largely systems programming/low-level focused, either expanding upon things I found interesting during my Year of Computer Science study last year or things that I felt that I needed to go deeper on. I‚Äôm leaving some space to change course as I meet and interact with other participants at RC, but not too much. There are so many interesting things one could work on and lots of cool projects others are working on at RC. It‚Äôs hard to say no, but I have to focus on things I think will contribute the most to my growth as a developer.</p><p>For now, I‚Äôll be working on the following:</p><ul><li>systems programming</li><li>operating systems (specifically the OG UNIX OSs - BSD &amp; Plan9)</li><li>algorithms</li><li>2D game development - Royal Game of Ur (AI development and basic graphics/GUI)</li><li>Maybe learn a little bit of Go lang</li></ul></div></div>
