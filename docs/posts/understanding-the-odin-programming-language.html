<p>
    <em>Understanding the Odin Programming Language</em> teaches both basic and advanced concepts. You&#39;ll learn about procedures, <strong>manual memory management</strong>, parametric polymorphism, data-oriented design, and much more.
</p>

<p>
    A programming language is a tool. <strong>By understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson</strong>. Therefore, on top of how to write Odin code, this book also provides explanations of why things work the way they do.
</p>

<p>
    The target audience is anyone with some programming experience. Odin is a simple yet powerful language, making it a <strong>great introduction to low-level programming</strong>, regardless of your programming background.
