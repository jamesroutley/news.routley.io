The industry provides corporate and government clients with insight into conversations on private, invite-only Discord chats, WhatsApp groups, Reddit forums, and dark web message boards to help those powerful customers keep tabs on a variety of potential threats, from political hacktivists to the illegal markets that traffic in stolen passwords and intellectual property. </p><p>I spoke to representatives of ZeroFox, DarkOwl, Searchlight Cyber, Recorded Future, CyberInt, Flashpoint, and other threat intelligence firms at RSA Conference 2023, an annual convention for cyber security professionals from across the world that is held in San Francisco. </p><p>“We have personnel who already have established credentials in these environments so that we&#39;re able to go in and look for things,” said A.J. Nash, the vice president of intelligence at ZeroFox, a leader in the threat intelligence industry that is based in Baltimore, Maryland. </p><p>Nash confirmed that the company is active in Discord, an audio and video group chat app popular among young video-game players.</p><p>&#34;We can do the same thing with Discord,&#34; Nash added. &#34;It&#39;s hard to infiltrate a small group because everybody knows everybody. But some of the groups that are larger, yeah, we have the ability to get into some opportunities.&#34;</p><p><span>An executive at DarkOwl, a Denver-based threat intelligence firm that provides clients with a special database of information from its snooping, explained that the company creates fake identities and usernames to gain admission to many of the private platforms and chatrooms that it uses to collect information.  </span></p><div id="youtube2-OL-0G3gOBwU" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;OL-0G3gOBwU&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OL-0G3gOBwU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>In another CyberInt marketing video, the firm walks a potential client through the process of using a fake online alias to contact a hacker over the messaging app Telegram and “get as much information as we can.” </span></p><p><span>&#34;[O]ur social media abilities might be slightly degraded during this [sic] events as we are getting use [sic] to this new tool but we&#39;re gonna make it work,&#34; </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000930224/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000930224.pdf" rel="">the FBI official wrote</a><span>. </span></p><p>&#34;We&#39;re not violating people&#39;s civil rights or civil liberties. We&#39;re not working as a conduit to work around the Fourth Amendment,” said Nash. “We wouldn&#39;t do that.”</p><p><span>DarkOwl President Russel Cohen provided a similar assurance.</span></p><p><span>It is especially hard to assess the lawfulness of these new threat intelligence firms’ surveillance practices, because the industry is shrouded in secrecy. </span></p><p>The plan was eventually discovered and thwarted after hackers dumped emails from HBGary onto the web, embarrassing its partner firms, including Berico Technologies and Palantir.</p><p><span>U.S. intelligence agencies also have a record of coming up empty after infiltrating private, online spaces, raising the possibility that the security justifications for the current incursions are weaker than the agencies are claiming. The documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/world-of-spycraft-intelligence-agencies-spied-in-online-games" rel="">revealed</a><span> that FBI and CIA spies had created fake personas to hunt for potential terror plots discussed in online games, such as World of Warcraft and Second Life, as well as on platforms like Xbox Live. Those initiatives fizzled after the intelligence agencies found little to no evidence of terror communications.</span></p><blockquote><p>Even where ideological commitments have motivated leakers, internet culture has often played a major role. U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning’s involvement with WikiLeaks began when she started monitoring—and then actively participating in—the forum’s chat channel. Her decision to leak diplomatic cables was initially motivated by debates about Icelandic politics on the WikiLeaks channel. When one looks at Manning’s conversations with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and others on the channel, they read very much like someone trying to connect with and impress her new internet friends; later, it was a similar desire to connect online that led to her arrest. Edward Snowden, too, attributed his decision to leak documents about National Security Agency surveillance programs to his concerns that they undermined the values he cherished as an avid denizen of early internet forums and chatrooms: anonymity, self-expression, and the right to reinvent oneself.</p></blockquote><p>The conclusion that online community forums are somehow a prerequisite to radicalization suggests a sweeping view of potential government threats that encompasses almost anyone born after 1980 with access to the internet. DiResta, an influential voice in cyber security circles, is far from alone. </p><p>A variety of journalists have urged a crackdown on private messaging platforms. </p><p><span>“The FBI and other law enforcement organizations are not spending enough time trolling the edges of the web like Discord and Telegram,” veteran reporter Lucian Truscott IV </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/04/15/pentagon-leak-radicalization-of-american-youth-now-a-national-security/" rel="">declared</a><span> in Salon, a progressive news outlet. </span></p><p><span>A news article in Time took the validity of national-security officials’ concerns about Discord as a given. “The leak has also put a spotlight on the lack of law-enforcement visibility into platforms like Discord,” </span><a href="https://time.com/6271787/jack-teixeira-arrest-leaks/" rel="">wrote</a><span> Vera Bergengruen and W.J. Hennigan. </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
