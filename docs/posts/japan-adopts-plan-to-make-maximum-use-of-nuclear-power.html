<p>TOKYO (Jiji Press) — The Japanese government Friday adopted a plan to make maximum use of nuclear power, in a bid to realize a carbon-free society while ensuring stable electricity supplies.</p>
<p>The basic plan for green transformation marks a departure from Japan’s policy of reducing its dependence on nuclear energy decided after the 2011 meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.’s tsunami-hit Fukushima No. 1 power plant.</p>
<p>The plan also includes a target of achieving over ¥150 trillion in public and private investments for decarbonization over the coming 10 years.</p>
<p>To the end, the government adopted green transformation legislation so that it can procure funds for its share of the envisioned investments, which is projected at some ¥20 trillion.</p>
<p>Specifically, the government will issue green transformation transition bonds, which will be redeemed with funds procured through an envisioned carbon-pricing system collecting fees from companies for carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>The basic plan calls for building next-generation nuclear reactors to replace decommissioned ones within the premises of the nuclear plants, ending a freeze on any projects to add, expand or replace reactors.</p>
<p>Japan will also change the rule that limits the operating life of reactors basically to 40 years but tolerates an extension to up to 60 years upon regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Japan will allow power companies to operate reactors beyond the 60-year limit by excluding periods when reactors are halted for safety inspections or other reasons.</p>
<p>The government plans to collect fees from fossil fuel importers set in accordance with the amounts of CO2 emissions resulting from the fuel use, starting in fiscal 2028.</p>
<p>From fiscal 2033, power companies will be required to buy emission credits through emission trading.</p>
