<p>Around 50 years ago, in October 1971, Ray Tomlinson, a graduate of MIT, sent the first email email over a network.. Last year, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ~121 trillion emails were sent</a> between <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ~4.3 billion people</a>. Email is the the most important written form of communication on this planet and will remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On October 3, 2023, <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo</a> announced upcoming email security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dmarc-configure?view=o365-worldwide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Outlook.com</a> (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies.</p>

<p>With the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs will begin tightening the reigns. <b><mark>Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024</mark></b>.</p>

<p><i> </i>
<b>UPDATE:</b> This policy is now in effect with senders already reporting delivery problems.
</p>

<p>In this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance.</p>

<p>The biggest change involves implementing email authentication standards like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These standards have been around for a while, but are only now being strictly enforced by major email service providers. Like SSL (HTTPS) for the web and MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) to protect your online accounts, organizations will be expected to conform to these guidelines.</p>

<p>This is what non-compliance (for Gmail) looks like in an email server log:</p>

<pre><code>host gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com [108.177.15.26]
SMTP error from remote mail server after pipelined end of data:
550-5.7.26 This mail is unauthenticated, which poses a security risk to the
550-5.7.26 sender and Gmail users, and has been blocked. The sender must
550-5.7.26 authenticate with at least one of SPF or DKIM. For this message,
550-5.7.26 DKIM checks did not pass and SPF check for [MYDOMAIJN.com] did not
550-5.7.26 pass with ip: [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]. The sender should visit
550-5.7.26  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126#authentication for
550 5.7.26 instructions on setting up authentication
</code></pre>

<p><code>
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/3726730#5726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550, &#34;5.7.26&#34;</a><a>, &#34;This message does not have authentication information or fails to pass authentication checks (SPF or DKIM). To best protect our users from spam, the message has been blocked. Please visit Prevent mail to Gmail users from being blocked or sent to spam for more information.&#34;
</a></code></p><p><a>Here’s the complete listing of </a><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/3726730" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gmail SMTP errors codes</a>.</p>

<p>This is quickly becoming a mandatory standard for senders, so every business will need to become familiar with them – or risk email deliverability to customers.</p>

<h2>Who’s Affected?</h2>

<p>Enforcement primarily pertains to <b>Bulk Senders</b>:</p>

<div><blockquote><p>“A <b>bulk sender</b> is any email sender that sends close to 5,000 messages or more to personal Gmail accounts within a 24-hour period. Messages sent from the same primary domain count toward the 5,000 limit.”</p></blockquote></div>
