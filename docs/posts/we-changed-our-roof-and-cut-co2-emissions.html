    <p> Factory </p>

    <p>
      In 2018, my wife and I bought an old shoe factory in Paris.
      We entirely demolished and revamped the space.
    </p>
    <p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/before_after.jpg"/> 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were conscious of the importance of energy insulation. We used
      hemp-based insulation for walls and a double-glass window
      for the facade.
      One thing we did not replace was the roof. We loved the industrial-style
      &#34;verrière&#34; and it was an expensive thing to do back then.
    </p>
    <p> Roof </p>
    <p>
      But soon after, we realized it was a bad decision. Insulating the entire flat except the roof
      led to severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge">thermal bridging</a>.
      During winter, as exterior temperature fell, the glass roof was exposed to cold air from the outside and
      hot air from the inside leading to condensation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In July 2021 we finally were able to replace our old single-glass roof. After one year looking for a capable
      artisan, we installed a double
      glass ceiling roof with thermal break steel from <a href="https://www.jansen.com/fr/building-systems-systems-de-profiles-acier/produits.html#/">Jansen</a>. The
      difference in confort was mind boggling. It was like moving in a new flat.</p>

    </p>

    <p> Data </p>

    <p>
      A question I asked myself was: how much energy and CO2 are we saving?
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2019, I acquired a <a href="https://www.netatmo.com/fr-fr/energy/thermostat">Netatmo thermostat</a>
      that controls the heating system. The device collects temperature, boiler activity on a 30min step.
      It has an <a href="https://dev.netatmo.com/apidocumentation/energy">API</a> we can query. See code
      source in <a href="https://github.com/martindaniel4/home_data">Python here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2020, I also got installed <a href="https://www.grdf.fr/particuliers/fonctionnement-compteur-gaz-communicant-grdf">Gazpar</a>, the smart
      gas meter from GRDF (French gas operator). While far from perfect (the data portal is <a href="https://twitter.com/martindaniel4/status/1482308908106625025">often</a> down) it allows me to get
      an accurate daily measure of my energy consumption.
    </p>
    <div><p>
      Below is a line graph plotting <span>internal temperature</span>, <span>exterior
        temperature</span> (°C)
      and <span>energy</span> in Kwh
      between October 2020 and April 2021. Few notes:
      </p><ul>
        <li>It&#39;s pretty chilly in our flat! Average interior temperature is 17.2 °C.</li>
        <li>The colder outside the more energy we consume (duh).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/temp_energy.svg"/>
    </p>

    <p> Modeling </p>
    <p>
      In order to measure how much energy we are saving, we need a model. We could for instance compare
      our energy usage with the previous year. But since exterior temperature varies, we be away for the house,
      comparing with the previous year is imprecise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good model would be like a &#34;twin&#34; flat. It would show how much energy we would have consumed if we had kept the
      old roof.
    </p>
    <p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/model.svg"/>
    </p>
    <div><p>
      To do so I run a good ol&#39; <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/linreg.htm">linear regression</a>
      with the following inputs:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Internal temperature (°C)</li>
        <li>Exterior temperature (°C)</li>
        <li>Whether or not the flat is occupied (boolean)</li>
      </ul><p>
      The model is trained from October 2020 to February 2021 and has a nice fit! We are able to capture 90% of the
      daily energy variance. The graph below displays the <span>model&#39;s predictions
        (dotted
        line)</span> and the <span>true energy consumed (solid line)</span>. Notice that
      the model &#34;holds well&#34; after the training period.
      </p><p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/training_model.svg"/>
      </p>

      <div><p>
        We can also look at the coefficients returned by our model in the table below.
        </p><table>
          <tbody><tr>
            <td></td>
            <th>coef</th>

            <td> 0.611</td>
            <td> -41.528</td>
            <td> 24.502</td>
          </tr>

            <td> 8.3755</td>
            <td> 1.179</td>
            <td> 7.105</td>
            <td> 0.000</td>
            <td> 6.044</td>
            <td> 10.707</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>temperature_ext</th>
            <td> -10.0999</td>
            <td> 0.366</td>
            <td> -27.614</td>
            <td> 0.000</td>
            <td> -10.823</td>
            <td> -9.376</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
      </div>
      <div><p>
        The interior and exterior temperature coefficients make sense and can be interpreted as follow:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Increasing internal temperature by 1°C correlates with a 8Kwh
            increase in energy heat. </li>
          <li>Similarly, when external temperature drop by 1°C, we need 10Kwh of energy to heat the home.</li>
        </ul><p>
        If you need some order of magnitude: 10Kwh of energy is equivalent to roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4O5voOCqAQ">10 cyclists</a> pedaling non stop during 10 hours.
      </p></div>

      <p> Savings </p>

      <p>
        So how much are we saving? The graph below displays our forecast and actuals after the new roof was installed.
        See the difference between the two lines? That&#39;s how much we are saving.
      </p>
      <p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/savings.svg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to represent is whether we are <span>above</span> or <span>below</span> the forecast on a given day (thank
        you <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/whats-different-timeseries-forecast-performance?collection=@observablehq/analyzing-time-series-data">Observable</a>
        team for the inspiration). On average we are saving 20kwh of daily heating energy or a 35% reduction in energy
        usage.
      </p>
      <p><img src="http://www.martindaniel.co/roof/img/savings_2.svg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Oct 01, 2021 we have saved 2,300 kwh, equivalent to 720 kg CO2e (assuming a <a href="https://www.carbonindependent.org/15.html">0.3g of CO2e per Kwh</a> of heating gas). At current
        trend, we would save 5,200 kwh, equivalent to 1,600 kg CO2e until Apr 15, 2022. To put that number in
        perspective, a French emits about 9,000 kg of CO2e per year. Not bad for a roof.

        I had a lot of fun running that analysis and I am inspired by the impact. Energy used in buildings makes about
        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector">18% of Global Grenhouse Gas emissions</a>.
