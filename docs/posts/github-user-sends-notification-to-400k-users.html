          <div><p>There are so many great opportunities to spot wildlife in a wide variety of habitats at London Wildlife Trust reserves. From secluded woodland to sparkling wetlands to sprawling meadows, there’s something for everyone to explore. You might be surprised by what you find on your doorstep, including:</p></div>

          <div><p>A unique mix of new and ancient woodland in Dulwich, Sydenham Hill Wood is a well-loved reserve home to more than 200 species of trees and plants. It is part of the ancient Great North Wood which used to cover much of South London and now remains in fragments of small woodlands. It is home to rare fungi, insects, birds and woodland mammals as well as a Victorian folly that resembles ancient ruins. The wood is full of the sounds of nature, and keen ears can hear owls and kestrels as well as the resonant drums of woodpeckers. In spring, bluebells, violets and wood anemones brighten the woodland floor.</p></div>

          <div><p>A working reservoir in Hackney that was closed to the public for almost 200 years, Woodberry Wetlands is a thriving urban wetland that is a birder’s paradise. Woodberry supports many species, from wintering populations of pochard, shoveler, tufted and gadwall ducks, to reed warbler and bunting who have migrated from Africa for spring and summer. You can also see birds of prey including red kites, peregrine falcons and sparrowhawks; a variety of moths, butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies; newts, frogs and toads; and several species of bat. While you’re there, enjoy the popular Coal House Café!</p></div>

          <div><p>One of the finest examples of rare wet grazing meadows in London, Frays Farm Meadows is home to a rich variety of species, with the banks of the river Fray providing an important home to the ever-elusive and highly threatened water vole. Top spots include snipe, lapwings, banded demoiselles and vibrant flowers like purple-loosestrife and marsh-marigold, as well as our friendly team of conservation grazing cattle.</p></div>
