    <h1>Is Apple making implausible iPhone satisfaction claims?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="heading--a-99percent-approval-rating-is-nearly-s"><b><i>A 99% approval rating is nearly s</i></b><i>tatistically</i><i><b> impossible. Apple says it gets one every year. </b></i></h2><p><b>Key Points: </b></p><ul><li><p>In its May earnings call, Apple claimed that the iPhone 14 had a 99% customer satisfaction rating citing a third party research firm it hired.  </p></li><li><p>Apple has made a similar claim in every single earnings call for the past seven years. </p></li><li><p>A customer satisfaction rating this high is nearly impossible to find using traditional survey methods and a representative sample. </p></li><li><p>Independent sources find iPhone satisfaction ratings significantly lower than what Apple claims. </p></li><li><p>Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction is far higher than what other consumer companies and brands claim for beloved products. </p></li><li><p>We asked Apple’s press team to explain how the company arrived at these results. They opened our email 73 times, but didn’t respond. </p></li><li><p>Our best guess is that Apple wants to make bold customer satisfaction claims, and has hired a third-party research firm that will produce those numbers to make them seem more credible – and perhaps to provide plausible deniability.</p></li><li><p>That firm is likely using a highly unrepresentative sample of tech enthusiasts and early adopters to generate extraordinary satisfaction numbers that Apple then presents as representative of consumers generally. </p></li></ul><p>Toward the end of its earnings call in May, Apple made an extraordinary claim: “The latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said. </p><p>The problem is a 99% satisfaction rate is so high, there’s almost no way to get it using standard survey methods and a representative sample. </p><p>“Even if every single person actually loved their iPhone it would still be nearly impossible to find near unanimous satisfaction using traditional survey methods,” said economist and PerfectRec founder Joe Golden. “A few percent of people just won’t understand the question, or will give the wrong response by mistake,” Golden said. </p><p>If Apple’s claims of 99% satisfaction were true, it would mean the iPhone 14 was not only the most popular mass market consumer product of all time, but it would also probably make it the most popular <i>anything of all time. </i>To get a sense of just how extraordinary Apple’s iPhone 14 claims were, we looked at some other satisfaction numbers and approval ratings for context. </p><p>America’s favorite holiday, Thanksgiving, enjoys 82% popularity according to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1277607/most-popular-holidays-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Thanksgiving%2C%20Memorial%20day%2C%20and%20Veterans,Veterans%20day%20with%2077%20percent."><u>2023 survey by Statista</u></a>. Memorial Day comes in second at 77%. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"><u>three most popular movies</u></a> of all time on IMDB are <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>The Dark Knight</i>. They have ratings of 9.2, 9.2 and 9.0 respectively. </p><p>If we look at some of the most popular retailers in America, we find satisfaction ratings maxing out in the 80s. Trader Joe’s fans will stand in line for hours for groceries but still give the store just an 84% <a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/supermarkets/"><u>satisfaction rating</u></a>, according to a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Institute. 82% of Costco customers say they are <a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/general-merchandise-retailers/"><u>satisfied with the retailer</u></a>, and they pay $60-120 a year for the privilege of shopping there.</p><p>What about politics where tribal loyalties tend to trump facts? <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203006/obama-job-approval-ratings-politically-polarized-far.aspx"><u>According to Gallup</u></a>, President Barack Obama enjoyed an average approval rating across his two terms of just 83% <i>among Democrats</i>. Donald Trump performed a bit better among Republicans while in the White House, averaging an <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx"><u>86% approval rating</u></a> from members of his own party. Even Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Asad only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Syrian_presidential_election"><u>managed 95% support</u></a> in the last election, and that was condemned by the United Nations for being undemocratic. </p><p>In fact, the only other poll we could find claiming 99% support for <i>anything</i> was a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/is-america-still-sweet-on-ice-cream-national-survey-reveals-our-relationship-may-be-cooling-off-300488561.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20findings%3A%20While%2099,due%20to%20%22health%22%20concerns."><u>press release</u></a>  that said 99% of Americans enjoy ice cream. It was authored by a frozen dessert company. I’d note they didn’t bother sharing methodology for such an implausible claim. </p><p>So what is going on with Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction rates? We reached out to Apple to find out, but didn’t get any response. When we kept digging, this is what we found. </p><h2 id="heading--third-party-sources-find-much-lower-satisfaction-rates-for-the-iphone">Third-party sources find much lower satisfaction rates for the iPhone</h2><p>Independent sources do not match Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates. </p><p>The American Consumer Satisfaction Institute regularly surveys consumers about cell phones and wireless carriers. Their <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/16/iphone-beats-samsung-in-satisfaction-survey/"><u>latest survey</u></a> found iPhone satisfaction at 81% for 5G models and 78% for other models. That was the highest combined satisfaction rate of any smartphone manufacturer, but still a far cry from the company’s own findings through 451 Research.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6fetvjj0zxvn/35oovuXDQwc5z2k5OE3DZh/dee474b1b912e34dedb3c640b2828bf0/satisfaction-survey.png?fit=fill&amp;w=768" height="639" width="768" alt=""/></p><p>User reviews on Google tell a similar story. People love the iPhone, but not as much as Apple claims. </p><p>While Apple has not published their methodology, a <a href="https://451research.com/images/Marketing/press_releases/iPhone-PR-1_31_2018-f.pdf?&amp;utm_campaign=2018_vocul_apple_pr&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=press_release&amp;utm_term=apple_iphone_pr"><u>2018 press release</u></a> about the survey from its creator, 451 Research shows at least two categories of support: “Very Satisfied” and “Somewhat Satisfied.” If Apple and 451 Research are using a traditional five-point satisfaction scale ranging from “Not At All Satisfied” to “Very Satisfied,” those responses would correspond to four and five stars respectively.  If we map that to ratings for the iPhone on Google Reviews, which uses a five-star scale, we find that  between 87% to 90% of users are rating the iPhone 4+ stars, depending on the model. Those are great reviews, but they are not a 99% satisfaction rate. </p><p>Even if you took the most favorable approach to Apple and said anything that’s not a one-star review counts as satisfied, you would still fall short of Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates. Six percent of users rate the various iPhone 14 models 1 star on Google as of July 6, 2023. That extremely generous scale would translate into a satisfaction rate of 94%, still not the 99% Apple is claiming. </p><h2 id="heading--when-other-consumer-companies-brag-about-satisfaction-they-cite-much-lower-numbers">When other consumer companies brag about satisfaction, they cite much lower numbers </h2><p>An analysis of dozens of earnings call transcripts show that executives are usually extremely cautious about satisfaction claims. </p><p>Companies love talking about how happy their customers are, but in the context of heavily scrutinized public earnings calls, they tend to keep their remarks extremely vague. When the word “satisfaction” is used at all, it’s usually part of broad statements like Disney CEO Bob Iger pledging to “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576588-walt-disney-company-dis-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript"><u>increase park capacity while preserving guest satisfaction</u></a>.” </p><p>We combed through the last four quarters of earnings transcripts from consumer favorites like Costco, Disney and McDonald’s as well as popular electronics companies like Samsung and Sony, for claims about customer satisfaction. The only quantitative claim we found was Sony touting that the PlayStation Plus subscription service enjoyed 72% customer satisfaction in a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2022/GNS_E.pdf"><u>2022 investor presentation</u></a>.</p><p>Even outside of investor calls, it’s unusual for consumer-facing companies to make concrete claims about customer satisfaction. One example of the few examples we found was the appliance company Dyson, which thought an 84% customer satisfaction rating for one of its vacuum cleaners was impressive enough to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/search/news/?keyword=customer%20satisfaction&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=100"><u>merit a press release</u></a>.  </p><p>Apple, by contrast, has claimed 98%-or-above approval in every investor call for the last half decade. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550156-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2022</u></a> - “And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463261-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2021</u></a> - “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4382943-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2020</u></a> - “In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4300690-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2019</u></a> - “And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2018</u></a> - “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li></ul><p>You can see the full list of Apple’s earnings call satisfaction claims in the appendix. The trend goes back to at least 2011.Other research firms were hired to produce the satisfaction claims prior to 2016, finding similar results.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple cites third-party research firms they have hired in every single quantitative mention of customer satisfaction they make on earnings calls going back to at least 2013. Why do this? Apple is the largest company in the world and almost certainly has extremely precise in-house measures of customer satisfaction. The answer likely has to do with credibility and deniability. An extraordinary claim sounds more credible if it’s coming from an independent party, even if you pay to produce it. Furthermore, if investors or others start asking questions about something as eyebrow raising as near-universal satisfaction, it’s easier to deflect than if Apple had produced the statistic in house. </p><h2 id="heading--we-contacted-apple-and-451-research-to-try-and-figure-out-what-was-going-on-with-the-satisfaction-numbers-they-didnt-respond">We contacted Apple and 451 Research to try and figure out what was going on with the satisfaction numbers.

By not mentioning that the survey participants are highly non-representative, Apple’s claims about the survey’s results are misleading, and out of step with basic best practices when reporting survey results. Apple gives the impression that this survey is representative of the population by not indicating otherwise. </p><h2 id="heading--our-take">Our Take </h2><p>The iPhone is an extraordinary phone. We recommend it to consumers using PerfectRec every day. But we’re 99% confident something doesn’t quite add up about Apple’s customer satisfaction claims.* </p><p><b>Consider: </b></p><ul><li><p>Independent sources report iPhone satisfaction levels that are significantly lower than what Apple claims. </p></li><li><p>The iPhone 14 did not get a great critical reception when it launched late last year, and earlier research by PerfectRec found user reviews for the model were <a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/the-iphone-14-is-apples-biggest-disappointment"><u>significantly worse</u></a> than previous editions of the handset. </p></li><li><p>Other companies with beloved consumer products tout much lower satisfaction rates when they talk about satisfaction at all.</p></li><li><p>It would be extraordinarily hard to find near-universal satisfaction using normal survey research methods and a representative sample. </p></li></ul><p>It is likely that Apple continues to work with 451 Research not despite its unusual results but because of them. Apple wants to make extraordinary customer satisfaction claims and has found an outside research firm to produce them. 451 Research polls an unrepresentative panel of tech professionals, early adopters and gadget enthusiasts about their iPhone satisfaction, which Apple presents as reflecting the opinions of iPhone users as a whole. It doesn’t. The iPhone is perhaps the most successful consumer product in the world. Its market long ago grew beyond early adopters and gadget enthusiasts. </p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple almost certainly has highly accurate internal measures of customer satisfaction. But instead of sharing those, the company instead highlights and likely misrepresent the findings of a third-party research firm they hired. </p><p>“We’re not calling on the SEC to investigate these customer satisfaction claims, since they have more important cases to go after,” Golden said.  “But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and we believe Apple should review the survey results they trumpet on every earnings call. If they truly think they are valid, they should publish their methodology, and if not, they should issue retractions.” </p><p>*<i>In this case, it’s a figure of speech. </i></p><h2 id="heading--about">About:</h2><h3 id="heading--joe-golden">Joe Golden </h3><p>Dr. Joe Golden is founder and CEO of PerfectRec.
