<h2> Introduction to CHART</h2>
<p> Welcome to the CHART project! CHART stands for Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope.
  Our goal with this project is to create an easy to navigate system of tutorials
  that will lead to you in building your own radio telescope from the comfort of your home or classroom.
  It is very important to us that that radio astronomy is as accessible as possible to whoever is interested,
  so we strove to keep the creation of this project as cheap as possible. We are excited that you have found
  our project and wish you the best of luck in the creation of your radio telescope.
  The following video gives you a brief overview of the creation of the project.

<h2>Build Your Own Radio Telescope</h2>
<p> Let&#39;s get started! We have desiged a series of tutorials that will guide you step-by-step
  in creating your own radio telescope. When it comes to navigating this project,
  we recommend that users start in the Telescope Design section, so that you will have a telescope to take data with,
  then move onto the software section of the course to record the data you will be taking.
