            <p><span>I</span>n June 1825 Samuel Pepys’ diary was published for the first time. It was an instant hit. Newspapers were soon full of reviews quoting memorable passages from this secret journal: Pepys’ descriptions of the Great Fire of London, his new wig, and his first ever ‘Cupp of Tee’ were among the favourites. Further editions followed, and by the end of the 19th century the diary was celebrated as a classic of British history and literature. Today, Pepys is the star of museum exhibits and historical novels. Excerpts from his diary are often used to introduce students to the Restoration period and, indeed, to introduce history: across England, six-year-olds following the National Curriculum can tell you about how Pepys buried his expensive cheese to protect it from the fire.</p>
