		<p>In the morning before I went forth <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1291/">old East</a> brought me a dozen of bottles of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">sack</a>, and I gave him a shilling for his pains.</p>

<p>Then I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/118/">Mr. Sheply</a> who was drawing of sack in the wine cellar to send to other places as a gift from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord</a>,<sup id="fnr1-1660-01-02"><a href="#fn1-1660-01-02">1</a></sup> and told me that my Lord had given him order to give me the dozen of bottles.</p>

<p>Thence I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a> to speak with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1860/">Mr. Calthropp</a> about the 60<i>l.</i> due to my Lord, but missed of him, he being abroad. Then I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/105/">Mr. Crew’s</a> and borrowed 10<i>l.</i> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1861/">Mr. Andrewes</a> for my own use, and so went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">my office</a>, where there was nothing to do. Then I walked a great while in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, where I heard that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/109/">Lambert</a> was coming up to London; that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/107/">Lord Fairfax</a> was in the head of the Irish brigade, but it was not certain what he would declare for. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">The House</a> was to-day upon finishing the act for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/295/">Council of State</a>, which they did; and for the indemnity to the soldiers; and were to sit again thereupon in the afternoon. Great talk that many places have declared for a free <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>; and it is believed that they will be forced to fill up the House with the old members. From the Hall I called at home, and so went to Mr. Crew’s (<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> she was to go to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/">her father’s</a>), thinking to have dined, but I came too late, so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore</a> and I and another gentleman went out and drank a cup of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/450/">ale</a> together in the new market, and there I eat some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/394/">bread</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/">cheese</a> for my dinner. After that Mr. Moore and I went as far as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleet-street</a> together and parted, he going into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, I to find Mr. Calthrop, but failed again of finding him, so returned to Mr. Crew’s again, and from thence went along with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Mrs. Jemimah</a> home, and there she taught me how to play at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/">cribbage</a>. Then I went <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/102/">home</a>, and finding my wife gone to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/240/">Mrs. Hunt</a>, I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/209/">Will’s</a>, and there sat with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1491/">Mr. Ashwell</a> talking and singing till nine o’clock, and so home, there, having not eaten anything but bread and cheese, my wife cut me a slice of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1862/">brawn</a> which I received from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">my Lady</a>; which proves as good as ever I had any. So to bed, and my wife had a very bad night of it through wind and cold.</p>

		<p>Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain, but upon taking of cold.<sup id="fnr1-1660-01-01"><a href="#fn1-1660-01-01">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I lived in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6919/">Axe Yard</a> having <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and servant <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a>, and no more in family than us three.</p>
<p>My wife … [, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, – L&amp;M] gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year … [the hope was belied.]<sup id="fnr2-1660-01-01"><a href="#fn2-1660-01-01">2</a></sup> [she hath them again. – L&amp;M] The condition of the State was thus; viz. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/34/">the Rump</a>, after being disturbed by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/109/">Lord Lambert</a>, was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the Army all forced to yield.  <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Lawson</a> lies still in the river, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Monk</a> is with his army in Scotland.  Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come into the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>, nor is it expected that he will without being forced to it.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/33/">Common Council</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> do speak very high; and had sent to Monk their sword-bearer, to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament, which is at present the desires, and the hopes, and expectation of all.  Twenty-two of the old secluded members<sup id="fnr3-1660-01-01"><a href="#fn3-1660-01-01">3</a></sup> having been at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>-door the last week to demand entrance, but it was denied them; and it is believed that [neither] they nor the people will be satisfied till the House be filled.</p>

<p>My own private condition very handsome, and esteemed rich, but indeed very poor; besides my goods of my house, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">my office</a>, which at present is somewhat uncertain.  <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/106/">Mr. Downing</a> master of my office.</p>

<p>(Lord’s Day) This morning (we living lately in the garret) I rose, put on my suit with great skirts, having not lately worn any other, clothes but them.</p>

<p>Went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/108/">Mr. Gunning’s</a> chapel at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/103/">Exeter House</a>, where he made a very good sermon upon these words: — “That in the fulness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman,” &amp;c.; showing, that, by “made under the law,” is meant his circumcision, which is solemnized this day.</p>

<p>Dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/102/">home</a> in the garret, where my wife dressed the remains of a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/378/">turkey</a>, and in the doing of it she burned her hand.</p>

<p>I staid at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts.</p>

<p>Then went with my wife to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father’s</a>, and in going observed the great posts which the City have set up at the <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14073/">Conduit</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleet-street</a>.</p>

<p>Supt at my, father’s, where in came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/120/">Mrs. The. Turner</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2408/">Madam Morrice</a>, and supt with us.  After that my wife and I went home with them, and so to our own home.</p>
