</div><div><p><a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">We</a> recently had a big downtime
at work where part of the work was me doing a relatively complex
and touchy thing. Naturally <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/UseAChecklist">I made a checklist</a>,
but also naturally my checklist turned out to be incomplete, with
some things I&#39;d forgotten and some steps that weren&#39;t quite right
or complete. This is a good illustration that checklists are hard
to create.</p>

<p>Checklists are hard partly because they require us to try to remember,
reconstruct, and understand everything in what&#39;s often a relatively
complex system that is too big for us to hold in our mind. If your
understanding is incomplete you can overlook something and so leave
out a step or a part of a step, and even if you write down a step
you may not fully remember (and record) why the step has to be
there. My view is that this is especially likely in system
administration where we may have any number of things that have
been quietly sitting in the corner for some time, working away
without problems, and so they&#39;ve slipped out of our minds.</p>

<p>(For example, one of the issues that we ran into in this downtime
was not remembering all of the hosts that ran crontab jobs that
used one particular filesystem. Of course we thought we did know,
so we didn&#39;t try to systematically look for such crontab jobs.)</p>

<p>To get a really solid checklist you have to be able to test it,
much like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/DocumentationNeedsTesting">all documentation needs testing</a>.
Unfortunately, a lot of the checklists I write (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/AlwaysMakeAChecklist">or don&#39;t write</a>) are for one-off things that we can&#39;t really
test in advance for various reasons, for example because they involve
a large scale change to our live systems (that requires a downtime).
If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll realize that you don&#39;t know something or
aren&#39;t confident in something while writing the checklist, so you
can investigate it and hopefully get it right, but some of the time
you&#39;ll be confident you understand the problem but you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Despite any imperfections, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/UseAChecklist">checklists are still a good thing</a>. An imperfect written down checklist is better than
relying on your memory and mind on the fly almost all of the time
(the rare exceptions are when you wouldn&#39;t even dare do the operation
without a checklist but an imperfect checklist tempts you into doing
it and fumbling).</p>

<p>(You can try to improve the situation by keeping notes on what was
missed in the checklist and then saving or publishing these notes
somewhere. You can review these after the fact notes on what was
missed in this specific checklist if you have to do the thing again,
or look for specific types of things you tend to overlook and should
specifically check for the next time you&#39;re making a checklist that
touches on some area.)</p>
