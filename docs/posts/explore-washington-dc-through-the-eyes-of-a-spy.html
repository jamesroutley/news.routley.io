        <h3>A different way to explore DC</h3>
        <p>A scavenger hunt is <b>more like a game</b> than a guided tour. You follow clues to find locations, solve puzzles, and complete challenges. Keep your eyes open and spot the <b>details</b>. It&#39;s a great way to see the city and have fun with friends and family.</p>

        <p><b>Secret Missions</b> are designed to be <b>accessible</b> to everyone. You don&#39;t need to be a local or have any special skills. You don&#39;t need to be fit or strong. You don&#39;t need to be a genius. You don&#39;t even need to be a spy. You just need to be able to walk around and have fun.</p>

        <p><b>Secret Missions</b> are <b>family friendly</b>. We don&#39;t use any scary or inappropriate content.</p>

        <p>You&#39;ll interact with your <b>controller</b> at <b>HQ</b> through a secure messaging service (no app download needed). Your controller will tell you what intelligence is required and guide you to the right locations to gather it!</p>
    </div>

<div>
    <div>
        <h3>Take your time, progress at your own pace</h3>

        <p>You can <b>start and stop whenever you like</b>, there&#39;s no fixed start time. You can take as long as you like to complete the mission. You can even take a break and come back later if you find another adventure along the way.</p>

        <p><b>Larger groups</b> can split up and compete to finish fastest and with fewest hints, or work together to complete the mission as a team.</p>

        <p>Play on your own terms! It&#39;s just you and your friends, <b>like a private tour</b>.</p>

        <h3>Start playing right away</h3>

        <p>You play the game using your phone. There&#39;s <b>nothing to download or install</b> and <b>nothing to print</b> or collect.</p>

        <h3>What if the weather is bad?</h3>

        <p>If it&#39;s <b>occasional, patchy rain</b>, you can still play - drop into a cafe or bar to stay dry, there is no hurry.</p>

        <p>If it&#39;s <b>heavy rain</b>, you can switch your booking to another day - or split the scavenger hunt over two days.</p>

        <p>If it&#39;s <b>torrential rain</b> and you can&#39;t reschedule, we will refund you.</p>

        <h3>You can rearrange or cancel</h3>

        <p>You&#39;ll see the sights of the area, but the real fun is solving the clues and spotting interesting details that non-spies would miss!</p>

        <h3>Will I enjoy Secret Mission DC if I&#39;m from Washington DC?</h3>

        <p>Yes! You&#39;ll already know some of the city, but we promise you&#39;ll see things you&#39;ve <b>never noticed before</b>!</p>

        <p>We&#39;ve worked hard to find <b>hidden gems</b> that you might not have heard of, and we&#39;ve included <b>local knowledge</b> that even residents might not know.</p>

        <h3>Will it be too physical?</h3>

        <p>There&#39;s no running or strenuous exercise required. The route is approximately 4 miles long but you can take as long as you need and there are plenty of bars, cafes and public parks to take breaks in along the route.</p>
