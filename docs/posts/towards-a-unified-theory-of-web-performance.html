    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2021/a-unified-theory-of-web-performance/">This post first ran</a> as part of <a href="https://www.sergeychernyshev.com/">Sergey Chernyshev</a> and <a href="https://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a>&#39;s indispensible <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2021/">annual series</a>. It&#39;s being reposted here for completeness, but if you care about web performance, make sure to check out the whole series and get <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/feed/">subscribed to the RSS feed</a> to avoid missing any of next year&#39;s posts.</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2021/request-for-a-general-theory-of-web-performance/">recent Perf Planet Advent Calendar post</a>, <a href="https://tannerhodges.com/">Tanner Hodges</a> asked many folks who work in the space what they would like for the holidays. The predominant answer: a unified theory of web performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I propose four key ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> What is &#34;performance&#34; beyond page speed? What, in particular, is &#34;web performance&#34;?</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is web performance trying to accomplish as a discipline? What are its goals?</li>
<li><strong>Principles:</strong> What fundamental truths are guiding the discipline and moving it forward?</li>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> What does it look like to work on web performance? How do we do it?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a tall order!</p>
<p>The hope is for a baseline theory, doctrine, and practicum. Hopefully the community can organise the latter once we roughly agree on a socio-technical view of what web performance <em>is</em> and what it&#39;s <em>for</em>. To make a general theory practical, leaders in the community will need to translate and connect principles to outcomes.</p>

<p>Embedded in the term &#34;web performance&#34; is <em>the web</em>, and the web is for humans.</p>
<p>That assertion might start an argument in the wrong crowd, but 30+ years into our journey, attempts promote a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/introduction.html">different first-order constituency</a> are considered failures. This makes economic sense, as the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/2021/07/the-core-web-loop/">Core Platform Loop</a> predicts. The web ecosystem grows or contracts with its ability to reach people and meet their needs safely and with low friction.</p>
<p>Taking <em>&#34;this is for everyone&#34;</em> seriously, aspirational goals for web performance emerge. To the marginal user, performance is the difference between access and exclusion.</p>
<p><em>The mission of web performance is to expand access to information and services.</em></p>
<h2 id="page-load-isn&#39;t-special">Page Load Isn&#39;t Special <a href="#page-load-isn&#39;t-special">#</a></h2>
<p>It may seem that web performance comprises two disciplines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimising page load</li>
<li>Optimising post-load interactions</li>
</ol>
<p>The tools used by performance practitioners in each discipline overlap to some degree but generally feel like separate concerns. The metrics that we report against implicitly cleave these into different &#34;camps&#34;, leaving us thinking about pre- and post-load as distinct universes.</p>
<p>But what if they aren&#39;t?</p>
<p>Consider the humble webmail client.</p>
<p>Here are two renderings of the same Gmail inbox in different architectural styles: one based on Ajax, and the other on <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/15049?hl=en">&#34;basic&#34; HTML</a>:</p>
