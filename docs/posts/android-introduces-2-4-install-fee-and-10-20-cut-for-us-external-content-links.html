  <p>Developers currently using links to app downloads or transactions need to enroll in this program and meet these requirements by January 28, 2026.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p><a id="in_the_future" name="in_the_future"></a>In the future, Google intends to apply a service fee on successful transactions and downloads completed via external content links. At this time, however, Google is not assessing these fees and is therefore not requiring developers in this program to report these transactions or downloads to Google.</p>
</div>

<p>The external content links program allows developers of Google Play-distributed apps to link users in the United States to external content, including to purchase in-app digital items or to download an app whose install and updates are not managed by Google Play. Additionally, developers can offer external links to purchase in-app digital items in lieu of or alongside Google Play Billing.</p>

<p>Developers must meet the eligibility and requirements set out below, and successfully complete their enrollment in this program prior to using external content links.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>This program is available in the US in connection with the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/15582165" rel="noopener">US District Court&#39;s order</a>. Google reserves the right to modify or terminate this program, including as a result of any changes to or termination of the US District Court&#39;s order.</p>

<h2><a id="ecl_requirements" name="ecl_requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>Developers participating in this program must comply with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enroll and get approval for your app(s) and any linked external apps in the external content links program as explained below.</li>
  <li>Limit external content links to users in the US and its territories.</li>
  <li>Ensure all Play Apps enrolled in this program and any linked external apps comply with <a href="https://play.google/developer-content-policy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Play Developer Policies</a>, with the exception of policies that are not applicable to linked apps, such as the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738" rel="noopener">Payments policy</a>.</li>
  <li>If using Google Play Billing with this program, all users must be able to access Google Play Billing in a consistent and reliable manner.</li>
  <li>Integrate with the external content links APIs, which surface an information screen, enable parental controls, and facilitate transaction reporting once required.</li>
  <li>Provide customer support for users completing transactions or downloading apps outside of Play and provide a process to dispute unauthorized transactions.</li>
  <li>Offer refund methods for users completing transactions outside of Play, unless the user was clearly informed that the transaction is non-refundable before completing the purchase.</li>
  <li>All external content links must meet the <a href="#destination_requirements" rel="noopener">destination requirements</a> as outlined below.</li>
  <li><a href="#in_the_future" rel="noopener">Once required</a>, pay Google the applicable fees for qualifying transactions or app installs that are concluded outside the app following the external content link as outlined below.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="destination_requirements" name="destination_requirements"></a><span>Destination requirements</span></h2>

<div>
  <p>All external content destinations must meet the following requirements:</p>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>External content links to purchase in-app offers can be shown on a browser, in a webview or another app store already installed on the user’s device.</li>
      <li>For user safety, external content links to download apps can link to the download of apps on a browser or another app store already installed on the user’s device. The destination page cannot contain any downloads that have not been approved for the ECL program.</li>
      <li>External content links must inform the user about the destination page and its purpose in the app before linking out.</li>
      <li>External content URLs must not contain a user’s personally identifiable information without sufficient security or encryption techniques in order to protect the user’s data.</li>
      <li>External content links must not redirect or mislead users to a different destination page than presented in your external link, or present other false or deceptive information.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>In addition, to ensure a good user experience and keep Play’s users safe, any destination for links to download need to:</p>

  <div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Have the right to distribute the apps available at the destination.</li>
        <li>Clearly and visibly publish details for the app that is to be downloaded. The app details must include at least app name, app icon, app description, app version number, app download size, and information about the app developer.</li>
        <li>Only install an app with the user’s knowledge and at the explicit direction of the user for each app, through a clearly labeled UI component visible to the user.</li>
        <li>Provide direct, publicly accessible customer support to end users through readily accessible communication channels.</li>
        <li>Have user data policies for their users.</li>
        <li>Be responsible for adhering to all applicable local regulations, laws and ordinances.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2><span>Play Ser</span><span>vice Fees</span></h2>

<div>
  <p>In the future, Google intends to apply a service fee on successful transactions and downloads completed via external content links. At this time, however, Google is not assessing these fees and is therefore not requiring developers in this program to report these transactions or downloads to Google.</p>
</div>

<p>Like our standard service fees, the fees associated with the external content links program reflect the <a href="https://play.google/howplayworks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">value provided by Android and Play and support our continued investments across Android and Play</a>. The following fees apply when a user completes any transactions or any app installs <strong>within 24 hours of following an external content link</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In-app item purchases</strong>: 10% for auto-renewing subscriptions and 20% for other offers of in-app digital features and services. Transactions for the first $1M (USD) of total developer earnings annually will be charged at 10%.</li>
  <li><strong>App download event</strong>: A fixed fee (subject to periodic adjustments) per install based on the app category of the linked external app being installed. The linked app category must be declared as part of transaction reporting.
    <ul>
      <li>Games: $3.65</li>
      <li>Apps: $2.85</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
  <p><a id="why_cant_I_select_the_external_app_when_declaring_external_content_links" name="why_cant_I_select_the_external_app_when_declaring_external_content_links"></a>Why can’t I select the external app when declaring external content links in the Play Console?</p>

  <div>
    <p>External apps must be successfully registered before you can declare the external content links that link users to an external app download. Please make sure that the external app has been submitted for registration and addressed any issues that may have been identified during the registration and review process. You can check to see if there are any issues in <a href="https://play.google.com/console/developers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Play Console</a> on the <strong>Publishing</strong> <strong>overview</strong> page before you submit your external app registration or on the <strong>Policy</strong> <strong>status</strong> page after you have submitted your external app for review.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Do I have to register the external apps that I link to?</p>

  <div>
    <p>Yes, registration of all external apps on the linked destination page is required. This process enables Google to check that all external apps linked to using external content links are compliant with <a href="https://play.google/developer-content-policy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Play Developer Policies</a>, with the exception of policies that are not applicable to linked apps, such as the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738" rel="noopener">Payment policies</a>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Can I make external content links available for only some of my apps?</p>

  <div>
    <p>Yes, after successfully signing up to the external content links program, you can select which apps you want to enroll for external content links at any given time using the Play Console.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>How can I notify Google of any changes to my app package enrollment selections?</p>

  <div>
    <p>You can change the external content link program enrollment for a given app package through your <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative#configuring-with-user-choice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Play Console settings</a>. Any updates will be effective immediately, including changes to applicable service fees.</p>

<div>
  <h2>What are the steps to integrate with the external links APIs?</h2>

  <div>
    <p>It is easy to extend your existing integration with Google Play’s billing system to utilize external links APIs. The APIs are built upon the same design patterns and principles as our Play Billing Library and Play Developer APIs. This means they are compatible with your existing designs and will be familiar to your teams. In our developer integration guide, we provide detailed guidelines and resources on how to get started. We welcome developer feedback on these APIs and any additional resources that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or feedback about the external links APIs, please contact us <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/billing_and_linkouts_program_q" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>If I am already participating in an alternative billing program, can I also participate in the external content links program?</p>

  <div>
    <p>Yes, developers can take advantage of both programs if they so choose and if they satisfy requirements of both programs and meet the eligibility criteria for both. To participate in the external content links program and start promoting external links, you need to successfully complete the signup process and comply with all the program requirements.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Can I use Google Play&#39;s billing system alongside external content links?</p>

  <div>
    <p>Yes, developers can take advantage of Google Play&#39;s billing system while also participating in the external content links program. To participate in the external content links program and start promoting external links, you need to successfully complete the signup process and comply with all the program requirements.</p>
