    <h1>There’s never going to be time</h1>

<p>A few years ago, a silly checkbox animation I made got some attention on Twitter:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/doused_zi/status/1436285069082120235"><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/so-much-time.png" alt="tweet text: y&#39;all have so much time on your hands, I desperately want some"/></a></p>
<p>Even years later, the comment above stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y’all have so much time on your hands, I desperately want some.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were probably joking, but it couldn’t have been further from the truth.</p>
<p>They didn’t know that I recorded that video at 1:30AM the night before, or that I’d been up that late working on it three nights in a row. They didn’t know that I had a sore throat and knew I needed the rest, but stayed up to work on it anyway. They didn’t see my overflowing email inbox or my Elder’s Quorum interview backlog. They didn’t see the hours I was putting in daily, raising 5 kids and maintaining a 70-yr-old house.</p>
<p>I bring this up, not because I want credit or pity. It’s because I want my future self to remember that <em>I didn’t have time for this but I made it anyway</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, looking back at my other projects, I’ve never had time for any of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/after-dark-css/">After Dark in CSS</a>: I loved this idea so much that I put my side-business on hold and blocked out a week to work on it. I went to the public library so I could have uninterrupted focus-time to learn about web animations and figure out how to build this.</li>
<li><a href="https://powerpointkaraoke.com">Powerpoint Karaoke</a>: My wife and I worked on this together during our 5th anniversary. We asked my sister-in-law to watch the kids and we spent most of the time building the first version of the website.</li>
<li><a href="https://sparkbox.github.io/bouncy-ball">Bouncy Ball</a>: I set up an unconventional schedule at work, putting in extra hours on Monday-Thursday, so I could have free time to work on this on Fridays. Ultimately, this meant I had to come in early, leave late, take fewer breaks, and work with my clients to get it approved.</li>
<li><a href="https://musicbox.fun">Music Box Fun</a>: I organized a trip to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> to build an early version of this. Sparkbox covered part of the cost, but I needed to pay for the remainder myself and use some vacation days in order to stay the whole week.</li>
<li><a href="https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative">Let’s Get Creative</a>: My wife and kids agreed to cover my outdoor chores for me so I could spend a couple of Saturdays working on this. I ended up taking some vacation days to get it out the door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, every time I wanted to make something non-trivial, life stood in the way. I’ve had to let house projects languish, retire existing projects (many which still had potential, but were high-maintenance), or interrupt momentum in one area to pursue an opportunity in another.</p>
<p>And while it’s tempting to feel resentful, the truth is that this is just what life looks like when you’re a capable adult. Your time is valuable so it gets put to good use.</p>
<p>There’s never going to be time to build something great, because <strong>it’s hard to do great work without giving it your undivided attention, and undividing your attention always has a cost</strong>. The trick is to become ok with that.</p>
