          <div><p>The star bird of the month though, wasn’t a passage migrant but more likely a result of post-breeding dispersal. From just before the middle of July a few reports started to come in of a <strong>kingfisher (below)</strong> being spotted along the New River. Views were generally fleeting, but it wasn’t long before the bird grew in confidence and started to perch happily allowing good views. The favourite perches were mostly not far from the water inlet next to the main entrance, but the bird could be found almost anywhere on site, either perched on reed, in waterside willow, or on a variety of metal bars around the inlet. From close views it could be seen that the bird was a young male.</p></div>

          <div><p>When a <strong>common sandpiper</strong> spent a day here on July 3<sup>rd</sup>, mostly on one of the tern rafts, it raised hopes that a few migrant wading birds might be about to pass through, but unfortunately this was the only wader seen in the month. <strong>Little egrets</strong> were seen daily at the start of the month, generally near the water inlet, but sightings fizzled out around the middle of the month. It was a similar story with <strong>common terns</strong>, seen daily for most of the month but not seen in the last week of the month. It seems likely that they attempted to breed this year, which would have been a first for the site, but unfortunately there was no evidence of breeding success.</p></div>

<p><strong>House martins</strong> don’t breed on site or nearby but they will often come here to feed. Large flocks are usually a feature of late autumn once the breeding season is over but we did have a flock of around fifty here on July 26<sup>th</sup>.
