Their ultimate target is &#39;endothelial LRP1&#39;, which helps remove amyloid-beta plaques at the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>&#34;The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain&#39;s vasculature,&#34; <a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/consiguen-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-ratones-con-el-uso-de-nanoparticulas">explains</a> bioengineer Giuseppe Battaglia from IBEC.</p><p>&#34;We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta  accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing amyloid-beta and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.</p><p>&#34;What&#39;s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels.&#34;</p><p>Today, effective treatments for Alzheimer&#39;s disease are proving tricky to find. The <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives">latest drugs</a>, which target abnormal clumps and tangles in the brain, have <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs">produced mixed results</a>.</p><p>While drugs like lecanemab and donanemab can <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-lifes-purpose-could-be-keeping-dementia-at-bay-study-finds">somewhat</a> <a href="http://sciencealert.com/this-fda-approved-drug-slows-down-alzheimers-we-finally-know-why">slow down</a> Alzheimer&#39;s symptoms, they can&#39;t reverse the disease or stop its progression, no matter how scientists try.</p><p>Some researchers <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-says-expert">think</a> we&#39;ve gotten ourselves into a bit of a rut. They argue we&#39;ve been too focused on clearing plaques and tangles inside the brain, when Alzheimer&#39;s may actually <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-start-at-the-brains-borders-scientists-discover">start at the brain&#39;s borders</a>.</p><p>Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer&#39;s Research UK, who was not involved in the current study, <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/">says</a> it&#39;s too early to say if this strategy will work in people. Mice don&#39;t have the same brain vasculature as humans, and the current study only examined a very specific subtype of dementia in a small number of rodents.</p><p>Still, Dudley says the results add to growing evidence that &#34;repairing the blood-brain barrier itself could offer a new way to treat Alzheimer&#39;s.&#34;</p><p>&#34;This type of research – while still early – is crucial for taking us closer to finding a cure,&#34; she <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/">writes</a>.</p><p>The study was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1"><i>Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy</i></a><i>.</i></p>
