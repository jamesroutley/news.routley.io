    <h1>Absurd Workflows: Durable Execution with Just Postgres</h1>

  <p>It’s probably no surprise to you that we’re building
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents">agents</a>
somewhere.  Everybody does it.  Building a good agent, however, brings back
some of the historic challenges involving durable execution.</p>
<p>Entirely unsurprisingly, a lot of people are now building durable execution
systems.  Many of these, however, are incredibly complex and require you to
sign up for another third-party service.  I generally try to avoid bringing in
extra complexity if I can avoid it, so I wanted to see how far I can go with
just Postgres.  To this end, I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd">Absurd</a> , a tiny SQL-only
library with a very thin SDK to enable durable workflows on top of just
Postgres — no extension needed.</p>
<h2>Durable Execution 101</h2>
<p>Durable execution (or durable workflows) is a way to run long-lived, reliable
functions that can survive crashes, restarts, and network failures without losing
state or duplicating work.  Durable execution can be thought of as the combination
of a queue system and a state store that remembers the most recently seen execution state.</p>
<p>Because Postgres <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190530143429/https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">is excellent at
queues</a>
thanks to <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>, you can use it for the queue (e.g.,
with <a href="https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq">pgmq</a>).  And because it’s a database, you
can also use it to store the state.</p>
<p>The state is important.  With durable execution, instead of running your logic in
memory, the goal is to decompose a task into smaller pieces (step functions) and
record every step and decision.  When the process stops (whether it fails,
intentionally suspends, or a machine dies) the engine can replay those events to
restore the exact state and continue where it left off, as if nothing happened.</p>
<h2>Absurd At A High Level</h2>
<p>Absurd at the core is a single <code>.sql</code> file
(<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd/blob/main/sql/absurd.sql"><code>absurd.sql</code></a>)
which needs to be applied to a database of your choice.  That SQL file’s goal is
to move the complexity of SDKs into the database.  SDKs then make the
system convenient by abstracting the low-level operations in a way that
leverages the ergonomics of the language you are working with.</p>
<p>The system is very simple: A <em>task</em> dispatches onto a given <em>queue</em> from where
a <em>worker</em> picks it up to work on.  Tasks are subdivided into <em>steps</em>, which are
executed in sequence by the worker.  Tasks can be suspended or fail, and when
that happens, they execute again (a <em>run</em>).  The result of a step is stored in
the database (a <em>checkpoint</em>).  To avoid repeating work, checkpoints are
automatically loaded from the state storage in Postgres again.</p>
<p>Additionally, tasks can <em>sleep</em> or <em>suspend for events</em> and wait until they are
emitted.  Events are cached, which means they are race-free.</p>
<h2>With Agents</h2>
<p>What is the relationship of agents with workflows?  Normally, workflows are DAGs
defined by a human ahead of time.  AI agents, on the other hand, define their own
adventure as they go.  That means they are basically a workflow with
mostly a single step that iterates over changing state until it determines that
it has completed.  Absurd enables this by automatically counting up steps if they
are repeated:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>absurd</span><span>.</span><span>registerTask</span><span>({</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;my-agent&#34;</span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>step</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>step</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>newMessages</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>finishReason</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>step</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;iteration&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>singleStep</span><span>(</span><span>messages</span><span>);</span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span>
<span>    </span><span>messages</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(...</span><span>newMessages</span><span>);</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>finishReason</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>&#34;tool-calls&#34;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>break</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This defines a single task named <code>my-agent</code>, and it has just a single step.  The
return value is the changed state, but the current state is passed in as an
argument.  Every time the step function is executed, the data is looked up first
from the checkpoint store.  The first checkpoint will be <code>iteration</code>, the second
<code>iteration#2</code>, <code>iteration#3</code>, etc.  Each state only stores the new messages it
generated, not the entire message history.</p>
<p>If a step fails, the task fails and will be retried.  And because of checkpoint
storage, if you crash in step 5, the first 4 steps will be loaded automatically
from the store.  Steps are never retried, only tasks.</p>
<p>How do you kick it off? Simply enqueue it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>absurd</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;my-agent&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>prompt</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;What&#39;s the weather like in Boston?&#34;</span>
<span>},</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>maxAttempts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And if you are curious, this is an example implementation of the <code>singleStep</code>
function used above:</p>

<h2>Events and Sleeps</h2>
<p>And like Temporal and other solutions, you can yield if you want.  If you want
to come back to a problem in 7 days, you can do so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>24</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>// sleep for 7 days</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Or if you want to wait for an event:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>eventName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`email-confirmation-</span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>
<span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>payload</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>waitForEvent</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>timeout</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>});</span>
<span>  </span><span>// handle event payload</span>
<span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span> </span><span>instanceof</span><span> </span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>// handle timeout</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>e</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which someone else can emit:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>eventName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`email-confirmation-</span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>
<span>await</span><span> </span><span>absurd</span><span>.</span><span>emitEvent</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>confirmedAt</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Date</span><span>().</span><span>toISOString</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>});</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>That’s it!</h2>
<p>Really, that’s it.  There is really not much to it.  It’s just a queue and a
state store — that’s all you need.  There is <a href="https://useworkflow.dev/">no compiler
plugin</a> and no <a href="https://www.inngest.com/">separate
service</a> or <a href="https://temporal.io/">whole runtime
integration</a>.  Just Postgres.  That’s not to throw shade
on these other solutions; they are great.  But not every problem necessarily
needs to scale to that level of complexity, and you can get quite far with much
less.  Particularly if you want to build software that other people should be
able to self-host, that might be quite appealing.</p>
