                    <p>The Japanese government is introducing laws that will require Apple to allow users nationwide to download apps outside their official app stores.
</p><p>The two tech giants face regulations from various countries to open their platforms and let users install apps from third-party sources. For example, Europe&#39;s Digital Markets Act <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/01/europe-confirms-its-digital-markets-act-will-go-after-apples-app-store">will compel</a> companies like Apple to provide options that allow third-party app stores on their platforms and alternative payment systems.
</p><p>Japan is the next country to impose regulations on these companies, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/06/16/business/japan-apple-google-apps-stores/">according to</a> <em>The Japan Times</em>. It will require Apple and Google to let users download apps through services other than their app stores. The government aims to stimulate competition and believes it could reduce app prices.
</p><p>The government will compile a list of prohibited actions for OS providers to prevent them from showing bias towards their services and payment platforms. The regulations were created at the government&#39;s digital market competition headquarters, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. 
</p><p>It intends to present the appropriate legislation during the upcoming ordinary session of parliament in 2024.
</p><p>Japan is also concerned that Apple and Google apps come pre-installed on iPhones and Android smartphones by default. As a result, the two companies will be required to make it easy for users to remove these apps and can&#39;t give preferential treatment to their services within their search engines.
</p><p>Apple doesn&#39;t have an official search engine like Google, but the government may be referring to Spotlight, a local search feature on Apple devices that lets users search for content on their devices and provide web search suggestions.
</p><p><h2 data-anchor="rules-from-apple-and-google" id="rules-from-apple-and-google">Rules from Apple and Google</h2>
</p><p>It&#39;s not possible to install <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios" title="iOS" data-kpt="1">iOS</a> apps from outside of the App Store due to Apple&#39;s rules. Meanwhile, although Google lets Android users install apps from third-party sources, 97% of people still use the Google Play Store.
</p><p>However, each company also prevents third-party app providers from accepting user payments through any payment platform other than those provided by Apple or Google.
</p><p>Apple CEO <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook" title="Tim Cook" data-kpt="1">Tim Cook</a> cites privacy and security as <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/28/privacy-and-security-are-apples-top-app-store-priorities-tim-cook-says">two reasons</a> while Apple doesn&#39;t allow app downloads outside of the iOS App Store. However, Japan&#39;s regulations would require developers to implement some privacy and security safeguards for their app stores for users to download apps.
</p><p>Furthermore, the two companies will be compelled to enable users to make payments through third-party platforms.</p>
