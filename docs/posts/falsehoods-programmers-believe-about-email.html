<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/x1kzgx/comment/imf360n/">Email attachment size will be accurate to the storage size of the attachment</a>; relatedly, attachment filenames are the correct filenames for those file types, and that it’s safe to extract attachments to those filenames</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/x1kzgx/comment/img6o2n/">It is valid to remove <code>+suffixes</code> from email addresses (e.g. <code>john+doe@example.com</code> → <code>john@example.com</code>)</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Email addresses are case-sensitive / can be compared by == or strcmp</li>
<li>A reply to an email sent to address X will come from X (this is the mistake made by things that say “Reply with REMOVE to unsubscribe”)</li>
<li>If you receive email at address X, you are capable of sending email whose From header is X.</li>
