        <p>By 2028, there must be fast chargers at least every 60 km on the EU’s key motorways. That is the most eyecatching measure of several approved by the European Parliament to improve EV charging. Others focus on increasing charging speed and making it easier to pay for charging. All are part of the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ package, aimed at reducing emissions by 55% by 2030.</p>  <p>The maximum-distance rule for fast chargers applies to TEN-T (<em>pictured)</em>, an EU-wide network of key traffic corridors with a total length of 24,500 km. The mandated fast chargers along these roads all must have an output of at least 400 kW by 2026, and 600 kW by 2028. </p>  <p>Specifically for electric buses and trucks, the European Parliament mandated charging points at most 120 km apart by 2028 on at least half the network, each heavy-duty charger with an output of 1,400 to 2,800 kW, depending on the road. </p>  <p>In addition to these minimum requirements for the density and speed of the fast charger network, the European parliament also wants more simplicity and transparency when it comes to payment:</p>  <ul> 	<li>All customers must be able to pay with cards or contactless devices (at present, some charging networks require subscriptions or app downloads). </li> 	<li>All prices must be clearly displayed to the customers: in euros per kW or per minute/session.  </li> 	<li>By 2027, the EU will develop a public database of charging stations, with information on pricing, availability, and waiting times. </li> </ul>  <p>Not forgetting other sustainable alternatives to ICEs, the European Parliament mandated at least one hydrogen refueling station every 200 km along TEN-T motorways by 2031. </p>  <p>The new alternative fuel infrastructure rules have already been approved by the European Parliament, but will only enter into force six months after approval by the European Council. </p>  <p>In a separate move, the UK has formulated similar proposals to improve the availability and reliability of public EV charging. For example: the British government wants to reduce the share of charging stations out of service from 8% in 2019 to 1% (as is already the case in the Netherlands), and will require that charging station operators provide a 24-hour helpline for their customers.</p>  <p><em>Image: Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, European Commission – CC BY-SA 4.0</em></p>
