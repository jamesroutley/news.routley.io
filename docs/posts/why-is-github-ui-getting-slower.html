    <h1>Why is GitHub UI getting slower?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I couldn&#39;t help but notice - GitHub UI has been getting slower and slower recently. Some things that were snappy before are
hellishly slow nowadays. GitHub is doing something weird and I just can&#39;t wrap my head around what&#39;s going on there.</p>
<p><strong>You guys developing at GitHub, you&#39;re using GitHub to develop it, right? Do you not see this? What&#39;s going on?</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I bump into slow website which drives me nuts, I open the devtools and profile it. Who knows, maybe I
find something to report and the problem will get fixed.</p>
<p>To give one representative example, here&#39;s a profile for switching from &#34;Conversation&#34; tab to
&#34;Files changed&#34; tab on a PR.</p>
<p>Before we look into the profile, notice that this takes over 5s. How is anything like that acceptable in 2025 is beyond me.</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/file-view-route-change.webp" alt="file-view-route-change.png"/></p>
<p>Now, if you dive deep into this, you&#39;ll see that GitHub uses <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo</a> to preload next page and swap out the
content without page reload. This is usually done as a performance optimization, but here, we see something completely
absurd.</p>
<p>If you try this out at home and play around with it, you&#39;ll find out that <strong>opening the &#34;Files changed&#34; link in a new tab is
actually 2x faster:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/fresh-file-view.webp" alt="img.png"/></p>
<p>And not only that - the client side post-processing in the first profile actually takes longer than loading the html
from the server. This whole thing just doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is the new loading bar that just drives me absolutely nuts, because it reminds me how slow
the whole transition is:</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/github-progress-bar.webp" alt="github-progress-bar.png"/></p>
<p>Guys... can you just make the transition fast such that you don&#39;t need a new loading bar?
Like, what&#39;s the point of doing client side routing, when you just recreate the full page reload experience, but slower?
<strong>The whole point of doing SPAs was to avoid this. Client side routing should be instant.</strong></p>
<p>This is just one of many performance problems on GitHub. It didn&#39;t use to be that way. Trying to go through multiple PRs and 
issues is just suffering now. Imagine you have 20 PRs to find out which one introduced a regression, and every click takes more than 5 seconds to show something.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on the diff view itself - yes, the one that periodically freezes for 2 seconds while browsing through
large PR&#39;s - maybe it has something to do with the fact that it renders thousands of invisible plus buttons with the
same inlined svg icon:</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/invisible-plus-icon.webp" alt="invisible-plus-icon.webp"/></p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/invisible-plus-icon-html.webp" alt="invisible-plus-icon-html.png"/></p>
<p>Or, you know, maybe not trying to render <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/111001">100 000 DOM nodes</a> in general would
also help.</p>
<p>The whole window freezes for 3 seconds when you resize the dev tools window because you want to profile
this thing.</p>

<a href="#does-this-ever-improve" aria-label="Anchor link for: does-this-ever-improve">ðŸ”—</a>
</span>
</h2>
<p>So, maybe, when <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/33663">some of the popular issues</a> are related to performance, and GitHub has this seemingly related <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1?filterQuery=is%3Aopen+product-focus-area%3A%22%E2%9B%B0+Platform+for+collaboration+at+scale%22">&#34;Platform collaboration at scale&#34;</a> focus area in the roadmap, maybe this will change?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the roadmap and see if we can find
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap%20slow&amp;type=code">anything</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap+slow+ui&amp;type=issues">related</a> to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap+web+performance&amp;type=code">performance</a>. Did you find something?</p>
