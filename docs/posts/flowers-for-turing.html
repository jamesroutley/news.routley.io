<p>Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. Each year on 23rd June, we honor his birthday by surrounding his statue with flowers. Since 2013, we’ve raised over £12,700 for the amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpYNG7MivHs&amp;feature=emb_title">Special Effect</a>. Based in the UK, they use video games and technology to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities.</p>

<p>By joining us in this heartfelt tradition, you can help celebrate Alan Turing’s legacy and support an amazing cause.</p>
