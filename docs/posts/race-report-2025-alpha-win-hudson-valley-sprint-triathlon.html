    <h1>Race Report - 2025 Alpha Win Hudson Valley Sprint Triathlon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Although the <a href="https://supertri.com/latest/triathlon-distances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olympic distance triathlon</a> is and will likely always be my favorite distance to race, I absolutely love that a sprint is over in about an hour and a half, maybe 2 hours at the most. I know I can do anything for 2 hours, right? Right?</p><p>I kept repeating this to myself as I went into last month’s <a href="https://alpha.win/event/hudson-valley-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha Win Hudson Valley Sprint Triathlon</a>. A few days before the race, I gave a <a href="https://missfunmi.com/talks/2025-06-25-triathlon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk on triathlons</a> at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=c7bc9ba4cb3e6725e05e413f16f8c5a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>, which is how I came to realize I’d raced 21 triathlons (now 22). So by all indications, I should have been totally “experienced” and not at all nervous or worried about a lil ol’ sprint, right?</p><p>Right??</p><p>—</p><h3 id="fears-%F0%9F%98%B5%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%AB" tabindex="-1">Fears 😵‍💫</h3><p>I didn’t learn to swim until I was 28, so I still have to mentally prepare every time I get in water where I can’t touch the bottom. This one was no different, especially after a 2‑year hiatus from open water swims, my last ending in a full‑blown panic attack thanks to <a href="https://longisland.news12.com/tracking-ophelia-tropical-storm-pummels-south-shore-with-rough-rip-currents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tropical Storm Ophelia</a> (I still finished, though).</p><p>I was also worried about how my legs would hold up. This was my first triathlon since tearing my PCL in November 2023, and while it’s “healed,” I know it’s probably never going to be 100%, so I’ve been trying to manage my expectations with speedwork. Then, in the months leading up to the race, I developed shin splints, and a couple days before the race my orthopedist flat‑out told me to skip it (like that was ever going to happen, lol).</p><p>—</p><h3 id="getting-there-%F0%9F%9A%97" tabindex="-1">Getting There 🚗</h3><p>I really like this race because it’s extremely well organized, easy to get to, and set in a beautiful little corner of upstate New York. When I last raced it in 2022, I drove up the morning of, leaving Brooklyn at 4 am to make the ~8 am start. Seemed reasonable at the time, slightly insane in hindsight.</p><p>This time around, I decided to spend the night and split a car rental and 1-night hotel stay with a friend from my <a href="https://brooklyntri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tri club</a>. We “splurged” on an SUV (only $9 more than a sedan, baller!) so we could toss our bikes in the back without fiddling with rack mounts, and left Brooklyn at 6 pm on Friday for a 9 pm arrival in Kingston. Unfortunately, our hotel was overbooked and sent us to a sister property down the road, so we didn’t get to bed until 11 pm.</p><p>—</p><h3 id="race-morning-%F0%9F%8C%9E" tabindex="-1">Race Morning 🌞</h3><p>We got up at 5 am, quickly showered, re-packed our bags, then went downstairs to grab coffee and breakfast (shout out to the front desk staff for setting up 30 minutes early). It felt too early to eat anything, so I only managed a slice of unbuttered toast and water before heading out for the 25-minute drive to the race venue.</p><p>Our goal was to make it to the main parking lot before it closed at 7 to avoid the overflow lot a bit further away, and we just about hit that, getting there around 6:50 am. We got in line to pick up our race packets and then went to set up our bikes in transition. It felt really good to be in the race environment again and especially around people I knew from my tri club. I made the standard pre-race restroom stop (by which time the first 70.3 swimmer had blazed out of water), before walking down to the water for the swim start.</p><p>—</p><h3 id="the-swim-%F0%9F%8F%8A%F0%9F%8F%BE%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F" tabindex="-1">The Swim 🏊🏾‍♀️</h3><p>Alpha Win texted us the day before that the water was 77ºF and wetsuit-legal. This sounded warm to me and I wasn’t sure if I would overheat, so naturally I consulted Reddit. The general consensus seems to be that unless you’re a fairly strong front-of-the-pack swimmer, it’s usually a good idea to wear a wetsuit if your race permits it. I’m sure I’ll totally remember this for my next race and not have to Google it again.</p><p>We headed down the long and gravelly path to the swim start and listened to instructions from the race director: we were to swim counterclockwise and turn at each of 3 yellow buoys. Given the size of the sprint event (around 200 participants total), the swim was a <a href="https://www.swimdojo.com/blog/2018/8/1/open-water-starts#:~:text=mass%20start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass start</a>. The male sprint athletes started first around 8:17 am before the rest of us entered the water. I waded in (instead of diving in) like a total wimp and immediately regretted it when I felt the slippery, slimy lake bed. The water itself felt warmish but not terribly so, and I was happy about my choice to wear a wetsuit.</p><p>A slight panic hit as soon as I couldn’t feel the ground anymore, but right then the race director blew his whistle and we were off. I’d seeded myself towards the back but quickly found myself swimming around others. For some reason in open water, everything always looks so far. The race director had said the first yellow buoy was only 300 yards away, but mid-swim my brain went “<em>Surely, that’s at least 1,000 yards away!</em>”</p><p>A few minutes in, my watch vibrated on my wrist to signal the 100-yard mark, and I silently thanked the Garmin gods for the <a href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-9D99A9D4-467A-4F1A-A0EA-023184FEA3DD/EN-US/GUID-5E34E41D-D8CB-496E-839D-BC1F0CBFCC48.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auto Lap feature</a>. I told myself: “<em>Okay 1 down, just 7 more to go. This is totally normal, you can do this.</em>” But when my watch buzzed again and the first buoy didn’t look any closer, I scanned for a rescue kayak for a rest stop. The nearest one was way off course and too far to reach. I was likely close to 250 yards at this point and could feel my heart rate spiking. I made a split-second decision to flip onto my back — something I almost never do — and let my wetsuit keep me afloat. I didn’t even try to swim; I simply focused on taking long deep breaths and getting my heart rate back down.</p><p>Thinking of my triathlon friends helped. I told myself “<em>If they can do this, you totally can, too</em>”. Visualizing them effortlessly swimming 1.2 miles in a half Ironman was oddly grounding. Even though I’ve completed four half Ironman races myself, my own ability felt suspect in that moment. But thinking about others powering through the distance comfortably and confidently surprisingly <em>normalized</em> the act for me. I reminded myself: I really had nothing to be afraid of. They’ve done this swim before, and I’ve done this swim and longer multiple times. I own my brain, not the other way around, dammit.</p><p>After maybe 15 seconds on my back, the fear of being alone in the water forced me to roll over and keep swimming. Soon I started passing other swimmers, even a few men from the earlier wave 5 minutes ahead, which reassured me that I was doing okay despite every fiber of my being insisting I was not. I kept my rhythm, breathing only to my right on a 2-stroke count (stroke, breathe), turning left at each buoy and continuing on until I could touch the soil at the swim exit. Ecstatic, I got to my feet and ran up the trail to transition, happy to leave the water behind.</p><p><strong>Swim Time</strong>: 00:19:49 (2:38 min/100m) - 32/73 Female, 6/73 Age Group</p><p>—</p><h2 id="the-bike-%F0%9F%9A%B4%F0%9F%8F%BE%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F" tabindex="-1">The Bike 🚴🏾‍♀️</h2><p>I decided to use my road bike since I haven’t ridden my TT bike outside in nearly 2 years. I didn’t have much of a strategy for the bike leg other than to absolutely <em>send it</em> (as best as I could). I didn’t know if I’d be able to run at all and didn’t want to regret holding back on the bike if that turned out to be the case. The 12.5 mile out-and-back bike loop was gorgeous and serene, with rolling hills on mostly empty roads. The roads were not closed for the race, but there were cops managing bikes through the lone busy intersection that cut through the bike course.</p><p>I only had to slow down for one gravelly stretch and a narrow U-turn at the halfway point, which I tried (and failed!) to complete without one foot on the ground. I didn’t plan ahead for my nutrition for the bike, but I’d remembered to grab an energy bar on my way out of transition, so that together with a half bottle of Skratch sports hydration really came in handy, especially on an empty stomach.</p><p>Overall, a relatively uneventful ride: I passed and was passed by lots of people along the way but felt pretty good about the effort I put in.</p><p><strong>Bike Time:</strong> 00:45:49 (16.2 mph) - 11/73 Female, 3/12 Age Group</p><p>—</p><h2 id="the-run-%F0%9F%8F%83%F0%9F%8F%BE%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F" tabindex="-1">The Run 🏃🏾‍♀️</h2><p>The run was along a mostly shaded section of the <a href="https://empiretrail.ny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire State Trail</a>. I’d forgotten how much I love running in the woods… why don’t I do this all the time again?!</p><p>I never bother wearing socks in anything shorter than an Olympic distance race, but I’d forgotten to swap in my elastic quick laces, so I had to fully untie and retie both shoes in transition to get my wet feet in. Rookie mistake, but a good one to re-learn now versus in a more competitive race.</p><p>I set out at a perky 8:39 min/mile, faster than anything I’ve run recently. I felt really great with no signs of pain in either shin and just a little high on adrenaline. My pace in the second mile slowed slightly to 8:48 min/mile and dropped to 9:00 min/mile in the 3rd leg. I could sense I was nearing a wall but knew I had a little left in the tank to power through the remaining 0.1 mile, so I pushed the pace back up to 7:42 min/mile on the last stretch and crossed the finish line feeling like I’d given it my all. By the end, I could only feel the beginnings of a niggle in the left shin — a huge success in my books!</p><p><strong>Run Time:</strong> 00:27:13 (8:45 min/mi) - 20/73 Female, 4/12 Age Group</p><p>—</p><h2 id="overall-%F0%9F%A5%B3%F0%9F%8E%96%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%A5%89" tabindex="-1">Overall 🥳🎖️🥉</h2><p>I finished in 1:37:08, a 6:33 PR over my previous showing at this race and a 3rd place finish in my age group! I couldn’t be more thrilled, especially after agonizing so much about the swim and unsure if I could even run at all. I’m so happy I trusted my gut regarding the wetsuit choice and pacing on the bike and that I was able to overcome my irrational fears and panic during the swim.</p><p><strong>Overall Time:</strong> 1:37:08 - 3/12 Age Group, 15/73 Female, 46/ Overall</p><p>—</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next%3F-%F0%9F%A4%94" tabindex="-1">What’s Next? 🤔</h2><p>My big race this year is <a href="https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-washington-tri-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ironman 70.3 Washington Tri-Cities</a> on September 21st. It’ll be my fifth time racing that distance, and I’m especially stoked for this race as it already seems really popular, despite this only being its second year. It’s also an excuse for me to finally visit the Seattle area for the first time, and I can’t wait!</p><p>I’d hoped to be able to race an Olympic tri this summer to refine my race routine and nutrition and get more race-specific open water swimming practice. Unfortunately, it looks unlikely I’ll be able to squeeze one in, so I’ll just have to be diligent about my brick workouts and get in a few more open water swims between now and September.</p><ul><li><a href="https://missfunmi.com/building-a-playdate-game-in-rust/">Building a Playdate Game in Rust</a></li></ul></section></div>
