				<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
				<p>This is a term that describes an array of different kinds of designers. Think of it like the term “entrepreneur”. It describes a wide variety of businesspeople - from founders to VC&#39;s to <a href="https://startupsthisishowdesignworks.com/tooltips/ninjas.html" rel="./tooltips/ninjas.html">“Chief Ninjas”</a> - but isn’t all-inclusive. Graphic designers work with graphical images, whether they be illustrations, <a href="https://startupsthisishowdesignworks.com/tooltips/typography.html" rel="./tooltips/typography.html">typography</a>, or images, and on a variety of media including print and web. Graphic design is typically rendered in 2D – printed on a physical surface or displayed on a screen.</p>
