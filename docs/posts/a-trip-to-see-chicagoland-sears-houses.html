It was kind of a spur of the moment idea I had a few weeks ago, and I invited my architect sister, Betsy, to meet me there (our dear sister Lynne was needed for Father&#39;s Day festivities in her world, so we had to make do with only two sisters!).

The definite majority of those is concentrated in Chicagoland, and, as you can see from a section of our map of houses, the area that I visited was only a tiny portion of what has been found in total, up to this point:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGvUPMdPy150gvvOv-cylkqCs8mtsy1jJK5ULFDIvmuQ4266KqXzSUUlZEqW5g7zPyiR9Ld7hZ06D8AaozkU2yABH3Q1M5IqjThPn9pJQw0F0Cq-wUri7YTrMvIQ1Y76KPUUHyHQcj9Jbteo2EPJYOwRdRixJPKIpXLDa_vgUwdfPFwQtwQjZ4ZGUa0U8Q/s1752/Screenshot%202023-06-20%20at%2010.12.35%20PM.png"><img alt="orange and white Google map image of Sears houses located in the greater Chicagoland area, houses pinpointed in blue" data-original-height="1752" data-original-width="1536" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGvUPMdPy150gvvOv-cylkqCs8mtsy1jJK5ULFDIvmuQ4266KqXzSUUlZEqW5g7zPyiR9Ld7hZ06D8AaozkU2yABH3Q1M5IqjThPn9pJQw0F0Cq-wUri7YTrMvIQ1Y76KPUUHyHQcj9Jbteo2EPJYOwRdRixJPKIpXLDa_vgUwdfPFwQtwQjZ4ZGUa0U8Q/w562-h640/Screenshot%202023-06-20%20at%2010.12.35%20PM.png" title="Google map image of Sears houses located in the greater Chicagoland area" width="562"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>The Chicagoland area Sears houses</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
