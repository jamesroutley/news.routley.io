Subject: <a href="#r" id="t">[PATCH RFC 00/20] Setting up Binder for the future</a>
Date: Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:01:30 +0000	<a href="#r">[thread overview]</a>
Message-ID: &lt;20231101-rust-binder-v1-0-08ba9197f637@google.com&gt; (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20231101-rust-binder-v1-0-08ba9197f637@google.com/raw">raw</a>)

We&#39;re generally not proponents of rewrites (nasty uncomfortable things
that make you late for dinner!). So why rewrite Binder? 

Binder has been evolving over the past 15+ years to meet the evolving
needs of Android. Its responsibilities, expectations, and complexity
have grown considerably during that time. While we expect Binder to
continue to evolve along with Android, there are a number of factors
that currently constrain our ability to develop/maintain it. Briefly
those are:

1. Complexity: Binder is at the intersection of everything in Android and
   fulfills many responsibilities beyond IPC. It has become many things
   to many people, and due to its many features and their interactions
   with each other, its complexity is quite high. In just 6kLOC it must
   deliver transactions to the right threads. It must correctly parse
   and translate the contents of transactions, which can contain several
   objects of different types (e.g., pointers, fds) that can interact
   with each other. It controls the size of thread pools in userspace,
   and ensures that transactions are assigned to threads in ways that
   avoid deadlocks where the threadpool has run out of threads. It must
   track refcounts of objects that are shared by several processes by
   forwarding refcount changes between the processes correctly.  It must
   handle numerous error scenarios and it combines/nests 13 different
   locks, 7 reference counters, and atomic variables. Finally, It must
   do all of this as fast and efficiently as possible. Minor performance
   regressions can cause a noticeably degraded user experience.

2. Things to improve: Thousand-line functions [1], error-prone error
   handling [2], and confusing structure can occur as a code base grows
   organically. After more than a decade of development, this codebase
   could use an overhaul.

3. Security critical: Binder is a critical part of Android&#39;s sandboxing
   strategy. Even Android&#39;s most de-privileged sandboxes (e.g. the
   Chrome renderer, or SW Codec) have direct access to Binder. More than
   just about any other component, it&#39;s important that Binder provide
   robust security, and itself be robust against security
   vulnerabilities.

It&#39;s #1 (high complexity) that has made continuing to evolve Binder and
resolving #2 (tech debt) exceptionally difficult without causing #3
(security issues). For Binder to continue to meet Android&#39;s needs, we
need better ways to manage (and reduce!) complexity without increasing
the risk.

The biggest change is obviously the choice of programming language. We
decided to use Rust because it directly addresses a number of the
challenges within Binder that we have faced during the last years. It
prevents mistakes with ref counting, locking, bounds checking, and also
does a lot to reduce the complexity of error handling. Additionally,
we&#39;ve been able to use the more expressive type system to encode the
ownership semantics of the various structs and pointers, which takes the
complexity of managing object lifetimes out of the hands of the
programmer, reducing the risk of use-after-frees and similar problems.

Rust has many different pointer types that it uses to encode ownership
semantics into the type system, and this is probably one of the most
important aspects of how it helps in Binder. The Binder driver has a lot
of different objects that have complex ownership semantics; some
pointers own a refcount, some pointers have exclusive ownership, and
some pointers just reference the object and it is kept alive in some
other manner. With Rust, we can use a different pointer type for each
kind of pointer, which enables the compiler to enforce that the
ownership semantics are implemented correctly.

Another useful feature is Rust&#39;s error handling. Rust allows for more
simplified error handling with features such as destructors, and you get
compilation failures if errors are not properly handled. This means that
even though Rust requires you to spend more lines of code than C on
things such as writing down invariants that are left implicit in C, the
Rust driver is still slightly smaller than C binder: Rust is 5.5kLOC and
C is 5.8kLOC. (These numbers are excluding blank lines, comments,
binderfs, and any debugging facilities in C that are not yet implemented
in the Rust driver. The numbers include abstractions in rust/kernel/
that are unlikely to be used by other drivers than Binder.)

Although this rewrite completely rethinks how the code is structured and
how assumptions are enforced, we do not fundamentally change *how* the
driver does the things it does. A lot of careful thought has gone into
the existing design. The rewrite is aimed rather at improving code
health, structure, readability, robustness, security, maintainability
and extensibility. We also include more inline documentation, and
improve how assumptions in the code are enforced. Furthermore, all
unsafe code is annotated with a SAFETY comment that explains why it is
correct.

We have left the binderfs filesystem component in C. Rewriting it in
Rust would be a large amount of work and requires a lot of bindings to
the file system interfaces. Binderfs has not historically had the same
challenges with security and complexity, so rewriting binderfs seems to
have lower value than the rest of Binder.

Correctness and feature parity
------------------------------

Rust binder passes all tests that validate the correctness of Binder in
the Android Open Source Project. We can boot a device, and run a variety
of apps and functionality without issues. We have performed this both on
the Cuttlefish Android emulator device, and on a Pixel 6 Pro.

As for feature parity, Rust binder currently implements all features
that C binder supports, with the exception of some debugging facilities.
The missing debugging facilities will be added before we submit the Rust
implementation upstream.

Performance numbers
-------------------

We have tested the driver using two different benchmarks:
binderThroughputTest [3] and binderRpcBenchmark [4]. These benchmarks
show that the Rust implementation has very promising performance
characteristics. That said, these are only microbenchmarks with very
simple workloads, and there is still a lot of work to be done before we
can truly understand how the drivers compare in the real world.

These tables depict roundtrip latencies of transactions as measured by
binderThroughputTest. Each measurement is given in microseconds. Each

better for Rust.

We&#39;ve found that Rust binder has similar performance to C binder on the
binderThroughputTest benchmark. The average latencies fluctuate between
-1.96% and +1.38%.

This table depicts wall clock time and cpu time measurements over
various test cases. Each measurement is given in microseconds. The
throughput benchmarks correspond to the
BM_throughputForTransportAndBytes test case, and the number is the size
of the payload. Negative percentages are better for Rust.

From the above, we find that Rust binder is competitive for all test
cases except for those with very large transaction sizes. However, this
is a very rare case in practice [5] and we&#39;ve been able to fix all other
performance issues that we&#39;ve run into, so there&#39;s no reason to think
that we won&#39;t also be able to fix this issue. We did not fix it for this
RFC because we prioritized getting the RFC out to provide context for
the upcoming discussion at Linux Plumbers Conference [6].

We ran all of the benchmarks with cross-language LTO enabled, so that C
code can be inlined into Rust code. We get similar results on the
Cuttlefish Android emulator (which has an x86 architecture).

The Binder driver is very performance critical, and although our initial
numbers are promising, we must gain a better understanding of how it
performs in realistic workloads and not just in simple benchmarks. What
we ultimately care about is the performance impact that it has on the
whole system. Much work remains to be done on this front.

Dependencies
------------

When implementing kernel drivers in Rust, you must write bindings for
each subsystem that we need to call into from Rust. Binder requires
quite a few of them. We have not included them in this patch series, but
you can view them at the following branch:

<a href="https://github.com/Darksonn/linux/commits/rust-binder-rfc">https://github.com/Darksonn/linux/commits/rust-binder-rfc</a>

The branch is based on top of commit 639409a4ac8e (&#34;Merge tag
&#39;wq-for-6.7-rust-bindings&#39; of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/wq&#34;),
which is available in mainline. I did not base it on a tag, since there
is not yet any tag that includes the Rust workqueue abstractions.

This RFC uses the kernel&#39;s red-black tree for key/value mappings, but we
are aware that the red-black tree is deprecated. We did this to make the
performance comparison more fair, since C binder also uses rbtree for
this. We intend to replace these with XArrays instead. That said, we
don&#39;t think that XArray is a good fit for the range allocator, and we
propose to continue using the red-black tree for the range allocator.
(see patch 6)
