<p data-block-key="sjn9t">This past weekend in New York City, the weather&#39;s oscillated in and out of crispness, sun and breeze cordially nudging each other out of the way. Talking with a newer volunteer at <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2025/you-can-just-show-up/">the outreach table I run</a>, I said we were in a liminal moment vis-Ã -vis the free candy we hand out.</p><p data-block-key="2uh2a">A little pack of candy works as a paperweight, and as a treat for a little kid or a fellow canvasser or someone who&#39;s having a hard day. (A key rule for the table: Always check with a child&#39;s parents before offering them candy. Parents know kids&#39; dietary restrictions, and we <b>really</b> don&#39;t want the optics of &#34;political activists manipulate children with free candy behind parents&#39; backs.&#34;) I don&#39;t give some to everyone who stops by, so one big bag of bite-sized sweets usually lasts a couple of months.</p><p data-block-key="bci2l">When I started giving away candy in April or May, it was chilly enough that chocolate worked. (Mini Snickers bars, cheap stuff like that, <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-favorites-candy-variety-90-oz.product.4000379649.html">$20 for a 5.6-pound bag</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="3ikg7">As weather warmed up, sometimes the chocolate got melty. I switched to tiny packs of gummy bears. This past weekend, I brought both, starting with chocolates and then switching to gummy bears when I picked up a Hershey&#39;s and felt the squish. But soon the chill will keep the chocolate solid.</p><p data-block-key="be1hl">After my brief explanation, the newer volunteer said, with some wonder, that I seemed as excited about the candy as I did about the issue advocacy. Like, I spoke with as much passion about candy strategy as I did about defending civil rights.</p><p data-block-key="am7j0">A few hours later, considering this, I realized: this person met me through the outreach table, and thus, understood my demeanor through the lens of activism. <i>But I am just like this all the time.</i> The level of intensity in my voice and body language in a small group conversation when I discuss a system, instruct learners, share advice, or advocate for a better way forward, is generally not what observers would call &#34;laid-back&#34; or &#34;chill.&#34; It&#39;s not as high as it gets in an argument or a lecture-style speech. But it&#39;s there.</p><p data-block-key="37oe9">Sometimes I have overheard (or, occasionally, received) advice like &#34;take it easy&#34; or &#34;stay in your lane&#34; or &#34;don&#39;t get so personally invested&#34; or &#34;chill out.&#34; I have learned to translate them into terms that make sense in my head, such as &#34;the way you are expressing your concerns is making other people feel bad (scared/disgusted/defensive)&#34; or &#34;you are unlikely to win in this conflict, and you are in danger of reducing your credibility and capability for other future negotiations with the same people.&#34;</p><p data-block-key="8qfl9">But there is a part of that advice that can come across as: <b>feel less, on command</b>. And I chafe at that, because it takes time to properly deal with intense emotion, to learn what it&#39;s trying to say. I know (some) how to work through difficult feelings, how to reflect on them, sift and look underneath them for hidden layers, temper them with broader perspectives. It takes patience and a kind of partnership between the part of myself that is intensely feeling and the part of myself that can listen nonjudgmentally. It takes time and trust.</p><p data-block-key="890rj">That same skill comes in to play when de-escalating conflict with strangers.</p><p data-block-key="3rt24">When I&#39;m helping new volunteers learn how to do outreach at the table, I say that rule #1 is to ask parents before giving a kid candy, and rule #2 is that if we receive hostility, we don&#39;t return it. I do not insult someone for disagreeing with us, even if they are rude.</p><p data-block-key="cr4t7">Maybe 1 or 2 times per day while tabling, a stranger&#39;s actively antagonistic (out of maybe 500-1,000 interactions over 6-7 hours). If they disagree in a passing comment as they walk by, rude or not: maybe I respond with a calm fact-based rejoinder, or silence. If a stranger disagrees with me within a conversation, I try to ask questions to better understand their point of view, and to better shape what to say back. If they just aren&#39;t going to change their mind, maybe I begin to bring the conversation to a close, or maybe I switch the topic to another issue where the coalition of people on my side is likely broader. (For example: even if you disagree with me about public safety, you probably <a href="https://www.queensforall.com/">don&#39;t want a casino in the neighborhood</a>.) Getting their help on that would still be useful.</p><p data-block-key="b6vb3">Pragmatically, ideologically, spiritually: having control of my response means I can <b>choose</b> how I come across. Approximately always, choosing to avoid insulting or shouting at the visitor suits my goals, avoids sounding awful in case someone posts an out-of-context video, and better meets my standards for who I want to be.</p><p data-block-key="ec16g">It&#39;s better to do this work with at least one other person present. And part of why is so they can notice if a conversation with a visitor is getting under my skin and I&#39;m reacting heatedly -- or so I can do that for my fellow volunteer, and help de-escalate. And the irritation can show up faster than one consciously notices. At least twice at the table, someone&#39;s realized that a reason a conversation really bothered them was that the other person looked or sounded like a difficult family member -- a condescending uncle, a bigoted grandma. The kind of echo that one only notices after the irritation&#39;s set in.</p><p data-block-key="9qigr">I&#39;ve spent a lot of words discussing those interactions, but, as I said, they&#39;re rare. Most of these hours we&#39;re getting the word out to people who substantively already agree with us, having informative and supportive conversations, sometimes being ignored by passers-by, chatting amongst ourselves, and seeing cute dogs. If I see someone in an awesome outfit I will compliment it regardless of whether or not they stop to talk with us. It usually doesn&#39;t get them to stop for a chat or take a leaflet. That&#39;s fine. The admiration is independent of the outreach; it is me genuinely reveling in the beauty my neighbor has brought into my life.</p><p data-block-key="d98de">Every week I learn a little more about how to do this work. A local organization with a resource to print and distribute, a more effective opening line or a specific wording that gracefully avoids bad assumptions, a better flyer layout.</p><p data-block-key="1dd6n">Scissors are useful to bring for slicing up half- and quarter-page flyers. Another reason to bring candy is so we&#39;re less tempted to briefly use the scissors as a paperweight. I take them out of the tote bag to use them and then stow them away when done. I do not leave them where a stranger could grab them.</p><p data-block-key="8nqdj">Those are two of the images of this ritual that stay with me, then, along with the cute dogs and the stacks of handouts and the colors of the streetscape: scissors and candy. Tools to cut and to connect.</p>
