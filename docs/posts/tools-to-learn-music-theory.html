    <h1>Ask HN: Tools to learn music theory?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I started to learn the piano 1.5 year ago, as an adult who never studied music before.</p><p>It is a slow, peaceful journey and there is no silver bullet: practicing is the key for improvement.</p><p>I have a weekly class for music theory, which I enjoy a lot. What I seem to be a slow learner at is reading notes fast (treble and bass clef), and remembering the theory and logic behind the tones.</p><p>I don&#39;t practice much music theory outside the class. I consider building paper flashcards because music paper is quite specific.</p><p>What is your experience?
What process or tool would you recommend to learn music theory?</p><p>PS: sorry if some words feel weird, music vocabulary is so different between French and English</p></div></div></div>
