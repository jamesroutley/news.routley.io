    <h1>LLMs: Spot-On &amp; Off-Target</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
<p>
I want to offer the framing I try to take on interactions with
products like ChatGPT and Claude that help me make sense of moments of
surprise, both positive and negative, or spot-on and off-target<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
The first is that these products do <em>natural language search</em> that you
can not always count on (in contrast to <em>key-word search</em>). If they’ve
seen <em>enough content</em> on a thing, and <em>decent content</em> on a thing,
then they will give you <em>more content</em> on a thing. That’s it. If they
have not, they’ll respond with anything that’s related, even if it
makes no sense at all in relation to your request! They can not tell
when they’re wrong. That’s an off-target moment: a response with
content that’s peripheral, goes off on a tangent, or the opposite
angle. <strong>Is it wrong or just retrieval gone somewhat wrong?</strong> How
about a spot-on moment? Those “net new” discoveries people claim they
have made that eluded a field for decades but turns out were hidden in
plain sight<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, for example, in these instances it simply spliced
content for parts A-B from source S, with content for parts D-E from
source T, with yet more content for parts F-J from source U, to get
you from part A in your request to part J in the response. <strong>Is that a
discovery or just fancy retrieval?</strong></p>
<p>
The second is that these products are translators. We’ve had
DSLs, compilers, and source to source translators of various quality
for eons. We’ve had natural language translation for a decade at
least. These products will translate from natural language to code, or
from code to natural language, or indeed from one programming language
to another. They can do this more arbitrarily than anything we’ve seen
before (at least to my knowledge). “Product” people often point to the
idea that they use these products to generate or translate (the code
for) an artifact from a big long (perhaps incomplete and buggy)
specification. <strong>Is that software development, product development, or
just translation?</strong> I wrote the opening sentence in my <a href="https://joseph.yiasemides.com/posts/how-i-prompt">first
post</a> hypothetically, but it seems these products
really <em>have</em> become the primary way some people in some professions
interact with computers.</p>
<p>
Natural language is just one angle at any phenomenon<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. Others
include formulae, diagrams, tables, code, etc. <strong>Have these products
(finally) made natural language (a bit) more tractable for computers
or just made the content on the WWW more easily but not reliably
accessible<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>?</strong></p>
<p>
These aren’t informed by data. They’re simply the framing and
questions I use to help me make some sense of my own experience,
others’s experience, and the chasm between the two. I hope they help
anyone else who are equally baffled.</p>
