    <h1>Ask HN: What are 100K dollar ideas but not million dollar ideas?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Forget about billion dollar ideas, I am not even interested in working on million dollar ideas. There are multiple ideas or projects which are left because they don&#39;t have potential to scale. They are very specific to a niche set of customers or teams. Many people wanted to work on the solution but dropped off as they had bigger fishes to fry or knew the idea wouldn&#39;t scale. But the idea would scale up to a certain limit.</p><p>e.g. https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/man-who-built-isp-instead-of-paying-comcast-50k-expands-to-hundreds-of-homes/</p><p>I believe that every village needs to solve their own problem and and may be in a different way(based upon the resources they have) as the external help may not arrive. The solution also need not go to cities as it is very specific to the village. This man got a project working after passing the initial inertia. His company may not scale beyond a certain limit but I guess that&#39;s okay.</p><p>What do you think would be those kind of ideas?</p></div></div></div>
