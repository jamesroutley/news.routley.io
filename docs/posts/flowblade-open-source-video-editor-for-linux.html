&#34;I found flowblade and I love it.  I edit movies 2 to 3 hours in length with many video clips.  What is a great help is the way the clips snap together, especially when I am deleting and editing out bad video and moving video around.&#34;, dnsXXXXX

&#34;We - that is a group of German students and me - are currently shooting a movie for a school project, and after trying a few solutions we ended
up choosing Flowblade.&#34;,&#34;.. From then it worked well - no more crashes! A lot of filters I
actually thought flowblade was simply lacking are available now. Thank you for your support - Flowblade rocks!&#34;, R.W, Germany

&#34;I&#39;m a professional video editor and director who is working from more than 15 years for the main broadcasters here in Italy...[Flowblade is] already showing it&#39;s great potential because it looks like it has been thought by someone who knows what editors need for real.&#34;, M.S, Italy
