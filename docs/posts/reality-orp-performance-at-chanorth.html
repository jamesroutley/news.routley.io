                This past Saturday, Andrei and I performed as
                <a href="https://palomakop.tv/art/reality-orp">REALITY ORP</a> on an outdoor stage
                at the
                <a href="https://www.chanorth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChaNorth</a>
                Residency Space in Upstate NY. As part of Upstate Arts Week,
                ChaNorth held an edition of
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weirdmusicnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird Music Night</a>, a usually-New-Haven-based showcase, organized and hosted by
                <a href="https://www.johnodonnellprojects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John O&#39;Donnell</a>. At this edition, there were eight total acts running
                throughout the evening, including Hudson-based artist duo
                <a href="https://spyrodon.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spyrodon</a>. On the same site, there were also open studios for the
                current artists in residence at ChaNorth, and a sculpture
                exhibition in the surrounding woods curated by
                <a href="https://www.paradicepalase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradice Palace</a>
                featuring a cool
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNXcfuu4YD/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sculpture</a>
                by our friend Jonathan Sims.

                We had a great time performing and hanging out with friends in
                the field as the sun went down. It was the sweet kind of summer
                show where people are sitting on blankets and there are random
                dogs running around among the audience. We were requested to
                park our van in the grass right next to the stage for Aesthetic
                Reasons.

                We played after dark, and with the lack of outdoor lighting most
                of our photos were unsalvageable, but we did get this pic of
                John as a ghost in front of our van:
