    <h1>A German ISP tampered with their DNS – specifically to sabotage my website</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>One of Germany&#39;s biggest ISPs changed how their DNS works, right after I exposed an organization that they’re part of.</p>
            </section><article>
                <h2>My website: Publishing Germany&#39;s secret internet blocklist</h2>
<p>In Germany, we have the <em>Clearingstelle Urheberrecht im Internet</em> (CUII) - literally &#39;Copyright Clearinghouse for the Internet&#39;, 
a private organization that decides what websites to block, corporate interests rewriting our free internet.
No judges, no transparency, just a bunch of ISPs and major copyright holders deciding what your eyes can see.</p>
<h2>Yet another slip-up by the CUII</h2>
<p>This week, Netzpolitik.org published an article about the CUII&#39;s latest blunder<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, based on information I gathered. 
They managed to block domains that no longer even existed: websites that had already been seized and taken offline when they were blocked.
It&#39;s not the first time the CUII has tripped over its own feet, and this mistake likely didn’t sit well with them.
In the past, it was <em>really</em> easy to find out if a domain was blocked by the CUII.
If you asked an ISP&#39;s DNS server (basically the internet&#39;s phone book) for a site and got a CNAME to <code>notice.cuii.info</code>, you knew it was blocked.</p>
<p>On cuiiliste.de, anyone can enter a domain, and see if it is blocked by the CUII, and which ISPs block it specifically.</p>
<h3>I get a new visitor</h3>
<p>Telefonica modified their DNS servers, specifically saying that <code>blau-sicherheit.info</code> was blocked by the CUII.
At 11:06 AM last Friday, someone from Telefonica&#39;s network checked if <code>blau-sicherheit.info</code> was blocked on my site. 
The twist? Telefonica seems to own this domain. Blau is one of their brands<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, and <code>blau-sicherheit.info</code> wasn’t some piracy hub -
it appears to be a test domain of theirs. 
My tool flagged it as blocked because Telefonica&#39;s DNS servers said so. 
Why would they block their own domain?</p>

To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li> Telefonica blocks their own domain</li>
<li> Someone from Telefonica visits my website to check if I detect this</li>
<li> I <i>do</i> in fact detect this</li>
</ul>
<h3>Telefonica modifies how their blocking works... to mess specifically with my website</h3>
<p>Two hours after this suspicious query, I was bombarded with Notifications. 
My program thought that the CUII had suddenly unblocked hundreds of domains.</p>
<h3>Why sabotage my website?</h3>
<p>The timing is more than suspicious. 
Right after Netzpolitik’s article exposed the CUII for blocking non-existent domains, they make it harder to track their mistakes. 
Coincidence? Or a move to bury future slip-ups? 
We can only speculate.
Regardless of intent, the result is the same: less transparency and harder oversight. And that benefits the CUII, not the public.  </p>
<p>In this context, Netzpolitik.org released another article (German):
