    <h1>Ask HN: What have you built with LLMs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Curious what people have been building with LLMs.</p><p>I worked on a chrome extension a few weeks ago that skips sponsorship sections in YouTube videos by reading through the transcript. Also was trying to experiment with an LLM to explain a function call chain across languages (in this case MakeFile, Python, Bash). I&#39;ve tried running a few telegram bots that are PRE prompted to do certain things like help you with taxes.</p><p>What are you building?</p><p>What does the stack look like? How do you deploy it?</p></div></div></div>
