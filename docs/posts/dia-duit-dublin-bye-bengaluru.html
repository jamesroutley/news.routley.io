<p>When I was in final year of college, I had to choose job location preferences over Chennai and Bengaluru. I choose Bengaluru for two reasons - startups and weather. After working a decade and a year in Bengaluru over seven companies, I decided to leave the startup scene, city, and the country.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my stay in Bengaluru. I spent half a decade building the python community in Bengaluru (of course with immense support from everyone), and felt every second was a complete worth it. Furthermore, I made a lot of acquaintances and some friends. My world view changed every couple of years. I have puzzled at my own beliefs and opinions over time.</p>
<p>I’m happy to call Bengaluru my home and happy being a houseplant. Before leaving the city, I wrote  a <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking/status/1546795418079883264?s=21&amp;t=sVruBcsejUChvX0AVJ5A4g">semi-satirical tweets</a> how to survive in Bangalore. It kind of went viral.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>You measure the distance in time on the road
Like life is measured in memories.

You measure the best day by
the quietness of the day and
sipping hot tea
yet looking for your cup of tea.

There are roads and gates you can pass through
But you will never belong there.
There are hands you can never hold
But you can cross the shadow.

There are times when clock moved backwards
And day is dark in the broad daylight,
smokes when nothing was lit
yet you kept moving forwards
you’re tall and short at the same time.
