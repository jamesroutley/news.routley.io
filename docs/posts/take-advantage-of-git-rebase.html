<p>These days, developers spend a lot of time reviewing merge requests
and taking these reviews into account to improve the code. We&#39;ll discuss how
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">Git rebase</a> can help in
speeding up these review cycles. But first, let&#39;s take a look at some
workflow considerations.</p>
<h2 id="different-ways-to-rework-a-merge-request">Different ways to rework a merge request</h2>
<p>A developer who worked on some code changes and created a merge
request with these changes will often have to rework them. Why does
this happen? Tests can fail, bugs are found, or reviewers suggest
improvements and find shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="simple-but-messy-method-add-more-commits">Simple but messy method: add more commits</h3>
<p>One way to rework the code changes is to make more changes in some new
commits on top of the branch that was used to create the merge
request, and then push the branch again to update the merge
request.</p>
<p>When a number of commits have been added in this way, the merge
request becomes problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s difficult to review by looking at all the changes together.</li>
<li>It&#39;s difficult to review the commits separately as they may contain different unrelated changes, or even multiple reworks of the same code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers find it easier to review changes split into a number of small,
self-contained commits that can be reviewed individually.</p>
<h3 id="pro-method-rebase">Pro method: rebase!</h3>
<p>A better method to prepare or rework a merge request is to always
ensure that each commit contains small, self-contained, easy-to-review
changes.</p>
<p>This means that all the commits in the branch may need reworking
instead of stacking on yet more commits. This approach might seem much
more complex and tedious, but <code>git rebase</code> comes to the rescue!</p>
<h2 id="rework-your-commits-with-git-rebase">Rework your commits with <code>git rebase</code></h2>
<p>If your goal is to build a merge request from a series of small,
self-contained commits, your branch may need significant rework before its
commits are good enough. When the commits are ready, you can push the branch
and update or create a merge request with this branch.</p>
<h3 id="start-an-interactive-rebase">Start an interactive rebase</h3>
<p>If your branch is based on <code>main</code>, the command to rework your branch
is:</p>

<p>I encourage you to create <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases">a Git alias</a>,
or a shell alias or function for this command right away, as you will
use it very often.</p>
<p>The <code>-i</code> option passed to <code>git rebase</code> is an alias for
<code>--interactive</code>. It starts
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---interactive">an &#39;interactive&#39; rebase</a>
which will open your editor. In it, you will find a list of the
commits in your branch followed by commented-out lines beginning with
<code>#</code>. The list of commits looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>pick 1aac632db2 first commit subject
pick a385014ad4 second commit subject
pick 6af12a88cf other commit subject
pick 5cd121e2a1 last commit subject
</code></pre></div>
<p>These lines are instructions for how <code>git rebase</code> should handle these
commits. The commits are listed in chronological order, with the
oldest commit at the top. (This order is the opposite of the default
<code>git log</code> order.) What do these lines contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>An instruction (here, <code>pick</code>) that tells Git what action to take</li>
<li>An abbreviated commit ID</li>
<li>A commit subject to help you identify the commit contents</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edit-the-instruction-list">Edit the instruction list</h3>
<p>You can edit these instructions! When you quit your text editor, <code>git rebase</code>
reads the instructions you&#39;ve just edited, and performs them
in sequence to recreate your branch the way you want.</p>
<p>After the instructions for all commits, a set of commented-out lines
explain how to edit the instruction lines, and how each instruction
will change your branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you <strong>delete a commit&#39;s entire instruction line</strong> from the list,
that commit won&#39;t be recreated.</li>
<li>If you <strong>reorder the instruction lines</strong>, the commits will be
recreated in the order you specify.</li>
<li>If you <strong>change the action</strong> from <code>pick</code> to something else, such as
<code>squash</code> or <code>reword</code>, Git performs the action you specify on that
commit.</li>
<li>You can even <strong>add new instruction lines</strong> before, after, or between
existing lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the comment lines aren&#39;t enough, more information about what you
can do and how it works is available in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">Git Tools - Rewriting History</a>
section of the &#34;Pro Git&#34; book</li>
<li>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode">Interactive mode</a>
section of the <code>git rebase</code> documentation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continue-or-abort-the-rebase">Continue or abort the rebase</h3>
<p>An interactive rebase can stop if there is a conflict (as a regular
rebase would) or if you used an instruction like <code>edit</code> in the
instruction line. This allows you to make some changes, like splitting
the current commit into two commits, or fixing the rebase conflict if
there is one. You can then either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue the interactive rebase with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</li>
<li>Abort the rebase altogether with <code>git rebase --abort</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(These <code>git rebase</code> options also work when a regular, non-interactive
rebase stops.)</p>
<h2 id="further-tips-and-benefits">Further tips and benefits</h2>
<h3 id="try-different-instructions">Try different instructions</h3>
<p>I recommend you try out the different instructions you can use in
each instruction line, especially <code>reword</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>squash</code>, and <code>fixup</code>. You&#39;ll
soon want to use the abbreviated versions of these instructions: <code>r</code>,
<code>e</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>f</code>.</p>
<h3 id="run-shell-commands-in-your-rebase">Run shell commands in your rebase</h3>
<p>You might also have noticed an <code>exec &lt;command&gt;</code> instruction that
allows you to run any shell command at any point in the interactive rebase.
I&#39;ve found it more useful for non-interactive rebases, such as:</p>
<div><pre><code>git rebase --exec &#39;make test&#39; main
</code></pre></div>
<p>(It&#39;s not an interactive rebase because it doesn&#39;t contain the <code>-i</code> flag.)</p>
<p>The <code>--exec &lt;command&gt;</code> flag allows you to run any shell command after
each rebased commit, stopping if the shell command fails (which is
signaled by a non zero exit code).</p>
<h3 id="test-all-your-commits">Test all your commits</h3>
<p>Passing a command to build your software and run its tests, like
<code>make test</code>, to <code>--exec</code> will check that each commit in your branch
builds correctly and passes your tests.</p>
<p>If <code>make test</code> fails, the rebase stops. You can then fix the current
commit right away, and continue the rebase to test the next
commits.</p>
<p>Checking each commit builds cleanly and passes all the tests ensures
your code base is always in a good state. It&#39;s especially useful if
you want to take advantage of
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">Git bisect</a> when you encounter
regressions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Git, a rebase is a very versatile and useful tool to rework
commits. Use it to achieve a workflow with high-quality changes
proposed in high-quality commits and merge requests. It makes your
developers and reviewers more efficient. Code reviews and debugging also become easier and more effective.</p>
