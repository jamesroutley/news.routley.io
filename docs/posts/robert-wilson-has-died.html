    <h1>Robert Wilson has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p itemprop="text">Robert Wilson, a visionary artist best known for his highly visual and stylised approach to theatrical performances, has died, aged 83. According to a statement released by the Watermill Center, the arts organisation he founded in Water Mill, New York, Wilson died at his home there on Thursday (31 July) following “a brief but acute illness”.</p><p itemprop="text">“While facing his diagnosis with clear eyes and determination, he still felt compelled to keep working and creating right up until the very end,” the statement notes. “His works for the stage, on paper, sculptures and video portraits, as well as The Watermill Center, will endure as Robert Wilson’s artistic legacy.”</p><p itemprop="text">Wilson was one of the most critically distinguished and distinctive directors and playwrights of the past half-century. His original productions—including the “silent opera” <em>Deafman Glance</em> (1970) and his canonic, epic collaboration with the composer Philip Glass, <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> (1976)—are in frequent production at theatres, opera houses and festivals around the world. As are his adaptations of classical works by Bertolt Brecht, William Shakespeare, Samuel Beckett, Virginia Woolf and others.</p><p itemprop="text">His works for the stage were known for a stylised dramaturgy that rejected naturalism. They drew on a wide range of musical collaborators from Glass to Tom Waits and Lou Reed, as well as performance modes drawn from silent film, mime and more. Their bold visual aesthetic typically involved sleek, minimalist stages and imaginative uses of lighting and projection.</p><p itemprop="text">“I very often stage a work—whether it’s <em>The Ring</em> of Wagner or <em>Hamlet—</em>visually first, and then later I add text,” he told <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/17/robert-wilson-theatre-ubu-roi" target="_blank">The Guardian<span><svg fill="currentColor" stroke="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" viewBox="0 0 24 24" x="0px" y="0px"><g><path d="M22.8,0h-7.6c-0.6,0-1.1,0.5-1.1,1.1s0.5,1.1,1.1,1.1h5.1L9.4,13.1c-0.4,0.4-0.4,1.1,0,1.6c0.2,0.2,0.5,0.3,0.8,0.3s0.6-0.1,0.8-0.3L21.7,3.9v4.8c0,0.6,0.5,1.1,1.1,1.1S24,9.4,24,8.8V1.1C24,0.5,23.5,0,22.8,0z"></path><path d="M19,11.2c-0.6,0-1.1,0.5-1.1,1.1V21c0,0.4-0.3,0.7-0.7,0.7H3c-0.4,0-0.7-0.3-0.7-0.7V6.9c0-0.4,0.3-0.7,0.7-0.7h8.8c0.6,0,1.1-0.5,1.1-1.1s-0.5-1.1-1.1-1.1H3c-1.6,0-3,1.3-3,3V21c0,1.6,1.3,3,3,3h14.1c1.6,0,3-1.3,3-3v-8.8C20.1,11.7,19.6,11.2,19,11.2z"></path></g></svg></span></a> </em>in 2022. “The visual book is as important as the audio.”</p><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="644" height="435.988" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/ad26f0ee9d43a63222de07716770a55198699638-2000x1354.jpg?rect=1,0,1999,1354&amp;w=750&amp;h=508&amp;q=85&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 1x, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/ad26f0ee9d43a63222de07716770a55198699638-2000x1354.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1300&amp;q=85&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 2x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/ad26f0ee9d43a63222de07716770a55198699638-2000x1354.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1300&amp;q=85&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format"/><figcaption><p>A scene from a 2012 staging of Robert Wilson and Philip Glass&#39;s <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> (1976) <span>Photo © Lucie Jansch</span></p></figcaption></figure><p itemprop="text">Some of Wilson’s stage projects are also known for their incredibly long durations; <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> stretches to nearly five hours, and attendees are encouraged to come and go at their leisure throughout the performance.

Those videos were shown alongside an installation of around 700 works from Wilson’s personal collection. Subsequent works in the <em>Video Portraits </em>series include portraits of the artists Pope.L and Zhang Huan, as well as the actors Isabella Rossellini, Brad Pitt and Winona Ryder.</p><p itemprop="text">In 2011, Wilson collaborated with the performance artist Marina Abramović on the semi-biographical stage production <em>The Life and Death of Marina Abramović</em>, which premiered at the Manchester International Festival and was subsequently produced at the Park Avenue Armory in New York.

After dropping out of his business administration studies at the University of Texas in Austin, Wilson moved to Brooklyn and studied interior design and architecture at Pratt Institute, graduating with a BFA in 1965. Before the end of the decade he had assembled a group of performers—the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds, in homage to his childhood dance instructor—and begun staging performances in New York City.</p><p itemprop="text">In 1992, he founded the Watermill Center, a visual and performing arts center on the South Fork of Long Island.
