<p>Hey Kris,</p>
<p>maybe you can’t fight the wind and win but thank you for fighting it nonetheless for us all and reminding us that a different world is possible. And who knows, maybe in a fucked up future humanity will need your articles more than you realize now. Anyway, keep up the good fight!</p>
<p>Thank you
Michael</p>
