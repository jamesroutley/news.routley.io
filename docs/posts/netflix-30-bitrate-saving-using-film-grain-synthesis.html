		Also, non AV1 streams can benefit from a High-Fidelity Noise Management with the same bitrate savings. For broadcast we often disabled the denoising functionally in the hardware encoders because the results blurred out. Splitting noise form image content is still a heavy signal processing task, with thousands of lines highly optimized code. But today scalable and High-Fidelity Video Noise Management solutions are available.
For the picture quality measurement, we should apply metrices like VMAF on the denoised but not on the re-grained video material. Otherwise there will be a risk that encoding artefacts will be hidden by the grain and noise amplitudes. 
Itâ€™s great to see that the video encoding community is paying attention to this important fact that the video noise behavior is an important point in the video delivery chain of the future.
