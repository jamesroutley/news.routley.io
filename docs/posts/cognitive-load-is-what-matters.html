<p dir="auto">There are so many buzzwords and best practices out there, but most of them have failed. We need something more fundamental, something that can&#39;t be wrong.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes we feel confusion going through the code. Confusion costs time and money. Confusion is caused by high <em>cognitive load</em>. It&#39;s not some fancy abstract concept, but rather <strong>a fundamental human constraint</strong>. It&#39;s not imagined, it&#39;s there and we can feel it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since we spend far more time reading and understanding code than writing it, we should constantly ask ourselves whether we are embedding excessive cognitive load into our code.</p>

<p dir="auto">Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to complete a task.</p>

<p dir="auto">When reading code, you put things like values of variables, control flow logic and call sequences into your head. The average person can hold roughly <a href="https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load/issues/16" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/zakirullin/cognitive-load/issues/16/hovercard">four such chunks</a> in working memory. Once the cognitive load reaches this threshold, it becomes much harder to understand things.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Let&#39;s say we have been asked to make some fixes to a completely unfamiliar project. We were told that a really smart developer had contributed to it. Lots of cool architectures, fancy libraries and trendy technologies were used. In other words, <strong>the author had created a high cognitive load for us.</strong></em></p>

<p dir="auto">Having too many shallow modules can make it difficult to understand the project. <strong>Not only do we have to keep in mind each module responsibilities, but also all their interactions</strong>. To understand the purpose of a shallow module, we first need to look at the functionality of all the related modules. Jumping between such shallow components is mentally exhausting, <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-09-11-linear-code.html" rel="nofollow">linear thinking</a> is more natural to us humans.</p>

<p dir="auto">Information hiding is paramount, and we don&#39;t hide as much complexity in shallow modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I have two pet projects, both of them are somewhat 5K lines of code. The first one has 80 shallow classes, whereas the second one has only 7 deep classes. I haven&#39;t been maintaining any of these projects for one year and a half.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once I came back, I realised that it was extremely difficult to untangle all the interactions between those 80 classes in the first project. I would have to rebuild an enormous amount of cognitive load before I could start coding. On the other hand, I was able to grasp the second project quickly, because it had only a few deep classes with a simple interface.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="open(path, flags, permissions)
read(fd, buffer, count)
write(fd, buffer, count)
lseek(fd, offset, referencePosition)
close(fd)"><pre><span>open</span>(<span>path</span>, <span>flags</span>, <span>permissions</span>)
<span>read</span>(<span>fd</span>, <span>buffer</span>, <span>count</span>)

<span>lseek</span>(<span>fd</span>, <span>offset</span>, <span>referencePosition</span>)
<span>close</span>(<span>fd</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A modern implementation of this interface has <strong>hundreds of thousands of lines of code</strong>. Lots of complexity is hidden under the hood. Yet it is easy to use due to its simple interface.</p>

<p dir="auto">All too often, we end up creating lots of shallow modules, following some vague &#34;a module should be responsible for one, and only one, thing&#34; principle. What is this blurry one thing? Instantiating an object is one thing, right? So <a href="https://minds.md/benji/frameworks" rel="nofollow">MetricsProviderFactoryFactory</a> seems to be just fine. <strong>The names and interfaces of such classes tend to be more mentally taxing than their entire implementations, what kind of abstraction is that?</strong> Something went wrong.</p>
<p dir="auto">We make changes to our systems to satisfy our users and stakeholders. We are responsible to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is what this Single Responsibility Principle is all about. Simply put, if we introduce a bug in one place, and then two different business people come to complain, we&#39;ve violated the principle. It has nothing to do with the number of things we do in our module.</p>
<p dir="auto">But even now, this rule can do more harm than good. This principle can be understood in as many different ways as there are individuals. A better approach would be to look at how much cognitive load it all creates. It&#39;s mentally demanding to remember that change in one place can trigger a chain of reactions across different business streams. And that&#39;s about it, no fancy terms to learn.</p>

<p dir="auto">This shallow-deep module principle is scale-agnostic, and we can apply it to microservices architecture. Too many shallow microservices won&#39;t do any good - the industry is heading towards somewhat &#34;macroservices&#34;, i.e., services that are not so shallow (=deep). One of the worst and hardest to fix phenomena is so-called distributed monolith, which is often the result of this overly granular shallow separation.</p>
<p dir="auto">I once consulted a startup where a team of five developers introduced 17(!) microservices. They were 10 months behind schedule and appeared nowhere close to the public release. Every new requirement led to changes in 4+ microservices. It took an enormous amount of time to reproduce and debug an issue in such a distributed system. Both time to market and cognitive load were unacceptably high. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Is this the right way to approach the uncertainty of a new system? It&#39;s enormously difficult to elicit the right logical boundaries in the beginning. The key is to make decisions as late as you can responsibly wait, because that is when you have the most information at hand. By introducing a network layer up front, we make our design decisions hard to revert right from the start. The team&#39;s only justification was: &#34;The FAANG companies proved microservices architecture to be effective&#34;. <em>Hello, you got to stop dreaming big.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate" rel="nofollow">Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate</a> argued that Linux&#39;s monolithic design was flawed and obsolete, and that a microkernel architecture should be used instead. Indeed, the microkernel design seemed to be superior &#34;from a theoretical and aesthetical&#34; point of view. On the practical side of things - three decades on, microkernel-based GNU Hurd is still in development, and monolithic Linux is everywhere. This page is powered by Linux, your smart teapot is powered by Linux. By monolithic Linux.</p>
<p dir="auto">A well-crafted monolith with truly isolated modules is often much more flexible than a bunch of microservices. It also requires far less cognitive effort to maintain. It&#39;s only when the need for separate deployments becomes crucial, such as scaling the development team, that you should consider adding a network layer between the modules, future microservices.</p>

<p dir="auto">On the backend we return:</p>
<p dir="auto">The engineers on the frontend use backend API to implement login functionality. They would have to temporarily create the following cognitive load in their brains:</p>
<p dir="auto">Frontend developers would (hopefully) introduce some kind <code>numeric status -&gt; meaning</code> dictionary on their side, so that subsequent generations of contributors wouldn&#39;t have to recreate this mapping in their brains.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then QA engineers come into play:
&#34;Hey, I got <code>403</code> status, is that expired token or not enough access?&#34;
<strong>QA engineers can&#39;t jump straight to testing, because first they have to recreate the cognitive load that the engineers on the backend once created.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Why hold this custom mapping in our working memory? It&#39;s better to abstract away your business details from the HTTP transfer protocol, and return self-descriptive codes directly in the response body:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
    &#34;code&#34;: &#34;jwt_has_expired&#34;

}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Cognitive load on the frontend side: <code>🧠</code> (fresh, no facts are held in mind)</p>
<p dir="auto">The same rule applies to all sorts of numeric statuses (in the database or wherever) - <strong>prefer self-describing strings</strong>. We are not in the era of 640K computers to optimise for memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">People spend time arguing between <code>401</code> and <code>403</code>, making decisions based on their own mental models. New developers are coming in, and they need to recreate that thought process. You may have documented the &#34;whys&#34; (ADRs) for your code, helping newcomers to understand the decisions made. But in the end it just doesn&#39;t make any sense. We can separate errors into either user-related or server-related, but apart from that, things are kind of blurry.</p>

<p dir="auto">P.S. It&#39;s often mentally taxing to distinguish between &#34;authentication&#34; and &#34;authorization&#34;.

<p dir="auto">Do not repeat yourself - that is one of the first principles you are taught as a software engineer. It is so deeply embedded in ourselves that we can not stand the fact of a few extra lines of code. Although in general a good and fundamental rule, when overused it leads to the cognitive load we can not handle.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nowadays, everyone builds software based on logically separated components. Often those are distributed among multiple codebases representing separate services. When you strive to eliminate any repetition, you might end up creating tight coupling between unrelated components. As a result changes in one part may have unintended consequences in other seemingly unrelated areas. It can also hinder the ability to replace or modify individual components without impacting the entire system. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto">In fact, the same problem arises even within a single module. You might extract common functionality too early, based on perceived similarities that might not actually exist in the long run. This can result in unnecessary abstractions that are difficult to modify or extend.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rob Pike once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A little copying is better than a little dependency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We are tempted to not reinvent the wheel so strong that we are ready to import large, heavy libraries to use a small function that we could easily write by ourselves.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>All your dependencies are your code.</strong> Going through 10+ levels of stack trace of some imported library and figuring out what went wrong (<em>because things go wrong</em>) is painful.</p>

<p dir="auto">There&#39;s a lot of &#34;magic&#34; in frameworks. By relying too heavily on a framework, <strong>we force all upcoming developers to learn that &#34;magic&#34; first</strong>. It can take months. Even though frameworks enable us to launch MVPs in a matter of days, in the long run they tend to add unnecessary complexity and cognitive load.</p>
<p dir="auto">Worse yet, at some point frameworks can become a significant constraint when faced with a new requirement that just doesn&#39;t fit the architecture. From here onwards people end up forking a framework and maintaining their own custom version. Imagine the amount of cognitive load a newcomer would have to build (i.e. learn this custom framework) in order to deliver any value. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>By no means do we advocate to invent everything from scratch!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">We can write code in a somewhat framework-agnostic way. The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework&#39;s components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion. This would allow new contributors to add value from day one, without the need of going through debris of framework-related complexity first.</p>

<p dir="auto">There is a certain engineering excitement about all this stuff.</p>
<p dir="auto">I myself was a passionate advocate of Hexagonal/Onion Architecture for years. I used it here and there and encouraged other teams to do so. The complexity of our projects went up, the sheer number of files alone had doubled. It felt like we were writing a lot of glue code. On ever changing requirements we had to make changes across multiple layers of abstractions, it all became tedious. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Abstraction is supposed to hide complexity, here it just adds <a href="https://fhur.me/posts/2024/thats-not-an-abstraction" rel="nofollow">indirection</a>. Jumping from call to call to read along and figure out what goes wrong and what is missing is a vital requirement to quickly solve a problem. With this architecture’s layer uncoupling it requires an exponential factor of extra, often disjointed, traces to get to the point where the failure occurs. Every such trace takes space in our limited working memory. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This architecture was something that made intuitive sense at first, but every time we tried applying it to projects it made a lot more harm than good. In the end, we gave it all up in favour of the good old dependency inversion principle. <strong>No port/adapter terms to learn, no unnecessary layers of horizontal abstractions, no extraneous cognitive load.</strong></p>

Changing the storage causes lots of problems, and believe us, having some abstractions for the data access layer is the least of your worries.

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We did a storage migration, and that took us about 10 months. The old system was single-threaded, so the exposed events were sequential. All our systems depended on that observed behaviour. This behavior was not part of the API contract, it was not reflected in the code. A new distributed storage didn&#39;t have that guarantee - the events came out-of-order. We spent only a few hours coding a new storage adapter, thanks to an abstraction. <strong>We spent the next 10 months on dealing with out-of-order events and other challenges.</strong> It&#39;s now funny to say that abstractions helps us replace components quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>So, why pay the price of high cognitive load for such a layered architecture, if it doesn&#39;t pay off in the future?</strong> Plus, in most cases, that future of replacing some core component never happens.</p>
<p dir="auto">These architectures are not fundamental, they are just subjective, biased consequences of more fundamental principles. Why rely on those subjective interpretations? Follow the fundamental rules instead: dependency inversion principle, single source of truth, cognitive load and information hiding. Your business logic should not depend on low-level modules like database, UI or framework. We should be able to write tests for our core logic without worrying about the infrastructure, and that&#39;s it. <a href="https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load/discussions/24" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/zakirullin/cognitive-load/discussions/24/hovercard">Discuss</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do not add layers of abstractions for the sake of an architecture. Add them whenever you need an extension point that is justified for practical reasons.</p>

<p dir="auto">Domain-driven design has some great points, although it is often misinterpreted. People say &#34;We write code in DDD&#34;, which is a bit strange, because DDD is about problem space, not about solution space.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ubiquitous language, domain, bounded context, aggregate, event storming are all about problem space. They are meant to help us learn the insights about the domain and extract the boundaries. DDD enables developers, domain experts and business people to communicate effectively using a single, unified language. Rather than focusing on these problem space aspects of DDD, we tend to emphasise particular folder structures, services, repositories, and other solution space techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto">Chances are that the way we interpret DDD is likely to be unique and subjective. And if we build code upon this understanding, i.e., if we create a lot of extraneous cognitive load - future developers are doomed. <code>🤯</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Team Topologies provides a much better, easier to understand framework that helps us split the cognitive load across teams. Engineers tend to develop somewhat similar mental models after learning about Team Topologies. DDD, on the other hand, seems to be creating 10 different mental models for 10 different readers. Instead of being common ground, it becomes a battleground for unnecessary debates.</p>

<p dir="auto">The problem is that <strong>familiarity is not the same as simplicity</strong>. They <em>feel</em> the same — that same ease of moving through a space without much mental effort — but for very different reasons. Every “clever” (read: “self-indulgent”) and non-idiomatic trick you use incurs a learning penalty for everyone else. Once they have done that learning, then they will find working with the code less difficult. So it is hard to recognise how to simplify code that you are already familiar with. This is why I try to get “the new kid” to critique the code before they get too institutionalised!</p>
<p dir="auto">It is likely that the previous author(s) created this huge mess one tiny increment at a time, not all at once. So you are the first person who has ever had to try to make sense of it all at once.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my class I describe a sprawling SQL stored procedure we were looking at one day, with hundreds of lines of conditionals in a huge WHERE clause. Someone asked how anyone could have let it get this bad. I told them: “When there are only 2 or 3 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference. By the time there are 20 or 30 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference!”</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no “simplifying force” acting on the code base other than deliberate choices that you make. Simplifying takes effort, and people are too often in a hurry.</p>

<p dir="auto">The more mental models there are to learn, the longer it takes for a new developer to deliver value.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you onboard new people on your project, try to measure the amount of confusion they have (pair programming may help). If they&#39;re confused for more than ~40 minutes in a row - you&#39;ve got things to improve in your code.</p>
