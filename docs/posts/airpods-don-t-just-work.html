            <p><span>AirPods are a fantastic product. However, the small annoyances that occur when using them don&#39;t allow it to fall under the category of Apple products that “Just Work”.</span></p>

            <p>These are the gripes I&#39;ve had after many years of AirPod usage. I&#39;m currently on my third pair.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span><b>Annoyance 1:</b></span> If you have 2 devices, say iMac and iPhone connected to AirPods, when you are using your iMac and unlock your iPhone to check something, sometimes, the AirPods switch to the iPhone. But you didn&#39;t want them to. I get that Apple is trying to be clever and anticipate your moves, which I genuinely appreciate, but when it gets in the way it&#39;s annoying.</li></ul>
