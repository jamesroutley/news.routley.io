    <h1>Share Openly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>You know all those “share to Facebook” / “share to Twitter” links you see all over peoples’ websites? They’re all out of date.</p><p>Social media has evolved over the last year, yet nobody has “share to” links for Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc. There have been a few attempts to create “share to Mastodon” buttons, but they haven’t taken the larger breadth of the new social media landscape into account.</p><p>So I’ve built a prototype, which I’ve called <a href="https://shareopenly.org">ShareOpenly</a>.</p><p>At the bottom of every article on my site, you’ll see a “share to social media” button. <a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https://werd.io/2024/share-openly&amp;text=Share+Openly">Here’s the button for this article.</a></p><p>If you click it, you’ll be taken to a page that looks like this one:</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6604cc44186ec4d81900abc2/thumb.png" alt="Share Openly share screen" width="500" height="445"/></p><p>You can select one of the pre-set sites in the list, and you’ll be taken to share a post there. For example, if I click on Threads, it will take me to share there:</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6604cc987fd321e929037a32/thumb.png" alt="" width="500" height="198"/></p><p>But if you, for example, have a Mastodon instance, or a Known site, or an <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb</a> site at a different domain, you can enter that domain in the box, and ShareOpenly will try and find a way to let you share the page with that site.</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6604cccbd16a0387290b7b92/thumb.png" alt="" width="500" height="154"/></p><p>ShareOpenly will do a few things first:</p><ol><li>If it’s on a “well-known” domain — eg, <a href="https://facebook.com">facebook.com</a> — it’ll send you to the share page there.</li>
<li>It checks to see if it can figure out if the site is on a known platform (currently Mastodon, Known, hosted WordPress, <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, and a few others). If so — hooray! — it knows the share URL, and off you go.</li>
<li>It looks for a <code>&lt;link rel=“share-url”&gt;</code> header tag on the page. The <code>href</code> attribute should be set to the share URL for the site, with template variables <code>{text}</code> and (optionally) <code>{url}</code> present where the share text and URL should go. (If <code>{url}</code> is not present, the URL to share will be appended at the end of the text.) If it’s there — yay! — we forward there, replacing <code>{text}</code> and <code>{url}</code> as appropriate.</li>
</ol><p>Once you’ve shared to a site, the next time you visit ShareOpenly, it will be in the quick links. For example, I shared to my site at <a href="https://werd.io">werd.io</a> in the example above, and now here it is in the links:</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6604ccfb0d624a544901eb62/thumb.png" alt="" width="500" height="439"/></p><p>It’s early days yet — this is just a prototype — but I thought I’d share what I’ve built so far.</p><p>If you want to add ShareOpenly to your own site, please do! Just replace the <a href="https://werd.io/(https:/shareopenly.org/share/?url=https://werd.io/2014/share-openly&amp;text=Share+Openly)">URL and text in this link</a> with your own. You can also just visit <a href="https://shareopenly.org">the ShareOpenly homepage</a> to share a site directly.</p><p><a href="https://news.indieweb.org/en"><em>Syndicated to Indienews</em></a></p></div></div>
