<p>Here’s a new crossword I made! This one has a “mini theme”, which you’ll find out as you solve it.</p>



<p>This was one of the first ones I made, so there are a few one-letter clues, but zero “?” clues! I was chatting with my parents (who are crossword aficionados) and they mentioned that most crossword words are a minimum of 3 letters, which I didn’t know! But, they said they enjoyed the two-letter clues since I could do things like state &amp; country codes, chemical elements, etc., which were fun to solve. So I think I’ll keep doing 2-letter clues even though it’s not standard.</p>



<p>Anyway, I give this one a 4.5/5 and you can solve it yourself here:</p>
