<h2>BOOK 1</h2>
<h3>THE ARGUMENT</h3>
	
<p><span>This first Book proposes,
first in brief, the whole Subject,</span> <span title="Man&#39;s">Mans</span> disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise
wherein he was <span title="placed">plac&#39;t</span>: <span>Then touches</span> the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent,
or rather <span>Satan</span> in the Serpent; who revolting from
God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God
driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. <span>Which action <span title="passed">past</span>
over, the Poem <span title="hastes">hasts</span> into <a id="medeas">the midst of things</a>,
</span>presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, <span><span title="described">describ&#39;d</span>
here</span>, not in the Center <span>(for Heaven and Earth may
be <span title="supposed">suppos&#39;d</span> as yet not made,
certainly not yet <span title="accursed">accurst</span>)</span>
but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest <span title="called">call&#39;d</span> <span>Chaos</span>: Here <span>Satan</span> with his Angels lying on the burning Lake,
thunder-struck and <span title="astonished">astonisht</span>,
after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in
Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of <span title="their">thir</span> miserable fall. <span>Satan</span>
awakens all his Legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded; They
rise, <span title="their">thir</span> Numbers, array of <span title="Battle">Battel</span>, <span title="their">thir</span> chief Leaders <span title="named">nam&#39;d</span>, according to the Idols known afterwards in <span>Canaan</span> and the Countries <span title="adjoining">adjoyning</span>. To these <span>Satan</span> directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of
regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature
to be created, according to an ancient <span title="Prophecy">Prophesie</span> or report in Heaven; <span>for
that Angels were long before this visible Creation, was the opinion of many <a id="opinion">ancient Fathers</a>.</span>  To find out the truth of this <span title="Prophecy">Prophesie</span>, and what to <span title="determine">determin</span> thereon he refers to a full <span title="Council">Councel</span>. What his Associates thence
attempt. <a id="pandaemonium"><span>Pandemonium</span></a> the Palace of Satan rises, suddenly built
out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in <span title="Council">Councel</span>.

He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</p>
