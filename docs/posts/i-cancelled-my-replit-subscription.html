    <h1>I cancelled my Replit subscription</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-body"><time datetime="2023-11-19T14:33:22Z" pubdate="" itemprop="datePublished" content="2023-11-19 14:33:22 +0000 UTC">November 19, 2023</time><div><p>I cancelled my annual Replit Hacker plan and I&#39;ll let it lapse at the end of December of 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a> is a popular and growing multi language development environment in the cloud. I&#39;ve been subscribing to the Hacker plan for the past few years and it worked well for <a href="https://journal.paoloamoroso.com/tag:Python">my Python projects</a>, as such an online environment is a good match for my chromeOS lifestyle. But two changes made me reconsider the value of the product.</p>

<p>The first is Replit changed its paid tiers by raising the price of my plan and removing some features. I actually saw it coming when Replit began receiving massive funding by major investors, who are likely pressuring the company to reduce costs and turn profits. Still, this left a sour taste as it felt like a bait and switch.</p>

<p>The other change is <a href="https://journal.paoloamoroso.com/back-to-lisp">my shift of focus back to Lisp</a>, the programming language I love most and know best.</p>

<p>Replit doesn&#39;t work well with a highly interactive language like Lisp. It doesn&#39;t directly support any Lisp dialects and its default code editor provides little or no integration with a running Lisp image. Moreover, the files created or uploaded outside of the editor are often not preserved across sessions. If I have to install and maintain a full Lisp system in the Linux shell of a Replit workspace, I might as well install it locally on my desktop computer.</p>

<p>Finally, like other development tool vendors, Replit is doubling down on AI coding features which affect the cost of paid plans. But I&#39;m not interested in this as the whole point of my hobby programming is to write all the code myself and learn from the experience.</p>
