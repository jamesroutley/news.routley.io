The pilot project is intended to show the technology’s commercial potential.</p><p>At commercial scale, when the sand is fully heated and stored in five silos, the technology could produce 135 MW of power for five days,<b><i> </i></b>according to an <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84728.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="1">NREL report</a>.</p><p>A targeted levelized cost of storage of 5¢/kWh could be achieved under a variety of scenarios, the report said.</p><p>NREL said a technology-to-market transition plan has been developed for the TES system, but was not included in the publicly available report “due to the business sensitivity of NREL and partners.”</p><p>Babcock &amp; Wilcox, one of five project team members supporting NREL’s research, <a href="https://www.babcock.com/home/about/corporate/news/babcock-wilcox-nrel-sign-exclusive-ip-option-agreement-for-advanced-renewable-energy-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2">said</a> in 2021 that it had signed an agreement with NREL, which gave it “field-limited exclusive rights” to negotiate a licensing agreement that would allow it to market the technology.</p><p>Several other energy storage technologies have storage durations longer than the typical four-hour limit for battery storage. For example, Hydrostor is <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/13/500-mw-compressed-air-energy-storage-project-in-california-secures-offtaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="3">developing</a> a 500 MW/4,000 MWh compressed air energy storage project in California. A pumped storage project <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/07/10/massive-montana-pumped-hydro-project-gets-danish-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="4">under development</a> in Montana would have a capacity of 400 MW and an estimated annual energy generation of 1,300 GWh. And flow batteries have a global market <a href="https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/05/global-flow-battery-market-to-grow-at-22-8-annually/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="5">estimated</a> by a research firm at $289 million in 2023.</p><p>For seasonal energy storage, hydrogen storage in salt caverns is an option. A <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/04/worlds-largest-underground-hydrogen-storage-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="6">project in Utah</a> is expected to have a storage capacity of 150 GWh matched with an 840 MW hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant.</p><p>This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
