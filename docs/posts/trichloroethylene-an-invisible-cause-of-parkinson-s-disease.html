    <h1>Trichloroethylene: An invisible cause of Parkinson’s disease?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <div><section><div id="article1-front"><h4><span>Abstract</span></h4><p id="d53480403e267">The etiologies of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain unclear. Some, such as certain genetic mutations and head trauma, are widely known or easily identified. However, these causes or risk factors do not account for the majority of cases. Other, less visible factors must be at play. Among these is a widely used industrial solvent and common environmental contaminant little recognized for its likely role in PD: trichloroethylene (TCE). TCE is a simple, six-atom molecule that can decaffeinate coffee, degrease metal parts, and dry clean clothes. The colorless chemical was first linked to parkinsonism in 1969. Since then, four case studies involving eight individuals have linked occupational exposure to TCE to PD. In addition, a small epidemiological study found that occupational or hobby exposure to the solvent was associated with a 500% increased risk of developing PD. In multiple animal studies, the chemical reproduces the pathological features of PD.</p><p id="d53480403e269">Exposure is not confined to those who work with the chemical. TCE pollutes outdoor air, taints groundwater, and contaminates indoor air. The molecule, like radon, evaporates from underlying soil and groundwater and enters homes, workplaces, or schools, often undetected. Despite widespread contamination and increasing industrial, commercial, and military use, clinical investigations of TCE and PD have been limited. Here, through a literature review and seven illustrative cases, we postulate that this ubiquitous chemical is contributing to the global rise of PD and that TCE is one of its invisible and highly preventable causes. Further research is now necessary to examine this hypothesis.</p></div><div id="article1-body"><div><h2><span></span>INTRODUCTION</h2><p id="d53480403e296">The number of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has more than doubled in the past 30 years [<a href="#ref001">1</a>] and, absent change, will double again by 2040 [<a href="#ref002">2</a>]. Numerous genetic causes or risk factors for the disease have been identified, but the vast majority of individuals with PD do not carry any of these mutations [<a href="#ref003 ref004">3, 4</a>]. Several environmental toxicants, especially certain pesticides [<a href="#ref005">5</a>], have also been linked to PD, and head trauma is also associated with an increased risk [<a href="#ref006">6</a>]. However, these are insufficient to explain the widespread prevalence of PD. Given the disease’s growing rates— more than can be explained by aging alone [<a href="#ref001">1</a>]— other less visible causes must be contributing to its rise. One of these may be trichloroethylene (TCE), a ubiquitous chemical that has contaminated countless sites and poses health risks to those who are (often unknowingly) exposed via their work or their environment. </p><p id="d53480403e317">The evidence linking TCE to PD to date is based on a handful of case studies [<a href="#ref007 ref008 ref009 ref010 ref011 ref012">7–12</a>], a small epidemiological study linking exposure to a 500% increased risk of PD [<a href="#ref011">11</a>], and numerous animal studies demonstrating that the chemical leads to the pathological hallmarks of PD [<a href="#ref008 ref009 ref013 ref014 ref015 ref016 ref017">8, 9, 13–17</a>]. Here we introduce the chemical, describe its association to PD and other diseases, detail its widespread use and routes of contamination, and provide circumstantial evidence for its broader role in PD through illustrative cases depicting individuals with the disease who were likely exposed to TCE through their environment or occupation. We conclude with a call for greater research on its effects on PD, protection from and remediation of contaminated sites, and banning of this century-old chemical that has caused immeasurable harm to the public’s health.</p></div><div><h2><span></span>WHAT IS TRICHLOROETHYLENE?</h2><p id="d53480403e331">TCE is a simple six-atom (two carbons, one hydrogen, and three chlorines) solvent that is clear, colorless, volatile, nonflammable, and environmentally persistent (<a href="#jpd-13-jpd225047-g001a">Fig. 1a</a>) [<a href="#ref018">18</a>]. It was first synthesized in the lab in 1864 (<a href="#jpd-13-jpd225047-g001b">Fig. 1b</a>), and commercial production began in the 1920s [<a href="#ref019">19</a>]. Because of its unique properties, TCE has had countless industrial, commercial, military, and medical applications. Among these are producing other chlorinated compounds (e.g., refrigerants), cleaning electronics, and degreasing engine parts for civilian and military purposes [<a href="#ref018">18</a>]. As it readily evaporates and does not shrink fabrics, TCE was used to dry clean clothes beginning in the 1930s. A closely related chemical called perchloroethylene (PCE), which has one additional chlorine atom in place of the hydrogen atom, largely supplanted TCE in dry cleaning in the 1950s. In anaerobic conditions, PCE often transforms into TCE, and their toxicity may be similar [<a href="#ref020">20</a>].</p><div id="jpd-13-jpd225047-g001a"><h5>Fig. 1a</h5><p id="d53480403e356">Trichloroethylene (TCE) chemical structure [<a href="#ref084">84</a>].</p><p><img alt="Trichloroethylene (TCE) chemical structure [84]." src="https://content.iospress.com:443/media/jpd/2023/13-2/jpd-13-2-jpd225047/jpd-13-jpd225047-g001a.jpg"/></p></div><div id="jpd-13-jpd225047-g001b"><h5>Fig. 1b</h5><p id="d53480403e366">The history of trichloroethylene (TCE) [<a href="#ref015 ref085">15, 85</a>].

Because they are lipophilic [<a href="#ref011">11</a>], both TCE and PCE readily distribute in the brain and body tissues and appear to cause mitochondrial dysfunction at high doses. This may partially explain the link to PD as dopaminergic neurons are sensitive to mitochondrial neurotoxicants such as MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup>, paraquat, and rotenone [<a href="#ref023">23</a>]. Indeed, in animal studies (<a href="#jpd-13-jpd225047-t003">Table 3</a>), TCE treatment caused selective loss of dopaminergic neurons [<a href="#ref008 ref009 ref013 ref015 ref016">8, 9, 13, 15, 16</a>]. In addition, PD-related neuropathology, such as neuroinflammation and <i>α</i>-synuclein phosphorylation and accumulation, was observed in the substantia nigra of rats and mice exposed to 200–1000 mg/kg TCE over chronic time periods (6 weeks to 8 months) [<a href="#ref013 ref015 ref017">13, 15, 17</a>]. While the specific metabolite or mechanism of TCE-induced neurodegeneration remains unclear, pre-clinical studies with high doses (400–1000 mg/kg) showed that mitochondrial complex I activity is dysregulated in the midbrain of rodents exposed to TCE [<a href="#ref009 ref013 ref014 ref015">9, 13–15</a>]. Mitochondrial function was further reduced in the rat striatum when TCE exposure occurred in conjunction with another PD risk factor, traumatic brain injury. The combined neurotoxic insults resulted in 50% reduction in complex I oxygen consumption [<a href="#ref014">14</a>], a more severe effect than each factor alone. This combined effect provides a key example of how TCE exposure may influence PD risk in certain populations, such as individuals who served in the military where head trauma is morecommon [<a href="#ref024">24</a>].</p><div id="jpd-13-jpd225047-t003"><h5>Table 3</h5><p id="d53480403e802">Animal studies involving trichloroethylene and Parkinson’s disease [<a href="#ref008 ref009 ref013 ref014 ref015 ref016 ref017">8, 9, 13–17</a>]</p><table xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="d53480403e807"><colgroup id="d53480403e808" span="1"><col id="d53480403e809" span="1"/><col id="d53480403e810" span="1"/><col id="d53480403e811" span="1"/><col id="d53480403e812" span="1"/><col id="d53480403e813" span="1"/><col id="d53480403e814" span="1"/></colgroup><thead id="d53480403e815"><tr id="d53480403e816"><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e817" rowspan="1">Authors</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e819" rowspan="1">Year</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e821" rowspan="1">Ref</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e823" rowspan="1">Animal</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e825" rowspan="1">Exposure</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e827" rowspan="1">Findings</td></tr></thead><tbody id="d53480403e829"><tr id="d53480403e830"><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e831" rowspan="1">Guehl et al.</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e833" rowspan="1">1999</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e835" rowspan="1">[<a href="#ref008">8</a>]</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e840" rowspan="1">OF1 mice</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e842" rowspan="1">400 mg/kg TCE, 5 days/week for 4 weeks</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e844" rowspan="1">Dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra</td></tr><tr id="d53480403e846"><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e847" rowspan="1">Gash et al.</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e849" rowspan="1">2008</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e851" rowspan="1">[<a href="#ref009">9</a>]</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e856" rowspan="1">Fisher 344 rats</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e858" rowspan="1">1000 mg/kg TCE, 5 days/week for 6 weeks</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e860" rowspan="1">Mitochondrial complex I activity inhibition in substantia nigra, increased complex I activity in striatum, dopaminergic neurodegeneration in nigrostriatal tract</td></tr><tr id="d53480403e862"><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e863" rowspan="1">Liu et al.</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e865" rowspan="1">2010</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e867" rowspan="1">[<a href="#ref013">13</a>]</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e872" rowspan="1">Fisher 344 rats</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e874" rowspan="1">200, 500 or 1000 mg/kg TCE, 5 days/week for 6 weeks</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e876" rowspan="1">Dose-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, motor deficits in 1000 mg/kg TCE-treated rats, mitochondrial complex I inhibition in substantia nigra, elevated oxidative stress markers, activated microglia, and intracellular alpha-synuclein accumulation in dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve</td></tr><tr id="d53480403e878"><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e879" rowspan="1">Sauerbeck et al.</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e881" rowspan="1">2012</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e883" rowspan="1">[<a href="#ref014">14</a>]</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e888" rowspan="1">Fisher 344 rats</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e890" rowspan="1">1000 mg/kg TCE, daily for 1 or 2 weeks with and without traumatic brain injury</td><td colspan="1" id="d53480403e892" rowspan="1">Mitochondrial impairment in striatum, with rates of complex I dependent oxygen consumption decreasing by 75%, after two week exposure to TCE and traumatic brain injury.

For example, in a 2021 study, chronic, systemic exposure to 200 mg/kg TCE elevated the kinase activity of LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2) in the striatum and substantia nigra of rats after 3 weeks, prior to the loss of dopaminergic neurons at 6 weeks [<a href="#ref017">17</a>]. Inherited variants of <i>LRRK2</i> are linked to both familial and sporadic PD, the most common of which is the G2019S mutation, that pathogenically elevate LRRK2 kinase activity resulting in dysregulated vesicular trafficking, endolysosomal dysfunction, and oxidative stress [<a href="#ref025">25</a>]. However, despite cellular dysfunction caused by elevated LRRK2 kinase activity, individuals who inherit the <i>LRRK2</i> G2019S mutation have only a roughly 50% increased risk for PD [<a href="#ref026">26</a>]. Incomplete penetrance of genetic risk factors suggests that possible gene-environment interactions could explain why only some individuals exposed to TCE develop PD and why those with a PD-related genetic predisposition may display variable risk of developing PD. Many other genetic causes of PD (e.g., <i>Parkin</i>, <i>PINK1</i>) also affect mitochondrial function, and an interaction with TCE is conceivable for carriers of mutations in these genes [<a href="#ref027">27</a>]. However, more data on gene-environment interaction between TCE, <i>LRRK2</i>, and other genetic risk factors associated with PD are needed.</p></div><div><h2><span></span>WIDESPREAD USE, WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION</h2><p id="d53480403e978">TCE was “ubiquitous” in the 1970s [<a href="#ref028">28</a>] when annual U.S. production surpassed 600 million pounds per year, or over two pounds per person [<a href="#ref029">29</a>].

In March 2020, Mr. Grant’s father died at age 65 from esophageal cancer, which is linked to TCE [<a href="#ref050">50</a>].</p></div><div><h4><span></span>Case 2</h4><p id="d53480403e1275">From 1984 to 1988, a young Navy captain, Amy Lindberg, was also stationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. On hot, humid days, Captain Lindberg swam, ran, trained, and outworked her peers. She also drank lots of water. What Captain Lindberg did not know is that the water that she drank, bathed, cooked, swam, and played in was contaminated with TCE, PCE, and other toxicants.</p><p id="d53480403e1277">Between active duty and the reserves, Captain Lindberg served for 26 years, before she and her husband retired in northern Virginia. In 2017, thirty years after being stationed at Camp Lejeune, the then 57-year-old Captain Lindberg developed anxiety, depression, and trouble thinking (“brain fog”) and was seen by a neuropsychologist. He asked her about her loss of smell, decreased right arm swing, and dragging of her right leg, all of which she had developed about two years earlier. She also had a mild rest tremor in her right hand and long-standing constipation. She soon saw a neurologist who diagnosed her with PD, which was not present in her family.</p><p id="d53480403e1279">Now 63, Captain Lindberg remains an avid runner, boxes regularly, and works out frequently, but is disabled by the disease’s non-motor features including urinary urgency, pain, and mood changes. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs established PD as having a “presumptive service connection” for those who, like Captain Lindberg, served at Camp Lejeune between 1953 and 1987 [<a href="#ref051">51</a>].</p></div><div><h4><span></span>Case 3</h4><p id="d53480403e1287">Dr. Jesh Mittal is a 48-year-old endocrinologist who was raised in an upstate New York community heavily contaminated by TCE. His first home, where he lived until age 14, was located less than a mile from a Superfund site where TCE, PCE, or both had contaminated 60 residential drinking wells [<a href="#ref052">52</a>]. His second home, where he resided until starting college, was also less than a mile from another Superfund site contaminated by TCE and other solvents used in vapor degreasing [<a href="#ref053">53</a>]. However, his potential exposure did not end at home.</p><p id="d53480403e1295">The future physician attended high school adjacent to a large computing firm where his father worked. The soil and groundwater at the manufacturing site were contaminated with TCE and PCE. In 1971, seven years before his freshman year, the well at the high school was found to have “slight contamination” with TCE even after a filtration system was installed [<a href="#ref054">54</a>]. A generation later in 2000, groundwater monitoring found high concentrations of PCE at the manufacturing facility [<a href="#ref055">55</a>]. Neither his homes nor his high school were (to our knowledge) ever checked for vapor intrusion despite their proximity to contaminated sites.</p><p id="d53480403e1303">In 2010, after a nurse noticed that his handwriting was becoming smaller, the right-handed physician was diagnosed with writer’s cramp. Two years later, he developed constipation, a “twitch” in his right hand, and dystonia in his right arm. He was subsequently diagnosed with PD at age 38. He had no family history of and no genetic marker for PD. Two years earlier, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and three years after his PD diagnosis, his father was diagnosed with prostatecancer.</p></div></div><div><h3><span></span>Likely occupational exposure to TCE</h3><div><h4><span></span>Case 4</h4><p id="d53480403e1311">Dr. John Smith was an 85-year-old physicist and industry executive with a family history of PD in his father and two paternal aunts, all of whom grew up on a farm. At age six, the future electrical engineer and his family moved to a farm in upstate New York where the young boy would apply rotenone and DDT to green bean plants as part of his chores. As a graduate student, he used TCE to wash electric parts but wore no personal protective equipment.</p><p id="d53480403e1313">Upon completing his PhD, he joined National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) where he cleaned electronics and was “swimming” in TCE. His term at NASA was interrupted by basic training in the army at Fort Gordon, Georgia, which served as a testing site for Agent Orange [<a href="#ref056">56</a>]. He then worked for a large computer manufacturing company in East Fishkill, New York, where TCE, PCE, and other chemicals eventually contaminated the soil and groundwater [<a href="#ref057">57</a>].</p><p id="d53480403e1321">In approximately 2010, Dr. Smith was diagnosed with PD. His symptoms included anxiety, decreased energy, anhedonia, diminished initiative, depressed mood, and constipation in addition to a rest tremor, slowed movements, a stooped posture, and a soft voice. Some of these symptoms improved with levodopa, but they subsequently worsened. As part of a physical exam in 2019, an internist found a breast lump in Dr. Smith’s chest. The lump was cancerous. The treatment of his breast cancer, which is associated with TCE exposure [<a href="#ref058">58</a>], required surgery and tamoxifen.</p></div><div><h4><span></span>Case 5</h4><p id="d53480403e1329">Mr. Ethan Jones is a 72-year-old retired teacher who was diagnosed with PD in 2017. He also carries a G2019S mutation in <i>LRRK2</i>.</p><p id="d53480403e1334">In his early thirties, Mr. Jones worked for three to four years in a small copy and print shop that required multiple chemicals and solvents. He is unsure whether he was exposed to TCE or PCE, but chlorinated solvents were commonly used in the industry in the 1970s and 1980s [<a href="#ref059">59</a>]. About 35 years later, he noticed that he was moving slower than his peers and was subsequently diagnosed with PD at age 68. His symptoms improved with levodopa, which he continues to take.</p><p id="d53480403e1339">Neither of his parents had PD, but his paternal grandfather did and his nephew does. In addition to PD, he was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a premalignant state associated with multiple myeloma, which is associated with TCE exposure [<a href="#ref060">60</a>].</p></div><div><h4><span></span>Case 6</h4><p id="d53480403e1347">After serving in the military, Mr. Alex Janssen worked in the construction and automotive industry. In these latter jobs, he worked with degreasing chemicals, such as TCE, for approximately seven years. About five years after his exposure ended, he noticed numbness on the right side of his body followed by difficulty walking up the stairs. He later experienced a stressful event that was followed by involuntary shaking in his right arm and leg and a PD diagnosis at age 33.</p><p id="d53480403e1349">The number and intensity of PD symptoms increased significantly over the years, and he eventually had deep brain stimulation (DBS), which improved his symptoms and his quality of life. Three years later, he developed fatigue, headache, and a facial droop. Brain imaging at age 53 revealed a stage IV glioblastoma situated next to a DBS wire.</p></div><div><h4><span></span>Case 7</h4><p id="d53480403e1354">In 2020, Georgians took to the polls to elect two U.S. Senators in a closely watched election that would determine political control of the legislative body. The reason for the unusual election? Parkinson’s disease. The late Senator Johnny Isakson, who was diagnosed with PD in 2015, had stepped down due to “health challenges” in 2019, leading to a special election in 2020 [<a href="#ref061">61</a>].</p><p id="d53480403e1359">Senator Johnny Isakson, who died in 2021 at age 76, served for fifteen years in the U.S. Senate during which time he was a staunch advocate for veterans and co-chaired the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson’s Disease [<a href="#ref062">62</a>]. In addition to his PD, Senator Isakson had a two-centimeter renal cell carcinoma removed from his kidney in 2019 [<a href="#ref061">61</a>], a tumor associated with TCE exposure [<a href="#ref063">63</a>].</p><p id="d53480403e1370">Nearly fifty years before his PD diagnosis, the future Senator served in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972. The military, including the Air Force, used TCE to degrease airplanes during this period [<a href="#ref064">64</a>], and many military bases, including those in Georgia [<a href="#ref065">65</a>], have been contaminated with the chemical [<a href="#ref066">66</a>].</p></div></div></div><div><h2><span></span>ADDITIONAL TOXICITY OF TCE</h2><p id="d53480403e1384">As depicted by these cases, the adverse health effects associated with TCE extend far beyond PD. Its toxic effects begin shortly after conception. TCE can cross the placenta, [<a href="#ref067">67</a>] and maternal exposure to TCE is associated with low birth weight [<a href="#ref068">68</a>], congenital heart disease [<a href="#ref068">68</a>], and neural tube defects [<a href="#ref069">69</a>]. At the TCE-contaminated Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, at least seven babies had anencephaly, and ten had spina bifida [<a href="#ref019 ref070">19, 70</a>]. After birth, TCE-linked diseases proliferate as the solvent is linked to conditions affecting nearly every organ system [<a href="#ref071">71</a>] including cancer.</p><p id="d53480403e1405">According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization, TCE is carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure [<a href="#ref072 ref073">72, 73</a>]. A meta-analysis found occupational exposure “was associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma, with the strongest evidence for the first three cancers” [<a href="#ref074">74</a>]. This is likely only a partial list. At least 78 <i>men</i> who lived at contaminated Camp Lejeune have been diagnosed with breast cancer [<a href="#ref049">49</a>]. In addition, high rates of brain and other central nervous system tumors have been reported in animal studies [<a href="#ref019">19</a>] and in TCE-contaminated communities [<a href="#ref075 ref076">75, 76</a>].</p><p id="d53480403e1426">TCE’s adverse health effects have long been known. In 1932, Dr. Carey McCord, a physician working for the Chrysler Corporation, wrote a letter to the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. He said that activities of TCE “frequently fail to disclose the toxic nature of this chemical and the practical dangers that may attend its use.” He then detailed experiments with rabbits in which repeated skin exposure to the chemical caused death in days. Inhalation of TCE “under conditions of trivial exposure” killed the rabbits in days if not hours. Ninety years ago, he concluded that the solvent could be “the source of disaster for exposed workmen” [<a href="#ref077">77</a>].</p></div><div><h2><span></span>CRITIQUE</h2><p id="d53480403e1437">The cases described demonstrate the potential role that TCE plays in PD. However, they are far from definitive and far from the only ones. The vignettes highlight many of the difficulties in establishing a strong link between the invisible TCE and PD. Among these are the following: 1) many are unaware of their exposure; 2) exposure, if present, was usually unmeasured; 3) previous exposures cannot currently be measured; 4) in many cases, exposure co-occurred with other pollutants; 5) time between exposure and disease is long; 6) underlying genetic risk factors, which are often not assessed, may augment the risk of developing PD following TCE exposure; and 7) diagnosis of PD is often delayed or missed.</p><p id="d53480403e1439">In just one of the cases above was the person— a physicist— aware of his exposure to the toxic chemical at the time it occurred, and all were unaware of the health risks associated with the chemical. Those who drank contaminated water or inhaled polluted air outside or inside their workplaces, schools, or homes generally had no idea that they were exposed. Today, sites known to be contaminated with TCE, including many of the most toxic ones in the U.S., have no warning signs, fences, notices, or other public notification of the inherent dangers. As a result, it is challenging to determine whether exposure occurred.</p><p id="d53480403e1441">Moreover, if exposure did occur, retrospective exposure assessment of TCE is difficult. Exposure is almost never measured contemporaneously (indeed, we are unaware of any case of PD associated with TCE where it was). Biomarkers of historical TCE exposure do not currently exist. The few studies [<a href="#ref009 ref020">9, 20</a>] and case reports [<a href="#ref011 ref073">11, 73</a>] available suggest that a dose-response relationship may be present as individuals who work most closely with the chemical have a shorter lag between exposure and disease onset.</p><p id="d53480403e1449">Like other environmental toxicants (e.g., smoking, pesticides), exposure to TCE is often combined with other exposures. Many TCE-contaminated sites are polluted with PCE and other toxic hydrocarbons such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which itself may be associated with PD.</p><p id="d53480403e1451">The effect of each individual compound has often not been assessed, and research into the risk of exposure to mixtures of toxicants is needed [<a href="#ref078 ref079">78, 79</a>].</p><p id="d53480403e1456">The time between exposure and disease onset may be decades. Individuals, if they were aware of their exposure to the chemical, may have long since forgotten about it. Those who worked with the solvent or who lived near a contaminated site may have changed jobs or moved, making retrospective evaluation of potential clusters challenging.</p><p id="d53480403e1458">Finally, while TCE’s effects on cancer are well-documented, its effects on PD are only recently coming to light. Gash’s study of factory workers who developed PD after degreasing metal parts with TCE was published in 2008 [<a href="#ref009">9</a>]. The twin study quantifying the high degree of association between occupational or hobby exposure to TCE and PD is only ten years old [<a href="#ref011">11</a>]. Many individuals who know they were exposed to TCE and subsequently developed PD have no reason to link the two. Today, most clinicians are unaware of TCE’s deleterious health effects even though they have been documented for over ninety years [<a href="#ref077">77</a>].</p></div><div><h2><span></span>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h2><p id="d53480403e1472">To address the large role TCE (and other chlorinated solvents) may play in fueling the rise of PD, we need to do the following:</p><div id="list0005"><ul><li><p id="d53480403e1478"><span>1.</span> <b>Conduct more research</b> – Given the widespread environmental contamination by TCE, the authors of the twin study linking TCE to PD concluded, “the potential public health implications are substantial” [<a href="#ref011">11</a>]. Unfortunately, that prescient warning has largely gone unheeded. A search of TCE and PD on PubMed yields only 15 papers in the past decade [<a href="#ref080">80</a>]. By contrast, a search of the genetic risk factor <i>GBA</i> and PD returns more published papers in just the last two months [<a href="#ref081">81</a>]. Among the pressing research needs are evaluating cohorts (ideally prospectively) of individuals (likely) exposed to TCE, identifying biological markers of prior exposure, better understanding the mechanisms of injury, and assessing gene-environment interactions including those affecting TCE’s metabolism. Further work is also needed to estimate the risk of TCE exposure in conjunction with other known neurotoxicants, such as pesticides, and risk factors like traumatic brain injury.</p></li><li><p id="d53480403e1497"><span>2.</span> <b>Clean and contain contaminated sites</b> – Hundreds of thousands of sites are contaminated across the U.S. and globally. They are found in strip malls where dry cleaners used to operate, on military bases where use was widespread, in cities near old manufacturing sites (especially those near rivers or streams), and in rural areas where landfills were created to dump hazardous waste. Fortunately, contaminated sites can be remediated, and homes, schools, and workplaces can be protected by vapor intrusion mitigation systems like those used for radon [<a href="#ref082">82</a>]. Until they are cleaned, existing contaminated sites must be contained, limiting exposure for humans and nature. Local, regional, and national authorities should take responsibility in overseeing rapid control of contaminated sites.</p></li><li><p id="d53480403e1507"><span>3.</span> <b>Monitor TCE levels and publicly communicate risk</b> – Most databases monitor emissions, not current levels, and monitoring tends to be sporadic and reactive. TCE testing in groundwater, drinking water, soil, and in outdoor and indoor air should be widespread, frequent, and part of routine water quality testing. The results should be readily and publicly available. Polluted sites need to be marked as such, and the dangers to health clearly communicated to all parties at risk.</p></li><li><p id="d53480403e1514"><span>4.</span> <b>Ban trichloroethylene</b> – In many ways, the long-established health risks of TCE dwarf its relationship with PD. TCE causes cancer, increases the risk of miscarriages, contributes to birth defects, and is associated with diseases in nearly every organ system. The chemical is over a century old. We do not fly airplanes from the days of the Wright brothers or drive cars from Henry Ford’s era; engineers have developed safer ones. Chemists can do the same for solvents. Some companies now advertise safer alternatives to TCE [<a href="#ref083">83</a>]. They are needed as the use of TCE continues to rise globally.</p></li><li><p id="d53480403e1524"><span>5.</span> <b>Listen to our patients</b> – Finally, we should listen to our patients more. In medicine, we often move from diagnosis to treatment without considering the cause. The vast majority of individuals with PD do not have a family history of the disease or carry an identifiable genetic risk factor. Listening to their life stories or occupational histories can help identify TCE or other factors contributing to PD and could help develop etiology-specific treatments. This information can also inform their care (e.g., cancer screening), provide guidance to family members, co-workers, and classmates, and advance our understanding of the potential causes of this debilitating and likely very preventable disease.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><h2><span></span>CONCLUSION</h2><p id="d53480403e1531">For more than a century, TCE has threatened workers, polluted the air we breathe— outside and inside— and contaminated the water we drink. Global use is waxing, not waning. Most of this has been invisible, all of it is unacceptable, and none of it will stop until we act.</p></div></div><div id="article1-back"><div id="d53480403e1534"><h2><span></span>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2><p id="d53480403e1537">Thank you to those who contributed their stories, including Mr. Brian Grant, Captain Amy Lindberg, and several anonymous individuals.</p></div><div><h2><span></span>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h2><p id="d53480403e1542"><b>Dr. Dorsey</b> has received honoraria for speaking at American Academy of Neurology, American Neurological Association, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, International Parkinson’s and Movement Disorders Society, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Northwestern University, Physicians Education Resource, LLC, PRIME Education, LLC, Stanford University, Texas Neurological Society, and Weill Cornell; received compensation for consulting services from Abbott, Abbvie, Acadia, Acorda, Bial-Biotech Investments, Inc., Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, California Pacific Medical Center, Caraway Therapeutics, Curasen Therapeutics, Denali Therapeutics, Eli Lilly, Genentech/Roche, Grand Rounds, Huntington Study Group, Informa Pharma Consulting, Karger Publications, LifeSciences Consultants, MCM Education, Mediflix, Medopad, MedRhythms, Merck, Michael J.
