This law would see these policies undermined.</p><p>Despite widespread opposition from across the country, Swiss cloud security company Infomaniak is supporting the law.</p><p>Infomaniak describes itself as an &#34;ethical cloud&#34; company and one that doesn&#39;t compromise on &#34;ecology, privacy, or people.&#34; It&#39;s surprising, then, that they are seemingly the only privacy-focused company in Switzerland supporting the law change.</p><h2 id="infomaniak-opposes-anonymity-3">Infomaniak opposes anonymity</h2><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rts.ch/play/tv/les-beaux-parleurs/video/faire-bonne-figure?urn=urn:rts:video:f357b48c-e80a-3330-b5c6-972e254d401f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.rts.ch/play/tv/les-beaux-parleurs/video/faire-bonne-figure?urn=urn:rts:video:f357b48c-e80a-3330-b5c6-972e254d401f" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">debate on Radio Télévision Suisse</a> (RTS), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.clubic.com/actualite-566385-infomaniak-tacle-proton-et-introduira-le-chiffrement-des-mails-sans-anonymat.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.clubic.com/actualite-566385-infomaniak-tacle-proton-et-introduira-le-chiffrement-des-mails-sans-anonymat.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">reported in Clubic</a>, Infomaniak spokesperson Thomas Jacobsen addressed Andy Yen&#39;s comments on the law.</p><p>Jacobsen believed Yen showed a &#34;lack of knowledge of Swiss political institutions&#34; and called for finding the right balance, not looking for extremes.</p><p>Infomaniak argued that anonymity prevents justice, saying there must be a &#34;happy medium&#34; to prevent the digital landscape becoming a &#34;Wild West.&#34;</p><p>Proton was cited as a company that advocates for anonymity, but this isn&#39;t technically the case. Proton, and Proton VPN, advocates for privacy – and there is a subtle but important difference between the two.</p><p>Confusing privacy and anonymity is common – a Tom&#39;s Guide VPN survey found that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vpns/we-surveyed-toms-guide-readers-about-vpns-and-i-need-to-bust-some-myths" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vpns/we-surveyed-toms-guide-readers-about-vpns-and-i-need-to-bust-some-myths">29% of readers think VPNs make you anonymous</a> – but they don&#39;t mean the same thing.

Many can still see some identifiable information and most don&#39;t claim to offer anonymity. Although your data is encrypted and reputable VPN providers can&#39;t see your internet activity, they can still see your connecting IP address and your payment information. The key point is that they never log or share it.</p><p>Hackers, third-parties, or your ISP can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing, and that is the privacy VPNs offer. Infomaniak is incorrect in saying Proton advocates for anonymity.</p><h2 id="calling-out-free-vpns-3">Calling out free VPNs</h2><p>Infomaniak also took issue with free services, such as free VPNs. In the debate, Jacobsen said how these free services allow anyone to hide from the law by enabling anonymity.</p><p>While VPNs can be misused by bad actors for criminal endeavours, something all reputable VPNs and Tom&#39;s Guide opposes, this doesn&#39;t mean they should be taken away or targeted.</p><p>Almost every kind of technology and device can be used for illicit purposes. We have to accept that not everything can, or should, be controlled in order to target a small minority.</p><p>This trade-off would take away the right to privacy of millions of genuine users.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL.jpg" alt="Broken speech bubble on red background" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atrrkzhMVawuwLjXF7bHVL.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: rob dobi / Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure><p>VPNs, and especially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-free-vpn" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-free-vpn">best free VPNs</a>, are a lifeline for people living under censorship and internet restrictions.

The contents of messages or communications will remain encrypted, but the metadata will be seen and collected.</p><p>Metadata can include geolocation, date and time, IP addresses, file size, device identifiers, plus who sent and received the message. So, even though the actual content of the message remains encrypted and hidden, you can identify and subsequently prosecute individuals based on analysis of metadata.</p><p>The opposition claims this is a fundamental privacy risk if handled in the wrong way, and something that should be opposed, not lauded.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33.jpg" alt="Floating eyeballs watching a red laptop" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHTTmCZU5J94BTnGKziW33.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: J Studios / Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Infomaniak&#39;s approach to metadata has also received backlash from others in the industry.
