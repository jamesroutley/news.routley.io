        <p id="introduction"><a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a> is a protocol for building decentralized applications that work well offline and that no one person can control. Because there is no central server, Scuttlebutt clients connect to their peers to exchange information. This guide describes the protocols used to communicate within the Scuttlebutt network.</p>
        <p>Scuttlebutt is a flexible protocol, capable of supporting many different types of applications. One of its first applications was as a social network. This guide has a slight focus on how to use Scuttlebutt for social networking, but many of the explanations will still be useful if want to use it for something completely different, or are just curious how it works.</p>

        <h2 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h2>

        <h3 id="keys-and-identities">Keys and identities</h3>
        <p>The first thing a user needs to participate in Scuttlebutt is an identity. An identity is an Ed25519 key pair and typically represents a person, a device, a server or a bot. It’s normal for a person to have several Scuttlebutt identities.</p>
        <p>Upon starting for the first time, Scuttlebutt clients will automatically generate an Ed25519 key pair and save it in the user’s home folder under <code>.ssb/secret</code>.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/identity_keypair.png" alt="The Scuttlebutt identity is a long-term Ed25519 key pair."/>
        <p>Because identities are long and random, no coordination or permission is required to create a new one, which is essential to the network’s design.</p>
        <p>Later, a user can choose to give themselves a nickname or avatar to make themselves easier to refer to. Over time nicknames may change but identities stay the same. If a user loses their secret key or has it stolen they will need to generate a new identity and tell people to use their new one instead.</p>
        <p>The public key of an identity is presented to users and transmitted in some parts of the network protocol using this format:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/format_public_key.png" alt="@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519 where everything but the @ prefix and .ed25519 suffix is the public-key, base64-encoded."/>
        
        <p>The beginning <code>@</code> sign signifies that this represents a public key rather than a message or blob, which start with <code>%</code> and <code>&amp;</code>. Each identity has an associated <a href="#feeds">feed</a>, which is a list of all the messages posted by that identity. This is why the identity is also called a <em>feed ID</em>.</p>

        <h3 id="cryptographic-primitives">Cryptographic primitives</h3>

        <p>The Scuttlebutt protocol relies on NaCl/libsodium&#39;s cryptobox primitives. This guide uses the following:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>nacl_scalarmult(n, p)</code></dt>
            <dd>This is <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/advanced/scalar_multiplication">Libsodium&#39;s scalar multiplication function</a>, which takes two scalars (usually public and/or secret keys). It has the useful property that, given two key pairs <code>(pk1, sk1)</code> and <code>(pk2, sk2)</code>, <code>nacl_scalarmult(sk1, pk2) == nacl_scalarmult(sk2, pk1)</code>, which allows shared secret derivation between peers who know each other&#39;s public key. More on this later.</dd>

            <dt><code>nacl_auth(msg, key)</code> and <code>assert_nacl_auth_verify(authenticator, msg, key)</code></dt>
            <dd>This functions are <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption">Libsodium&#39;s message authentication function</a>. The former takes a message and returns a 32-bytes authenticator, that acts as a detacted signature of the message. The latter verifies this authenticator is indeed valid for the given message and key; and errors if they don&#39;t.</dd>

            <dt><code>nacl_secret_box(msg, nonce, key)</code> and <code>assert_nacl_secretbox_open(ciphertext, nonce, key)</code></dt>
            <dd>These function are based on <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox">Libsodium&#39;s crypto_secretbox_easy and crypto_secretbox_open_easy function</a>, which use symmetric cryptography to, respectively, encrypt+authenticate, and verify+decrypt a message using a nonce and a shared secret.</dd>

            <dt><code>nacl_sign_detached(msg, key)</code> and <code>assert_nacl_sign_verify_detached(sig, msg, key)</code></dt>
            <dd>The former is computed from <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures">Libsodium&#39;s signature functions</a>. Unlike the usual Libsodium/NaCl functions, they work with signatures in independent buffers, rather than concatenated with the msg.</dd>

            <dt><code>pk_to_curve25519(ed25519_pk)</code> and <code>sk_to_curve25519(ed25519_sk)</code></dt>
            <dd>These functions convert Ed25519 keys (used for cryptobox) to Curve25519 (aka X25519) keys, used for signing. They are <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/advanced/ed25519-curve25519">implemented by Libsodium as <code>crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519</code> and <code>crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519</code></a>, respectively.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
        <div>
            <p>After a user has generated their identity they need to find some peers to connect to. To connect to a peer you need its public key and its address using any of the protocol it supports. Typically with TCP/IP, you would need its IP address and port, but the Scuttlebutt protocol is not restricted to TCP/IP as transport. The Scuttlebutt protocol currently has three methods for peers to discover each other.</p>

            <h3 id="local-network">Local network</h3>
            <p>Peers constantly broadcast UDP packets on their local network advertising their presence. The body of each packet is a string containing the peer’s IP address, port and base64-encoded public key (without <code>@</code> or <code>.ed25519</code>):</p>
        </div>
        

        <div>
            <figure>
                <div>
                    
                    <p><img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/format_udp_broadcast.png" alt="net:192.168.1.123:8008:~shs:FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY="/>
                </p></div>
            </figure>
            <p>This message format can be any valid <a href="https://github.com/ssb-js/multiserver#address-format">multiserver address</a>. In local networks, this is usually a <code>net</code> address with an IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>
            <p>Current implementations broadcast one of these packets every second. When a peer sees another peer’s broadcast packet they can connect to exchange messages. Some clients show nearby peers in the user interface so that the user can see other people on the same network as them.</p>
        </div>
        

        <h3 id="invite-code">Invite code</h3>
        <p><a href="#invites">Invite codes</a> help new users get connected to their first <a href="#pubs">pub</a>, which is a Scuttlebutt peer that is publicly accessible over the internet. An invite code contains a pub’s domain name, port and public key.</p>
        <p>They also contain a secret key that the user can <a href="#redeeming-invites">redeem</a> to make the pub <a href="#following">follow</a> them back. This lets the new user see messages posted by other members of the pub and share their own messages. Invite codes are the most common way for new users to get started on Scuttlebutt.</p>
        <p>Pub operators can distribute invite codes any way they see fit, for example by posting them on existing social networks. Some pubs have a web page that anybody can visit to generate an invite code.</p>

        <h3 id="pub-message">Pub message</h3>
        <p>Users can post a message to their own <a href="#feeds">feed</a> advertising a pub:</p>
        
        <pre><code>{
  &#34;author&#34;: &#34;@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519&#34;,
  &#34;content&#34;: {
    &#34;type&#34;: &#34;pub&#34;,
    &#34;address&#34;: {
      &#34;host&#34;: &#34;one.butt.nz&#34;,
      &#34;port&#34;: 8008,
      &#34;key&#34;: &#34;@VJM7w1W19ZsKmG2KnfaoKIM66BRoreEkzaVm/J//wl8=.ed25519&#34;
    }
  },
  …
}</code></pre>
        <p>When others see this message they can make a note that this pub exists and connect to it in the future.</p>
        <p>Pub messages are a useful way to find additional peers if you already know a few. Obviously this doesn’t work for new users who don’t know anyone else yet and therefore can’t see any pub messages.</p>

        <h2 id="peer-connections">Peer connections</h2>
        <p>Once a Scuttlebutt client has discovered the IP address, port number and public key of a peer they can connect via TCP to ask for updates and exchange messages.</p>

        <h3 id="handshake">Handshake</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The connection begins with a 4-step handshake to authenticate each peer and set up an encrypted channel.</p>
            <p><img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/message_flow.png" alt="Message 1: Client hello (sent by the client). Message 2: Server hello. Message 3: Client authenticate. Message 4: Server accept"/>
        </p></div>
        
        <p>The handshake uses the <a href="https://dominictarr.github.io/secret-handshake-paper/shs.pdf">Secret Handshake key exchange</a> which is designed to have these security properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>After a successful handshake the peers have verified each other’s public keys.</li>
            <li>The handshake produces a shared secret that can be used with a bulk encryption cypher for exchanging further messages.</li>
            <li>The client must know the server’s public key before connecting. The server learns the client’s public key during the handshake.</li>
            <li>Once the client has proven their identity the server can decide they don’t want to talk to this client and disconnect without confirming their own identity.</li>
            <li>A man-in-the-middle cannot learn the public key of either peer.</li>
            <li>Both peers need to know a key that represents the particular Scuttlebutt network they wish to connect to, however a man-in-the-middle can’t learn this key from the handshake. If the handshake succeeds then both ends have confirmed that they wish to use the same network.</li>
            <li>Past handshakes cannot be replayed. Attempting to replay a handshake will not allow an attacker to discover or confirm guesses about the participants’ public keys.</li>
            <li>Handshakes provide forward secrecy. Recording a user’s network traffic and then later stealing their secret key will not allow an attacker to decrypt their past handshakes.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h4 id="starting-keys">Starting keys</h4>
        <p>Upon starting the handshake, the client and server know these keys:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/starting_keys.png" alt="Both the client and servers know: their own long term key pair, their own ephemeral key pair, and the network&#39;s (private) identifier. Additionally, the client knows the server&#39;s long term public key."/>

        <h4 id="client-hello">1. Client hello</h4>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/client_hello.png" alt="The client sends their own ephemeral public key, hmac-authenticated using the network identifier"/>

        <figure>
            <h5>Client sends <span>(64 bytes)</span></h5>
            <h5>Server verifies</h5>
            <pre><code>concat(
  nacl_auth(
    msg: client_ephemeral_pk,
    key: network_identifier
  ),
  client_ephemeral_pk
)</code></pre>

        </figure>

        <div>
            <p>First the client sends their <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_little_a_public.png" alt="public"/> generated ephemeral key. Also included is an hmac that indicates the client wishes to use their key with this specific instance of the Scuttlebutt network.</p>
            <p>The <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_big_n.png" alt=""/> network identifier is a fixed key. On the main Scuttlebutt network it is the following 32-byte sequence:</p>
            <p><span>d4</span><span>a1</span><span>cb</span><span>88</span><span>a6</span><span>6f</span><span>02</span><span>f8</span><span>db</span><span>63</span><span>5c</span><span>e2</span><span>64</span><span>41</span><span>cc</span><span>5d</span>

            </p>
            <p>Changing the key allows separate networks to be created, for example private networks or testnets. An eavesdropper cannot extract the network identifier directly from what is sent over the wire, although they could confirm a guess that it is the main Scuttlebutt network because that identifier is publicly known.</p>
            <p>The server stores the client’s ephemeral public key and uses the hmac to verify that the client is using the same network identifier.</p>

            <p>The client and server each combine their own ephemeral secret key with the other’s ephemeral public key to produce the same shared secret on both ends. An eavesdropper doesn’t know either secret key so they can’t generate the shared secret. A man-in-the-middle could swap out the ephemeral keys in Messages 1 and 2 for their own keys, so the shared secret <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_little_a_little_b.png" alt=""/> alone is not enough for the client and server to know that they are talking to each other and not a man-in-the-middle.</p>
            <p>Because the client already knows the <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_big_b_public.png" alt=""/> server’s long term public key, both ends derive a second secret <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_little_a_big_b.png" alt="using the client&#39;s ephemeral key pair (either the public or the secret key) and the server&#39;s permanent key pair (respectively either the secret or private key)"/> that will allow the client to send a message that only the real server can read and not a man-in-the-middle.</p>

        <h4 id="handshake-complete">Handshake complete</h4>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/final_shared_secret.png" alt=""/>
        <p>At this point the handshake has succeeded. The client and server have proven their identities to each other.</p>
        <p>The shared secrets established during the handshake are used to set up a pair of box streams for securely exchanging further messages.</p>

        <h3 id="box-stream">Box stream</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Box stream is the bulk encryption protocol used to exchange messages following the handshake until the connection ends. It is designed to protect messages from being read or modified by a man-in-the-middle.</p>
            <p>Each message in a box stream has a header and body. The header is always 34 bytes long and says how long the body will be.</p>
            <p><img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/box_stream_overview.png" alt="A stream is made of alternating headers (34 bytes) and bodies (1 to 4096 bytes); ending with a body followed by a 34-bytes &#39;goodbye&#39; header"/></p><h4 id="sending">Sending</h4>
            <p>Sending a message involves encrypting the body of the message and preparing a header for it. Two secret boxes are used; one to protect the header and another to protect the body.</p>
        </div>
        

        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/box_stream_send.png" alt="The plaintext message body is enclosed in a secret box using the key and nonce shown below. Secret boxes put a 16-byte tag onto the front of messages so that tampering can be detected when the box is opened. This tag is sliced off the body and put inside the header. A temporary header is made of the body length (a two-bytes big-endian integer) and th previous tag. This temporary header is then encrypted too, including its own (16-bytes) authentication tag, producing a 16+2+16 bytes header."/>

        <h4 id="receiving">Receiving</h4>
        <p>Receiving a message involves reading the header to find out how long the body is then reassembling and opening the body secret box.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/box_stream_receive.png" alt="Read the first 34 bytes. This is the secret box containing the header. Open this box, extract the body length and body authentication tag. Read the number of bytes specified in the header. Join the body authentication tag and encrypted body back together, open it, and read the secret text."/>

        <h4 id="goodbye">Goodbye</h4>
        <p>The stream ends with a special “goodbye” header. Because the goodbye header is authenticated it allows a receiver to tell the difference between the connection genuinely being finished and a man-in-the-middle forcibly resetting the underlying TCP connection.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/box_stream_goodbye.png" alt="The &#39;goodbye&#39; header is made of 18 bytes of zero, encrypted in a secret box (with a header authenticated tag like other headers)."/>
        <p>When a receiver opens a header and finds that it contains all zeros then they will know that the connection is finished.</p>

        <h4 id="keys-and-nonces">Keys and nonces</h4>
        <p>Two box streams are used at the same time when Scuttlebutt peers communicate. One is for client-to-server messages and the other is for server-to-client messages. The two streams use different keys and starting nonces for their secret boxes.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/box_stream_params.png" alt="The secret box key is made of a double-sha256 hash of the network identifier and three shared secrets, followed by either the server&#39;s permanent public key (for Client to Server) or the client&#39;s permanent public key (for Server to Client), both hashed again with sha256. The starting nonces are respectively the first 24 bytes of server&#39;s or the client&#39;s ephemeral public key, hmac-authenticated with the network identifier."/>
        <p>The starting nonce is used for the first header in the stream (“secret box 1” in the above figures), then incremented for the first body (“secret box 2”), then incremented for the next header and so on.</p>

        <h3 id="rpc-protocol">RPC protocol</h3>
        
        <div>
            <p>Scuttlebutt peers make requests to each other using an RPC protocol. Typical requests include asking for the latest messages in a particular feed or requesting a blob.</p>
            <p>The RPC protocol can interleave multiple requests so that a slow request doesn’t block following ones. It also handles long-running asynchronous requests for notifying when an event occurs and streams that deliver multiple responses over time.</p>
            <p>Similar to the box stream protocol, the RPC protocol consists of 9-bytes headers followed by variable-length bodies. There is also a 9-bytes goodbye message which is just a zeroed out header.</p>
            <p><img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/rpc_overview.png" alt=""/>
        </p></div>
        
        <p>Both peers make requests to each other at the same time using the pair of box streams that have been established. The box streams protect the RPC protocol from eavesdropping and tampering.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/rpc_alignment.png" alt=""/>
        

        
        <p>RPC headers contain a set of flags to say what type of message it is, a field specifying its length and a request number which allows matching requests with their responses when there are several active at the same time.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/rpc_header.png" alt="Headers are made of (in network order): 4 zero bits, a stream bit (1 = &#39;message is part of a stream&#39;), a end/error bit (1 = &#39;message is the last in its stream or an error), and a 2-bits body type (00 = binary, 01 = UTF-8 string, 10 = JSON), the body length (4 bytes unsigned big-endian), and the request number (4 bytes signed big-endial)."/>

        <h4 id="request-format">Request format</h4>
        <p>To make an RPC request, send a JSON message containing the name of the procedure you wish to call, the type of procedure and any arguments.</p>
        <p>The name is a list of strings. For a top-level procedure like <em>createHistoryStream</em> the list only has one element: <code>[&#34;createHistoryStream&#34;]</code>. Procedures relating to blobs are grouped in the blobs namespace, for example to use <em>blobs.get</em> send the list: <code>[&#34;blobs&#34;, &#34;get&#34;]</code>.</p>
        <div>
            <p>There are two types of procedure used when Scuttlebutt peers talk to each other:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Source</em> procedures return multiple responses over time and are used for streaming data or continually notifying when new events occur. When making one of these requests, the stream flag in the RPC header must be set.</li>
                <li><em>Async</em> procedures return a single response. Async responses can arrive quickly or arrive much later in response to a one-off event.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each procedure in the RPC protocol you must already know whether it is source or async and correctly specify this in the request body.</p>
        </div>
        

        <h4 id="source-example">Source example</h4>
        <p>This RPC message shows an example of a <em>createHistoryStream</em> request:</p>

        
        <figure>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{
  &#34;name&#34;: [&#34;createHistoryStream&#34;],
  &#34;type&#34;: &#34;source&#34;,
  &#34;args&#34;: [{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519&#34;}]
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
        </figure>

        <div>
            <p><em>createHistoryStream</em> is how Scuttlebutt peers ask each other for a list of messages posted by a particular feed. It has one argument that is a JSON dictionary specifying more options about the request. <em>id</em> is the only required option and says which feed you are interested in.</p>
            <p>Because this is the first RPC request, the request number is 1. The next request made by this peer will be numbered 2. The other peer will also use request number 1 for their first request, but the peers can tell these apart because they know whether they sent or received each request.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now the responder begins streaming back responses:</p>

        <p>Each message posted by the feed is sent back in its own response. This feed only contains two messages.</p>
        <p>To close the stream the responder sends an RPC message with both the stream and end/err flags set and a JSON body of <code>true</code>. When the requester sees that the stream is being closed they send a final message to close their own end of it (source type requests must always be closed by both ends).</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Alternatively, to abort a stream before it is finished the requester can send their closing message early, at which point the responder closes their own end.</p>

        <h4 id="async-example">Async example</h4>
        <p>One of the few public async procedures is <em>blobs.has</em>, which peers use to ask each other whether they have a particular blob.</p>
        <p>In this example the requester is asking the responder if they have blob <code>&amp;WWw4tQJ6…</code>:</p>

        <figure>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{

        </figure>

        <p>The responder does in fact have this blob so they respond with <code>true</code>. Because this is an async procedure and not a stream, there is only one response and no need to close the stream afterwards:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>

            </div>
        </figure>

        <h4 id="error-example">Error example</h4>

        <p>Let’s take the previous example and introduce a programming mistake to see how the RPC protocol handles errors:</p>

        <figure>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{
  &#34;name&#34;: [&#34;blobs&#34;, &#34;has&#34;],
  &#34;type&#34;: &#34;async&#34;,
  &#34;args&#34;: [&#34;<strong>this was a mistake</strong>&#34;]
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{
  &#34;name&#34;: &#34;Error&#34;,
  &#34;message&#34;: &#34;invalid hash:this was a mistake&#34;,
  &#34;stack&#34;: &#34;…&#34;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
        </figure>

        <p>Most importantly, the response has the end/err flag set to indicate that an error occurred. The reference Scuttlebot implementation also includes an error message and a JavaScript stack trace.</p>
        <p>For source type procedures an error will also end the stream because the end/err flag has the dual purpose of ending streams and indicating that an error occurred.</p>

        <h2 id="feeds">Feeds</h2>
        <p>A Scuttlebutt feed is a list of all the messages posted by a particular identity. When a user writes a message in a Scuttlebutt client and posts it, that message is put onto the end of their feed.</p>

        <h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
        <p>The messages in a feed form an append-only log, meaning that once a message is posted it cannot be modified. Each message (except the first one) references the ID of the previous message, allowing a chain to be constructed back to the first message in the feed.</p>

            <p>Before signing a message it must be serialized according to a specific canonical JSON format. This means for any given message there is exactly one way to serialize it as a sequence of bytes, which is necessary for signature verification to work. The reference implementation verifies that all messages it receives are in the canonical format and rejects messages that aren’t.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The canonical format is defined by the <em>ECMA-262 6<sup>th</sup> Edition</em> section <em><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-json.stringify">JSON.stringify</a></em>. For an example, see how the above message is formatted.</p>
        <p>In brief, the rules are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two spaces for indentation.</li>
            <li>Dictionary entries and list elements each on their own line.</li>
            <li>Newlines use the line feed character <code>\n</code>.</li>
            <li>No trailing newline.</li>
            <li>One space after the colon <code>:</code> for dictionary keys.</li>
            <li>Empty dictionaries appear as <code>{}</code> and empty lists appear as <code>[]</code>.</li>
            <li>Strings and numbers formatted according to the sections <em><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-quotejsonstring">QuoteJSONString</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-tostring-applied-to-the-number-type">ToString Applied to the Number Type</a></em>.
        </li></ul>
        <p>Then sign the message by computing:</p>
        <pre><code>signature = nacl_sign_detached(
  msg: formatted_json_message,
  key: authors_longterm_sk
)</code></pre>
        <p>Base64 encode the signature and put <code>.sig.ed25519</code> on the end. Finally, add the signature to the message itself. It must be the last entry in the dictionary:</p>
        <pre><code>{
  &#34;previous&#34;: &#34;%XphMUkWQtomKjXQvFGfsGYpt69sgEY7Y4Vou9cEuJho=.sha256&#34;,

  &#34;sequence&#34;: 2,
  &#34;timestamp&#34;: 1514517078157,
  &#34;hash&#34;: &#34;sha256&#34;,
  &#34;content&#34;: {
    &#34;type&#34;: &#34;post&#34;,

                IousK4cCn9T5qFa8E14GVek4cAMmMbjqDnAg==.sig.ed25519&#34;
}</code></pre>

        <p>To verify the signature, first remove the signature field from the message. Make sure the remaining message is formatted as JSON using the same formatting rules. Here the order of dictionary entries within <em>content</em> matters; they must be in the same order that you received them.</p>
        <p>Then remove the <code>.sig.ed25519</code> suffix from the signature, base64 decode it and verify with:</p>
        <pre><code>nacl_sign_verify_detached(
  sig: signature,
  msg: formatted_json_message,
  key: authors_longterm_pk
)</code></pre>

        <h4 id="message-id">Message ID</h4>
        <p>A message ID is a hash of the message including signature. Messages can refer to other messages by their ID.</p>
        <p>To compute a message’s ID, first format it as JSON using the formatting rules. Like with signatures, dictionary keys must appear in the same order that you received them. The <em>signature</em> key must appear last as shown above (but without wrapping the line).</p>
        <p>The ID of the above message is:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/format_message_id.png" alt="%R7lJEkz27lNijPhYNDzYoPjM0Fp+bFWzwX0SmNJB/ZE=.sha256 where everything between % and .sha256 is the base64-encoding of the sha256 hash of the formatted message including signature"/>
        <p>Currently all IDs are computed using sha256. However the protocol includes the name of the hash function in message IDs and the messages themselves to allow migrating to a different one if needed in the future.</p>

        <h3 id="createHistoryStream">createHistoryStream</h3>
        <p>Scuttlebutt clients maintain a set of feeds that they are interested in. These could be feeds that the user has followed, bookmarked or subscribed to. When peers connect, one of the first things they do is ask each other whether the feeds they are interested in have any new messages.</p>
        
        <p>The RPC procedure <em>createHistoryStream</em> is how peers ask each other for a list of messages in a particular feed.</p>

        <h2 id="blobs">Blobs</h2>
        <p>A blob is binary data. Blobs are referred to from Scuttlebutt messages and stored by peers in the network. When a user attaches an image to their post, that image is stored as a blob and the message contains a link to it.</p>
        <p>Being just a sequence of bytes, blobs can contain any data, unlike feeds and messages which have a specific structure. Blobs can handle much larger amounts of data than feeds or messages, which is why they are stored separately. However, clients may decide to not replicate blobs larger than a chosen size, which defaults to 5 megabytes in current implementations.</p>
        <p>Blobs are referred to by their blob ID:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/format_blob_id.png" alt="&amp;uaGieSQDJcHfUp6hjIcIq55GoZh4Ug7tNmgaohoxrpw=.sha256 where everything between &amp; and .sha256 is the base64-encoding of the sha256 hash of the blob"/>
        <p>Blobs are immutable because their ID contains a hash of their contents. This allows peers to fetch blobs from anyone in the network and know they haven’t been tampered with.</p>
        <p>When a Scuttlebutt implementation receives a new message and sees that it references a blob, it might be a good time to fetch that blob so that the complete message will be available to show the user.</p>

        <h3 id="fetching">Fetching</h3>
        <p>There are two RPC methods for fetching blobs. To get an entire blob use <em>blobs.get</em>, or for only part of the blob use <em>blobs.getSlice</em>.</p>
        

        <h4 id="blobs.get">blobs.get</h4>
        <p><em>blobs.get</em> asks a peer to send you the contents of a blob. There is one argument which is the blob ID:</p>
        <figure>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{
  &#34;name&#34;: [&#34;blobs&#34;, &#34;get&#34;],
  &#34;type&#34;: &#34;source&#34;,
  &#34;args&#34;: [&#34;&amp;uaGieSQDJcHfUp6hjIcIq55GoZh4Ug7tNmgaohoxrpw=.sha256&#34;]
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
        </figure>

        <p>Now the responder begins streaming back the contents of the blob. Each response has a body type of binary and contains a piece of the blob, starting from the beginning.</p>
        <p>This particular blob is 161,699 bytes long and the responder has decided to send it in pieces of 65,536 bytes each. That means two full pieces of 65,536 bytes will be sent and a final piece with the remaining 30,627 bytes.</p>

        <p>Upon receiving the blob the requester should check that what they received matches the sha256 checksum they asked for.</p>

        <p><em>blobs.get</em> has an alternate form where the first argument is a JSON dictionary of options:</p>
        <figure>
            <div>
                
                <pre><code>{

      &#34;size&#34;: 161699,
      &#34;max&#34;: 200000
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
        </figure>

        <p>Valid options are:</p>
        <table>
            <tbody><tr>
                <td>hash</td>
                <td>ID of the blob. Required.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>size</td>
                <td>Expected size of the blob in bytes. If the blob is not exactly this size then reject the request. Optional.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>max</td>
                <td>Maximum size of the blob in bytes. If the blob is larger then reject the request. Only makes sense to specify <em>max</em> if you don’t already know <em>size</em>. Optional.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>This form allows the responder to reject the request if the blob is not the expected size or too large. When a request is rejected the responder sends back a single message with the end/err flag set containing a JSON error message.</p>

        <h4 id="blobs.getSlice">blobs.getSlice</h4>
        <p><em>blobs.getSlice</em> works like <em>blobs.get</em> but rather than receiving the entire blob, the requester specifies a start and end point and the responder only sends back bytes within that range.</p>
        <p>Reasons for using <em>blobs.getSlice</em> could be to download a blob in pieces from many peers at once, to resume a partially-completed download or to fetch the first part of a video to show a preview. Though beware that if you only fetch part of a blob you cannot be sure that it hasn’t been tampered with. You need the whole blob to verify its integrity.</p>

        <p><em>Start</em> and <em>end</em> are byte offsets from the start of the blob and form a half-open interval, meaning the end byte is not included.</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/blobs_get_slice.png" alt="For example, start=4 and end=10 returns six bytes: bytes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; but not byte 10. (Bytes are numbered so that the first byte is byte 0)"/>
        <p>Specifying <em>start</em> = 0 means start from the beginning of the blob. Specifying <em>end</em> = <em>size of the blob</em> means keep going all the way to the end of the blob.</p>
        <p><em>blobs.getSlice</em> also accepts the <em>size</em> and <em>max</em> options, which work the same as in <em>blobs.get</em>. These two options refer to the size of the entire blob, not the range requested.</p>

        <h3 id="want-and-have">Want and have</h3>
        <p>Peers signal to each other which blobs they want and have. This lets peers know who they can fetch a particular blob from. It also allows requests for blobs to propagate through the network until a peer that has the blob is found.</p>
        
        <p>Upon connecting, peers typically invoke the RPC method <em>blobs.createWants</em> on each other. <em>blobs.createWants</em> asks a peer to tell you which blobs they want, and also allows the peer to tell you which blobs they have.</p>

            </div>
        </figure>

        <p>Responding with an empty dictionary <code>{}</code> means they don’t currently want any blobs. Later, when they want a particular blob the responder will send another response back:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>
            <div>

            </div>
        </figure>
        

        <p>The <code>-1</code> means the responder wants this blob themselves. <code>-2</code> means they know someone who wants the blob. <code>-3</code> means they know someone who knows someone who wants the blob, and so on.</p>
        <p>If a peer tells you that they want a blob and you don’t have it yourself then you can forward the want to other peers you are connected to. When forwarding a request, remember to subtract one from the number so that the request does not keep propagating through the network in an infinite loop.</p>
        <p>Implementations can pick a limit and ignore blob requests that come from further out than their threshold. The reference implementation forwards requests with <code>-1</code> or <code>-2</code>, but does not forward requests with <code>-3</code> or further out.</p>
        <p>If the responder does in fact have the blob, they can respond with its size in bytes:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/arrow.png" alt=""/>

        </figure>
        

        <p>Now the requester knows they can retrieve the blob from this peer with <em>blobs.get</em> or <em>blobs.getSlice</em>.

Peer B then tells Peer A: &#39;Have: &amp;uaGie&#39;. Peer A hen requests &#39;Get: &amp;uaGie&#39; from B, and B answers with the blob."/>

        <h2 id="following">Following</h2>
        <p>Feeds can follow other feeds. Following is a way of saying “I am interested in the messages posted by this feed”.</p>
        
        <p>Following is an optional part of Scuttlebutt, however current clients do implement it because it enables interesting social dynamics, such as introducing people that otherwise wouldn’t have found each other and allowing trust to be built within human networks. Following is what enables Scuttlebutt to be a social network rather than a group messenger.</p>

        <p>When a user wants to follow another feed their client will post a message to their own feed that looks like:</p>
        
        <pre><code>{
  &#34;author&#34;: &#34;@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519&#34;,
  &#34;content&#34;: {
    &#34;type&#34;: &#34;contact&#34;,
    &#34;contact&#34;: &#34;@sxlUkN7dW/qZ23Wid6J1IAnqWEJ3V13dT6TaFtn5LTc=.ed25519&#34;,
    &#34;following&#34;: true
  },
  …
}</code></pre>
        <p>Later, if the user decides to unfollow this feed, their client can post another message with <em>following</em> set to <code>false</code>.</p>
        <p>When two feeds follow each other current user interfaces will call them “friends”, however this is just a cosmetic touch and for everything else they are still treated as individual follows in each direction.</p>

        <h3 id="follow-graph">Follow graph</h3>
        <p>Because each feed publicly announces which feeds it is following, clients can arrange feeds into a graph of who follows who:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/follow_graph.png" alt="The follow graph seen by a user is a directed graph, &#39;rooted&#39; in the user. It can be seen as concentric circles, with the user in the center, and feeds arranged by proximity to the user according to the number of hops. First, feeds directly followed by the user. Then feeds not directly followed by visible in the user interface (2 hops or more). Then feeds not visible, whose content is fetched by the client nontheless. Then feeds the client has need mentioned but chosen not to fetch."/>
        <p>Clients may want to use the follow graph to decide which feeds to display to the user and which to replicate. If the user explicitly follows a feed that is a strong signal that the user wants to see messages posted by that feed.</p>
        <p>One implementation, Patchwork, shows messages up to 2 hops out by default. Messages from feeds 3 hops out are replicated to help keep them available for others, but not directly shown in the user interface. A benefit of replicating at a greater range is that for discussion threads with lots of participants it’s more likely that the client will be able to fill in gaps where someone posted who was further than 2 hops out.</p>
        <p>Clients could also let users configure how far the visibility and replication ranges are, or a client could use an entirely different method of deciding which feeds to show and replicate that is not based on follow range.</p>

        <h2 id="pubs">Pubs</h2>
        <p>A pub is a publicly-accessible Scuttlebutt peer. Pubs have a social and a technical purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pubs serve as a gathering point for new users to find other people and for existing users to welcome people who have just joined.</li>
            <li>Pubs have a stable IP address and allow incoming TCP connections, which enables users to connect even if their internet service provider lacks dedicated IP addresses or refuses incoming connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pubs speak the same protocol as regular peers and behave like regular peers except that they are normally run on servers so that they are always online.</p>
        <p>Joining a pub means following it and having it follow you back. After a new user joins a pub they will be able to see posts by the pub’s other members, and crucially the other members will be able to see the new member. This works because everyone is now within 2 hops of each other:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/follow_perspective.png" alt="From a new user perspective, the pub will be 1 hop from them, and existing users will be 2 hops from them. From the pub&#39;s perspective, all users who are members of the pub are 1 hop from it. From existing users&#39; perspective, the pub is 1 hop from them, and both the new user and other existing users are 2 hops away."/>
        <p>After joining a pub, a user may decide to follow some of its members directly, in which case the pub is no longer needed for feed visibility but is still useful for accepting TCP connections and replicating messages.</p>

        <h3 id="invites">Invites</h3>
        <p>Any user can follow a pub by posting a follow message, but to get the pub to follow you back you need an invite.</p>
        <div>
            <p>How the pub hands out invites is for its operator to decide. Some pubs have a web page that anybody can visit to generate an invite code. Some pubs have a pre-generated list of invite codes that the operator distributes. Invite codes can be single-use-only, have a maximum number of uses before they expire, or keep working indefinitely. A single user can use several invites if they wish to join several different pubs.</p>
            <p>Invite codes use this format:</p>
        </div>
        
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/format_invite.png" alt="one.butt.nz:8008:@VJM7w1W19ZsKmG2KnfaoKIM66BRoreEkzaVm/J//wl8=.ed25519~r4hIBk7KC7a9Gknj6Qiuuo4+Et/TS2rjgl6gYgw3OIM=. the parts are: a domain name or IP address of the pub, a colon, the port, a colon, the pub&#39;s public key (prefixed with an @ and suffixed with .ed25519 as usual), a tilde, then the base64-encoded invite secret key."/>
        <p>To make a new invite code, a pub generates a new Ed25519 key pair. The seed for the key pair (derived from the secret key) goes into the invite code, which is given to either a new user or the pub operator to distribute. The public key is remembered by the pub along with any extra conditions such as the number of remaining uses or expiry date.</p>

        <h4 id="redeeming-invites">Redeeming invites</h4>
        <p>To redeem an invite, a user enters the invite code into their Scuttlebutt client. The client opens a new TCP connection to the domain and port contained in the invite and proceeds to set up a peer connection, starting with the handshake.</p>
        
        <p>However, unlike a regular handshake, the client uses the secret key in the invite as their <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/key_big_a_secret.png" alt=""/> long term secret key. Because the invite only contains the secret key but not the public key, the client will need to calculate the public key from the secret key. Some cryptographic libraries call this “seeding” an Ed25519 key pair.</p>
        <p>Handshaking with the invite key allows the client to call a special RPC method <em>invite.use</em>:</p>

        
        <figure>
            <div>

        </figure>
        <p>The pub checks the key used in the handshake against its list of unredeemed invites. If the invite code is valid and has not expired, the pub follows the feed ID specified by the requester and responds with its new follow message:</p>

        <p>Because this a pub, it is probably connected to a few other peers already. The pub will notify its peers of its new follow message using the normal <em>createHistoryStream</em> mechanism, at which point other users of the pub may decide that they are now interested in this new user’s feed and fetch it.</p>
        <p>Now that the pub has followed the new user, the new user should reciprocate by following the pub back. Clients automatically handle this on behalf of the user when they enter an invite code. The client posts a message to the user’s feed that follows the pub back:</p>
        <pre><code>{
  &#34;author&#34;: &#34;@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519&#34;,

    &#34;following&#34;: true
  },
  …
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>The client also posts a message of type <em>pub</em> to the user’s feed:</p>
        <pre><code>{
  &#34;author&#34;: &#34;@FCX/tsDLpubCPKKfIrw4gc+SQkHcaD17s7GI6i/ziWY=.ed25519&#34;,

    }
  },
  …
}</code></pre>
        <p>These messages help peers discover new pubs where they might be able to fetch new messages from. Clients can maintain a list of pubs they have seen so that they know of alternative places to fetch messages from in case a pub goes offline.</p>

        <h2 id="private-messages">Private messages</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Private messages are encrypted so that only certain recipients can read them. They are posted to the sender’s Scuttlebutt feed like normal messages.</p>
            <p>Anyone can see the fact that a feed posted a private message, who sent it (the feed that posted it), when it was sent and its size. However the list of recipients, number of recipients and message body is concealed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Given the user wants to post these message contents:</p>

        <p>When a client sees a message where the content is a string ending in <code>.box</code> it will know that it is a private message. Because clients can’t see who the message is addressed to, they will attempt to decrypt every private message they come across in case it is for them.</p>

        <h3 id="encrypting">Encrypting</h3>
        <p>To encrypt a private message, the sender starts with these keys:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/private_message_starting_keys.png" alt="A generated Curve25519 key pair used to encrypt the message header, call the &#39;header key&#39;; a generated 32-byte secret key used to encrypt the message body called the &#39;body key&#39;; and the public long-term key of each recipient (max 7)."/>
        <p>Next, the sender uses scalar multiplication to derive a shared secret for each recipient:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/private_message_secret_derivation.png" alt="by computing the product of the secret key they just generated and that recipient&#39;s public long-term key."/>
        <p>The sender constructs the encrypted message by first enclosing the message content in a secret box, then enclosing the key needed to open it into a series of additional secret boxes, one to each recipient:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/private_message_encrypt.png" alt="The plaintext message content is enclosed in a secret box using the public &#39;body key&#39; and a random 24-byte nonce; this box is 16 bytes (the auth tag) plus the original length of the message. The sender prepares a temporary header, made of the number of recipients (1 byte) and the secret body key (32 bytes). This temporary header is then enclosed as many times as there are recipients, in as many secret boxes (the &#39;encrypted headers&#39;, 16 + 33 bytes each, as they each include their own auth tag). The final message is made of: the 24 bytes nonce (defined above), the public header key (32 bytes), all the encrypted headers (49 bytes each), and finally the encrypted message content (at least 16 + 1 bytes)."/>

        <h3 id="decrypting">Decrypting</h3>
        <p>Decrypting a private message involves scanning through the series of header secret boxes to see if any of them open using your long-term secret key. Then, if one of them opens, taking out the body secret key and using it to open the secret box holding the message content:</p>
        <img src="https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/img/private_message_decrypt.png" alt="base64-decode the message, extract the nonce and the public header key at the beginning. Then use the secret long-term key and the header public key to compute the shared secret. Read the first 49 bytes of the encrypted headers and try to open it as a secret box. If that fails, try the next 49 bytes. Keep trying up to 7 times. If the shared secret opens a secret box, then this message is intended for you. Read the number of recipients and body secret key. Now that you know how many recipients there are, skip forward 49 bytes for each remaining header. Finally open the secret box using the body secret key and read the content."/>
