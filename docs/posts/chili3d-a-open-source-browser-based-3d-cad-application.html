    <h1>Show HN: Chili3d – A open-source, browser-based 3D CAD application</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I&#39;m currently developing Chili3D, an open-source, browser-based 3D CAD application. By compiling OpenCascade to WebAssembly and integrating Three.js, Chili3D delivers near-native performance for powerful online modeling, editing, and rendering—all without local installation. Access it here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/xiangechen/chili3d">https://github.com/xiangechen/chili3d</a></p><p>Features:</p><p>Modeling Tools: Create basic shapes (boxes, cylinders, cones, etc.), 2D sketches (lines, arcs, circles, etc.), and perform advanced operations (boolean operations, extrusion, revolution, etc.).</p><p>Snapping and Tracking: Precisely snap to geometric features, workplanes, and track axes for accurate alignment.</p><p>Editing Tools: Modify (chamfer, fillet, trim, etc.), transform (move, rotate, mirror), and perform advanced edits (feature removal, sub-shape manipulation).</p><p>Measurement Tools: Measure angles and lengths, and calculate sums of length, area, and volume.</p><p>Document Management: Create, open, and save documents, with full undo/redo history and support for importing/exporting STEP, IGES, BREP formats.</p><p>User Interface: Office-style interface with contextual command organization, hierarchical assembly management, dynamic workplanes, and 3D viewport controls.</p><p>Multi-Language Support: Built-in i18n support with current languages including Chinese and English.</p></div></td></div></div>
