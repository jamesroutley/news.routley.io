    <h1>Value-based pricing can be a trap for early startups</h1>

    <p>2024-10-03<span> • 2 minutes to read</span></p></section><article><p>Founders are often told to price based on the value they are providing to their customers. For example, if you’re saving your customer 1 million dollars, charge a 10th of that. <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6h-startup-pricing-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s</a> Kevin Hale at YC advocating for this approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In startups, and almost pretty consistently across all businesses, everyone will tell you, you should strive for value-based pricing. It allows you to charge a whole lot more. It allows you to manipulate this incentive to buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we’re just talking about the short-term, this is good advice. Over the long-term, the situation is more complicated.</p>
<p>First, if you don’t have strong network effects, high switching costs, or economies of scale, then the increased margin you get from value-based pricing is — to paraphase Jeff Bezos — someone else’s opportunity to disrupt you. A high-margin business can get fat and slow and unable to muster the will to do the deep cuts to compete with an upstart on price.</p>
<p>Second, the relative power of your economies of scale, network effects, and switching costs are a function of your market share. When you use value-based pricing early on in your startup’s journey, you’re hamstringing your growth and your ability to gain these important sources of sustainable competitive advantage. All other things equal, a more savy startup that sticks to cost+ pricing to penetrate the market more quickly will get these competitive advantages faster and win.</p>
<p>Now, some caveats.</p>
<p>Investors like to see big margins, and you may need to prove that you can sustain high margins in a subset of your deals to make them happy and raise another round, but applying value-based pricing to every deal is overkill.</p>
<p>Moreover,you may be selling a very price-inelastic product in which case higher prices won’t meaningfully slow your growth rate. Value-based pricing is fine here, but unless your first to market — something that is increasingly difficult to do after decades of VC being dumped into software — this probably isn’t you.</p>
<p>But what the hell do I know? I’m currently in the process of winding down a failed startup, so I might be full of shit. Here’s a more certain truth: Josh Shroyer, our founding engineer is a hell of a catch, and you should hire him if you can.
