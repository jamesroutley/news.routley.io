<p>It feels like every week a new mindblowing Ai assistant pops up, tools like D-alle, Whisper, Copilot etc.
Have all been amazing and useful to me.</p>

Yesterday I saw this tweet about using GPT chat.
</p><p>I had never tried GPT chat and this got me very keen in doing so!
I quickly tried it on some of the code examples we use in our courses as examples of hard-to-find bugs or
code in need of refactoring and I was more than amazed that one code challenge that
1/100 engineers find was found ‘easily’ by GPT chat and it also provided the suggested refactor to remove it.</p><p>Today Advent Of Code started so I’m naturally curious how far I can come with minimal guidance of these code-writing Ais.</p><p>If you want to do the challenges yourself or with your Ai friend visit <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/">Advent Of Code</a>.</p><p>I wrote a little instruction on where to find the question that needed to be answered, that I wanted the answer printed, and please don’t use any libraries.</p><p>Then I just pasted the whole question in full to the GPT chat.</p></div>
