    <h1>Why “OpenBSD Mastery: Filesystems” Is Not in Amazon’s Kindle Store</h1>

		<p>I expect folks to ask this, so here’s a pre-emptive blog post.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/os#omf">OpenBSD Mastery: Filesystems</a> for Kindle <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/omf/">direct from me at Tilted Windmill Press</a> or at <a href="https://mwlucas.gumroad.com/l/omf">Gumroad</a>. You can get a Kindle-friendly ebook from any number of other retailers, but while they’re all supposed to be DRM-free I can’t advise on prying the file out of another vendor’s ecosystem. The one place you cannot buy OMF for Kindle is Amazon’s Kindle bookstore.</p>
<p>TLDR: <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200644210">Amazon pays roughly 70% of retail price for books priced up to $9.99, and 35% for books $10 and over</a>. Amazon is the only retailer that does this. Other retailers, I make somewhere around 65%-70% no matter the retail price. Everything follows from that math, but if you want the details read on.</p>
<p>According to economists, <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2012?amount=1">prices have gone up about 30% since I started releasing the Mastery books</a>. According to my wallet, not so much. In 2012 I could get a cheap lunch for my wife and I for $10. I paid $18 last weekend. But let’s go with the official numbers. Just as “dime novels” now cost $10, I must raise prices. While book pricing is hotly debated, $11.99 is a reasonable price for a short tech book like <em>OpenBSD Mastery: Filesystems</em>.</p>
<p>If I charge $9.99 for this ebook, I make about $7.</p>
<p>If I charge $11.99 for the ebook, I make about $8.40 everywhere but Amazon. At Amazon, I make $4.20. For me to make that $8.40 at Amazon, I must price the book at $23.99. I’m fond of the book, but it ain’t worth that! And if I did, giving Amazon a $15.59 slice of every sale <em>for no reason</em> sticks in my craw.</p>
<p>Charge $23.99 at Amazon and $11.99 elsewhere? <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200634500">Amazon’s program has a Most Favored Nation clause</a>. They can price match any other major vendor.</p>
<p>Will Amazon change their business because of this? No. Authors are plentiful and of low value. I am not worth Amazon’s time.</p>
<p>Amazon’s business model is based on squeezing prices down, and they play a long game. I don’t expect them to ever raise that $9.99 limit. A novel might sell tens or hundreds of thousands of copies. If I’m lucky, a book like <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/os#omf">OpenBSD Mastery: Filesystems</a> <em>might </em>sell four thousand. The few extra bucks I’ll make by raising prices are important. That’s also why I’ve focused so hard on disintermediation through my Patronizers, sponsorships, and lately Kickstarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://mwl.io/archives/12806">I have been expecting this for years now</a>. I do not expect to publish future Mastery books on Amazon’s Kindle store, unless by some chance I write <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ed">another very short one</a>.</p>
