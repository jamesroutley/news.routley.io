        <p>A disturbing trend in consumer electronics has been a steady disappearance of replaceable batteries on our devices. Finding a mobile phone with a swapable battery is a struggle, and many other devices follow the trend by sealing in a Li-Po cell. The result is an ever-shorter life for electronics, and a greater problem with devices going to recycling or worse still, landfill. Hope is at hand though, thanks to <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20221205IPR60614/batteries-deal-on-new-eu-rules-for-design-production-and-waste-treatment" target="_blank">a proposed European Union law</a> that would if passed make batteries in appliances “<em>designed so that consumers can easily remove and replace them themselves</em>“.</p>
<p>In case any readers in the rest of the world wonder what it has to do with them, the EU represents such a huge market that manufacturers can neither ignore it, nor in most cases afford to make separate EU and rest-of-world versions of their products. Thus if the EU requires something for sale in its territories, in most cases it becomes the <em>de facto</em> norm for anything designed to be sold worldwide. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/10/09/europeans-now-have-the-right-to-repair-and-that-means-the-rest-of-us-probably-will-too/">We’ve already seen this with the EU’s right to repair legislation</a>, and while we have not doubt that manufacturers will do their best to impede this new law we don’t think they will ultimately prevail.</p>
