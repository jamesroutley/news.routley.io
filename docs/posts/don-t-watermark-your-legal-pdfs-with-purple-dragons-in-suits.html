    <h1>Don&#39;t watermark your legal PDFs with purple dragons in suits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>Being a model citizen and a person of taste, you probably don&#39;t <em>need</em> this reminder, but some others do: Federal judges do not like it when lawyers electronically watermark every page of their legal PDFs with a gigantic image—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/dragon-lawyer-lawsuit.html">purchased for $20 online</a>—of a purple dragon wearing a suit and tie. Not even if your firm&#39;s name is &#34;Dragon Lawyers.&#34;</p>
<p>Federal Magistrate Judge Ray Kent of the Western District of Michigan was unamused by a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988.1.0.pdf">recent complaint</a> (PDF) that prominently featured the aubergine wyrm.</p>
<p>&#34;Each page of plaintiff’s complaint appears on an e-filing which is dominated by a large multi-colored cartoon dragon dressed in a suit,&#34; he <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988.6.0.pdf">wrote on April 28</a> (PDF). &#34;Use of this dragon cartoon logo is not only distracting, it is juvenile and impertinent. The Court is not a cartoon.&#34;</p>
<p>Kent then ordered &#34;that plaintiff shall not file any other documents with the cartoon dragon or other inappropriate content.&#34;</p>

<p>The unusual order generated coverage across the legal blogging community, which was apparently <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ensorcell">ensorcelled</a> by a spell requiring headline writers to use dragon-related puns, including:</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
