</div><p>A <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-01-private-lunar-landers-moon-roundabout.html">private lunar lander</a> from Japan is now circling <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-04-soil-moon-side-drier-conditions.html">the moon</a>, with just another month to go before it attempts a touchdown.</p>


										    
																					<p>Tokyo-based ispace said Wednesday morning its Resilience lander entered <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lunar+orbit/" rel="tag">lunar orbit</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;The countdown to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lunar+landing/" rel="tag">lunar landing</a> has now officially begun,&#34; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched Resilience with U.S-based Firefly Aerospace&#39;s <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-03-private-lunar-lander-blue-ghost.html">lunar lander</a> in January. Firefly got there first in March, becoming the first private outfit to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Another American company, Intuitive Machines, landed a spacecraft on the moon a few days later, but it ended up sideways in a crater.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s ispace&#39;s turn. It&#39;s targeting the first week of June for Resilience&#39;s touchdown. The company&#39;s first lander crashed into the moon in 2023.</p>
<p>The lander holds a mini rover equipped with a scoop to gather lunar dirt for analysis as well as other experiments.</p>
