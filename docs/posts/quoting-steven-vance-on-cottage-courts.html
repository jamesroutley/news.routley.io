<blockquote>
  <p>One of the many benefits of allowing pocket neighborhoods and cottage courts is being able to share high land costs. That, and sharing child care duties, are primary reasons that Phil Levin and Kristen Berman created “Radish”, a pocket neighborhood in Oakland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpnWfidzYnc">The video</a> of their compound does a great job of highlighting the upsides, however I wish they would have gone deeper into the details of how finances and decision-making were done. They seem to paint everything as utopian, but my cynical Northeastern brain wants to know what happens when somebody doesn’t do their chores or somebody misses a bill or any of the number of conflicts that can arise from shared living arrangements. Having a toolkit for conflict-resolution seems like a critically important aspect of living in a functional community.</p>

<p>I’m also a bit skeptical of the premise of the video’s title: “Friends couldn’t afford rent. Pooled together to buy homes instead,” given that Phil Levin’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillevin/">LinkedIn profile</a> lists him as a former Meta employee and founder of Culdesac. I mention this only to make the point that this is a less interesting example if the solution to all of these problems is just “have more money to throw around.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I share their conviction that living in proximity to friends and community is a great idea. I also love the idea of using accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to infill suburbs and make this goal more achievable. There is certainly something to be learned from and experimented with here!</p>
