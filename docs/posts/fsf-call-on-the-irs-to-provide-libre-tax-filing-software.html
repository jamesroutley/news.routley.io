        <div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>How did you file your taxes this year? Millions of US taxpayers file
their taxes using proprietary software such as TurboTax. Many feel
they have no other option than to use nonfree software or a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html">Service
as a Software Substitute (SaaSS)</a>, giving up their freedom as well
as their most private financial information to a third-party company,
in order to file taxes. Fortunately, upcoming legislation gives us a
chance to change this. The <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/files-taxes-free-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a> requires the
IRS to research a government-operated gratis tax return system. $15
million of the $80 billion that was approved for the tax agency by the
Act is allocated for this. On April 5, the IRS released a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3744.pdf">plan</a>
for how it intends to improve the tax system. This plan includes the
promise to further explore an &#34;electronic service to prepare and file
tax returns directly with the IRS.&#34; To do so, the IRS intends to
&#34;study taxpayer preferences for products. The results of the study
will inform if and how the IRS should design such a service.&#34;</p>
<p>This is an invitation to tell the IRS about the importance of free (as
in freedom) software. The Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund
launched a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/tell-irs-commissioner-implement-a-free-simple-tax-filing-system-that-saves-taxpayers-time-and-money?nowrapper=true">petition</a> calling for a gratis, &#34;simple tax filing
system that saves taxpayers time and money.&#34; This is not enough! We
<em>need</em> a tax filing system in which every taxpayer can file their
taxes entirely with free software. There are already some
<a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile">providers</a> who allow eligible people to file their taxes free of
charge, but none of the software offered is free as in freedom.</p>
<h2>Take Action</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s call on the IRS to make a website for filing your tax return
which respects your freedom. This is your chance. Write to the new IRS
commissioner Daniel Werfel with your message. It can be as simple as:</p>
<blockquote> 
Dear Commissioner Werfel,
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

Thank you for exploring an electronic service for preparing and filing
returns directly with the IRS. Your Internal Revenue Service Inflation
Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan states that you intend to
&#34;study taxpayer preferences for products.&#34; I would like to share my
strong preference for a software that respects the taxpayer&#39;s freedom,
i.e. free (as in freedom) software. A free society like the United
States needs free/libre software, especially in the public sector.
Please visit the Free Software Foundations website at
https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software to learn more about
free/libre software. You can email campaigns@fsf.org if you have any
questions.

</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
Thank you for your consideration.
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
Sincerely, 
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
[Your name] 
</blockquote>

<p>Look up the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/where-to-file-paper-tax-returns-with-or-without-a-payment">address</a> of your state&#39;s tax filing institution and
send your letter to this address. Post your letter on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/share">social
media</a> to inspire others to do the same.</p>
