The price differs depending on which country a subscriber resides in, while other users can still use X for free.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One risk of putting X behind a paywall is that the platform may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the company&#39;s income.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In recent weeks, the company <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67097020">has been investigated by the European Union</a> for the possible spread of terrorist and violent content and hate speech, after Hamas&#39;s attack on Israel.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>It <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67119677">has also been fined by Australia&#39;s internet safety watchdog</a> for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.</p></div></div></article></main></div></div>
