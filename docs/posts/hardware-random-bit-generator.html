The article appearing below was one of my recent posts to the <a href="news:sci.crypt">sci.crypt</a> newsgroup. These are some notes about
building a hardware random bit generator. Johnny von Neumann once said that
anybody who contemplates arithmetic methods for the generation of random
numbers is in a state of sin. What he meant by that is this: if you try to
generate random numbers using only software, the results will necessarily
depend on the state of your machine at the outset of the process, and are
therefore (at least in principle) insecure. That is, somebody could
conceivably reconstruct your <i>allegedly random</i> bitstream.
<p>
Now in fact, programs like PGP and Linux&#39;s /dev/random driver do a remarkably
good job of keeping track of entropy from the different sources of randomness
available in your computer, and it&#39;s extraordinarily unlikely that anybody
would be able to figure out anything worthwhile about your PGP secret key by
stealing and disassembling your computer weeks or months after you generated
your key pair. But it&#39;s always nice to know that you have an even more secure
option available. Some folks at UC Berkeley have compiled an excellent list
of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/netscape-randomness.html">web
randomness resources</a>, including source code and writings about PGP and
/dev/random.
</p><p>
This circuit uses <i>avalanche noise</i> in a reverse-biased PN junction, the
emitter-base junction of the first transistor. The second transistor amplifies
it. The first two ALS04 inverters are biased into a linear region where they
act like op amps, and they amplify it further. The third inverter amplifies
it some more, and clips it to TTL levels. You can find out more about
avalanche noise by reading the &#34;Noise Diodes&#34; section of the
<a href="http://www.avtechpulse.com/faq.html/">
Unusual Diode FAQ</a>, or Terry Ritter&#39;s

noise</a>.

There are a couple of options for coming up with +18 volts. You can put two
nine-volt batteries in series, or you can use a Maxim MAX232 line converter.
The MAX232 part runs off five volts (which you&#39;ll need anyway for the 74ALS04)
and has a clever switching circuit to generate +10 volts and -10 volts, which
it uses for sending RS232 signals. So connect the +10 volts to the top of the
15K resistor, and the -10 volts to the emitter of the second NPN transistor
(where I&#39;ve shown a ground in the schematic). The output of the transistor
stage is AC-coupled thru a capacitor, so this offset won&#39;t hurt anything, and
there&#39;s nothing magical about 18 volts as opposed to 20 volts. Within
reasonable limits, more is better, since you&#39;re trying to induce an avalanche
effect in the emitter-base junction of the first transistor.
</p><p>
Now that you have the 74ALS04 and the MAX232 part on your board, you&#39;re all
set to add a PIC controller to sample the output and format it into a stream
of RS232 bytes. Just time bit lengths, add a start bit and a stop bit and a
little time between consecutive characters, and ship them out. You can send
them directly into the serial port of a PC, Linux box, or Mac. Macs can accept
RS232 signals using an RS422 cable, I believe.
</p><p>
So here is the sci.crypt article:
</p><pre>James Pate Williams has been establishing the good precedent of posting
useful things to Usenet that we wouldn&#39;t want to lose (C source code for
crypto-related algorithms). These are then picked up by Deja News and
other organizations that regularly collect snapshots of Usenet and the
web. In keeping with his precedent, and in view of recent events, I&#39;m
reposting a circuit from a couple of years ago which produces reasonably
random bits at very low cost. With a little software help, these bits
can be made arbitrarily secure.

Bits from this circuit have a lot of entropy, but they&#39;re not entirely
unbiased. To generate 128 really random bits, collect 1000 or 2000 bits
from this circuit, and hash them using MD5 or SHA. A hash ratio of 10:1
or 20:1 should be adequate to thwart any electromagnetic attack intended
to influence or predetermine the final 128 bits. The bandwidth on this
circuit is fairly high; the output of the final inverter can be sampled
as often as every few microseconds. On an oscilloscope, obviously visible
autocorrelations trailed off at about 200 or 300 nanoseconds. The higher
the amplifier bandwidth, the lower the autocorrelation. It&#39;s a good idea
to experiment with the R and C values and see if you can do better than
I did.

One thing I&#39;ve thought of doing but never quite had the energy was to make
a board with one of these bit generators and a PIC controller. The PIC
could format bytes for RS-232 transmission, and might even be capable of
doing the hash. Many microcontroller evaluation boards include small areas
of board space for little circuits, and this circuit should fit into at
least some of them.

Reference to an earlier article from 1995, when I actually built and tested
the circuit:

This really should be in a FAQ somewhere. There are various ways to do
this. People talk about using radioactive sources, and that probably
gives better randomness, but a more practical approach is to use noise
from a reverse-biased PN junction. Some people like Zener diodes for
this; I prefer vanilla NPN transistors, such as 2n3904s. I use two of
them set up like this:

                        +18 volts
                        |
                        15K
                        |
                        +----- to next stage
                +-------+
                |       |
                E       C
                 B-----B
                C       E
                |       |
                no      Ground
             connect

Then I use two stages of 74ALS04 inverters, biased into their linear
range so they act like op amps. ALS gates have a good gain-bandwidth
product and they don&#39;t ring (like AS gates do). AC-couple the input
of the inverter with a 0.1uf cap, and put a 2.7K resistor from input
to output as feedback/bias. Two stages like that, and connect the
output of the second directly to the input of a third inverter. The
output of the third inverter is a fairly clean TTL-level signal. It
can be brought in one of the pins of a PC&#39;s printer port, or picked
up in any other convenient fashion.

The signal should not be sampled more often than every few hundred
nanoseconds, to avoid correlation between consecutive bits. There
will be a noticeable bias (1s more likely than 0s, or vice versa).
The bias can be greatly reduced by XORing a few raw bits together.
Probably a better idea is to take a large number of bits and use a
good hash function to reduce them to a smaller number.

I&#39;ve built a few bit generators of this sort, and looked at their
outputs on a spectrum analyzer. I didn&#39;t see any identifiable spikes.
But if you wanted to be super-paranoid, you could encase the thing
in a copper box surrounded by a mu-metal box, power it internally
with two 9-volt batteries, and use the last inverter to drive an
LED that shines thru a hole in the wall of the box to an external
phototransistor (better use a real fast phototransistor).

But I suspect that the same level of security can be achieved far
more easily just by hashing more bits together.

<h3>Nifty postscript!</h3>
Some students at Johns Hopkins have done some measurements on this
circuit and found that its output looks good according to several
statistical tests. (I&#39;ve seen comments elsewhere expressing concern
over the floating collector on the first transistor, and the possibility
that the output is biased. To the first, I recommend tying the collector
to the base. To the second, I agree, there&#39;s a bias, which is partly
why I recommend hashing the output.)
<p>
I don&#39;t think I held onto a copy of their statistical results. I&#39;ll
look around and include them if I find them.
</p><p>
Anyway, these folks at Johns Hopkins were interested in using the
circuit as input to the /dev/random device in Linux. I contacted
Theodore Ts&#39;o, one of the original authors of the /dev/random code,
and he explained how to do that:

Subject: Re: /dev/random questions

   Date: Wed, 3 May 2000 11:48:38 -0400 (EDT)
   From: Will Ware <wware@world.std.com>

   Hi, a few years back I posted a web page describing an inexpensive
   hardware random bit generator using PN junction noise. I have recently
   been contacted by Joel Sandin at Johns Hopkins who is tinkering with
   the circuit. Wanting to be helpful (but being really pretty clueless
   about Linux kernel stuff), I started looking at the source for
   /dev/random, and noticed that the random_write() function adds new
   bytes to the entropy pool. I assume this gets invoked when somebody
   with root access does something like:

       cat bunch_o_bytes &gt; /dev/random

   My question (beyond &#34;is my understanding correct so far?&#34;) is, how do
   you tell /dev/random how many bits of entropy to expect for each bit
   you write to it? And how does one characterize the entropy of a source?
   Joel has been running some diehard tests and getting what look like
   good results.

In order to tell /dev/random how many bits of entropy, there is an
ioctl, RNDADDENTROPY, and then a pointer to a structure which looks like
this:

struct rand_pool_info {
	int	entropy_count;
	int	buf_size;
	__u32	buf[MAX_ENT_BUF_SIZE];
};

This ioctl requires root access.  

The basic idea is that you have a user-mode daemon that receives the
input from the hwrand device driver, does whatever whitening, entropy
characterization is necessary (which may potentially be CPU intensive,
and so should be done in user-mode), and then uses this ioctl to feed
the data into the /dev/random entropy pool.

I hope this helps!  If you have any other questions, feel free to give
me a yell.

   The /dev/random source I&#39;ve been looking at is at
   http://www.openpgp.net/random/
   I don&#39;t know if this really is current, it claims to be.
   Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the latest, but it&#39;s closest for government work.
Looking at the latest Linux sources is generally the best way of getting
the very latest random code.
