<h2>
Concrete Mathematics and Bernoulli
</h2>
<p>
The sequence of Bernoulli numbers plays a prominent role in mathematics,
especially in connection with asymptotic expansions related to
Euler&#39;s summation formula. When I learned about this fascinating
sequence, during my undergraduate days,
I  was taught that $B_1$ is equal to minus one-half.
So I duly taught the same to my students, and went on to write books
that explained what I thought Bernoulli and Euler had done.
</p>
<p>
But last year I took a close look at Peter Luschny&#39;s
<a href="http://luschny.de/math/zeta/The-Bernoulli-Manifesto.html">Bernoulli
manifesto</a>,
where he gives more than a dozen good reasons why the value of $B_1$
should really be <i>plus</i> one-half. He explains that some mathematicians
of the early 20th century had unilaterally
changed the conventions, because some of their
formulas came out a bit nicer when the negative value was used.
It was their well-intentioned but ultimately poor choice that had
led to what I&#39;d been taught in the 1950s.
</p>
<p>
Luschny&#39;s webpage cites, for example, recent treatments of the subject
by leading mathematicians such as Terence Tao. And his most compelling
argument, from my personal perspective, is the way he unveils the
early publications: I learned from him that my own presentation of
the story, in
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html"><cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite></a> and
much more extensively in
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/gkp.html"><cite>Concrete Mathematics</cite></a>,
was a violation of history! I had put words and thoughts into
Bernoulli and Euler&#39;s minds that were not theirs at all. This hurt,
because I&#39;ve always tried to present the evolution of ideas faithfully;
in this case I&#39;d fooled myself, by trying to conform what they wrote
to what I&#39;d learned.
</p>
<p>
By now, hundreds of books that use the “minus-one-half”
convention have unfortunately been written. Even worse, all the major
software systems for symbolic mathematics have that 20th-century aberration
deeply embedded.
Yet Luschny convinced me that we have all been wrong, and that it&#39;s
high time to change back to the correct definition before the situation
gets even worse.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I changed the definition of $B_1$ in all printings of
<cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite> during the latter half
of 2021. And the new (34th) printing of <cite>Concrete Mathematics</cite>,
released in January 2022, contains the much more extensive changes
that are needed to tell a more comprehensive story.
</p>
<p>
These changes to <cite>Concrete Mathematics</cite> are too numerous
to incorporate into the
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/gkp.html#errata">online errata</a>. Therefore I&#39;ve prepared
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/gkp34.pdf"><b>replacement pages</b></a>
for anybody who wants to upgrade their copy of the second edition.
</p>

<h2>
Weak Components Revived
</h2>
<p>
Speaking of unfortunate conventions in the math and CS literature,
I&#39;ve recently been surprised to learn that graph theory textbooks
still have a very weak way to define the concept of “weak
components” of a directed graph. They copy Harary&#39;s half-hearted
notion, originally stated almost as an afterthought,
by which a digraph&#39;s weak components are simply its ordinary
components when the directions of oriented edges are ignored.
Sometimes definitions are given just to fill up space instead
of to fill a need!
</p>
<p>
A far better way to define weak components was introduced by Ron Graham,
Theodor Motzkin, and yours truly in the paper “Complements and
transitive closures,” <cite>Discrete Mathematics</cite> <b>2</b> (1972),
17--29; reprinted as Chapter 25 of
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dm.html"><cite>Selected Papers on Discrete Mathematics</cite></a>.
This definition wins big because it has a rich theory and many practical
applications.
</p>
<p>
One nice way to think of it is by reference to strong components:
The strong components of a digraph give the weakest partition of the
vertices so that, when each part is collapsed into a single vertex,
we get a partial order. The weak components give the weakest partition
so that, when each part is collapsed into a single vertex, we get
a total order.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/strong-and-weak-comps.jpg" alt=""/>
For example, this digraph has 15 vertices (black dots),
9 strong components (in ovals),
and 4 weak components (separated by vertical lines).
</p>
<p>
Another nice way to think of it is by reference to ordinary connectivity:
A digraph is weakly connected if and only if cannot be divided into two
nonempty parts, L and R, such that (i) all vertices of R are reachable from
all vertices of L; but (ii) no vertices of L are reachable from any vertex
of R. Condition (ii) in an <i>undirected</i> graph is, of course,
ordinary connectivity.
</p>
<p>
Bob Tarjan has devised beautiful algorithms to find both strong and
weak components in linear time. I&#39;ve recently written an exposition
of those algorithms (and depth-first search in general), intended for
eventual publication in Section 7.4.1.2 of
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html"><cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite></a>.
You can read it here:
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc12a+.pdf"><tt>fasc12+.pdf</tt></a>
(and there&#39;s a 
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">reward of 0x$1.00</a> if you are the first to discover
an error). The theory of weak components is introduced on pages 11–14;
relevant exercises are on page 21; answers to those exercises are
on pages 31–33.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s all agree as soon as possible to use the easily understood term
<i>undirected components</i>,
or (as suggested by Doug West) <i>underlying components</i>,
for what many people have unfortunately
been calling weak components, and to celebrate the properties
of directed graphs whose weak components are defined in a truly useful way.

<h2>
Volume 4B exists
</h2>
<p>
The fourth volume of
<cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>
deals with Combinatorial Algorithms, the area of computer science
where good techniques have the most dramatic effects. I love it
the most, because one good idea can often make a program run
a million times faster. It&#39;s a huge, fascinating subject, and I
published Part 1 (Volume 4A, 883 pages, now in its twenty-first printing)
in 2011.
</p>
<p>
Ta da: My publishers have just told me that Part 2 (732 pages, now in its
first printing) arrived at their warehouse on September 28! Shipments
will begin early in October.
</p>
<p>
Full details, including a dozen reviews from people who have looked
closely at previews of the content, appear on the
<a href="https://www.informit.com/store/art-of-computer-programming-volume-4b-combinatorial-9780201038064">publisher&#39;s website</a>.
</p>
<p>
<SPAN size="2">
Preliminary versions of most of this material were published in
2015 and 2019 as <cite>Volume 4, Fascicle 6</cite> and
<cite>Volume 4, Fascicle 5</cite>. Errata to those paperbacks
can be found on the
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">TAOCP home page</a>.

</p>
<p>
<SPAN size="2">
I&#39;ve spent considerable time, while preparing many of the new exercises,
attempting to improve on expositions that I found in the literature.
And in several noteworthy cases, nobody has yet pointed out any
errors. It would be nice to believe that I actually got the details
right in my first attempt. But that seems unlikely, because I had
hundreds of chances to make mistakes. So I fear that the most probable
hypothesis is that nobody has been sufficiently motivated to check
the finer points out carefully as yet. 
</SPAN>
</p>
<p>
<SPAN size="2">
I still cling to a belief that these details are extremely instructive.
Thus I would like to enter here a plea for some readers to tell
me explicitly, “Dear Don, I have read exercise N and its answer
very carefully, and I believe that it is 100% correct,” where N is one
of the following exercises:

Please don&#39;t be alarmed by the highly technical nature of these examples;
more than 250 of the <i>other</i> exercises are <i>completely non-scary</i>,
indeed quite elementary. But of course I do want to go into high-level details also,
for the benefit of advanced readers; and those darker corners of my books
are naturally the most difficult to get right. Hence this plea for help.

<p>
<SPAN size="2">
Remember that you don&#39;t have to work the exercise first. You&#39;re allowed
to peek at the answer; in fact, you&#39;re even encouraged to do so.
Please send success reports to the usual address for bug reports

By the way, if you want to receive a

your best strategy may well be to scrutinize the answers to the exercises

<p>
Meanwhile I continue to work on Part 3 (Volume 4C), which
already has many exciting topics of its own. Those sections are
still in very preliminary form, but courageous readers who have
nothing better to do might dare to take a peek at the comparatively
raw copy in these “prefascicles.” One can look, for instance, at
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc8a.ps.gz">Pre-Fascicle 8a (Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles)</a>;
<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc9b.ps.gz">Pre-Fascicle 9b (A Potpourri of Puzzles)</a>.
