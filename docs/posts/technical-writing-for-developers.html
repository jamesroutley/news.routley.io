I encourage you to pick up pen and paper and draw your own as you read! </p><p><em>Important note:</em><span> In a real-world exercise, you’d bring stakeholders together for extensive discussions to identify system components and relationships. This would likely be the most time-consuming part of the exercise: for a highly complex system, it could take months! </span></p><p><em>Another important note:</em><span> The goal of drawing a causal loop diagram is not to diagram the entire system! It’s to create a usable tool to identify leverage points. So, a major goal of the diagramming process is to set boundaries for the model and hone in on the key system components and loops. There’s a significant risk that unless sufficiently diverse perspectives are involved in creating the diagram, key loops will be left out, and you’ll overlook key leverage points. </span></p><p>So, don’t think that bringing only managers to the table is likely to work well. If warehouse employees are stakeholders, bring them to the table. If suppliers are stakeholders, bring supplier reps to the table. Fight the tendency to get trapped in a perspective echo chamber of similar viewpoints.</p><p><span>So, let’s dive in.

Isn’t this all about boundaries? </strong></p><p><span>Yes, and we’re not going to diagram every component feeding into CPI. This is just a simple example. But you’ll see </span><em>how </em><span>to draw causal loop diagrams, and how to assess their components as pairs and then overall.</span></p><p>I’ll start by drawing a simple closed loop for how CPI affects food price expectations and resulting consumer behavior.

As John Sterman puts it in the book </span><em><a href="https://systemdynamics.org/product/business-dynamics-systems-thinking-and-modeling-for-a-complex-world/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Business Dynamics</a></em><span>, we’ll “trace the effect of a change around the loop.” (There’s a neat trick for checking our results afterward, too!)</span></p><p><span>We can start at any point on the loop and return to that same point. We’ll start with an assumption that food price expectations </span><em><strong>increase </strong></em><span>and then travel around the loop from there: </span></p><p><span>“If food price expectations increase, then hoarding behavior (stocking up) likely increases, which will likely increase household food supplies, which will likely decrease short-term future food demand, which will likely decrease food prices (after a delay for market adjustment), which will likely decrease CPI (after another delay for data collection), which will likely </span><em><strong>decrease</strong></em><span> food price expectations.” </span></p><p><span>Hold on. We changed direction. We started out with an </span><em>increase</em><span> in food price expectations and arrived back around with a </span><em>decrease</em><span> in food price expectations. If we go around again, continuing to follow our chain, we’ll change direction again: </span></p><p><span>“If food price expectations </span><em><strong>decrease</strong></em><span>, then hoarding behavior likely decreases, which will likely decrease household food supplies, which will likely increase short-term future food demand, which will likely increase food prices (after a delay for market adjustment), which will likely increase CPI (after another delay for data collection), which will likely </span><em><strong>increase</strong></em><span> food price expectations.”</span></p><p><span>This loop flips back and forth. It’s a balancing loop (aka a negative loop). It isn’t feeding some vicious spiral of price inflation or deflation. Yes, an exogenous (external) shock like massive crop destruction </span><em>could</em><span> cause such a spiral… but that would be a different loop, and it would connect to </span><em>this</em><span> loop at the point where it affected food prices. It might also dominate this loop, sending food prices and therefore CPI spiking despite the balancing nature of this loop in isolation. </span></p><p><strong>You mentioned a neat trick for double-checking the loop polarity.</strong></p><p>Sure thing. This is a shortcut, and you shouldn’t use it alone. But it’s a good double-check if you’ve already traced the effect of a change through a loop. </p><p><span>Here’s how you do it: in the loop, count the number of negative signs. In our example, that’s one. (Remember, we assessed the relationship between each pair of components individually.) </span><em><span>Because we have an odd number of negative signs, our loop is a </span><strong>balancing</strong><span> loop.</span></em><span> It tends to return a system to a goal state. In </span><em>Business Dynamics</em><span>, balancing loops are described as “goal-seeking”.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, </span><em><span>if we had a zero or even number of negative signs, then the loop would be a </span><strong>reinforcing</strong><span> loop. </span></em><span>Reinforcing loops (aka positive loops) tend to produce exponential growth or decay. </span></p><p><span>This trick can help you make sure that in tracing a change through an entire loop, you didn’t slip up somewhere. If there’s a discrepancy between the sign-counting shortcut and your change-tracing, trace the change again. Then trace another change, starting elsewhere in the loop. Sometimes it helps to talk it through out loud. Applying </span><em>both</em><span> thought processes increases the chance of accuracy in identifying loops correctly. </span></p><p><strong>How complex can these loop diagrams get? </strong></p><p>Very.
