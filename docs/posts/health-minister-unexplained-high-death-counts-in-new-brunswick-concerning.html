So that&#39;s a really important clue that a lot of it is likely COVID related,&#34; said Moriarty. </p><p>&#34;The level of excess mortality in New Brunswick during that period is enormous. And if it&#39;s not COVID killing people, what the hell is it?&#34; </p><p>Shephard said Friday she considered that &#34;fear mongering&#34; by Moriarty. But did accept Moriarty and Melanson&#39;s position that answers to what killed so many in 2021 are required.</p><p>&#34;I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, and a decision has been made by the Department of Health that they will complete an excess deaths analysis once all registered deaths for 2021 have been coded with Statistics Canada,&#34; said Shephard. </p><h2>Premier concerned</h2><p>Premier Blaine Higgs said he too found the elevated number of deaths &#34;obviously most concerning,&#34; and pledged the issue will be thoroughly scrutinized.</p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/roger-melanson.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/roger-melanson.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/roger-melanson.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/roger-melanson.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/roger-melanson.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5741992.1607705279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/roger-melanson.jpg"/></p></div><figcaption> Interim New Brunswick Liberal Leader Roger Melanson won agreement from Health Minister Dorothy Shephard and Premier Blaine Higgs that unexplained high death counts in New Brunswick in 2021 are a concern.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Jacques Poitras/CBC file photo)</figcaption></figure></div><p>&#34;If there&#39;s more investigation requirements, there&#39;s more information required. We will proceed to get everything we can,&#34; said Higgs.</p><p>It was a distinct change from when Melanson asked about the same issue in the legislature in May and then again last week. At the time he was accused by Shephard of making &#34;an insinuation&#34; of wrongdoing by government by asking about excess deaths.</p><p>&#34;The member is alluding to something being wrong,&#34; said Shephard during Question Period on June 1.  </p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/er-crowding.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/er-crowding.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/er-crowding.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/er-crowding.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/er-crowding.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4669558.1526669892!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/er-crowding.jpg"/></p></div><figcaption>New Brunswick experienced 886 more deaths than normal during the final 25 weeks of 2021.
