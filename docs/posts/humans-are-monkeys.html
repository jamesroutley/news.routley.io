<h2><a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/">humans are monkeys</a></h2>
<h4>2023-02-23</h4>
<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="https://rodrigotello.me/">Rodrigo</a>, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about what it means to be human. Specifically, how closely related we are to chimpanzees and other primates. I&#39;ve found myself asking people &#34;How often do you think about the fact that you&#39;re a monkey?&#34; only to find an overwhelming response of &#34;Almost never&#34;. (This was also the case for me prior to talking to Rodrigo.) People often then respond, &#34;Why? ...do you find it matters a lot to you?&#34;</p>
<p>Holy hell yes! How could anything be more <strong>relevant</strong>! My entire life is dictated by the fact that I have a literal animal brain. Habits are built into my physical brain macro-structure. I chase dopamine nearly every moment of the day. After reading about primates on wikipedia I look up to myself in a mirror eating a goddamn banana. Should I have children, I&#39;ll love them not because they are more deserving than others but because I am an actual ape! Everything I care about and everything I am is because of this; how could it not be relevant?</p>
<p>And here we are spending our time thinking about tax liability and database performance. What is going on?</p>
<p>I have maintained for years that the first headline on every newspaper should forever read &#34;Breaking! Existence is still a mystery! We have no idea what is going on!&#34;. Now I can add another continually important headline to the list: &#34;Extra! Extra! You&#39;re still a monkey!&#34;</p>
