    <h1>YouTube made AI enhancements to videos without warning or permission</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Rick Beato&#39;s face just didn&#39;t look right. &#34;I was like &#39;man, my hair looks strange&#39;, he says. &#34;And the closer I looked it almost seemed like I was wearing makeup.&#34; Beato runs a YouTube channel with over five million subscribers, where he&#39;s made nearly 2,000 videos exploring the world of music. Something seemed off in one of his recent posts, but he could barely tell the difference. &#34;I thought, &#39;am just I imagining things?&#39;&#34; </p><p>It turns out, he wasn&#39;t. In recent months, YouTube has secretly used artificial intelligence (AI) to tweak people&#39;s videos without letting them know or asking permission. Wrinkles in shirts seem more defined. Skin is sharper in some places and smoother in others. Pay close attention to ears, and you may notice them warp. These changes are small, barely visible without a side-by-side comparison. Yet some disturbed YouTubers say it gives their content a subtle and unwelcome AI-generated feeling.</p><p>There&#39;s a larger trend at play. A growing share of reality is pre-processed by AI before it reaches us. Eventually, the question won&#39;t be whether you can tell the difference, but whether it&#39;s eroding our ties to the world around us.</p><p>&#34;The more I looked at it, the more upset I got,&#34; says Rhett Shull, another popular music YouTuber. Shull, a friend of Beato&#39;s, started looking into his own posts and spotted the same strange artefacts. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nhP8tvbLY">He posted a video on the subject</a> that&#39;s racked up over 500,000 views. &#34;If I wanted this terrible over-sharpening I would have done it myself. But the bigger thing is it looks AI-generated. I think that deeply misrepresents me and what I do and my voice on the internet. It could potentially erode the trust I have with my audience in a small way. It just bothers me.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
