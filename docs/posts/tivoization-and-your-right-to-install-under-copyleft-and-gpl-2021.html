    <h1>“Tivoization” and your right to install under Copyleft and GPL (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>by

</p>




<p>Two schools of thought about the purpose of copyleft have been at odds for
  some time.  Simply put,  the question is: are copyleft licenses designed primarily to protect
  the rights of large companies that produce electronics and software
  products, <em>or</em> is copyleft designed primarily to protect individual users&#39;
  rights to improve, modify, repair, and reinstall their software?</p>

<p>This debate quickly gets deep into complex policy questions.  In the last
  few years, that general debate has slowly but surely focused almost
  entirely on the issue of users&#39; ability to make effective use of FOSS on
  their own hardware by reinstalling their modified versions.</p>

<p>Historically, these nuanced policy questions about copyleft requirements
  have generally been discussed only in semi-public venues, and often fall
  prey to the tactic du jour: post-fact politics.  I have realized in recent
  months that the failure to properly document and explain key historical
  narratives in copyleft history leaves software freedom activism
  at a disadvantage: well-resourced copyleft violators and their lawyers can
  use the ambiguity and confusion in the scant public record to spin false
  narratives and draw legal conclusions.  While such legal conclusions should not
  be drawn (absent a Court ruling), companies have nevertheless pushed their views
  forward quite loudly recently.  To use Herman and Chomsky&#39;s insightful phrasing, the
  incumbent power structures manufacture consent to their worldview to serve
  their interests, merely by being the loudest and most commonly heard
  voices.</p>

<p>Specifically on the issue of protections for the right to repair and
  reinstallation under copyleft licenses such as
  <acronym title="General Public License">GPL</acronym>, I am fortunate to
  have been a direct observer to many of the events that now serve as the
  connective tissue to build these false narratives about the GPL.  However,
  I admit I have failed to write down and impart that knowledge to the
  general public in adequate measure, which has, in turn, inadvertently aided in promulgation of these false narratives.  So, at least on the issue of
  “scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
  executable”, I hope this essay will serve as remedy.  I, and everyone
  at Conservancy, all believe in intellectual transparency, and we strive to
  provide it wherever possible.  The truth will out.</p>

<h4>Installation Requirement Under GPLv2</h4>

<p>Recent debates on this issue focus on the question of what is
  required to comply with the first two sentences of GPLv2§3¶2, which reads:
      </p><blockquote>
      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.
</blockquote>
      
<p>Before explaining the historical understanding of these terms,  I will, first of all, point
  out that any company or lawyer that seeks to do the bare minimum for
  compliance is likely not prioritizing users&#39; rights to repair their
  software.  In all compliance-related systems, bad actors seek a
  “race to the bottom”.  Rules like GPL are similar to environmental
  regulations, workplace safety requirements, and the like.  The more minimalistic the interpretation
  of the requirements, the more companies can profit from only doing the bare minimum. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, it has been the goal of organizations that
  advocate for software freedom — such as Conservancy ourselves or <acronym title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</acronym>
  — to state clearly our view about the minimum requirements as best we
  can.  I often wonder if this strategy has been beneficial to software freedom.  Sadly, the answer from the
  industry has primarily been to hear us clearly about the minimum requirements, and then work
  over time to lower the GPL compliance bar — even if it requires
  inaccurately quoting FOSS leaders and misleading the public about history.
  Most recently, industry has engaged in this bar-lowering process with GPLv2§3¶2 and installation information under
  GPLv2 generally.  My hope herein is to fully explain the history of
  interpretation of GPLv2§3¶2 by pro-copyleft advocates, and
  explore the misdirection of arguments of those who seek to curtail users&#39;
  rights to install modified versions of their GPL&#39;d software.</p>

<h4>FSF CLE Classes, 2003-2004</h4>

<p>I began volunteering for licensing and GPL enforcement work for
  <acronym title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</acronym> in 1997, and
  officially worked on my first GPL enforcement action in 1999.  I became an
  FSF employee that year, and worked there until 2005. I thereafter
  remained affiliated with the organization in various roles
  until <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2019/10/15/fsf-rms.html">my final
  affiliations ended with FSF in October 2019</a>.  Most notably,
  I <em>was</em> the Executive Director of FSF from 2001-2005. During
  that time, I led
  FSF&#39;s GPL enforcement and copyleft education measures, including the
  <acronym title="Continuing Legal Education">CLE</acronym> classes (first
  taught in 2003-2004).</p>

<p>In preparation for teaching those courses, I began to write the tutorial which later became
  the <a href="https://copyleft.org/guide">Copyleft Guide</a>. To begin that effort, I collected, curated, and verified interpretations and intent of
  the GPLv2 with Richard Stallman, Bob Chassell (a key but oft-forgotten
  leader of FSF during the 1980s and 1990s), and FSF&#39;s legal counsels.
  One of the many outcomes of that endeavor was that  I <a href="https://k.sfconservancy.org/Copyleft/guide/changeset/c098468ba805f60f2781e5417c84ff0f3ef28873">wrote these words on 2003-05-09</a>:

  </p><blockquote>
GPLv2§3 requires that the source code include “meta-material” like
scripts, interface definitions, and other material that is used to “control
compilation and installation” of the binaries.
</blockquote>

<p>In GPL enforcement actions at the time, during our “complete,
  corresponding source (CCS) checks”, we verified that the source code
  was not only complete, but that it <em>corresponded</em> to the binaries on
  the vendors&#39; devices, and that we could <em>install modified versions</em>
  of the software.  This was a standard part of any check to verify GPLv2
  compliance.  Passing this check was required, then and now, by FSF and Conservancy before
  distribution rights are restored after a violation.</p>

<p>That position was not controversial when I, along with then FSF counsel (Daniel Ravicher),  taught it to lawyers in 2003
  and 2004 on FSF&#39;s behalf.  Nevertheless, today, many act as if this interpretation and
  intent of GPLv2§3¶2 is a recent and novel phenomena, rather than
  a long standing position held by all copyleft activists for at least 18
  years.  Today, most companies and lawyers argue (incorrectly, IMO) that
  users have no rights to reinstall their GPLv2&#39;d software.</p>
  
<h4>The 2003 TiVo GPL Enforcement Action</h4>

<p>Even before teaching those CLE classes, as (then) FSF&#39;s Executive
  Director, I <em>led</em> the GPLv2 enforcement effort against TiVo.  I&#39;ve
  often seen those with only a passing familiarity with the subject jump to
  inaccurate conclusions about that enforcement action that tend to conveniently fit
  their policy agenda.  I herein recount the entire history regarding the
  TiVo GPLv2 violation and how it led to the “tivoization”
  rhetoric.  Since that rhetoric is often treated as dispositive truthiness that GPLv2 does not ensure
  the users&#39; rights to repair by reinstalling their modified GPLv2&#39;d
  software, we should examine the actual facts that back the rhetoric, and examine the
  conclusions that others make about GPLv2 based on it.</p>

<p>First and foremost, TiVo&#39;s GPL violation initially had nothing specific to
  do with GPLv2§3¶2.  TiVo never raised any intention to not comply
  with that section.  In fact, to my recollection, TiVo never disputed nor
  disagreed with FSF&#39;s interpretation on that section.  The initial violation
  was a standard GPLv2§3(b) violation, wherein some distributions of the
  TiVo device had an offer for source that could not be successfully
  exercised.  (At the time) acting on behalf of FSF, I contacted TiVo on
  2002-06-11 to raise this issue, and, TiVo responded favorably and indicated
  they wanted to resolve the matter.  As is usual practice in all GPL
  enforcement matters, I and my (then) team did our due diligence to verify
  full compliance, including any other potential issues under GPLv2.
  Eventually, my FSF colleague (David Turner) and I did a <acronym title="Complete, Corresponding Source">CCS</acronym> check of TiVo&#39;s software.  The procedures, criteria,
  and interpretations that Turner and I used then are exactly the same as the
  ones that Denver and I use today at Conservancy.  To my knowledge (based on
  recent personal conversations with FSF staff), FSF still uses when these
  same procedures, criteria, and interpretations when FSF has the rare
  occasion to do GPLv2 enforcement these days. </p>

<p>Once the GPLv2§3(b) violation was resolved, Turner and I discovered
  — as has been true in nearly every one of the hundreds of GPL
  compliance matter that I&#39;ve worked — that “the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable” were
  incomplete.  When this was identified, TiVo&#39;s solution was to, in
  fact, <strong>agree with the interpretation that that such instructions are
  mandatory and must be provided</strong> and they provided them.  To my
  knowledge, TiVo was in full compliance with the GPLv2, including the
  inclusion of instructions for installation as required under GPLv2.  People
  were able to reinstall Linux on their TiVo boxes thanks to our enforcement
  action; <a href="http://www.vonhagen.org/tivo/DirecTiVo-info.html">community</a>
  <a href="https://medium.com/cracked-the-code/hacking-into-a-20-year-old-tivo-part-4-7d4dd80047fa">resources</a>
  on how to take advantage of GPL reinstallation rights on TiVos (of that era)
  are <a href="https://www.tivocommunity.com/community/index.php?threads/old-unused-tivo-want-to-convert-it-to-a-linux-box.483541/#post-8962997">still</a>
  <a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/threat-management/hacking-your-tivo">readily</a>
  <a href="http://www.rosswalker.co.uk/tivo_upgrade/">available</a>!  At the
  time<a id="return-footnote-tivo-later-violate-maybe" href="#footnote-tivo-later-violate-maybe"><sup>0</sup></a>, TiVo was doing the
  right thing in providing what the GPLv2 requires — including the
  ability to reinstall GNU and Linux software onto the actual device.  Keep
  in mind: this enforcement action, and the compliance achieved from it, occurred years before the
  GPLv3 process began.</p>

  <h4>Understanding The Tivoization Rhetoric</h4>

<p>So, what <em>did</em> TiVo do that was so objectionable?  What was the
  behavior that Stallman went to work drafting GPLv3 to prevent that TiVo was
  allowed to do under GPLv2?  It&#39;s not, as others widely misreport, that TiVo
  forbade reinstallation “of the GPL&#39;d software” <em>itself</em>.
  To my knowledge, TiVo <strong>never prevented such reinstallation</strong>.
  No one involved, including me, Stallman, TiVo, or anyone at FSF at the time
  believed that GPLv2 permitted TiVo to withhold the installation information
  for the GPL&#39;d software <em>itself</em>.  FSF demanded that TiVo provided
  its users the ability to reinstall Linux (and other GPL&#39;d software, such as
  GNU bash).  What TiVo later did, which some software freedom activists (including
  Stallman) found objectionable, was that TiVo designed the reinstallation
  process of that GPLv2&#39;d software to <strong>cause the proprietary TiVo
  application to cease to function</strong>.  I recall this being widely
  discussed when TiVo Series 3 was released in mid-2006, and my understanding
  was that all Series 3 devices had this particular anti-feature.  (There
  were rumors that some of the Series 2 had this anti-feature as well, but
  not all models.)  In other words, if you decided to modify your copy of
  Linux for the TiVo device and reinstall Linux, the TiVo userspace
  application would realize that cryptographic lockdown had been breached,
  and that <em>proprietary</em> software would no longer function.  By exercising
  your reinstallation rights under GPLv2, you&#39;d
  turn your TiVo DVR into a stand-alone server with some video processing
  equipment attached.  You could use Kodi (which at the time had a different
  name) to turn that former-TiVo into a FOSS DVR, but your ability to use
  the <strong>proprietary</strong> DVR software from TiVo was lost — likely permanently.</p>

<p>Most have of course heard of the negative term “tivoization”
  that Richard Stallman popularized during the GPLv3 process — which
  was contemporaneous with the release of the TiVo Series 3.  I nevertheless
  asked Stallman to not use that term — both then <em>and</em> many
  times since.  I still disagree with Stallman&#39;s policy position on the
  narrow issue of preserving proprietary userspace functionality. Specifically, I just don&#39;t think it <strong>matters</strong>
  if, upon upgrading your copylefted software, that the proprietary software
  that was (to use GPLv2&#39;s terminology) “merely aggregated”
  alongside the copylefted software continue to function.  I felt and still
  feel that it&#39;s actually better policy to <em>break</em> the (“merely aggregated”) proprietary
  software (as GPLv2 permits).  My policy view is that this breakage inspires and encourages users to install a FOSS
  alternative for the userspace applications after they&#39;ve reinstalled the
  FOSS operating system.  Nevertheless, Stallman found this practice (using
  crypto lock-down to force the proprietary software to fail) illegitimate.
  He noted publicly that GPLv2 didn&#39;t prevent this behavior, and wanted (and wrote, as explained below) a
  GPLv3 draft that prohibited that behavior.</p>

<h4>How Discussion Focused on Cryptographic Lockdown <em>Generally</em></h4>

<p>To this day, I&#39;ll remain frustrated that many pro-GPLv3 advocates, during
  the GPLv3 drafting process, saw fit to imply ideas that they had no basis to
  believe were true about GPLv2.  We all knew, long before GPLv3 drafting
  began, that there was a clear installation requirement in GPLv2 — the
  word “install” appears prominently.  The training materials that I developed for 
  <acronym title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</acronym> (described above) were vetted through Stallman and FSF&#39;s legal counsel
  before using them to teach <acronym title="Continuing Legal Education">CLE</acronym> classes.  If anyone received a different
  impression, it was surely a miscommunication due to the aggressive “GPLv3 is much better” rhetoric of the time.</p>
  
<p>Meanwhile, much of the debate about cyptographic lockdown under GPL centered around the question of disclosure
of specific authorization keys.  It was said, probably correctly, that GPLv2 did not mandate disclosure of an
any specific authorization key.  What was often left unsaid (apparently in an effort to make GPLv2 seem
weaker than it actually was) was what GPLv2 <strong>did still require</strong>: a functional installation method without disclosure of authorization
keys.  For example, it would, in my personal opinion, be entirely compliant with the GPLv2 to simply disable the secure boot chain,
providing no path back to the vendor-provided cryptographically signed firmware<a id="return-footnote-my-view-may-not-matter-either" href="#footnote-my-view-may-not-matter-either"><sup>1</sup></a>, and allow the user to reinstall only the GPLv2&#39;d
components on the device — never to return to the stock vendor firmware.  I suspect such restriction <em>would be prohibited</em> under GPLv3, since GPLv3 clearly requires not that you just give
a viable install path (as GPLv2 does), but GPLv3 <em>additionally</em> requires disclosure of the authorization keys.</p>

<p>We can debate whether this copyleft expansion under GPLv3 was good policy.  What is not up for debate is the
simple concept that: more requirements added to a later revision of a licensing document does not change the intent
or standing requirements in the older document.  That&#39;s true even if the authors of the original document, for marketing or other reasons,
 choose later to denigrate their own past work.  As it turns out, historically, we <em>know</em> what GPLv2 intended
because its author, Richard Stallman, talked so extensively about what he sought to accomplish by creating GPLv2.</p>
<p>Going back to the early 1990s and contemporaneous with GPLv2&#39;s publication, Stallman himself has been quite
  fond of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.pdf#page=133">telling his experience</a> with the
  broken <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym>
  printer, for which he begged for the source code and didn&#39;t receive it.
  Stallman doesn&#39;t end this story with: “what I really wanted was to
  get the source code to that printer so I could build my own printer from
  scratch and then compile and make a fresh install of that printer software
  on a new printer”.  No, Stallman was clear that his goal was
  to <strong>fix the bugs on the printer that MIT already had</strong>, using
  the source code for that very same printer.  Stallman expected that the
  source code for the printer would include information sufficient for him to
  recompile and reinstall the software onto the very same
  device.  Larger printers of that era were simply embedded devices of unusual size.  
  They have only minor technical differences from the TVs, wireless routers, and dozens of
  other Linux-based embedded devices we have today.  Computers are tiny today when they were
  large before, but their functioning and basic methods of operations have not changed.  Install meant install
  then.  Install means install now.  And FSF, Conservancy, every software
  freedom activist and every legitimate copyleft theorist that I&#39;ve ever met
  still agrees with this!  The <em>intent</em> of the GPLv2 is clear and
  always has been: to allow reinstallation of modified versions of the GPL&#39;d
  software into the same place where the binaries were installed when you
  got the computer in the first place, and to reap the benefits of that change.  It&#39;s ludicrous to suggest Stallman
  meant anything other than that when he wrote GPLv2.</p>

<h4>Recent Confirmation from FSF</h4>

<p>Nevertheless, opponents of users&#39; right to repair their software persist
  in their claims that GPLv2 doesn&#39;t intend this.  We at Conservancy hear it
  regularly; GPL violators frequently send  us a recently compiled dossier of curated
  comments by FSF — quoted (and some even misquoted) completely out
  context — that purport to “prove” that FSF does not want
  users to repair their embedded devices that contain GPLv2&#39;d software.  My
  affiliations with FSF had already ended by the time this dossier started making the rounds, so
  we did what any reasonable person would do: we asked FSF
  to clarify their opinion for us directly.</p>
  
  <p>The opportunity to ask presented itself about a year ago, in May 2020, when Conservancy worked with FSF&#39;s
  Executive Director (John Sullivan), FSF&#39;s Licensing and Compliance Manager
  (Donald Robertson), and FSF&#39;s (then) legal counsel (Marc Jones) on a joint GPLv2 enforcement matter
  against a pernicious and intentional violator who had infringed the copyrights of GNU Bash and Linux. (The violator was using a GPLv2&#39;d fork of Bash.)
  We took the opportunity then to reaffirm
  our joint understanding of this 18-year-old interpretation of the GPLv2 as part of that specific joint embedded device enforcement action.
  We discussed the matter at length and confirmed everyone&#39;s understanding remained
  unchanged from the prior FSF positions going back (at least) 18 years.</p>
  
  <p> At the end of
  our discussions, on 2020-05-11, I wrote to Sullivan saying: “I just
  want to summarize what I believe was our mutual view on the phone call last
  Friday.  If you could confirm that I have summarized correctly, we&#39;ll use
  the below as a basis of our response to [those who are currently inquiring
  about this issue]:”
      </p><blockquote>
         The GPLv2 does not have any specific requirement for preservation of
   the ability to reinstall proprietary-software-centric vendor-provided
   firmwares (even if such firmwares contain some GPLv2&#39;d works) on embedded
   systems, provided that the downstream user (i.e., the consumer with the
   device) <strong>can</strong> build, install, and (repeatedly and
   successfully) reinstall a firmware containing only the copylefted
   components (such as Linux+Bash).
</blockquote>

<p> John replied on 2020-05-13 with: “Bradley, We suggest just a couple
  of small tweaks:”
        </p><blockquote>

   The GPLv2 does not have any specific requirement for preservation of the
   ability to reinstall proprietary-software-centric vendor-provided
   firmwares (even if such firmwares contain some GPLv2&#39;d works) on embedded
   systems, provided that the downstream user (i.e., the consumer with the
   device) <strong>can</strong> build, install, run, and (repeatedly and
   successfully) reinstall a firmware containing at least the copylefted
   components (such as Linux+Bash).
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, Sullivan advocates inclusion of the term “run”
  (which admittedly I had accidentally failed to include in my original
  draft!).  It was a great addition, and Sullivan&#39;s statement matched exactly
  the historical interpretation that FSF espoused when I worked there in
  2003.  Indeed, it read to me almost exactly what Chassell had originally
  taught it to me when I was volunteering for FSF in the 1990s.
  Furthermore, the quote from Sullivan above matches the position that I
  vetted with Stallman throughout my time at FSF, right up until the end of
  my affiliation with FSF in 2019.  Thus, FSF&#39;s position, as stated above, on the question
  of installation under GPLv2 has remained consistent from 2003-2020.</p>

<p>This leaves me to wonder: how is it that <strong>so many people</strong>
    came to conclude that FSF&#39;s view was that the GPLv2 didn&#39;t speak to
    “install” at all?  I can only speculate, but my view is that
    (a) people heard what they wanted to hear, (b) a few (but not most, or
    even many) Linux developers spoke widely that it was their personal view
    that installation information isn&#39;t required by GPLv2 (notwithstanding the
    obvious textual requirement), and (c) in their fervor to ballyhoo the
    GPLv3 as an improvement, some GPLv3 advocates chose to denigrate GPLv2 as
    “not good enough” — in an apparent effort to frighten
    pro-GPLv2 copyleft activists to rush away from GPLv2 as quickly as
    possible.</p>

<h4>Stallman on GPLv3 Installation Information</h4>

<p>In April 2012, I started an email thread with Stallman yet again about the
  term “tivoization”.  I again urged him to stop using the term,
  because, in my view, what TiVo did for GPLv2 compliance was not bad for
  software freedom.  I wrote to Stallman at that time to again remind him
  that upgrades of TiVo&#39;s Linux installation “can be done
  successfully” and (at least for TiVo product that FSF declared in
  compliance), the only offense was one that GPLv2 permits: merely disabling
  the proprietary components from working after reinstallation of the GPLv2&#39;d
  components.  At that time, Stallman informed me that he had indeed designed
  the GPLv3 to deal with this situation.  Specifically, I asked him on
  2012-05-05:

  </p><blockquote>
  [so], these words in GPLv3: “The information must suffice to ensure
  that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
  prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been
  made.” mean that the proprietary software that is not a combined work
  with the GPLv3&#39;d work must also function?
  </blockquote>



<p>Stallman replied on 2012-05-06 with:

  </p><blockquote>
    Absolutely.  And I wrote it specifically to do that!
  </blockquote>
  


<h4>Why This History Must Be Told</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, long narratives of past events that have hitherto
  lived only in oral history usually have academic interest only.  They make for great podcast or
  post-conference-dinner fodder, but they rarely make for good blog posts.
  Nevertheless, I&#39;ve explained all this here in painstaking detail to counter
  the rising swell of opposition to users&#39; right to repair their GPLv2&#39;d
  software installations.  Initially, these efforts to curtail the right to
  reinstall under GPLv2 have been done clandestinely — for example, by
  spreading the aforementioned misleading dossier.  Recently, however, the
  effort has gone public.</p>

<p>In mid-July 2021, a lawyer named McCoy
  Smith, who tries to make his living (in part) representing GPL violators, published an article 
  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210814042936/https://jolts.world/index.php/jolts/article/download/149/269">that
  makes outrageous and inaccurate claims about these long-standing positions held by both Conservancy and FSF</a>.  We at
  Conservancy don&#39;t fear transparency, and we urge you to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210814042936/https://jolts.world/index.php/jolts/article/download/149/269">read
  McCoy&#39;s response to Denver&#39;s article</a>, as well
  as <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/mar/25/install-gplv2/">Denver&#39;s
  original article</a>, and then reread this one that responds to McCoy&#39;s
  argument.  You should decide for yourself who has the better argument, and
  decide whether or not we&#39;ve adequately answered McCoy&#39;s outrageous and
  inaccurate claims.  In our view, McCoy spins a false narrative about the
  differences between GPLv2 and GPLv3 regarding install, and provides
  specious evidence for this claim.  I hope that the historical facts that I
  describe above clarify this issue.</p>

  <p>A few of McCoy&#39;s fundamental arguments are easily disputed by the
    historical facts that I outlined above:
    </p><ul>
      <li>McCoy accused me and Conservancy of “Historical
      Revisionism”, by claiming my words about GPLv2§3 were
      “a recent effort … to reinterpret the requirements of
      GPLv2”.  I&#39;ve shown above, using reliable and accurate revision
      history logs, that those words, which McCoy claims were recent, were  written
        and published in May 2003.</li>

      <li>McCoy states that the objection to TiVo was regarding prohibition
      of reinstallation of the GPL&#39;d binaries.  I&#39;ve confirmed above that
      during FSF&#39;s enforcement action against TiVo, TiVo agreed to allow
      reinstallation of the GPL&#39;d binaries but caused the proprietary
        software not to function, and that FSF took the position that GPLv2 required reinstallation of GPLv2&#39;d binaries to function.</li>

      <li>McCoy claims that GPLv2&#39;s original intent was never to allow
      installation.  I&#39;ve shown above that Stallman, the author of GPLv2,
      specifically knew about situations of embedded device
      proprietarization before GPLv2 was drafted, and, in contemporaneous and ongoing rhetoric, spoke clearly that he intended to
      preserve and advance users&#39; right to repair their software by engaging in
      truly functional reinstallation of GPL&#39;d binaries into
        the <em>actual</em> location.</li>

        <li>McCoy claims that FSF does not share Conservancy&#39;s position about
        installation under GPLv2.  I&#39;ve shown specific text written by FSF&#39;s
        Executive Director, which was also verified by FSF&#39;s legal counsel
        and FSF&#39;s Licensing and Compliance Manager as recently as May 2020
        — wherein Conservancy and FSF are in full agreement.  I can
        also further confirm that I spoke with John Sullivan on the telephone
        earlier this week, and he reconfirmed that he still agrees with the paragraph
        as written as correct policy for the situation.</li>

    </ul>
      
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I then quote my 2012 exchange with Stallman to point out clearly: the installation information definition in GPLv3 <em>expands</em> the
  requirements and does not <em>reduce</em> the existing installation
  requirements that we all saw as present in GPLv2 from its first publication
  in 1992.  McCoy&#39;s article contains a simple logical fallacy: it assumes
  that since the installation information requirements in the GPLv3 are (in
  some respects) more expansive than those in GPLv2, that the requirement for
  installation information in GPLv2 are non-existent and/or are diminished merely through public discussion of GPLv3&#39;s policy goals by FSF during
  GPLv3&#39;s drafting.  As I show above, it&#39;s
  clear that Stallman&#39;s rhetoric about extending installation information
  requirements in GPLv3 had complex additional policy goals that don&#39;t
  exist in GPLv2.  Specifically, I don&#39;t think that GPLv2 reinstallation
  requires that all “merely aggregated” works continue to
  function as designed upon reinstallation of the GPLv2 works.  Stallman
  has agreed with that GPLv2 interpretation, but differed from me regarding forward-looking policy (in that he
  finds such disabling of proprietary software deplorable) and thus Stallman wrote GPLv3 to
  prevent <em>that</em> practice that GPLv2 permits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, and most importantly, I quote the May 2020 recent exchange with Sullivan to point
  out that FSF policy regarding GPLv2 and installation <strong>has not
  wavered</strong> since FSF established it during Bob Chassell&#39;s time,
  which continued on into my time as FSF&#39;s Executive Director and then into
  Peter Brown&#39;s and John Sullivan&#39;s time, too.  As I&#39;ve shown, this
  interpretation of GPLv2 installation requirements is <em>at least</em> a
  17-year unbroken chain from at May 2003 all the way through to May 2020.
  If Bob Chassell were still alive today, I&#39;m sure he could account for that
  position remaining consistent in the 1990s, too.</p>


<p>There is also a central and inherent flaw in McCoy&#39;s underlying argument:
  the idea that FSF&#39;s view, or Linus&#39; view, or any single individual&#39;s or
  organization&#39;s view, is what matters.  The license says what it says. If the license steward has a view, it would not mean their
  view is dispositive, and I say that <em>knowing</em> that their view
  happens to agree with mine!  Indeed, Linus Torvalds has stated he doesn&#39;t
  agree with FSF&#39;s views about GPLv2, and has his own views, which McCoy
  himself quotes.  (I&#39;m not sure why McCoy thinks that forwards his argument,
  because Linus&#39; view differing from FSF undercuts McCoy&#39;s argument that what
  FSF said during GPLv3 drafting is relevant.) Other contributors to Linux
  disagree with both FSF&#39;s and Linus&#39; view; many prominent Linux developers
  have told me that they agree with Conservancy and/or FSF about this.
  Others have told me they have an even <em>broader</em> interpretation of
  the installation requirements under GPLv2 than I do!</p>

  <p>Thus, McCoy makes a classic “appeal to authority” fallacy as
  the center of his argument.  Regardless of McCoy&#39;s mostly unsupported
  opinion, I suspect even he would agree that only three things will really
  definitively matter regarding this issue: (a) what the wronged party who
  didn&#39;t get their complete, corresponding source code believes, (b) what the
  entity refusing to give them that source code believes, and (c) what the
  Courts says when the former sues the latter.  All else is simply bluster
  — full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Finally, as a reminder, please keep in mind that (as I already said in the text above), I no longer have any affiliation with FSF (since October 2019) and do not speak for them — which is precisely why I quote the words <em>they told me</em>.</p>

<a href="#return-footnote-tivo-later-violate-maybe" id="footnote-tivo-later-violate-maybe"><sup>0</sup></a> Please note that I
have not personally looked into TiVo&#39;s GPL compliance since late 2003.  As
such, it&#39;s entirely possible that TiVo models released from 2004 onward may
have violated GPLv2§3¶2 and failed to include required
“scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
executable”.  However, any later non-compliance is not
capitulation by me, FSF, Conservancy or anyone else that McCoy&#39;s and others&#39;
interpretation of that clause is correct.</p>
<p>
<a href="#return-footnote-my-view-may-not-matter-either" id="footnote-my-view-may-not-matter-either"><sup>1</sup></a>Please be abundantly
  clear that even as I give an interpretation of what <em>I</em> happen to believe is
  correct at this given moment, I&#39;m a flawed human being capable of error.  (Also, IANAL and TINLA.)  I can misspeak,
  misstate, and otherwise just be plain wrong about something one way or the other.  This
  is also true of FSF, its representatives, and all the other pundits like McCoy Smith who opine on this question.  One of
  the horrible “race to the bottom” traps that GPL violators constantly lay for
  us is unrelenting pressure that we choose between (a) reducing what we believe
  a given license requires, or (b) suing them to ask the Court to uphold our view.  No one escapes that pressure cooker unscathed;
   nearly every pro-copyleft activist (including me)
  has fallen into this trap, and succumbed to the pressure of (a) at least once.
  I know, even as I write this footnote, that someday I&#39;m going to have a GPL violator&#39;s lawyer
  quoting this blog post back to me in a deposition about some esoteric, “race to the
  bottom” issue of GPL compliance.  They&#39;re going to look for a way to twist my words
  to argue that somehow I&#39;ve given their client carte blanche to  trample  users&#39;  rights that GPL protects.
  Everyone who stands up for copyleft faces this constant challenge now that intentional GPL violations are the
  norm rather than the exception. Conservancy
  simply will not capitulate when standing up for users&#39; rights to copy, share, modify, repair, reinstall
  and reinstall modified versions of their software on the devices they own.</p>
