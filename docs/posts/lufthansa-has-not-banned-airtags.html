</p><p>Lufthansa has not banned Apple AirTags and I think it is clear why: it is the sort of rule that would practicably be unenforceable. Lufthansa remains free to ban AirTags, but is it prepared to enforce that ban by digging through passenger bags when they refuse to comply? In reality, a ban by Lufthansa or any airline is simply trying to evade accountability rather than promote safety.<span> </span></p>
<h2>Lufthansa Has Not Banned Apple AirTags</h2>
<p>It was widely reported yesterday that Lufthansa banned Apple AirTags in hold baggage, the miniature devices that you can drop inside a bag and then use your phone to follow the location of your bag. That proved quite handy in a recent lost baggage case and I am now the proud owner of four of these coin-size devices.</p>
<p>German media and even some of my colleagues reported that Lufthansa determined that AirTags and other tracking devices represent “dangerous goods” according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and therefore cannot be placed in a checked bag while transmit mode is enabled. But when the very point of these devices is to transmit location information, it renders them useless.</p>
<p>Last night, however, a Lufthansa spokesperson confirmed to Ethan Kapper of The Points Guy that AirTags are still permitted onboard and there has been no change in policy.</p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A Lufthansa spokesperson tells me there is no change to the carrier’s policy on AirTags.</p>
<p>— Ethan Klapper (@ethanklapper) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanklapper/status/1578453321546801158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2022</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While I would not wholly foreclose the possibility of Lufthansa banning such items, I find it highly unlikely. How would Lufthansa possibly enforce that? Furthermore, I suspect that the act of banning these would embolden more passengers to flout the rule.</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>AirTags are NOT banned by Lufthasna. Instead, Lufthansa has confirmed there is no change in policy. At least for now, you can continue to place AirTags or other baggage-tracking devices inside your checked baggage. I suspect Lufthansa will not try to ban these even at a future point, as customers will simply ignore the ban.</p>
