The core of the I Ching is synchronicity, as described by psychologist Carl Jung. Your intention and the moment of consultation matter more than the physical tool. Whether using virtual coins or physical yarrow stalks, the oracle responds to your sincere inquiry.</p></div><div><p>While the Yarrow Stalk method is the traditional approach offering a slower, meditative experience, I Ching coins are far more convenient for daily practice. The Three Coins method is faster, easier to learn, and equally valid for divination. Most modern practitioners prefer coins for their accessibility.<!-- --> <a href="https://castiching.com/articles/i-ching-coins">Learn how to use I Ching coins →</a></p></div><div><p>Moving lines (also called changing lines) are lines in your hexagram that are in a state of transformation. They represent dynamic aspects of your situation. When you have moving lines, your hexagram transforms into a second hexagram, showing the potential evolution of your circumstances.</p></div><div><p>Open-ended questions work best. Instead of asking &#39;Should I take this job?&#39; try &#39;What should I understand about this job opportunity?&#39; The I Ching provides wisdom for reflection rather than simple yes/no answers. Focus on your genuine concern and approach with sincerity.</p></div><div><p>No sign-up is required. Our I Ching divination tool is completely free and can be used immediately. Simply enter your question and choose your preferred divination method to begin your consultation.</p></div><div><p>After your hexagram is cast, you can optionally request an AI-powered interpretation that considers your specific question, the hexagram meanings, and any moving lines. The AI provides personalized guidance while respecting the traditional wisdom of the I Ching.</p></div><div><p>A hexagram is a figure composed of six horizontal lines, each either solid (Yang) or broken (Yin). There are 64 hexagrams in the I Ching, each representing a unique archetype of change and providing specific wisdom for different life situations.</p></div><div><p>Yes, our virtual I Ching reading tool is fully responsive and works on all devices including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The interface adapts to provide an optimal experience on any screen size.</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2>Browse the 64 Hexagrams</h2><p>Complete guide to all hexagrams in the Book of Changes</p></div></section></div></div>
