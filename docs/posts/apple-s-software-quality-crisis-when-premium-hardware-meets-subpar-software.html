    <h1>Apple&#39;s Software Quality Crisis: When Premium Hardware Meets Subpar Software</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><div><p>Mar 2, 2025<!-- --> - ⏱️ <!-- -->4 minutes to read</p></div></section><p>As a long-time Apple user, I&#39;ve always appreciated the seamless integration of
hardware and software that is the signature of the Apple ecosystem. However,
recent experiences with my iPad Air 11&#34; M2 has left me questioning whether
Apple has lost sight of what once made their products exceptional.</p>
<h2>A Brief Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>November 6, 2024</strong>: Visited the Apple Store in Turin with my new iPad Air
11&#34; M2 experiencing significant lag and overheating when using Notes and
Freeform with Apple Pencil Pro.</li>
<li><strong>November 13, 2024</strong>: Received a replacement unit after store
representatives suggested a hardware swap.</li>
<li><strong>February 27, 2025</strong>: The replacement unit is now exhibiting identical
performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premium Hardware, Struggling Software</h2>
<p>In November, I visited the Apple Store in Turin to address persistent issues
with my iPad Air 11&#34; M2 running iPadOS 18.1. Despite having cutting-edge
hardware, I&#39;ve been experiencing significant lag when using basic Apple
applications like Notes and Freeform.</p>
<p>The performance issues don&#39;t stop at sluggish response times. During these
standard use cases, my iPad frequently overheated, making it uncomfortable to
hold and raising concerns about potential long-term hardware damage.</p>
<p>What made this particularly frustrating is that these aren&#39;t third-party
applications pushing the hardware to its limits. These are Apple&#39;s own
applications that should theoretically be optimized for their hardware.</p>
<p>The Apple Store staff were courteous and professional, following their standard
troubleshooting protocols. After demonstrating the issues in person, the
support representative suggested a hardware replacement. However, after further
discussion, we both concluded this was likely a software problem rather than a
hardware defect.</p>
<p>I think this highlights a growing challenge for Apple&#39;s retail support model:
how do you troubleshoot software issues when the traditional solution has been
to replace hardware? When software quality declines, the entire support
infrastructure feels misaligned.</p>
<p>This experience feels symptomatic of a broader decline in Apple&#39;s software
quality.</p>
<p>My replacement iPad Air 11&#34; M2 with the Apple Pencil Pro is once again
struggling with basic tasks. Despite multiple iPadOS updates since my original
complaint (we&#39;re now on 18.3.1), the fundamental issues remain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant lag when using Apple&#39;s own Notes and Freeform applications</strong>:
Input latency increases dramatically after about 5-10 minutes of use, with
stroke rendering delayed by up to 5 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Device overheating during standard usage scenarios</strong>: CPU temperatures
reach concerning levels (based on device heat) during basic pencil input tasks</li>
<li><strong>Poor responsiveness with the Apple Pencil Pro</strong>: Palm rejection fails
intermittently, and pressure sensitivity becomes inconsistent</li>
</ul>
<p>This recurrence with a replacement device confirms what I suspected last
November - this is a software optimization problem, not a hardware defect.</p>
<h2>Details Worth Noting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermal Management Failures</strong>: The M2 chip should throttle performance
before reaching uncomfortable external temperatures, suggesting the thermal
management system isn&#39;t properly engaging;</li>
<li><strong>Memory Management Problems</strong>: The gradual degradation in performance points
to memory leaks or improper garbage collection in Apple&#39;s drawing applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my original complaint, I&#39;ve discovered
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/search/?q=overheating">numerous</a> forum threads
and social media discussions from iPad users experiencing similar issues. This
suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.</p>
<p>Most concerning is that multiple software updates have failed to address these
fundamental performance issues while introducing new features that add more
strain to the system (like Apple Intelligence, but that&#39;s a story for another
day).</p>
<h2>Reconsidering the &#34;Apple Tax&#34;</h2>
<p>For years, many of us have willingly paid the &#34;Apple tax&#34;, the premium price
for Apple products justified by superior user experience, design, and ecosystem
integration. But if software quality continues to decline, this value
proposition becomes increasingly difficult to defend.</p>
<p>The persistence of these issues through multiple software updates suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feature prioritization over optimization</strong>: Engineering resources appear
focused on new capabilities rather than fixing existing performance problems;</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate performance testing</strong>: Real-world usage scenarios with Apple&#39;s
own applications aren&#39;t being adequately tested.</li>
</ol>
<p>As customers paying premium prices for Apple products, we at least deserve:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Acknowledgment of known performance issues;</li>
<li><strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong>: Updates focused solely on performance and
stability;</li>
<li><strong>Extended support</strong>: Consideration for extended warranties when software
issues impact hardware lifespan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Apple experience was once defined by the joy of using products that &#34;just
worked.&#34; Today, that promise feels increasingly hollow as software struggles to
keep pace with hardware capabilities. As users and customers, we need to
vocally advocate for the quality-focused Apple we once knew.</p>
<p>After months of hoping for improvement, I&#39;m faced with difficult decisions
about my future in the Apple ecosystem. This extended iPad issue has severely
damaged my confidence in new Apple products.</p>
<p>I call on Apple to return to its roots - creating products that prioritize user
experience over feature checklists. The company that once proudly created
products that &#34;just work&#34; needs to reclaim that ethos.</p></article></div>
