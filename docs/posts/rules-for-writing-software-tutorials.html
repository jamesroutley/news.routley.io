    <h1>Rules for writing software tutorials</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><header></header><p>Most software tutorials are tragically flawed.</p><p>Tutorials often forget to mention some key detail, preventing readers from replicating the author’s process. Other times, the author brings in hidden assumptions that don’t match their readers’ expectations.</p><p>The good news is that it’s easier than you think to write an exceptional software tutorial. You can stand out in a sea of mediocre guides by following a few simple rules.</p><h2 id="rules">Rules<a href="#rules">🔗</a></h2><ol><li><a href="#write-for-beginners">Write for beginners</a></li><li><a href="#promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">Promise a clear outcome in the title</a></li><li><a href="#explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">Explain the goal in the introduction</a></li><li><a href="#show-the-end-result">Show the end result</a></li><li><a href="#make-code-snippets-copypasteable">Make code snippets copy/pasteable</a></li><li><a href="#use-long-versions-of-command-line-flags">Use long versions of command-line flags</a></li><li><a href="#separate-user-defined-values-from-reusable-logic">Separate user-defined values from reusable logic</a></li><li><a href="#spare-the-reader-from-mindless-tasks">Spare the reader from mindless tasks</a></li><li><a href="#let-computers-evaluate-conditional-logic">Let computers evaluate conditional logic</a></li><li><a href="#keep-your-code-in-a-working-state">Keep your code in a working state</a></li><li><a href="#teach-one-thing">Teach one thing</a></li><li><a href="#dont-try-to-look-pretty">Don’t try to look pretty</a></li><li><a href="#minimize-dependencies">Minimize dependencies</a></li><li><a href="#specify-filenames-clearly">Specify filenames clearly</a></li><li><a href="#use-consistent-descriptive-headings">Use consistent, descriptive headings</a></li><li><a href="#demonstrate-that-your-solution-works">Demonstrate that your solution works</a></li><li><a href="#link-to-a-complete-example">Link to a complete example</a></li></ol><h2 id="write-for-beginners">Write for beginners<a href="#write-for-beginners">🔗</a></h2><p>The most common mistake tutorials make is explaining beginner-level concepts using expert-level terminology.</p><p>Most people who seek out tutorials are beginners. They may not be beginners to programming, but they’re beginners to the domain they’re trying to learn about.</p><div><div><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create your first “Hello world” SPA using React.</p><p>Open the included <code>hello.jsx</code> file and change the greeting from <code>&#34;Hello world&#34;</code> to <code>&#34;Hello universe&#34;</code>.</p><p>The browser should hot reload with the new text. Because of React’s efficient JSX transpilation, the change feels instant.</p><p>The browser doesn’t even have to soft reload the page because React’s reconciliation engine compares the virtual DOM to the rendered DOM and updates only the DOM elements that require changes.</p></div></div><p>The above example would confuse and alienate beginners.</p><p>A developer who’s new to the React web framework won’t understand terms like “JSX transpilation” or “reconciliation engine.” They probably also won’t understand “SPA,” “soft reload,” or “virtual DOM” unless they’ve worked with other JavaScript frameworks.</p><p>When you’re writing a tutorial, remember that you’re explaining things to a non-expert. Avoid jargon, abbreviations, or terms that would be meaningless to a newcomer.</p><p>Here’s an introduction to a React tutorial that uses language most readers will understand, even if they have no background in programming:</p><div><div><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a simple webpage using modern web development tools.</p><p>To generate the website, I’m using React, a free and popular tool for building websites.</p><p>React is a great tool for creating your first website, but it’s also full-featured and powerful enough to build sophisticated apps that serve millions of users.</p></div></div><p>Writing for beginners doesn’t mean alienating everyone with more experience. A knowledgeable reader can scan your tutorial and skip the information they already know, but a beginner can’t read a guide for experts.</p><h2 id="promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">Promise a clear outcome in the title<a href="#promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">🔗</a></h2><p>If a prospective reader is Googling a problem, would the title of your article lead them to the solution? If they see your tutorial on social media or in a newsletter, will your title convince them it’s worth clicking?</p><p>Consider the following weak titles:</p><div><div><ul><li>A Complete Guide to Becoming a Python CSV Ninja</li><li>How to Build Your Own Twitter</li><li>Key Mime Pi: A Cool Gadget You Can Make</li><li>How to Combine Django with Front-End JavaScript</li></ul></div></div><p>The above examples are poor titles because they’re vague. From the title alone, you’d be hard-pressed to say what the tutorial will teach you.</p><p>A tutorial’s title should explain succinctly what the reader can expect to achieve by following your guide.</p><p>Here are clearer rewrites of the previous titles:</p><div><div><ul><li>How to Read a CSV File in Python</li><li>Build a Real-Time Twitter Clone in 15 Minutes with Phoenix LiveView</li><li>Key Mime Pi: Turn Your Raspberry Pi into a Remote Keyboard</li><li>Organizing Your Front-End Codebase in a Django Project</li></ul></div></div><p>These titles give you a clear sense of what you’d learn by reading the tutorial. The titles are clear and specific in what the tutorial delivers.</p><h2 id="explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">Explain the goal in the introduction<a href="#explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">🔗</a></h2><p>If the reader clicks your tutorial, you’re off to a great start. Someone is interested in what you have to say. But you still have to convince them to continue reading.</p><p>As the reader begins a tutorial, they’re trying to answer two critical questions as quickly as possible:</p><ol><li>Should I care about this technology?</li><li>If I care, is this the right tutorial for me?</li></ol><p>The first few sentences of your article should answer those questions.</p><p>For example, if you were writing a tutorial about how to use Docker containers, this would be a terrible introduction:</p><div><div><h3 id="an-introduction-to-docker-containers">An Introduction to Docker Containers<a href="#an-introduction-to-docker-containers">🔗</a></h3><p>Docker is an extremely powerful and versatile technology. It allows you to run your app in a container, which means that it’s separate from everything else on the system.</p><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use Docker to run containers on your internal infrastructure as well as in the cloud.</p></div></div><p>Based on the above introduction, what problem does Docker solve? Who should use it?</p><p>The introduction fails to answer those questions and instead hand-waves with vague terms that ignore anything the reader cares about.</p><p>Here’s a rewrite that explains how Docker solves pain points the reader might have:</p><div><div><h3 id="how-to-use-docker-for-reliable-app-deployments">How to Use Docker for Reliable App Deployments<a href="#how-to-use-docker-for-reliable-app-deployments">🔗</a></h3><p>Do you have a production server that you’re terrified to touch because nobody knows how to rebuild it if it goes offline? Have you ever torn your hair out trying to figure out why your staging environment behaves differently than your production environment?</p><p>Docker is a tool for packaging your app so that it has a consistent, reproducible environment wherever it runs. What’s more, it allows you to define your app’s environment and dependencies in source code, so you know exactly what’s there, even if your app has survived years of tweaks by different teams.</p><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use Docker to package a simple web app and help you avoid common Docker gotchas.</p></div></div><p>The above introduction explains the problems Docker solves and what the tutorial will deliver.</p><p>The introduction doesn’t say, “This tutorial is for people who are brand new to Docker,” but it doesn’t need to. It introduces Docker as a new concept, which tells the reader that the guide is for newcomers.</p><h2 id="show-the-end-result">Show the end result<a href="#show-the-end-result">🔗</a></h2><p>As soon as possible, show a working demo or screenshot of what the reader will create by the end of your tutorial.</p><p>The end result doesn’t have to be anything visually stunning. Here’s an example of how I showed the terminal UI the user would see at the end of my tutorial:</p><figure><a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/fuzz-nix-solution.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw" srcset="/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/fuzz-nix-solution.png 905w" src="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/fuzz-nix-solution.png" alt="" loading="lazy"/></a><figcaption><p>Early in your tutorial, show the reader a preview of what they’ll produce by the end.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Showing the final product reduces ambiguity about your goal. It helps the reader understand if it’s the right guide for them.</p><h2 id="make-code-snippets-copypasteable">Make code snippets copy/pasteable<a href="#make-code-snippets-copypasteable">🔗</a></h2><p>As the reader follows your tutorial, they’ll want to copy/paste your code snippets into their editor or terminal.</p><p>An astonishing number of tutorials unwittingly break copy/paste functionality, making it difficult for the reader to follow along with their examples.</p><h3 id="make-shell-commands-copyable">Make shell commands copyable<a href="#make-shell-commands-copyable">🔗</a></h3><p>One of the most common mistakes authors make in code snippets is including the shell prompt character.</p><p>A shell snippet with leading <code>$</code> characters will break when the user tries to paste it into their terminal.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ sudo apt update       <span># &lt;&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t do this!</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo apt install vim  <span># &lt;&lt;&lt; Users can&#39;t copy/paste this sequence without</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ vim hello.txt         <span># &lt;&lt; picking up the $ character and breaking the command.</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even Google gets this wrong. In some places, their documentation helpfully offers a “Copy code sample” button.</p><figure><a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/gcloud-copy.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 551px, 98vw" srcset="/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/gcloud-copy.webp 549w" src="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/gcloud-copy.webp" alt="Screenshot of Google showing copy button next to shell command examples" loading="lazy"/></a><figcaption><p>Google offers a “Copy code sample” button that incorrectly copies shell terminal characters.</p></figcaption></figure><p>If you click the copy button, it copies the <code>$</code> terminal prompt character, so you can’t paste the code:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>michael@ubuntu: $ gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com

</span></span><span><span>bash: $: command not found
</span></span><span><span>michael@ubuntu:
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There’s a different version of this copy/paste error that’s more subtle:</p><div><div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt install software-properties-common
</span></span><span><span>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt install python3.9
</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div><p>If I try to paste the above snippet, here’s what I see in the terminal:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>0 upgraded, 89 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.

</span></span><span><span>$
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What happened?</p><p>When the <code>apt install software-properties-common</code> command executes, it prompts the user for input. The user can’t answer the prompt because <code>apt</code> just continues reading from the clipboard paste.</p><p>Most command-line tools offer flags or environment variables to avoid forcing the user to respond interactively. Use non-interactive flags to make command snippets easy for the user to paste into their terminal.</p><div><div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt install --yes software-properties-common
</span></span><span><span>sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

</span></span><span><span>sudo apt install software-properties-common
</span></span><span><span>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt install python3.9
</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div><p>If one of the commands fails, the user might not notice. For example, if the first command was <code>sudo apt cache ppa:dummy:non-existent</code>, that command would fail, but the shell would happily execute the next command as if everything was fine.</p><p>In most Linux shells, you can join commands with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and continue lines with a backslash. That tells the shell to stop when any command fails.</p><p>Here’s the user-friendly way to include a series of copy-pasteable commands:</p><div><div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  sudo apt install --yes software-properties-common &amp;&amp; <span>\

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  sudo apt install --yes python3.9
</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div><p>The user can copy/paste the entire sequence without having to tinker with it in an intermediate step. If any of the commands fail, the sequence stops immediately.</p><h3 id="only-show-the-shell-prompt-to-demonstrate-output">Only show the shell prompt to demonstrate output<a href="#only-show-the-shell-prompt-to-demonstrate-output">🔗</a></h3><p>Occasionally, showing the shell prompt character benefits the reader.</p><p>If you show a command and its expected output, the shell prompt character helps the reader distinguish between what they type and what the command returns.</p><p>For example, a tutorial about the <code>jq</code> utility might present results like this:</p><div><div><p>The <code>jq</code> utility allows you to restructure JSON data elegantly:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ curl <span>\
