    <h1>We Let a Crisis Go to Waste - Now What?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><em>Note: You’re receiving Risk Musings on Fridays because experimentation showed Friday newsletters get more traffic than Thursday newsletters. If you strongly prefer a different day, please hit reply and let me know. As always, if there’s anything you’d like me to write about, let me know that too. </em></p><p><em>Okay, onward! </em></p><p><span>Rahm Emanuel was famously </span><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/the-political-art-of-not-wasting-a-crisis-or-getting-wasted-by-it-20200515-p54tej.html" rel="">against letting a crisis go to waste</a><span>. Cynical, yes, but it gets to a deep truth: significant changes are often driven by crises. </span></p><p><span>For example, the Great Depression spurred creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FDIC in the US. Edward Jenner invented vaccination because people were willing to try anything to stop smallpox.</span></p><p><span> Astronauts reached the moon because the US and the Soviet Union were in a Cold War and willing to fund literal moonshots to come out on top. </span></p><p>Reforms are simply easier during and after a crisis: politicians may put aside  differences and work together (so funding becomes available), people may be willing to make sacrifices they would never consider in normal times, and in general, lots of roadblocks and red tape that typically would slow or stall change are cleared away. </p><p><strong>It can’t all be good.</strong></p><p><span>True. Crises are also dangerous for the same reasons. It’s easier for a demagogue or dictator to seize power during an emergency. It’s easier for </span><em>bad </em><span>laws to pass and undermine the values a society previously held dear. And some of our crisis-driven inventions can prove terrifying, like nuclear weapons. </span></p><p>Whether danger or opportunity, it’s normal for crises to generate change at a faster pace than normal. We saw that during the COVID pandemic with rapid vaccine development and rollouts. </p><p><span>But we also saw something disturbing during and after the COVID pandemic, a sign of what I’ll call a failed crisis: the </span><em>devolution </em><span>of pandemic readiness, especially in the US but to some degree in some other countries, too. </span></p><p><strong>Not just letting a crisis go to waste but letting a crisis leave the system worse off than before? </strong></p><p><span>Yeah. I think the world is </span><em>less </em><span>prepared for a new pandemic than we were in 2019, for several reasons: </span></p><ul><li><p>Polarization around the effectiveness of and approach to COVID lockdowns, vaccines, treatments, and masks </p></li><li><p>Emergent doubts about the CDC’s and WHO’s much-vaunted capabilities </p></li><li><p>Disparate impacts of COVID on different socioeconomic classes </p></li><li><p>Lingering questions about the origins of the pandemic </p></li><li><p>Individual burnout with regard to pandemics</p></li><li><p>Exhaustion of government and industry appetites for emergency spending</p></li></ul><p>Let’s talk more about polarization and trust, which seem important in terms of why this crisis felt so difficult. I remember feeling, very clearly, that I was on my own in winter and spring 2020. Hospitals were overloaded, tests were scarce, information changed every week, and political interests polarized what should have been a straightforward scientific message. Institutional trust fell, sometimes for good reasons (as just one example, the CDC’s early test-kit failures and slow responses as the disease stormed across the US were shocking—but the CDC was also struggling to gain political support amid a global emergency, which is a bizarre position to be in). </p><p><strong>So, it was a mess-and-a-half. What about the next time a pandemic arises?</strong></p><p>If another pandemic happens anytime soon, there will likely be even more doubters than last time, and less readiness to open public funding coffers. Recent tensions would likely rise to the surface and ignite, immediately complicating the response. </p><p><span>Can we turn this around before another pandemic strikes? As I wrote in </span><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/emerging-risks-and-smart-regulation" rel="">Emerging Risks and Smart Regulation</a><span>, there </span><em>are</em><span> ways to build trust proactively—and if we need anything right now, it’s greater trust in our institutions and in each other. For pandemic preparedness, that could mean: </span></p><ul><li><p>Strengthening communication among local, state, and federal public health departments and helping them proactively build trust with communities. </p></li><li><p><em>Cutting </em><span>red tape for testing, reporting, and treatment of various diseases. </span></p></li><li><p>Setting up rapid-response channels designed to take early reports from doctors seriously and act fast to investigate. </p></li><li><p>Banning gain-of-function research (whether or not it contributed to the COVID pandemic, gain-of-function research poses significant risks that may not be worth the potential benefits).</p></li></ul><p><span>We’re not destined to fail in the face of another pandemic, but we </span><em>are</em><span> less prepared than we were in 2019. That isn’t set in stone, though. The things that went wrong with COVID don’t have to define the future. That’s risk management in action: learning from incidents and addressing root causes to improve resilience for the next time. </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
