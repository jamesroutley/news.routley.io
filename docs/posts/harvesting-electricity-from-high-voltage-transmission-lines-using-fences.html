        <p>When you have a bunch of 230 kV transmission lines running over your property, why not use them for some scientific experiments? This is where the [Double M Innovations] YouTube channel comes into play, including a recent video where the idea of harvesting electricity from HV transmission lines <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDm00Ww6qE4" target="_blank">using regular fences</a> is put to an initial test.</p>

The cable was then put up at a height consistent with that of fencing at about 1.2 m (4 ft), making sure that no contact with the ground occurred anywhere. One end of the copper shield of the coax was connected to the full bridge rectifier, with the opposite AC side connected to a metal stake driven into the ground. From this the capacitor was being charged.</p>
<p>As for the results, they were rather concerning and flashy, with the 1000 VAC-rated multimeter going out of range on the AC side of the bridge rectifier, and the capacitor slowly charging up to 1000 V before the experiment was stopped.</p>
<p>Based on the capacity of the capacitor and the final measured voltage of 907 VDC, roughly 36.2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule?useskin=vector" target="_blank">Joule</a> would have been collected, giving some idea of the power one could collect from a few kilometers of fencing wire underneath such HV lines, and why you probably want to ground them if energy collecting is not your focus.</p>
<p>As for whether storing the power inductively coupled on fence wire can be legally used is probably something best discussed with your local energy company.</p>
