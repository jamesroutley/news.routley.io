    <p><strong>Saturday, October  1, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>Last week, I read <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11466590537214723805">&#34;Architecture of a Database System&#34;</a> for a <a href="http://redbook.io">Red Book</a> reading group.</p>
<p>This is as massive paper: 119 pages.
What surprised me is how approachable it is.
I have relatively little background building database systems and more experience using them.
Despite this, the paper was readable and I was able to take away quite a bit from it, which I&#39;ve already put into practice in my <a href="https://github.com/ntietz/anode-kv">redis-compatible KV store</a> that I&#39;m building to learn about database systems.</p>
<p>The paper is structured in a way that makes it easy to skip around and focus on the parts that are most interesting or useful to you at the moment.
It also gives a lot of pointers into other papers or texts to learn more or build a foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first section is under ten pages and gives a map of the rest of the paper as well as of architecture in general, so you can put the different pieces in context.
This is probably the section I would recommend <em>everyone</em> read.</li>
<li>The second and third sections are also really useful as a user of a database system to put in concrete terms why, for example, PostgreSQL does not handle large numbers of open connections very well.
(Hello, <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a>!).</li>
<li>The fourth section gives an overview of the relational query processor and helps understand how queries are parsed, optimized, and executed.</li>
<li>The fifth section talks about storage and what considerations go into making it efficient.</li>
<li>The sixth section talks about transactions, concurrency, and recovery. This section breaks down what ACID is (spoiler: it&#39;s not well defined, but it&#39;s useful anyway), talks about locking, and most importantly goes through transaction isolation levels. It wraps up with durability. This section was probably the most intense for me!</li>
<li>The seventh section talks about the junk drawer that exists in database architectures, just like in all architectures: shared components that get shoved into one category, the section of misfit toys.
I skimmed this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this paper is an excellent introduction to database architecture for users of databases and for anyone who wants to learn more about the internals.
It will give you a good, broad foundation which you can use to drive further exploration and improve your understanding of databases as you use them.</p>
