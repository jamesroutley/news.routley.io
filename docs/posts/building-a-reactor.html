                        <p> A nuclear reactor is just a system that can get heavy elements to break apart in an
                            efficient
                            manner. The reactor itself, the nuclear core, is not a complicated mechanical contraption.
                            The
                            core has no moving parts or complex mechanisms. It&#39;s just an arrangement of special
                            materials,
                            that permits nuclear reactions to occur. There are moving parts to transfer the
                            heat and control the reactions, but it&#39;s basically a pile of bricks.
                        </p>

                        <p>The goal is to get the fuel to keep splitting apart continuously and self sustainably in what
                           is
                           called a chain reaction. This generates heat that is carried away by a coolant, and which we
                           can
                           use for industrial processes like baking cookies or generating electrical power.
                        </p>


                        <h3>
                            Neutrons as multiplying bullets
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            To split atoms and release nuclear binding energy, we need to launch neutrons at the fuel
                            atoms.
                            Where do we get these neutrons? We could use an accelerator, but that’s not very practical
                            and
                            poses a few safety issues. The spontaneous fission of U-235 or U-238 could be used. But
                            these don’t happen very often. Indeed, 1 kg of natural Uranium generates just 10 such
                            neutrons
                            per second. Which is not very useful.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Fortunately, every time an isotope fissions, or breaks apart, it releases new neutrons that
                            can
                            cause more fissions. A U-235 fission consumes just 1 neutron while releasing an
                            average of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/145296/contributions/1381141/attachments/136909/194258/lecture24.pdf?ref=usnc.com">
                            2.43 fast-moving neutrons</a>, with a slight <a href="https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-08/jefreport-24.pdf?ref=usnc.com">dependence</a>
                            on the original neutron&#39;s energy and the target isotope. This gives us 2.43 neutrons to
                            cause an
                            extra fission
                            reaction, which means we have a 1.43 neutron margin for inefficiencies in the system. We’re
                            going to need that margin because we’re going to lose neutrons when they get absorbed by
                            materials or escape from the core altogether.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To sum up, we will use whatever neutrons available to cause fission reactions in U-235 which
                            release 2-3 neutrons each, which in turn cause fission reactions and produce more neutrons,
                            and
                            so on. We will try to get neutrons to multiply like bacteria, and carefully control the
                            growth
                            or decline in the population to sustain a desired number of fission reactions per unit time.
                        </p>
                        <p>How
                           much power is being produced? The thermal power produced is proportional to the number of
                           fission reactions which is also proportional to the total number of neutrons at any given
                           time.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Criticality</h3>
                        <h4>Critical System</h4>
                        <p>What we’ve been doing here is trying to get a critical system. A critical system is just an
                           arrangement of matter that can support a steady state neutron population. Neutron births are
                           balanced by neutron deaths. Neutron births take place when a U-235 fissions or when some
                           fission
                           fragments decay. Neutrons “die” when they are absorbed, escape the reactor core, or are
                           utilized
                           to cause a fission reaction. A reactor core operating at constant power has a constant
                           neutron
                           population, and it is called “critical.”

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At a constant 1 MWth, there are approximately 3.1x10<sup>16</sup> fission reactions taking
                            place
                            per
                            second (1 J/s divided by 200 MeV/ U fission). The neutrons causing these reactions move at
                            roughly 2200 m/s and have lifetimes of
                            about 20ms. This 1 MWth reactor would have a standing population of 1.5x10<sup>15</sup>
                            neutrons
                            (fissions/sec / lifetime), but probably about 2.5x that to account for neutron absorptions.
                        </p>
                        <p> We can also find the volumetric neutron density which is the neutrons per cm<sup>3</sup> or
                            neutrons per mL. For a low power density like 1 W/cm<sup>3</sup>, like the MMR, we would
                            have
                            3x10<sup>9</sup> neutrons per cm<sup>3</sup>. For higher power density of a typical LWR, on
                            the
                            order 50 W/cm<sup>3</sup>, it would be 50x higher. This is not much compared to the nubmer
                            of
                            atoms in a cm<sup>3</sup>, roughly 10<sup>22</sup>. So neutrons don&#39;t collide with each
                            other, but only with atoms.

                        </p>
                        <h4>Sub-critical System</h4>
                        <p>
                            A sub-critical system has a declining neutron population. Deaths exceed births. A
                            sub-critical
                            core’s power is zero or declining. The core is fizzling out.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Super-critical System</h4>

                        <p>
                            A super-critical system has a growing neutron population. Births exceed deaths. As in many
                            biological growth models, the growth is exponential as each new neutron can give birth to
                            generations of daughter neutrons. And just as in all growth models, the growth does not
                            remain
                            exponential indefinitely as negative feedback mechanisms curb the growth and turn
                            exponential
                            functions into logistic functions or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_effect?ref=usnc.com">collapse</a>
                            functions.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For bacteria, the growth limiters are the walls of the petri
                            dish and the food supply. For neutrons, growth is limited by many mechanisms, most
                            importantly
                            rising temperatures which either cause more neutrons to die or force the core to fall apart
                            and
                            become sub-critical - more on that later.

                        </p>

                        <p>Nuclear reactors carefully take advantage of the limiting mechanisms to control the rate of
                           energy release.
                           On the other hand, the design of nuclear weapons aims to overcome the negative feedback
                           mechanisms to achieve a rapid growth of the fissions and fully utilize the nuclear
                           material in a very short period of time.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Core Build-up</h3>
                        <p> Let’s try to make a core. In each simulation, we’ll seed the sample with a starting
                            population
                            of neutrons and watch them propagate through the core, either achieving stability or going
                            extinct. We are aiming to create a self sustaining neutron population in the core.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first thing we’ll try to do is use the neutrons naturally emitted by the fuel itself.
                            The
                            fuel is just sitting there and spontaneously fissioning and we’re hoping these neutrons are
                            enough to get a chain reaction going.
                        </p>


                        


                        <p>There’s a little problem. While there are some fissions, illustrated by the blue colored
                           blips,
                           most of the neutrons are escaping! And on top of that, the neutrons are not
                           always doing what we want. We’d like all the neutrons to just cause fissions in the Uranium
                           atoms. But nuclear reactions are probabilistic processes, and fissioning Uranium atoms is
                           just
                           one of the many possible things a neutron can do. The probability of those things occurring
                           depends on the materials and the energy of the neutrons themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>The neutrons emitted from the U-235 spontaneous fissions are fast (high energy 2 MeV), moving
                           at
                           about 5% of the speed of light in random directions. At those speeds, the neutrons are not
                           very
                           likely to cause a fission of U-235 or U-238. Instead of causing a fission reaction, they can
                           be
                           scattered or absorbed. In a scattering reaction, the neutron interacts with an atom to slow
                           down
                           and change direction. In an absorption or capture, the target atom absorbs the neutron. So
                           the
                           neutrons travel around the core hitting atoms and slowing down until they are either
                           absorbed,
                           cause a fission, or escape from the core. Absorptions and escapes reduce the neutron
                           population
                           while fissions will grow the population.
                        </p>

                        <p> There are lots of things to consider. The nuclear reactions are numerous and probabilistic.
                            To
                            control these reactions, we have to know their probabilities and reaction products as well
                            as
                            the energies and directions of the resulting neutrons. We have to know that U-238 and U-235
                            have
                            very different reaction probabilities for different neutron energies. For example, U-238 is
                            likely to be fissioned only by fast neutrons while U-235 is far more easily fissioned by
                            slow
                            neutrons. On the other hand, U-238 can absorb a neutron to eventually become Pu-239, which
                            is
                            fissile like U-235, easily fissioning with slow neutrons. In current reactors, the
                            fissioning of
                            U-238 contribute 5-10% of thermal power, and the fissioning of the Pu-239 derived from U-238
                            in
                            the reactor contributes up to 50% of the total thermal power.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Measuring and predicting the probabilities of different reactions for different isotopes and
                            neutron energies is the crowning achievement of nuclear physics. We use cross sections to
                            describe the probabilities for each reaction, for each isotope or material, and across
                            different
                            neutron energies. We show only the fission, scattering, and absorption cross sections. For a
                            given input neutron with a particular energy, we can read out the probability of a
                            particular
                            reaction occurring.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A cross section is basically the practical interaction area of the atoms when they are
                            bombarded
                            with neutrons. While an atom has a physical cross sectional area of a about 1 barn
                            (10<sup>-24</sup>
                            cm<sup>2</sup>), the somewhat complex nuclear physics of nuclear forces and interactions
                            leads
                            to wide
                            ranging cross sections for various neutron energies interacting with different isotopes.
                        </p>


                        


                        <p>
                            The way to present cross sections for physical materials utilizes their density and is as a
                            probability per unit length.
                            This is called the macroscopic cross section. We can also consider the probability per unit
                            time, which simply multiples the macroscopic cross section by the velocity, but this is less
                            useful when implementing simulations. We can change the materials below.

                        </p>

                        


                        <p>
                            Let’s use a neutron cannon to seed the core and observe what happens when we change neutron
                            velocity (energy). We can change it from very slow neutrons with velocities of a few hundred
                            m/s
                            to fast neutrons at a few percent of the speed of light.</p>
                        

                        


                        <p> We can get a lot more fissions at lower neutron energies. But still, lots of the neutrons
                            die by
                            absorption or by escaping from the core. Also, we don&#39;t know how to make those slow neutrons
                            yet.</p>
                        <h4>Size</h4>


                        <p>We’ve got to arrange things to make those fission reactions as likely as possible. So let’s
                           keep
                           adding Uranium by adding more blocks. This way, whatever direction the neutron scatters it
                           will
                           come across more Uranium atoms, and any neutrons that pass through one bit may cause a
                           fission in
                           another bit further along. And we can keep doing that. Pressing the reset button will unleash
                           a
                           burst of initial neutrons at the center of the core to test the conditions.</p>

                        <p>
                            Enlarging the reactor reduces the leakage of neutrons. This has to do with the surface area
                            to
                            volume ratio. As the radius of the sphere
                            increases, the volume increases faster than its surface area, and a smaller fraction of the
                            core’s neutrons are able to escape. One reason reactors have been designed and built to be
                            extremely large is to reduce this leakage of neutrons. Less leakage and the fuel can be used
                            more efficiently, lowering the overall cost of energy.
                        </p>

                        


                        <p> Unfortunately, this won’t work even for an infinite amount of natural uranium. The U-238
                            fission
                            cross section is much lower than the absorption cross section. Also the neutrons generated
                            in
                            the fission are too
                            slow to appreciably tap into the fission cross sections on the far right of the spectrum for
                            U-238. We’re losing too
                            many neutrons from absorptions and the neutrons that aren’t absorbed aren&#39;t able to
                            slow down to speeds that are likely to cause fission reactions in the tiny amount of U-235.
                            But
                            we have the tools to fix
                            this
                            and create self-sustaining chain reactions. These tools are enrichment, moderation, and
                            size.</p>


                        <h4>Enrichment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Using only the natural uranium available on Earth today, there’s just no way to get a
                            stable,
                            let alone growing, population of neutrons to sustain nuclear reactions. Natural reactors
                            like
                            those found in the Oklo region of Gabon were active roughly 1.8 billion years ago when the
                            enrichment was close to 4% and could not work using today&#39;s natural enrichment level. The
                            problem is the U-238 is absorbing a lot of neutrons and it doesn’t easily fission.
                        </p>

                        <p> We can manually increase the U-235 content in the fuel by various enrichment processes. This
                            is
                            an extra expense but very doable. The U-235 displaces the less fissile U-238, and means
                            fewer
                            neutrons will be lost to the U-238 and more neutrons will be available to interact with the
                            U-235 to cause fissions. U-235 is far easier to fission than U-238, and can utilize both
                            fast
                            and slow neutrons. Just look at the spectrum.
                        </p>

                        




                        <h4>Moderation</h4>
                        <p>
                            We can also slow the neutrons down, or moderate them, so they are more likely to cause
                            fission
                            reactions in the U-235. The U-235 fission releases neutrons moving at about 200 km/s (fast
                            neutrons 2 MeV), and we need to slow them down to 2 km/s (thermal neutrons .1 eV) so they
                            are
                            more likely to cause fissions in U-235. There are several moderating materials that can slow
                            down neutrons without absorbing them that are also resistant to radiation damage. We’ll just
                            use
                            graphite, the same material Fermi used in the Chicago pile and what high temperature
                            gas-cooled
                            reactors use nowadays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All materials will slow down neutrons to a certain extent, but we want materials that are as
                            efficient as possible per unit of volume. When neutrons hit heavy atoms like Uranium, it&#39;s
                            like
                            a ping pong ball hitting a bowling ball and the velocity change in the neutron is very
                            small.Colliding with light atoms like hydrogen and carbon is like a ping pong ball hitting
                            another ping pong ball, and is far more effective at slowing down neutrons.
                            We also want the moderator to be atomically dense so that the chance of interaction is as
                            high
                            as possible. So hydrogen gas is not as effective as liquid water (H20).

                        </p>

                        


                        <p>There are a few ways we might add graphite. We can add it to the fuel homogeneously so that
                           the
                           uranium and graphite are smeared together.
                        </p>

                        

                        <p>But mixing the fuel and moderator into a smeared material is not optimal as the U-238 present
                           in
                           the fuel tends to absorb the neutrons as they are slowing down through the resonance
                           absorption region of the spectrum. It is more effective to keep the fuel and moderator
                           separate,
                           clumping the fuel in chunks. This clumping arrangement, also called heterogeneous, allows
                           neutrons to slow down while traveling between fuel chunks and without getting absorbed by the
                           U-238.</p>

  <p> Below, you can see the neutron pass from one material to antoher. This is shown in both the 3d model and the 2 spectrum.</p>


                        


                        <p>Each of the tools discussed can be tuned to achieve different sized cores that achieve criticality. The
                           nuclear core designer will balance these design parameters to achieve a critical core with
                           desired metrics of size, fuel loading, fuel utilization, and ultimately cost.
                        </p>

                        


                        <h3> Other Considerations</h3>

                        <h4> Design Options</h4>
                        <p>There are significant limitations on the materials and geometries available for nuclear
                           reactor
                           environments and there’s not much wiggle room on the materials we can use.
                           Most materials are neutron killers and cannot tolerate any significant radiation damage, high
                           temperatures, or corrosive environments. And you have to keep an eye on the materials
                           activation
                           - which refers to the habit of materials to become radioactive when subject to radiation
                           either
                           by absorbing radioactive substances or by reactions with the radiation.
                        </p>
                        <p>The research and development required to
                           understand materials for use in the complex nuclear environment is often a decades long
                           endeavor
                           with limited success. The knobs we can play
                           with are the ratios and arrangements of materials, the coolant, the enrichment of the
                           Uranium,
                           and the size of the reactor. Later we will be able to choose the power level.</p>


                        <h4>Excess Criticality</h4>
                        <p>
                            To make the reactions self-sustaining, we need to at least achieve a critical system. But in
                            practice we want a system that can be super-critical by simply moving the control rods out
                            of
                            the reactor. This way, we can change the power level and keep burning uranium over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The latter point about burning uranium over time concerns the fact that as we burn the fuel,
                            the
                            core conditions are changing. First, the U-235 content is decreasing over time, reducing
                            criticality. In addition, many of the fission products produced by the nuclear reactions
                            will
                            absorb neutrons, so that over time, the reactor by itself becomes less and less conducive to
                            neutron multiplication. On the other hand, some of the fission or decay products are
                            fissionable
                            materials like U-233 which will help extend the life of the core. To account for all this,
                            we
                            have to make the starting configuration sufficiently super-critical that it can tolerate an
                            increasing number of fission products that poison the neutron environment. How
                            super-critical
                            does it have to be? Enough that we can burn an economical fraction of the fuel without
                            compromising safety.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Nuclear Startup</h4>
                        <p>The spontaneous fission of U-235 is not typically relied upon to start-up up a fresh reactor
                           core. The spontaneous
                           fission half-lives for U-235 and U-238 are 3.5*10<sup>17</sup> and 8.4*10<sup>15</sup> years
                           and
                           produces an average
                           of 1.86 neutrons per fission. 1kg of natural Uranium can be expected to produce about 14
                           neutrons per second depending on the enrichment, which can be sufficient to start up a
                           nuclear
                           core. However, in practice the startup of a nuclear reactor is aided by a more emissive
                           neutron
                           starter like Cf-252 or Pu-238 and Be so that operators can be really sure there&#39;s enough
                           neutrons
                           to get things going. </p>
