    <h1>Kickstarter Update #4</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>April was not a good month for writing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/post/758">my last post</a> I net ~3k words in March. In April I net ~1k words. I can attribute this to two things: remaining very busy at work, and having my mom visit for two weeks.</p>

<p>Given in January I declared <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/natwelch/make-100-locative-garden/posts/4302826">I would be done writing in July</a>, I really need to step it up.</p>
<p>I am currently at 14,225 words total. My guesstimate is that the final version will be 70,000. That&#39;s pretty daunting to realize how far behind I am. Let&#39;s do some rounding and say I need to write 55,000 words before July 1st, 2025. That&#39;s 54 days from now. That means I need to write a little over one thousand words a day.</p>
<p>I also need to stop self-editing so much during writing. This is something I am pretty good at when writing non-fiction, but while writing fiction I find myself editing, deleting and revising constantly. This habit needs to stop. The goal should be words on page, as I have purposely scheduled editing time post July.</p>
<p>So my ask to you is to be annoying to me and hold me accountable for these 1k words a day. Text messages, DMs, sky writing, whatever would be appreciated. I will get this book to you all this year.</p>
<p>Lots of love from the east coast,</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
