				The New York Times reports that &#34;After more than three weeks without being able to leave the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine, 64 workers were able to be rotated out, the plant said on Sunday.&#34;

<i>Staff at the plant, which includes more than 200 technical personnel and guards, had not been able to rotate shifts since February 23, a day before Russian forces took control of the site, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which serves as a nuclear watchdog for the United Nations.  In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChornobylNPP/posts/268512748802947">Facebook post</a>, the plant said that to rotate the 64 workers, 46 volunteers were sent to the site to make sure operations at the plant could continue.</i></p></div>
