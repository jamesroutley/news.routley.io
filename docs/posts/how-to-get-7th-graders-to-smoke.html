Like when a conservative Christian senator sponsors a bill that’s like “Let’s Make It Illegal to Be Horny” and then gets caught at a brothel wearing a diaper and nipple clamps. That’s the level of hypocrisy we’re dealing with here. If you claim to care about preventing sexual harassment and then you’re out here asking whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a “county” law, you </span><em>do not </em><span>care about preventing sexual harassment.</span></p><p>There are lots of reasons why we are continually surprised by how hard it is to change people, but there are three particularly nefarious ones that deserve closer inspection.</p><p><span>We perceive ourselves in full 4000K HD with Dolby Atmos Surround Sound, but when we perceive each other, it’s like we’re watching a VHS tape that someone made by using a Motorola Razr phone c. 2007 to record the screen on the back of an airplane seat.</span></p><ol><li><p>Go to gym</p></li><li><p>Work out</p></li><li><p>Get jacked</p></li></ol><p><span>But if </span><em>I </em><span>made a workout plan for me, it would look more like this:</span></p><ol><li><p>Decide which of my very important tasks to ignore so I can go to the gym instead.</p></li><li><p>Find workout clothes.</p></li><li><p>Workout clothes are all old and ratty.</p></li><li><p>Look for new workout clothes online.</p></li><li><p>Spend the rest of the day figuring out whether I’m more of a nylon poplin guy or a jacquard knit guy.</p></li><li><p>Wait for clothes to come in.</p></li><li><p>Go to gym.</p></li><li><p>Figure out which podcast I want to listen to while I work out.</p></li><li><p>Okay now I’m ready to work out.</p></li><li><p>Wait I’ve heard this episode before, this the one where Malcolm Gladwell proves that Toyotas are safe by driving one off the George Washington Bridge.</p></li><li><p><span>Okay </span><em>now</em><span> I’m ready to work out.</span></p></li><li><p>Oh no there’s someone on the machine I want to use.</p></li><li><p>Mill around a bit, get on another machine and pretend it’s the one I wanted to use in the first place.</p></li><li><p>Okay he’s gone. Get on the other machine.</p></li><li><p>Oh no I don’t know how to use this machine.</p></li><li><p>Watch a YouTube video where a frighteningly large man tells me how to use the machine.</p></li><li><p>Oh no the frighteningly large man is now telling me January 6th was a false flag operation.</p></li><li><p>Use machine.</p></li><li><p>It kinda hurts, but I can’t tell if it’s a “You’re getting stronger” kind of hurt, or a “If you keep doing this you won’t be able to walk when you’re 57” kind of hurt.</p></li><li><p>Repeat for another 45 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Go home.</p></li><li><p>Wait I have to do this every day until I die??</p></li></ol><p>I’m going to talk about implicit bias for a second, so if you’re the kind of person who gets upset about that, please deactivate your Pedantry Module and just play along for the sake of the example.</p><p><span>Psychologists would very much like to reduce people’s implicit biases, especially their anti-Black biases. So far, they have </span><a href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=acc5cec4-865f-434f-916e-99f043d57352%40redis" rel="">failed</a><span> to do that. And they’ve tried lots of stuff:</span></p><ul><li><p>Helping people set a goal to not be biased</p></li><li><p>Lecturing them about how great multiculturalism is</p></li><li><p>Telling them a story that counters their stereotypes (“Imagine a White guy attacks you and throws you in his trunk, and then a Black guy shows up and saves the day!”)</p></li><li><p>Making people play a virtual dodgeball game where all of their teammates are courteous Black players and all of their opponents are mean nasty White players</p></li><li><p>Showing them a bunch of pictures of Black faces with the word “GOOD” written next to them</p></li></ul><p>Some of these interventions changed people’s biases in the moment, but none of the effects lasted beyond 24 hours. And of course they didn’t! As soon as participants leave the lab, they go right back into the world that massaged those biases into the folds of their brains in the first place. You can’t permanently change implicit biases with 15 minutes of screentime, just like you can’t spray someone with a hose and expect them to stay wet forever.</p><p><span>This is part of why changing people is so surprisingly hard—no matter how much you focus on the person in front of you, you’ll never appreciate the million tiny influences that made them who they are and that keep them that way. If you really want to make someone different, you might have to change the TV they watch, the music they listen to, the things they learn in school, the friends they hang out with, the role models they look up to, etc., and if you do all that, congratulations, you’ve started what we call a </span><em>cult</em><span>. Which, unlike social scientists, do have a pretty good track record of changing people.</span></p><p>Most people’s theories of human behavior are just never gonna be tested, and so their hypotheses can be both wrong and immortal. For example, if you think the solution to political polarization is to drug Congress with magic mushrooms, then a) nobody’s ever going to prove you wrong, and b) I think I know which anti-drug program you got in high school.</p><p>On top of this, we’re all running our own tiny-N, p-hacked studies and then slathering the results in confirmation bias:</p><ul><li><p><span>“My kid does better when we feed him raw beef and read him </span><em>Ulysses</em><span>, so that’s what all schools should do, and the fact that this also happens to fit my personal and political aesthetics is merely a coincidence.”</span></p></li><li><p>“I gave my religion’s holy book to a person who was struggling and now they’re doing better, which is proof my religion is true.”</p></li><li><p>“Some famous CEOs were mean to their employees and got good results, so I should do that too, which is convenient because I am a jerk.”</p></li></ul><p>These itsy-bitsy confounded little pseudo-studies are more convincing to us than any “official” experiments precisely because they unfold before our own eyes. On the one hand, that’s fair—“official” experiments are so poor on average that you should consider them guilty until proven innocent. But doing low-quality uncontrolled social science in your own backyard is a good way to increase your convictions without increasing your evidence.</p><p><span>Even when there is reasonably good data, our hypotheses about how humans work are often so vague that they can withstand any attempts at falsification. Okay, so </span><em>this </em><span>emotions-based anti-drug intervention didn’t succeed, but maybe that’s because the instructors weren’t motivated enough, or it didn’t go on long enough, or they used the wrong kind of deep breathing technique, or they should have targeted fifth-graders instead of seventh-graders, etc., on and on, forever. If you can only think of all these critiques and exceptions after the fact, however, you at least have to admit you didn’t really know what you were talking about in the first place.</span></p><p><span>The philosopher Michael Strevens </span><a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/" rel="">argues</a><span> that science requires humans to adopt an “alien mindset”—you have to ignore common sense, the wisdom of the ancients, the literal word of God, etc. Why would anyone toss out everything they know and instead try to learn things by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi" rel="">putting rotten meat in a jar</a><span>? Science took so long to develop, Strevens says, because it seemed </span><em>stupid</em><span>.</span></p><p>I say: we must become even stupider. If all of our intuitions, theories, and knowledge cause us to run programs that make tweens do more drugs—well, then, we oughta ditch our intuitions, theories, and knowledge!</p><p><span>Sufficiently stupid people would look at </span><a href="http://SexualHarassmentTraining.com" rel="">SexualHarassmentTraining.com</a><span> and ask, “Wait, how does this work? You show people walls of text and then ask them multiple choice questions and then they don’t sexually harass each other anymore?” They would wonder whether an imaginary dodgeball game could really make people less racist. They might question whether a couple deep-breathing exercises are enough to stop seventh graders from doing shots at a party.</span></p></div></div></div>
