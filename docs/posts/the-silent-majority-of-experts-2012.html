    <h1>The silent majority of experts (2012)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="c1"><p>When I still followed the Usenet group <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/128.html">comp.lang.forth</a>, I wasn&#39;t the only person frustrated by the lack of people doing interesting things with the language. Elizabeth Rather, co-founder of Forth, Inc., offered the following explanation: there <b>are</b> people solving real problems with Forth, but they don&#39;t hang-out in the newsgroup. She would know; her company exists to support the construction of commercial Forth projects.</p><p>In 1996 I worked on a port of <i>The Need for Speed</i> to the SEGA Saturn. (If you think that&#39;s an odd system to be involved with, I also did 3DO development, went to a Jaguar conference at Atari headquarters, and had an official set of Virtual Boy documentation.) There were a number of game developers with public faces in the 1990s, but the key people responsible for the original version of <i>The Need for Speed</i>, released in 1994, remained unknown and behind the scenes. That&#39;s even though they had written a game based around rigid-body physics before most developers had any idea that term was relevant to 3D video games. And they did it without an FPU: the whole engine used fixed-point math.</p><p>Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they&#39;re working on, but there are even more people who don&#39;t. Blogging takes time, for example, and not everyone enjoys it. Other people are working on commercial products and can&#39;t divulge the inner workings of their code.</p><p>That we&#39;re unable to learn from the silent majority of experts casts an unusual light upon online discussions. Just because looking down your nose at C++ or Perl is the popular opinion doesn&#39;t mean that those languages aren&#39;t being used by very smart folks to build amazing, finely crafted software. An appealing theory that gets frantically upvoted may have well-understood but non-obvious drawbacks. All we&#39;re seeing is an intersection of the people working on interesting things <i>and</i> who like to write about it--and that&#39;s not the whole story.</p><p>Your time may better spent <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/138.html">getting in there and trying things</a> rather than reading about what other people think.</p><p>(If you liked this, you might enjoy <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/118.html">Photography as a Non-Technical Hobby</a>.)</p><p><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/143.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>June 21, 2012</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/142.html">Your Coding Philosophies are Irrelevant</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/141.html">Another Programming Idiom You&#39;ve Never Heard Of</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/140.html">The Pace of Technology is Slower than You Think</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/139.html">We Who Value Simplicity Have Built Incomprehensible Machines</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/138.html">You, Too, Can Be on the Cutting Edge of Functional Programming Research</a></li></ul></div></div>
