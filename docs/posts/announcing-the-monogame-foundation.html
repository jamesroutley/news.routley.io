          <p>Two months ago, <a href="https://community.monogame.net/t/update-on-monogames-status/19457">we announced</a> our intention to create a non-profit organization to help fund and secure the future of the MonoGame framework as an open-source initiative.</p>
<p>Today, we are pleased to announce that the MonoGame Foundation is officially in business and has applied for non-profit status (which is pending validation).</p>
<p>The MonoGame Foundation’s goal is to bolster the development of the MonoGame framework by voting and funding initiatives to strengthen or expand the open-source project. To this purpose, the Patreon and active donations have been redirected to this new entity.</p>
<p>This new step wouldn’t be possible without a major sponsor: <a href="https://re-logic.com/">Re-Logic</a>, developers of <a href="https://terraria.org/">Terraria</a>, who have committed to support the foundation with a $100,000 donation. On behalf of the foundation board, we would like to celebrate their support and dedication to open-source software, as well as renewing our thanks to past, present, and future donors.</p>
<p>To highlight this shift, we are introducing a new website which is now fully <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/monogame.github.io">automated with Github</a>. The paint is still fresh, but we hope to expand it with more <a href="https://monogame.net/about.html#foundation">information about the MonoGame Foundation</a>, like how it operates, and how to join it or contribute.</p>
<p>We will soon communicate about the foundation roadmap and the start of projects.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the community for its continuous support, and we hope to build the next iteration of the framework together.</p>
<p>The MonoGame Foundation board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dean Ellis, President</li>
<li>Marko Jeremic, Chairman</li>
<li>Dominique Louis, Treasurer</li>
<li>Simon Jackson, Secretary</li>
<li>Tom Spilman</li>
<li>Thomas Altenburger</li>

        <p>Woo! This is such a huge step forwards and having the (massive) backing of a beloved studio like Re-Logic is huge news. I can’t wait to see the growth MonoGame’s going to have now that it has the resources to compete with at least the big FOSS engine that is Godot.</p>
