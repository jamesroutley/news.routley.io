    <h1>Fed raises rates by another 75 bps to fight inflation</h1>

The market swung as Fed Chairman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/">Jerome Powell</a> discussed the outlook for interest rates and the economy.</p><p>Traders have been concerned that the Fed is remaining more hawkish for longer than some had anticipated. Projections from the meeting indicated that the Fed expects to raise rates by at least 1.25 percentage points in its two remaining meetings this year.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>&#39;Main message has not changed&#39;</h2><div><p>&#34;My main message has not changed since Jackson Hole,&#34; Powell said in his post-meeting news conference, referring to his policy speech at the Fed&#39;s annual symposium in August in Wyoming. &#34;The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.&#34;</p><p>The increases that started in March — and from a point of near-zero — mark the most aggressive Fed tightening since it started using the overnight funds rate as its principal policy tool in 1990. The only comparison was in 1994, when the Fed hiked a total of 2.25 percentage points; it would begin cutting rates by July of the following year.</p><p>Powell conceded a recession is possible, particularly if the Fed has to keep tightening aggressively.</p><p>&#34;No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession will be,&#34; he said.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>&#39;75 is the new 25&#39;</h2><div><p>The dot plot showed virtually all members on board with the higher rates in the near term, though there were some variations in subsequent years. Six of the 19 &#34;dots&#34; were in favor of taking rates to a 4.75%-5% range next year, but the central tendency was to 4.6%, which would put rates in the 4.5%-4.75% area. The Fed targets its fund rate in quarter-point ranges.</p><p>Markets have been bracing for a more aggressive Fed.</p><p>&#34;I believe 75 is the new 25 until something breaks, and nothing has broken yet,&#34; said Bill Zox, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in reference to the size of the rate hikes. &#34;The Fed is not anywhere close to a pause or a pivot. They are laser-focused on breaking inflation. A key question is what else might they break.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
