Like a human driver, the Waymo Driver encounters potential hazards — from a vehicle runn</span>ing a red light to a car suddenly changing lanes. To evaluate our Driver’s ability to avoid or mitigate crashes in situations like these, we developed a comprehensive scenario-based testing methodology called Waymo<span>’s Collision Avoidance Testing (CAT). To maintain transparency and provide the public with a deeper understanding of our safety approach, we are publishing a <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/collision-avoidance-testing">paper</a> to describe how we judge good collision avoidance performance, how we identify the right set of scenarios to test, and the testing tools we’ve developed.</span></p><p><span>Fully autonomous systems need to handle the entire driving task with no human in the driver’s seat, so they go through much more in-depth testing than driver assist systems. At Waymo, one method we use to evaluate the safety of our Driver is scenario-based testing — a combination of virtual, test-track, and real-world driving. We used it, among many other methods, to help assess safety readiness before removing a human from the driver’s seat in Chandler, Downtown Phoenix, and San Francisco and have been using it ever since to evaluate new software releases for our rider-only fleets.</span> — which we <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2022/09/benchmarking-av-safety.html">introduced</a> earlier this year. All human drivers take their gaze or attention off the roadway from time to time. So the NIEON model represents a level of performance that doesn’t exist in the human population and provides a high benchmark against which to compare the Waymo Driver.</p><p><span>*NIEON is defined by (1) gaze being directed through the windshield toward the forward path during the conflict and (2) a lack of sleepiness and intoxication-related impairment.</span>
