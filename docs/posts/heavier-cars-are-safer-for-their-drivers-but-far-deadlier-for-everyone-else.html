        <h3>Institutional access</h3>

        <p>
            Access to content on Oxford Academic is often provided through institutional subscriptions and purchases. If you are a member of an institution with an active account, you may be able to access content in one of the following ways:
        </p>

        <h4>IP based access</h4>

        <p>
            Typically, access is provided across an institutional network to a range of IP addresses. This authentication occurs automatically, and it is not possible to sign out of an IP authenticated account.
        </p>

        <h4>Sign in through your institution</h4>

        <p>
            Choose this option to get remote access when outside your institution. Shibboleth / Open Athens technology is used to provide single sign-on between your institution’s website and Oxford Academic.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click Sign in through your institution.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>
