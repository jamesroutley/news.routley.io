<!-- --><p>üîä Just a fair warning - there are some perhaps annoying glitch sounds in the attached recording. The volumes are normalized to limit loud spikes, as they were <!-- --><em>a lot worse<!-- --></em> in person. üòÖ<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>so, my phone service has a rather clever anti-spam tactic, which works like this:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><ul>
<!-- --><li>I receive a phone call from an unknown number, and it goes through screening when I answer it. It rings until the fifth ring, the voicemail greeting plays out, then I&#39;ve got 30 seconds to judge if it&#39;s a spam robocall or if it&#39;s genuine<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>If it&#39;s okay, I press 1, and it interrupts the ring/voicemail sequence and I answer the call like usual.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>If it&#39;s spam, I press ### (the # key by itself normally opens my PBX menu, so it doesn&#39;t go through) and hang up immediately.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ul>
<!-- --><p>Pressing ### and hanging up, will shove the call to voicemail, then launch a &#34;DTMF bomb&#34;, which is a rapid sequence of over a hundred tones of DTMF keysmash, even including some of the <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling##,_*,_A,_B,_C,_and_D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&#34;ABCD&#34; keys.<!-- --></a> This <!-- --><em>has<!-- --></em> blown up spammers&#39; cheapass PBXes, especially ones with poor security and too much trust given to the DTMF decoder on the call server.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So, when IKEA called from a random 1-877 number to confirm my furniture shipment worth $1200 (that&#39;s the equivalent of <!-- --><img src="https://cohost.org/static/9a6014af31fb1ca65a1f.png" alt=":sixty:" title=":sixty:"/> bl√•haj!), the only thing it said is &#34;To continue in English, please press 1.&#34;... <!-- --><em>and I had no idea who it was,<!-- --></em> immediately thought it was spam, and did the ### gesture. <!-- --><em>Oops.<!-- --></em></p>
<!-- --><p>What follows is a transcript of the call in the recording above.<!-- --></p><hr/>

<!-- --><p>... I should&#39;ve just bought <!-- --><img src="https://cohost.org/static/9a6014af31fb1ca65a1f.png" alt=":sixty:" title=":sixty:"/> bl√•haj, instead.<!-- --></p>
