    <h1>Lufthansa confirmed that 18k flights had been flown empty to keep slots</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Brussels Airlines has operated 3,000 flights without passengers this winter to avoid losing take-off and landing slots.</h2>
<p>he airline’s parent company, Lufthansa Group, confirmed that 18,000 flights had been flown empty, including 3,000 Brussels Airlines services, according to a report in <a href="https://www.thebulletin.be/brussels-airlines-runs-3000-empty-flights-maintain-airport-slots"><em>The Bulletin</em></a>.</p>
<p>EU rules require that airlines operate a certain percentage of scheduled flights to keep their slots at major airports.</p>
<p>Under these “use it or lose it” regulations, prior to the pandemic carriers had to utilise at least 80pc of their scheduled take-off and landing slots.</p>
<p>This was revised to 50pc as coronavirus saw travel become increasingly difficult – but airlines are still struggling to hit this target.</p>
<p>As a result of Lufthansa Group’s latest figures, the Belgian federal government has written to the European Commission, calling for a change to the rules on maintaining slots.</p>
<p>Lufthansa Group, which owns the carriers Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines, Austrian Airlines, and Eurowings in addition to Brussels Airlines, has already axed 33,000 flights in January and February.</p>
