    <h1>Ask HN: Do you also marvel at the complexity of everyday objects?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A few weeks ago I was doing some soldering and I started using a spool of insulated 22-gauge wire.</p><p>Maybe it was the solder fumes, but I started thinking about what it <i>actually</i> took to create that spool of wire -- everything from the geologists and miners extracting ore, through all the metallurgy, industrial engineering, and plastics work. And I started to marvel at all the work and expertise it took to make something that I normally would&#39;ve just considered a semi-disposable consumable item. It made me wonder whether that spool of wire was actually a piece of technology on par in sophistication with all the software that I build every day.</p><p>It was such an odd moment, but it&#39;s has caused a lasting perspective shift. almost every day I&#39;ll look at some commonplace object I took for granted and think &#34;this is actually so complex, no single human has all the knowledge or expertise to create it&#34;.</p><p>I&#39;m curious if anybody else has had a similar experience and/or what are some simple everyday objects that give you pause when you stop to think about their complexity</p></div></div></div>
