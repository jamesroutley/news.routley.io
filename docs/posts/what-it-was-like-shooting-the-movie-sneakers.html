                    <p>I remember the day my agent called and told me he was sending me a new script. I had just landed several movies in a row, and agents believe in one thing more than luck—momentum. He wanted to keep it rolling.</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>The messenger arrived with a big envelope. I opened it. It said <em>Sneakers</em>. My heart sank. It sounded like a bad teen comedy about a hapless junior-high basketball team that is saved when they recruit a girl point guard who’s a great shot.</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>The script, written by Phil Alden Robinson, Larry Lasker, and Walter Parkes, is a wonder of the modern screenwriting world. It survives by wit and not tricks. It’s a caper movie that transcends the genre. It’s a technology movie that still isn’t outdated even though it was released 20 years ago and features cradle modems.</p>

                        
                    
                    
                     
                    <p>In the makeup trailer I got to listen to Ben Kingsley tell theater stories. For the record, Ben is the greatest storyteller alive. Hilarious and insightful. One of the advantages of being me on a movie set is that I never need makeup. It doesn&#39;t help. Ben, however, had to wear a wig. That translated into hours in makeup and hair. The makeup trailer became his stage. Even when no one needed powdering we gathered for Ben to thrill us with more tales of his early days as an actor and his various onstage disasters working in regional theaters in England.</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>During part of the big action finale, Robert Redford is chased through a secret lab by all of us bad guys. Phil was choreographing the chase and trying to put us in some kind of order of how fast we were running. He said, &#34;Let&#39;s do it this way. Ben, you’re the Academy Award winner, we’ll start with you. Then, Tim, the Emmy winner, you’ll be next. Do we have a Tony winner? Anyway, Stephen, you&#39;ll be last.&#34;</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>Here is a Hollywood Zen story. We shot on location around Los Angeles and at Universal. The studio has a going concern of little buses that regularly drive through the back lot area with tourists from all over the world wielding disposable cameras. The tour guide has a set patter, &#34;On your right is the shark from <em>Jaws</em>. On your left is Columbo&#39;s automobile.&#34; While one of the buses was nearing our stage, we were called to the set. The tour bus had to stop while Robert Redford and James Earl Jones crossed in front of it. No one noticed. The guide just kept up with, &#34;On our right is the bicycle from <em>E.T.</em>&#34; People were snapping away at the bicycle and were completely oblivious that two of the most famous actors in the world were a few feet away from them.</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>At the end of the shoot, Phil said the only thing that could make the whole experience of working on <em>Sneakers </em>better was if the lab lost the film. Then we would be able to do it all over again.</p>

                    
                     
                    <p>Years later I ran into Phil at the symphony. I asked him I how he was able to come up with such a great script. He blushed and said he had worked on it for nine years. I know spending a long time writing something doesn’t guarantee success. But not giving up on a good idea almost always does.<br/>
