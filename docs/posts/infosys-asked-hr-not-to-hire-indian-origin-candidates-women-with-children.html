Prejean filed the suit against Infosys, former senior VP and head of consulting Mark Livingston, and former partners Dan Albright and Jerry Kurtz. </p><p>Alleging unjust termination, the former Infosys V-P in her suit said that company partners Kurtz and Albright “turned hostile” towards her when she objected to comply with illegal demands for hiring senior executives for the company. </p><p>The plaintiff was hired to recruit “hard-to-find executives” to work as partners or VPs in the consulting division of the firm. She was 59 when she was hired for the job in 2018. </p><p>According to her complaint, “she was shocked to find a rampant culture of illegal discriminatory animus among the partner level executives based on age, gender and caregiver status.” </p><p>The complaint further mentions that Prejean “tried to change this culture within the first two months of her employment” but was met with “resistance from Infosys partners - Jerry Kurtz and Dan Albright - who became hostile in the face of her objections and tried to circumvent her authority to evade compliance with the law”, according to the ET report. </p><p>The complaint further mentions that the biases violated New York City Human Rights Laws and cost Prejean her job. </p><p>The court also asked the defendants to submit their replies to the accusations within 21 days from the date of order on September 30, reported Economic Times. </p><p>Infosys and the accused executives had filed for a dismissal of the suit on grounds that the complainant did not highlight specific comments as proof. </p></div></div>
