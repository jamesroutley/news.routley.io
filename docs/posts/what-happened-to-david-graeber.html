Since I read his little book <em>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology </em>in 2004, I’ve been telling anyone who seemed inclined to listen that he was the most important anarchist thinker since Peter Kropotkin, who died in 1921. His ideas, including those beautifully captured in his book <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em> (2011), helped motivate and shape the Occupy movement, which took inspiration from his commitments to radical democracy, egalitarianism, and “prefigurative politics”—the idea that people seeking to make a revolution should try to live and organize now in a way they’d want to arrange their lives together in the future.</p></div><div><p>LARB Contributor</p><p><strong>Crispin Sartwell teaches philosophy at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
