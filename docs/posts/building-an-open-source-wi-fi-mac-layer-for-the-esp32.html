    <h1>Building an open-source Wi-Fi Mac layer for the ESP32</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section><div><p>The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with Wi-Fi connectivity.
Currently, the Wi-Fi MAC layer of the ESP32 is closed-source.
This project aims to change that: by reverse engineering the hardware registers and software, we can build a networking stack that is open-source up to the hardware, instead of having to use the proprietary MAC layer.</p><p>This will improve security auditability, open up the possibility for features not supported in the proprietary implementation (for example, standards-compliant mesh networking), improve interoperability and make research into Wi-Fi networks with lots of nodes more affordable.</p><p>The source code is under <a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/">the esp32-open-mac organisation on GitHub</a>.
There are currently two implementations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/esp32-open-mac">esp32-open-mac</a> (we know it&#39;s confusing that one reference implementation has the same name as the overarching project, but bear with us)
This is a reference implementation that demonstrates how the hardware works, written in C and Rust: the hardware abstraction and initialization is written in C; the MAC stack (parsing packets and deciding which packets to send when) is written in Rust.
This relies on two FreeRTOS tasks; one to handle the hardware, one to handle the MAC stack.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/FoA">Ferris-on-Air (FoA)</a>: this is a reference implementation in pure async Rust. It builds on Embassy and the patches in the esp-hal we submitted to add support for the Wi-Fi peripheral.</li></ul><p>If you want to help out with developing or want to contact us, feel free to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#esp32-open-mac:matrix.org">the Matrix room</a></p></div></section><section></section><section><ul><li><span>March 7, 2025</span>
