    <h1>I&#39;m puzzled how anyone trusts ChatGPT for code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I asked ChatGPT to convert a simple 12-line Python program to Lisp.</p><p>The result is broken by mismatched brackets. Yes. In Lisp.</p><p>I ask for correction and receive the errant bracket moved, still mismatched.</p><p>I ask again and the bracket gets removed. Fine??</p><p>No. A loop break has been mistranslated to a return from function, so execution is nonsense.</p><p>I wonder how much user faith in ChatGPT is based on examples in which the errors are not apparent ... to a certain kind of user.</p></div></div></div>
