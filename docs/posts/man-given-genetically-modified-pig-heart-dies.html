Currently 17 people die every day in the US waiting for a transplant, with more than 100,000 reportedly on the waiting list.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The possibility of using animal organs for so-called xenotransplantation to meet the demand has long been considered, and <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heart-valve-replacement-which-type-is-best-for-you/">using pig heart valves is already common</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In October 2021, surgeons in New York announced that they had successfully transplanted a pig&#39;s kidney into a person. At the time, the operation was the most advanced experiment in the field so far. However, the recipient on that occasion was brain dead with no hope of recovery.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The first pig-heart transplant was a landmark moment in medicine. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The biggest barrier to using organs from another species is &#34;hyperacute rejection&#34;. The body sees the tissue as so foreign that it starts to kill the donated organ within minutes. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The hope was the 10 genetic modifications made to the pig meant its organs would be acceptable to the human body. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was a nervous moment when the heart went in, but there was no hyperacute rejection and that monumental barrier had been cleared. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When I spoke to the surgical team one month after the operation they said there were still no signs of rejection and the donated heart was performing like a &#34;Ferrari engine&#34;. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00146c3">But they warned Mr Bennett himself was still frail</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Exactly what has happened since and the precise cause of Mr Bennett&#39;s death is not clear.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The results of those investigations will determine how close we are to a future of using pigs to solve the global shortage of transplant organs. </p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
