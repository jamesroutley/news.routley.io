As a few on this list may recall, it is 25 years ago today that the
&#34;IBM secure mailer&#34; had its public beta release. This was accompanied
by a nice article in the New York Times business section.

There is some literature at <a href="https://www.postfix.org/press.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.postfix.org/press.html</a> that
attests how this project accelerated open-source adoption by a very
large company.

At the time there were several efforts by people inside IBM to do
open-source projects, but it was the NY Times article that brought
open source on the radar of the CEO. He then tasked people to come
up with an open-source strategy for IBM.

As for the name Postfix, my colleagues and I had come up with
multiple names that were rejected each time (I still have some
Internet domains names from that time). We decided that this was
not going to work, released it as &#34;IBM secure mailer&#34;, and then,
after IBM was no longer in control, changed the name to Postfix.

That was a long time ago. Postfix has evolved as the Internet has
changed. I am continuing the overhaul of this software, motivated
by people like you on this mailing list.
