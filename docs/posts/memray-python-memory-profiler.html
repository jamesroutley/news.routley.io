                        Memray tracks and reports memory allocations, both in Python code and in compiled
                        extension modules.

                    <p>
                        Memray knows the stack trace of every single allocation that happens in your code, no
                        matter how small it is. This lets you to see exactly where your memory is being
                        allocated and gives you insights on how to optimize your code.

                    <h2>More than just a profiler</h2>
                    <p>
                        Memray does much more than just telling you where your application is spending
                        memory and which memory is being leaked. For instance, it can help you find wasteful
                        temporary allocations that you can avoid to speed up your program.

                    <p>
                        You can easily integrate Memray into your pytest test suite. Learn where each test is
                        spending its memory with per-test allocation summaries with useful statistics, or set
                        limits on how much memory each test is allowed to use to prevent memory regressions!

                    <h2>Native allocation tracking. <span>No more leaks

                    <p>
                        Memray sees allocations made by C/C++/Rust libraries.
                        This means that when you use Memray to profile your
                        Python code, you&#39;ll be able to see the entire call
                        stack, including any calls to C/C++/Rust functions. This can
                        be incredibly useful for tracking down memory issues, as
                        it allows you to see exactly where and how memory is
                        being allocated. Whether you&#39;re working
                        on a complex project with many layers of code, or simply
                        trying to optimize your Python scripts for better
                        performance, Memray is an invaluable tool that can help
                        you understand and improve your code&#39;s memory usage.

                    <p>
                        One of the standout features of Memray is its ability to
                        provide a live, real-time view of memory allocation.
                        With the live mode, you can see exactly how memory is
                        being used as your Python code is executing. This can be
                        particularly useful for debugging and optimizing your
                        code, as you can see in real-time how different parts of
                        your code are impacting memory usage.

                    <h2>One log, many analyses. <span>
                            There&#39;s a reporter for everyone!</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the great things about Memray is its flexibility
                        and customizability. After running a memory profiling
                        session, you can use a wide range of reporters to view
                        the data in different ways. For example, you can use the
                        flamegraph reporter to see a visual representation of
                        the call stack and how memory is being used at each
                        level. Or, you can use the statistical reporter to see
                        summary statistics and trends in your memory usage.
                        And these are just a few of the many reporters available
                        in Memray - there are many more to choose from, allowing
                        you to view your data in the way that makes the most
                        sense for your specific needs.
