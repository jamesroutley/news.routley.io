<li>crap, late as anything again.</li>
<li>my housemates/chosen fam are/were away for this week and until august so mostly luxuriating in the quiet in the house, and marvelling at my brain&#39;s ability to not ruminate even when there&#39;s ample time for it. apparently, my brain only ruminates when it wants to!</li>
<li>speaking of rumination, i am really shook that i can work for so long on a project and then get full of doubt (and maybe fear?) about what i&#39;m doing to the point i need to stop working on it for at least a while. The &#34;who isn&#39;t online&#34; stuff maybe will get uploaded as a note for now but I feel like it&#39;s become a fact dumping ground, which is not very entertaining or interesting to me, so it&#39;s being parked.</li>
<li>i still need to work out how you have milestones and goals around open-ended projects, aka ones i&#39;m unsure how long they will take and/or what form/shape/length the output will have. I know you can make input goals - i will work X hours on Y until Z - but is that all the control you can have?</li>
<li>since <a href="https://ynab.com">YNAB</a> are once again increasing their prices i looked into <a href="https://actualbudget.org/">Actual Budget</a> but i think it&#39;s too much work for me, which I should have known from the jump. i am not blogging from a platform i self-rolled, know thyself. it looks good if you&#39;re happy with the workflow and want to save $109 a year though, i will admit.</li>
<li>pretty head empty week in all honesty. been going to therapy. been trying to <a href="https://amysnellingpersonaltraining.squarespace.com/">exercise/move more</a> and <a href="https://www.aadamrichardson.com/">stretch</a> with mixed success but i have enjoyed what i have done! been trying to cook more with grudging success. i feel very grateful for my life and excited to see what&#39;s coming up.</li>
