<p>Code updates to a government database that helps track whether a federal program to get children ready for school at age five is actually working show software engineers are purging it of references to &#34;forbidden words&#34; related to DEI.</p><p>The updates, shown in Github commits, are to a database for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Head Start program. They show a project called “<a href="https://github.com/HHS/Head-Start-TTADP/commit/d33953e0fc267970203a0ef41bb2e81398ca6ab0?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Remove-DEI</a>,” which reveal some of the back-and-forth that is happening behind the scenes to align federal agencies with Donald Trump’s executive orders that forbid almost anything having to do with race or gender within federal agencies. The Github pages show software engineers discussing amongst themselves how to best remove all instances of “forbidden words” from a specific database, and the code updates they used to do it. The changes also show that, while thousands of government datasets are disappearing from the internet, even ones that remain are having parts of their utility deprecated or broken in a way that may not be visible to those outside the government.</p><p>The <a href="https://headstart.gov/about-us/article/about-office-head-start?ref=404media.co"><u>Office of Head Start</u></a> is a government agency that spends roughly $12 billion per year to get families and children between birth and age five ready to succeed in schools, with a special focus on providing and administering grants to groups that provide assistance for “America’s most vulnerable young children.” Head Start centers <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/28/nation/trump-administration-federal-loan-freezes-head-start/?ref=404media.co"><u>were briefly impacted by Trump’s spending freeze</u></a>, leading centers to worry about making payroll. </p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Are you a federal worker or contractor?

A description of the change explained on Github reads “Review the option for equity: Removal of the equity topic from the topic drop down, removal of the equity topic from all filters, Removal of the DEIA standard goal, ‘Families affected by systemic discrimination/bias/exclusion’ removes as a target population.” </p><p>The coder also explains that they tweaked how topics are filtered in the database as a way of “making sure that when we mark a topic as deleted, it is removed from all the relevant places.” </p><p>The coder asked their colleagues to “confirm equity has been removed from the places above. I ask also that you scan the website for other places where we need to remove the forbidden words.” The code was written by employees at a company called Ad Hoc LLC, a government contractor that works with HHS on the database. Ad Hoc is being <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75ACF124F80009_7590_GS35F392DA_4732?ref=404media.co"><u>paid $7.2 million to manage the database</u></a>, according to federal records.</p><p>Ad Hoc was created in the aftermath of the HealthCare.gov launch debacle, and describes itself as “a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people.” Ad Hoc declined to comment. </p><p>HHS told 404 Media that it is not allowed to comment: &#34;HHS has issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health. This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization. There are exceptions for announcements that HHS divisions believe are mission critical, but they will be made on a case-by-case basis.”</p><figure><a href="https://www.404media.co/archivists-work-to-identify-and-save-the-thousands-of-datasets-disappearing-from-data-gov/"><div><p>Archivists Work to Identify and Save the Thousands of Datasets Disappearing From Data.gov</p><p>More than 2,000 datasets have disappeared from data.gov since Trump was inaugurated.
