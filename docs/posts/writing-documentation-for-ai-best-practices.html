    <h1>Writing documentation for AI: best practices</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Kapa rely on your
documentation to provide accurate, helpful information. When documentation
serves both humans and machines well, it creates a self-reinforcing loop of
content quality: clear documentation improves AI answers, and those answers
help surface gaps that further improve the docs.</p>
<p>This guide provides best practices for creating documentation that works
effectively for both human readers and AI/LLM consumption in RAG systems. Many
best practices benefit both simultaneously, often in complementary ways.</p>
<h2 id="why-documentation-quality-matters">Why documentation quality matters<a href="#why-documentation-quality-matters" aria-label="Direct link to Why documentation quality matters" title="Direct link to Why documentation quality matters">​</a></h2>
<p>Documentation quality has always been important for helping users understand
and use your product effectively. And it becomes even more important when AI
systems use that same content to answer user questions. Poor documentation
doesn&#39;t just frustrate human readers, it directly degrades the quality of AI
responses, creating a compounding problem where bad content leads to bad
answers.</p>
<p>Understanding how AI systems process and use your documentation reveals why
content quality is non-negotiable for good AI performance.</p>
<h3 id="how-ai-systems-process-your-documentation">How AI systems process your documentation<a href="#how-ai-systems-process-your-documentation" aria-label="Direct link to How AI systems process your documentation" title="Direct link to How AI systems process your documentation">​</a></h3>
<p>Kapa works by finding relevant pieces of your content and using them to
construct answers. The process involves three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retriever</strong>: Searches through your knowledge sources to find content that
matches the user&#39;s question</li>
<li><strong>Vector database</strong>: Stores your content in a searchable format that enables
fast and accurate retrieval</li>
<li><strong>Generator</strong>: A Large Language Model (LLM) that uses the retrieved content
to create helpful responses</li>
</ul>
<p>Information flows through a specific process once you connect knowledge sources
to Kapa:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ingestion</strong>: Content is divided into chunks (smaller, focused sections)
and stored in the vector database</li>
<li><strong>Query processing</strong>: When users ask questions, the system converts their
question into a searchable format</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: The system finds the most relevant chunks from your
documentation</li>
<li><strong>Answer generation</strong>: The LLM uses these chunks as context to generate a
response</li>
</ol>
<p>In the steps that an AI takes to consume your content, there are some writing
and structural patterns worth highlighting that can negatively impact how well
your content is understood:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI systems work with chunks</strong>: They process documentation as discrete,
independent pieces rather than reading it as a continuous narrative</li>
<li><strong>They rely on content matching</strong>: They find information by comparing user
questions with your content, not by following logical document structure</li>
<li><strong>They lose implicit connections</strong>: Relationships between sections may not be
preserved unless explicitly stated</li>
<li><strong>They cannot infer unstated information</strong>: Unlike humans who can make
reasonable assumptions, AI systems can only work with explicitly documented
information</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation optimized for AI systems should ideally be explicit,
self-contained, and contextually complete. The more a chunk can stand alone
while maintaining clear relationships to related content, the better it can be
understood by the AI. The more explicit and less ambiguous the information is,
the better the retrieval accuracy is and the better equipped the AI becomes at
answering questions confidently.</p>
<p>While AI does work remarkably well with unstructured content, it&#39;s also true
that information written and structured for with retrieval in mind can greatly
improve the quality of an &#34;Ask AI&#34; interface to your knowledge sources.</p>
<h3 id="why-chunking-is-necessary">Why chunking is necessary<a href="#why-chunking-is-necessary" aria-label="Direct link to Why chunking is necessary" title="Direct link to Why chunking is necessary">​</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, chunking would not be necessary, and the AI could continuously keep
your entire knowledge base in context, all the time. Unfortunately, this is
impractical. Not only due to token limits but also because LLMs perform
significantly better when provided with optimized, focused contexts. A large or
overly broad context increases the likelihood that the model overlooks or
misinterprets critical information, resulting in reduced accuracy and less
coherent outputs.</p>
<p>Dividing documents into smaller, semantically coherent chunks enables retrieval
systems to present the most relevant content to the LLM. This targeted approach
significantly improves model comprehension, retrieval precision, and overall
response quality.</p>

<p>Optimizing content for AI is similar in principle to optimizing content for
accessibility and screen readers: the clearer, more structured, and more
machine-readable your content is, the better it performs. Just as clear
semantic structure helps accessibility tools parse content effectively, a clear
structure significantly improves AI accuracy. This section outlines some
actionable, practical improvements you can apply today to make your docs more
machine-readable.</p>
<p>Prioritizing these adjustments sets a strong foundation for addressing more
nuanced content challenges, as discussed in the section <a href="#content-design-challenges-for-ai">Content design
challenges for AI</a>.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-standardized-semantic-html">1. Use standardized semantic HTML<a href="#1-use-standardized-semantic-html" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Use standardized semantic HTML" title="Direct link to 1. Use standardized semantic HTML">​</a></h3>
<p>For website sources, ensure correct and semantic use of HTML elements like
headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>), lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>), and tables (<code>&lt;table&gt;</code>).
Semantic HTML ensures clear document structure, improving how accurately
content is chunked and retrieved.</p>
<div><p>Example</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>How to enable webhooks</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>ol</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Log in to your CloudSync dashboard.</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Navigate to Settings </span><span>&amp;gt;</span><span> Webhooks.</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Toggle webhooks to &#34;Enabled&#34;.</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ol</span><span>&gt;</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>More importantly, <strong>avoid incorrect use</strong> of elements. An incorrectly placed
<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element, for example, can have dire consequences for how a machine
parses your content.</p>
<h3 id="2-avoid-pdfs-prefer-html-or-markdown">2. Avoid PDFs, prefer HTML or Markdown<a href="#2-avoid-pdfs-prefer-html-or-markdown" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Avoid PDFs, prefer HTML or Markdown" title="Direct link to 2. Avoid PDFs, prefer HTML or Markdown">​</a></h3>
<p>PDF documents often have complex visual layouts that make machine parsing
difficult. Migrating content from PDFs to HTML or Markdown drastically improves
text extraction and retrieval quality.</p>
<h3 id="3-create-crawler-friendly-content">3. Create crawler-friendly content<a href="#3-create-crawler-friendly-content" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Create crawler-friendly content" title="Direct link to 3. Create crawler-friendly content">​</a></h3>
<p>Simplify page structures by reducing or eliminating custom UI elements,
JavaScript-driven dynamic content, and complex animations. Clear, predictable
HTML structure facilitates easier indexing and parsing.</p>
<p>Replace complex JavaScript widgets with plain-text alternatives or simple
interactive elements.</p>
<h3 id="4-ensure-semantic-clarity">4. Ensure semantic clarity<a href="#4-ensure-semantic-clarity" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Ensure semantic clarity" title="Direct link to 4. Ensure semantic clarity">​</a></h3>
<p>Use descriptive headings and meaningful URLs reflecting the content hierarchy.
Semantic clarity helps the AI correctly infer content relationships, greatly
enhancing retrieval accuracy.</p>
<div><p>Example of a meaningful URL</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>✅ Good: /docs/cloudsync/setup-webhooks</span><br/></span><span><span>❌ Poor: /docs/page12345</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Always include clear text descriptions for critical visual information such as
diagrams, charts, and screenshots. This ensures crucial details remain
accessible to machines and screen readers alike.</p>
<div><p>Example</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>System architecture diagram</span><span>](</span><span>architecture.png</span><span>)</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>**</span><span>Figure 1:</span><span>**</span><span> Diagram illustrating the CloudSync integration workflow,</span><br/></span><span><span>detailing authentication, data upload, and confirmation steps.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="6-keep-layouts-simple">6. Keep layouts simple<a href="#6-keep-layouts-simple" aria-label="Direct link to 6. Keep layouts simple" title="Direct link to 6. Keep layouts simple">​</a></h3>
<p>Avoid layouts where meaning is derived heavily from visual positioning or
formatting. Layout is lost during conversion, and any meaning it was designed
to convey with it. Content structured simply with clear headings, lists, and
paragraphs translates effectively into plain text.</p>
<h2 id="content-design-challenges-for-ai">Content design challenges for AI<a href="#content-design-challenges-for-ai" aria-label="Direct link to Content design challenges for AI" title="Direct link to Content design challenges for AI">​</a></h2>
<p>This section takes a closer look at common content design anti-patterns that
can create challenges for AI systems. These challenges often arise from how
information is organized, contextualized, or assumed rather than how it&#39;s
formatted. Each example highlights a specific problem pattern, why it causes
issues for AI, and how to rewrite or restructure your content to avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-dependencies">Contextual dependencies<a href="#contextual-dependencies" aria-label="Direct link to Contextual dependencies" title="Direct link to Contextual dependencies">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Documentation that scatters key details and definitions across
multiple sections or paragraphs creates problems when content is divided into
chunks. When critical information is separated from its context, individual
chunks can become ambiguous or incomplete.</p>
<p>Understanding how chunking works in practice reveals why proximity matters.
Kapa attempts to preserve document structure by keeping sections intact when
possible, but practical constraints often force splits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections that are too long get divided at paragraph or sentence boundaries</li>
<li>Sections that are too short get combined with neighboring content</li>
<li>Chunk sizes must be balanced for optimal retrieval performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Since chunk boundaries can&#39;t be perfectly predicted, the closer related
information appears in your source content, the more likely it stays together
after chunking. This proximity principle becomes critical for maintaining
meaning.</p>
<p>Consider this (simplified) problematic example:</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Authentication tokens expire after 24 hours by default.</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>The system provides several configuration options for different environments.</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>When implementing the login flow, ensure you handle this appropriately.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>When this content gets chunked, the middle sentence about configuration options
might cause the chunking algorithm to separate the token expiration detail from
the implementation guidance. The resulting chunk containing &#34;When implementing
the login flow, ensure you handle this appropriately&#34; loses crucial context
about what &#34;this&#34; refers to and the specific 24-hour timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>The remedy:</strong> Keep related information together within close proximity. When
introducing a concept that has important constraints or context, include those
details in the same paragraph or immediately adjacent paragraphs.</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Authentication tokens expire after 24 hours by default. When implementing the</span><br/></span><span><span>login flow, ensure you handle token expiration by refreshing tokens before the</span><br/></span><span><span>24-hour limit or implementing proper error handling for expired token</span><br/></span><span><span>responses.</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>The system provides several configuration options for different environments,</span><br/></span><span><span>including custom token expiration periods.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>By keeping the constraint (24-hour expiration) close to its implementation
guidance, they&#39;re much more likely to remain in the same chunk, regardless of
where the boundaries fall.</p>
<p>Look for sections that become unclear when read in isolation, especially where
section headings are generic and multi-step processes that reference context
from earlier paragraphs.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-discoverability-gaps">Semantic discoverability gaps<a href="#semantic-discoverability-gaps" aria-label="Direct link to Semantic discoverability gaps" title="Direct link to Semantic discoverability gaps">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Kapa finds information based on semantic similarity between
queries and content. If important terms or concepts aren&#39;t present in a chunk,
that chunk won&#39;t be retrieved for relevant queries, even if it contains exactly
the information needed.</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Configure timeouts</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Configure custom timeout settings and retry logic for improved reliability in</span><br/></span><span><span>production environments. Access these options through the admin panel.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>If a user asks &#34;How do I configure <strong>CloudSync</strong> timeouts?&#34;, this chunk might
not be retrieved because &#34;CloudSync&#34; doesn&#39;t appear in the text.</p>
<p><strong>The remedy:</strong> Establish consistent terminology for your product&#39;s unique
concepts and use them systematically. Include specific product or feature names
when documenting functionality.</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Configure CloudSync timeouts</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Configure custom CloudSync timeout settings and retry logic for improved</span><br/></span><span><span>reliability in production environments. Access these options through the</span><br/></span><span><span>CloudSync admin panel.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Your product&#39;s unique terminology won&#39;t be well-represented in the model&#39;s
training data. Explicit, consistent usage helps establish what content relates
to which product features.</p>
<p><strong>A note of balance:</strong> This doesn&#39;t mean you should repeat the product name in
every sentence or heading. Kapa also uses document structure, URLs, and parent
headings to infer context. The important thing is that for any given chunk,
there’s a clear and consistent signal that connects it to your product or
feature. See <a href="#hierarchical-information-architecture">Hierarchical information architecture</a>
for how structural metadata supports this.</p>
<h3 id="implicit-knowledge-assumptions">Implicit knowledge assumptions<a href="#implicit-knowledge-assumptions" aria-label="Direct link to Implicit knowledge assumptions" title="Direct link to Implicit knowledge assumptions">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Kapa operates on a simple principle: if information isn&#39;t
explicitly documented, it doesn&#39;t exist in the system&#39;s knowledge base. Unlike
human readers who can draw on external knowledge or make reasonable inferences,
Kapa only works with the information provided.</p>
<p>When documentation assumes user knowledge, these become dangerous gaps.
Well-designed RAG systems should choose uncertainty over inaccuracy, but this
only works when documentation explicitly addresses the topics users ask about.</p>
<p><strong>The remedy:</strong> Include prerequisite steps within procedural content rather
than assuming prior setup. When referencing external tools or concepts, provide
brief context or links to detailed explanations.</p>
<div><p>Before</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Setting up webhooks</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Configure your endpoint URL in the dashboard and test the connection.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<div><p>After</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Setting up CloudSync webhooks</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Before configuring webhooks, ensure you have:</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> Valid SSL certificate</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> CloudSync API credentials</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Configure your endpoint URL in the CloudSync dashboard under Settings &gt;</span><br/></span><span><span>Integrations, then use the &#34;Test connection&#34; button to verify setup.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Look for instructions that assume familiarity with tools or interfaces, or
reference &#34;standard&#34; configurations without explanation.</p>
<h3 id="visual-information-dependencies">Visual information dependencies<a href="#visual-information-dependencies" aria-label="Direct link to Visual information dependencies" title="Direct link to Visual information dependencies">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Critical information embedded in images, diagrams, and videos
create problems for the ingestion processes that parse your documentation. When
key information appears only in visual elements, users may receive incomplete
answers.</p>
<div><p>Example: Information that completely depends on a graphical element</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>See the diagram below for the complete API workflow:</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>Complex flowchart showing 8-step process</span><span>](</span><span>workflow.png</span><span>)</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Follow these steps to implement the integration.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Instructions that depend on visual elements become inaccessible to automated
systems, making the instruction meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>The remedy:</strong> Provide text-based alternatives that capture the essential
information. Represent workflow diagrams as numbered step lists while keeping
visual elements as supplements.</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> CloudSync API workflow</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>The CloudSync integration follows this workflow:</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Authentication</span><span>**</span><span>: Send API credentials to </span><span>`/auth/token`</span><span> endpoint</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Validation</span><span>**</span><span>: System validates credentials and returns access token</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Data preparation</span><span>**</span><span>: Format your data according to CloudSync schema</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Upload request</span><span>**</span><span>: POST data to </span><span>`/sync/upload`</span><span> with access token</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Processing</span><span>**</span><span>: CloudSync validates and processes the data</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Status check</span><span>**</span><span>: Poll </span><span>`/sync/status/{job_id}`</span><span> for processing updates</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Completion</span><span>**</span><span>: Receive confirmation when sync completes</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>**</span><span>Error handling</span><span>**</span><span>: Handle any validation or processing errors</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>API workflow diagram</span><span>](</span><span>workflow.png</span><span>)</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>_</span><span>Visual representation of the workflow steps above</span><span>_</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="layout-dependent-information">Layout-dependent information<a href="#layout-dependent-information" aria-label="Direct link to Layout-dependent information" title="Direct link to Layout-dependent information">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Information that depends on visual layout, positioning, or
table structure often loses meaning when processed as text by machines. While
humans can interpret visual relationships and grouped content, AI systems
struggle to maintain these connections.</p>
<p>Complex or poorly structured comparison tables with merged headers and visual
groupings become ambiguous when converted to plain text:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Pricing</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Basic Plan</strong></td><td><strong>Standard Plan</strong></td><td><strong>Enterprise Plan</strong></td></tr><tr><td>5 users</td><td>25 users</td><td>Unlimited users</td></tr><tr><td>1GB storage</td><td>10GB storage</td><td>Unlimited storage</td></tr><tr><td>Email support</td><td>Phone support</td><td>24/7 dedicated support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>API Limits</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>100 requests/hour</td><td>1,000 requests/hour</td><td>No rate limit</td></tr><tr><td>Basic endpoints only</td><td>All endpoints</td><td>All endpoints + webhooks</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><strong>The remedy:</strong> If a tabular representation is preferable, ensure that the
headers and rows are semantically correct. However, tabular representation is
not always appropriate or necessary. You may also consider alternatives that
preserve relationships in text form. Use structured lists or repeated context
that maintains the connections. For example:</p>
<div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> CloudSync pricing plans</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>###</span><span> Basic Plan</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> 5 users</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> 1GB storage</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> Email support</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> API limits: 100 requests/hour, basic endpoints only</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>###</span><span> Standard Plan</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> 25 users</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> 10GB storage</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> Phone support</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> API limits: 1,000 requests/hour, all endpoints</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>###</span><span> Enterprise Plan</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> Unlimited users</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> Unlimited storage</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> 24/7 dedicated support</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>-</span><span> API limits: No rate limit, all endpoints plus webhooks</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Keep simple reference tables where each row is self-contained, but supplement
or replace complex tables where relationships between cells convey important
meaning.</p>
<h2 id="content-organization">Content organization<a href="#content-organization" aria-label="Direct link to Content organization" title="Direct link to Content organization">​</a></h2>
<p>The following techniques help create content that can be effectively retrieved,
without sacrificing readability.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchical-information-architecture">Hierarchical information architecture<a href="#hierarchical-information-architecture" aria-label="Direct link to Hierarchical information architecture" title="Direct link to Hierarchical information architecture">​</a></h3>
<p>When your content gets ingested into Kapa, preprocessing steps extract metadata
that helps preserve context and boost retrieval accuracy. One of the most
valuable pieces of data extracted is the hierarchical position of each document
or section.</p>
<p>This hierarchy includes multiple layers of context: URL paths, document titles,
and headings. These elements work together to build contextual understanding
for content chunks after they&#39;re separated from their original location.</p>
<p>Design your content hierarchy so that each section carries sufficient context
to be understood independently, while maintaining clear relationships to parent
and sibling content.</p>
<p>When planning content structure, consider how users would find any given
section without search. Ensure each section includes enough context to be
understood independently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product family</strong>: Which product or service area</li>
<li><strong>Product name</strong>: Specific product or feature name</li>
<li><strong>Version information</strong>: When applicable</li>
<li><strong>Component specificity</strong>: Subfeatures or modules</li>
<li><strong>Functional context</strong>: What the user is trying to accomplish</li>
</ul>
<p>This hierarchical clarity helps AI systems understand relationships between
concepts and provides richer context when retrieving information for user
queries.</p>
<h3 id="self-contained-sections">Self-contained sections<a href="#self-contained-sections" aria-label="Direct link to Self-contained sections" title="Direct link to Self-contained sections">​</a></h3>
<p>Documentation sections that depend on readers following a linear path or
remembering details from previous sections become problematic when processed as
independent chunks. Sections are retrieved based on relevance and document
order is not preserved, so sections should ideally make sense when encountered
in isolation.</p>
<p>Compare these two approaches to the same information:</p>
<div><p>Context-dependent</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Updating webhook URLs</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>Now change the endpoint to your new URL and save the configuration.</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<div><p>Self-contained</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>##</span><span> Updating webhook URLs</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>To update webhook endpoints in CloudSync:</span><br/></span><span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>1.</span><span> Navigate to Settings &gt; Webhooks in your CloudSync dashboard</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>2.</span><span> Select the webhook you want to modify</span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>3.</span><span> Change the endpoint URL to your new address, and click Save</span><br/></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The self-contained version works when retrieved as an isolated chunk because it
includes the essential context: what system (CloudSync), where to find the
setting (Settings &gt; Webhooks), and complete steps. The context-dependent
version assumes the reader knows what &#34;endpoint&#34; refers to and where they are
in the interface.</p>
<p>Front-load essential context and include complete information within each
section boundary. This doesn&#39;t mean repeating everything everywhere, but
ensuring sections remain actionable when encountered independently.</p>
<p>Consider starting each section with brief context about its scope and
prerequisites, using descriptive headings that indicate what the section
accomplishes, and including essential background information without assuming
prior reading. Look for sections that reference &#34;as mentioned above,&#34; &#34;now that

<p>Troubleshooting documentation deserves special attention because users often
search by copying exact error messages they encounter. When your documentation
includes the specific error text alongside solutions, it creates direct matches
between user queries and helpful content.</p>
<p>When documenting troubleshooting steps, quote exact error messages and describe
observable symptoms alongside solutions.</p>

<p>Including exact error text ensures users can find help when searching with the
specific messages they&#39;re seeing. To identify which error messages to
prioritize in your documentation, review the <a href="http://jimkang.com/analytics/common-questions">Common Questions</a>
analytics in the Kapa platform. This shows you the actual error messages and
problems users are asking about most frequently.</p>

<p>Creating documentation that serves both human readers and AI effectively
centers on a fundamental principle: explicit, self-contained content that
maintains clear relationships between concepts. Eliminating contextual
dependencies, ensuring discoverability, filling knowledge gaps, and providing
text alternatives for visual content help mitigate inherent limitations in how
machines consume your docs.</p>
<p>Documentation that works for AI is, at its core, just great documentation:
clear, structured, explicit, and user-focused. The better your docs serve your
users, the better your AI serves them, too.</p>
<p>Review and analyze user conversations, particularly conversations with
uncertain or downvoted answers. Start with immediate fixes to frequently asked
questions, then gradually restructure scattered information into coherent,
complete sections. The goal is documentation where every section stands alone
while maintaining logical connections to related concepts.</p></div></div></div>
