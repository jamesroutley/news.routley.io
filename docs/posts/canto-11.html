    <h1>Canto 11</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>My plan is not working so well. I am going to binge read the cantos tonight</p>



<p>“I mean SIdg went to Tarentum / And he found ’em, the antI-Aragons,”</p>



<p>I really have no idea what is happening. </p>



<p>I also have no image. </p>



<p>I read Robert Duncan’s HD book this am – part of it – and it referenced pound and the cantos and that pound was creating poems that were ideograms.  This is really not working. </p>



<p>If anything the cantos are a rhythm – a march – a beat – as the great herbalist sam perry says some people like to waltz and some like to march.</p>



<p>I cannot tell the difference stylistically between one canto and the other </p>
