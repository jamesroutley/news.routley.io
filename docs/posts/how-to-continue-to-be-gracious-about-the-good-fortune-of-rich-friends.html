    <h1>Ask HN: How to continue to be gracious about the good fortune of rich friends?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I have no money. I do have rich friends who are getting richer and richer every year.<p>I try to be gracious and happy for their good fortune.</p><p>However it makes me depressed and angry and envious.</p><p>One friend told me a few days ago his house went up in value $1,000,000 in one year, at which point he sold it.</p><p>I visited my cousin who is a fabulous person and has a gorgeous house freshly renovated and extended and a new pool put it.</p><p>All around me my peers are becoming very wealthy.</p><p>And I’m at the bottom with nothing.</p><p>I try to be happy for them and gracious and to listen and enthuse whilst they tell me of their good fortune or show me around their stunning houses. And afterwards I feel smashed with depression as I go back to my shit rental house that I’m ashamed of.</p><p>Good people, great friends, and seeing them brings me down.</p><p>Rich people aren’t aware  that their tales of success make people like me feel bad. They shouldn’t have to be aware of that or hold themselves back. As a good friend I should feel happy for them, and I pretend to, but inside it makes me feel terrible.</p><p>If you’re commenting on this thread and offering advice, I encourage you add the context of whether you are one of those who have money or not.</p></div></div>
