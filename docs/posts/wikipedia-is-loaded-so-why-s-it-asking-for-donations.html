But the reality is very different, as freelance journalist Andreas Kolbe elucidated <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/wikipedia-endownemnt-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in the Daily Dot</a> last week.</p><p>In an eye-opening piece, Kolbe explains that the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), which owns Wikipedia, is actually richer than ever before.</p><p>Kolbe, a former co-editor-in-chief of Wikipedia‘s community newspaper, The Signpost, argues that the non-profit’s rising revenues and record-breaking annual donations are easily sufficient to keep the site operating.</p><p><em>[Read: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/this-dude-drove-an-ev-from-the-netherlands-to-new-zealand-here-are-his-3-top-road-trip-tips">This dude drove an EV from the Netherlands to New Zealand — here are his 3 top road trip tips</a>]</em></p><p>Rather than needing cash to keep Wikipedia online and independent, Kolbe suggests the WMF wants to further boost its vast savings and fund a range of new projects.</p><p>At the same time, the WMF is launching a for-profit company, which has caused concern among the site’s volunteer writers, who work unpaid while some WMF staff receive six-figure salaries.</p><p>Kolbe’s analysis portrays an organization that can comfortably keep Wikipedia online without requiring donations from users in countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic. The piece is well worth a read if you’re interested in the inner workings of Wikipedia, or merely want to ease an unnecessary sense of guilt. Find it <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/wikipedia-endownemnt-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here on the Daily Dot</a>.<span></span></p></div><h3>Also tagged with</h3></main></article></div></div>
