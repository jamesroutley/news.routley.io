    <h1>Update - New year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><section><p>Another year gone by. I had a great moment where I was talking about this years card (these get sent in the mail). They said they wanted to compare this year&#39;s to others, and happily, I was able to point them to the <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/happy-new-year">New Years Page</a>.</p><p><img alt="happy 2026" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/happy-new-year/new-year-2026.jpg"/></p><div id="2025-big-goal-s-achieved-"><h3>2025 Big Goal&#39;s achieved!</h3></div><p>I&#39;ve never been a good swimmer. But at the start of last year, my foot was injured and I couldn&#39;t really play soccer, and when I realized there was a pool right next to where I drop my daughter off for pre-school, I decided to give it a go.</p><p>It proved a big success -- and over the course of the year, I swam 53 times - averaging over 1 a week. With two children, I consider this a big success!</p><p>With this update - I&#39;ve added a page about my swimming journey.</p><p>When I hit 52, I came home to this lovely certificate.</p><p><img alt="52 swims" src="https://aaronstrick.com/update/images/updates/goal-52-swims.jpg"/></p><p>My new son is chillest in the early hours of the morning. In the beginning part of the year, we got into a rhythm of waking up very early, and then while he chilled out, I&#39;d be able to get some reading in. I got hooked! I&#39;ve maintained a steady &#34;couple-books-a-year&#34; pace for the last decade or so, but this past year, I was able to average over 1 a month!</p><p>I love <a href="https://macwright.com/reading/" target="_blank">Tom Macwright&#39;s</a> reading tracking. I have something like it on my machine -- and maybe this year will get around to it. But here&#39;s a quick list of the 2025:</p><pre><code>| Title                       | Rating | Format   |
