I believed it was a green, gloopy, corrosive liquid as depicted in </span><em>The Simpsons</em><span>. I thought it was dumped in rivers, contaminated the environment with radiation and gave people cancer. I feared waste as if it </span><em>was </em><span>cancer.</span></p><p>I was 18 years old and I believed that nuclear energy was dangerous, the nuclear industry was evil, and renewables were the only way to save humankind.</p><p><span>I changed my mind about nuclear energy when I learned that it is essential for decarbonisation, that nuclear power stations have the </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-per-energy-source" rel="">smallest land footprint</a><span> of all the energy sources per unit of electricity they produce, and that the energy they produce is </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-energy" rel="">clean</a><span> and reliable. However, one thing continued to concern me: nuclear waste.</span></p><p>I had been told by countless friends and green organisations, of which I was an active member, that there were huge amounts of nuclear waste in the world, that it could not be disposed of safely, and that it was leaking into our precious environment. It was years before I realised that I had been misinformed, by people who were themselves misinformed. </p><p><strong>What is nuclear waste?</strong></p><p><span>Nuclear wastes are classified according to how radioactive they are. Low- and medium- level wastes include things like used protective clothing, tools, wiping cloths, and other disposable items that have been used on site. These are not particularly hazardous, but because of the nuclear industry’s high safety standards they are treated with rigorous caution - so much so that steel and concrete from nuclear plants can only be recycled as scrap if their radiation levels are </span><a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/radiation-and-health/naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials-norm.aspx" rel="">a thousand times lower than the same materials from the oil and gas industry</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>High-level radioactive waste consists of </span><em>irradiated</em><span>, or </span><em>spent</em><span>, nuclear reactor fuel. This fuel is in a solid form, consisting of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes called rods. A structured group of fuel rods is called a fuel assembly. Again, I was wrong: there is no scary green liquid. The waste is not even </span><em>liquid</em><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg" width="1051" height="814" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:814,&#34;width&#34;:1051,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F889f22b7-a240-472b-9f57-6e645ac6133c_1051x814.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Nuclear fuel schematic (Image: U.S. Department of Energy)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>What I’d been told about leaking waste was not to do with nuclear energy. The leaky vats I was afraid of were from weapons-related reactors, such as the </span><a href="https://darrp.noaa.gov/hazardous-waste/hanford-nuclear-site" rel="">Hanford Nuclear Site</a><span> in Washington State, where the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Energy produced plutonium for use in the atomic weapon program. Some of these contaminants leaked into the land and water, including into the Columbia River.</span></p><p>I learned that I had been confusing waste from nuclear energy with waste from nuclear weapons.</p><p><strong>How much waste is there?</strong></p><p><span>I was also confused about how much nuclear waste there is in the world. It turns out that there isn’t very much of it. All the high-level nuclear waste produced in the world would </span><a href="https://www.nei.org/fundamentals/nuclear-waste" rel="">fit in a single football field</a><span> to a height of approximately ten yards. </span></p><p><span>The amount of high-level waste produced during nuclear energy production is also small: a typical large reactor produces about 25-30 tonnes of used fuel per year. Worldwide, </span><a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx" rel="">97%</a><span> of the waste produced by the nuclear power industry is classified as low- or medium-level waste. In France, where fuel is reprocessed, just 0.2% of all radioactive waste by volume is classified as high-level waste. </span></p><p><strong>Cooling pools</strong></p><p>When a fuel assembly is removed from a reactor because it can no longer provide useful power it is extremely hot, both thermally and radioactively. It is immediately transferred to a cooling pool where it is stored alongside other used fuel for two to ten years as it cools down and becomes less radioactive. After this, it can be moved to a dry storage cask.</p><p><strong>What about the radiation?</strong></p><p>After I realised how wrong I’d been about what nuclear waste is, I was determined to learn how it is managed. This required a lot more work as I had to understand how waste is managed by other industries and also from fossil fuels and renewable production, to give a fair comparison.</p><p>We live in an industrialised civilisation where waste is a by-product of our everyday lifestyles. Many of these wastes are hazardous, including lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, cyanide, asbestos, dioxins, many other carcinogens, clinical wastes and various pathogens. They are, for the most part, managed carefully. But arguably, of all of them, nuclear waste is managed the most carefully. </p><p><span>I had this misconception about nuclear waste and radioactivity, where I believed that it would stay highly radioactive for many hundreds of thousands of years. I learned that unlike other industrial toxic wastes, the principal hazard associated with high-level waste - radioactivity - diminishes significantly with time. This is known as </span><em>radioactive decay</em><span>. The amount of time it takes for the radioactivity of radioactive material to decrease to half its original level is called the </span><em>radioactive half-life</em><span>.</span></p><p>The decay of heat and radioactivity over time means that after only forty years, the radioactivity of used fuel has decreased to about one-thousandth of the level at the point when it was unloaded. Less than 1% is radioactive for 10,000 years.  This portion can be easily isolated and shielded to protect humans and wildlife.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png" width="812" height="612" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:612,&#34;width&#34;:812,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1e63532-58b6-48aa-aa1a-478fe765c60f_812x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>How is nuclear waste transported?</strong></p><p><span>When spent fuel has to be transported, e.g. to reprocessing plants, it is carried in dry storage casks.

Every day when I wake up, I am grateful to be able to provide my family with a warm, safe home, as I know that billions of people around the world do not yet share this privilege.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg" width="1067" height="1600" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1600,&#34;width&#34;:1067,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58dfac10-a430-4a2c-b9a5-e26cda5f3360_1067x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Tree hugging looks different today</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I believe in an energy-abundant future, one informed by science over the fear of things that we don’t understand. After a decade of being afraid, I now understand that nuclear energy is essential for the future and that nuclear waste is a positive part of that future.</p><p>Realising all of this about waste and then seeing how it is managed and stored marked a turning point for me from being someone who protested nuclear energy to someone who now champions it globally. Knowledge is power, and no longer fearing something I didn’t understand has been liberating. I hope it will be for you too. Because the true waste is the amount of time we spend worrying about spent fuel instead of celebrating what this clean, reliable source of energy gives us.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
