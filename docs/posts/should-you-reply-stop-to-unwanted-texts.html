    <h1>Ask HN: Should you reply STOP to unwanted texts?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been advising people I know to block, then delete and report junk (iOS) to unwanted texts.  Others have argued with me that you should reply STOP.  I disagree, especially after checking a shortened link in a “campaign” text and finding the link was a phishing attempt.  What do you think?</p></div></div>
