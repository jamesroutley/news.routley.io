    <h1>Day 7: My first line of C#</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When I first started Keygen, I had this idea in my head that I could create a
company where I never had to get on a sales call — or any call. Being an
introvert, I absolutely hated calls. They&#39;re not only awkward, but a 30 minute
call takes up hours of my headspace. I quickly learned that I didn&#39;t want to
do them, and so I decided that I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>I instituted a bonkers <em>&#39;no calls&#39;</em> policy at work.</p>
<p>(Even I thought I was being crazy.)</p>
<p>However, as Keygen grew, I wanted to start to move more up-market. I wanted
larger customers, because the bigger a customer got, the less support they
typically needed, and of course, the more they paid me. And the bigger
logos help gain trust in a market.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was taking sales calls. I threw up a big <em>&#39;book a call&#39;</em>
button on my enterprise pricing page — but I obviously hated it.</p>
<p>(What about for non-enterprise leads? Well, I can&#39;t justify a call for $49/mo,
I&#39;ll tell you that much, especially when they may not buy.)</p>
<p>I felt like I was wasting my time, the lead&#39;s time, and I could never close a
sale. It felt awkward. I tried for months. I never felt prepared. I felt like
I was constantly talking to the wrong people, slowly climbing the ladder to an
actual stakeholder, repeating myself over and over every call — and then
repeating myself <em>again</em> in a summary email.</p>
<p><em>&#34;Couldn&#39;t this have all been an email?&#34;</em></p>
<p>(Yes, it could — and should — have been.)</p>
<p><em>&#34;This would be easier if it was async so I could think about my answer.&#34;</em></p>
<p><em>&#34;This person isn&#39;t somebody that has the authority to even close.&#34;</em></p>
<p><em>&#34;Is this person even involved in the project?&#34;</em></p>
<p><em>&#34;How do I talk to engineering?&#34;</em></p>
<p><em>&#34;Why am I talking to this person again?&#34;</em></p>
<p>One day, I woke up and out of frustration, I nuked the <em>&#39;book a call&#39;</em> button
from my pricing page.</p>
<p>When the next person asked for a call, I responded with a simple <em>&#34;No, we don&#39;t
do calls, but happy to help via email. Feel free to CC any relevant team
members onto this thread.&#34;</em></p>
<p>Their response was surprising. They <em>actually did</em> what I suggested — they CC&#39;d
the engineering department onto the email, they asked their questions, and we
started chatting integration strategies.</p>
<p>Instead of speaking with somebody who was multiple positions removed from the
project, I was speaking with the actual people who could champion Keygen within
the organization — the people who&#39;re directly involved — <em>the right people.</em></p>
<p>I thought to myself, <em>&#34;did I just bypass all of the red tape?&#34;</em></p>
<p>That month, I closed my first enterprise sale.</p>
<p>It was an F1000 company.</p>
<p><em>&#34;Maybe it was a fluke?&#34;</em></p>
<p>But it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Nearly everybody I sent that to <em>wanted</em> to skip the calls too. (I&#39;ve even had
people <em>literally say that to me in their response!</em>)</p>
<p>Sometimes, it didn&#39;t work out, and that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t expect Keygen to be a
fit for everybody; and not everybody is a fit for Keygen.</p>
<p>Am I leaving money on the table?</p>
<p>Maybe?</p>
<p>But I personally don&#39;t <em>feel</em> like I am. I feel like I get to wake up every
morning and do the kind of work that I love to do. And I feel like I have
the freedom to avoid the type of work that I hate to do.</p>
<p>I think about it like this: I don&#39;t provide white-glove integration or
consulting services, even though I might be able to earn more money if
I did. (And lots of people ask for it!)</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not what I want to do. That&#39;s not why I built Keygen.</p>
<p>In the same way, I don&#39;t want to do calls.</p>
<p>So, in enterprise sales, why do calls happen? Enterprises often default to
calls for these 4 totally-solvable reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don&#39;t understand what you offer.</li>
<li>They don&#39;t know how to use it.</li>
<li>They don&#39;t know your price.</li>
<li>They don&#39;t trust you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to try <em>#nocalls</em>, you need to solve these problems.</p>
<h4 id="1-they-don-t-understand-what-you-offer">1. They don&#39;t understand what you offer</h4>
<p>This comes down to messaging. If your messaging is vague, people will need to
get on a call to understand what you actually offer. If your product offering
is too wide (i.e. <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/good-saas-products-are-like-unix-tools/">you do too much</a>), people will feel like
they need to get on a call just to understand if your product is a good fit
for their much more narrow use-case.</p>
<p>But if you narrow down your focus, and really nail your messaging — make it
clear what you actually do — you can eliminate the question entirely. Drop the
<em>&#34;We Make Work Happen&#34;</em> taglines and actually sell the product. (And now, it
might be easier to see <em>why</em> some companies use these taglines — it&#39;s like
a sales call siren song!)</p>
<h4 id="2-they-don-t-know-how-to-use-it">2. They don&#39;t know how to use it</h4>
<p>If your product isn&#39;t self-serve, and if your onboarding sucks, people will
feel like have they to book a call in order to get started.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t provide enough information on your website to scope a POC or an
integration, they&#39;re going to need to somehow obtain that information. And
that typically requires a call.</p>
<p>e.g. if you don&#39;t have public documentation, you guessed it — call.</p>
<p>(And why would you not have public documentation?)</p>
<h4 id="3-they-don-t-know-your-price">3. They don&#39;t know your price</h4>
<p>Price is the big one. Enterprises are used to the dance. You book a call, size
each other up, and then come up with a b.s. price. It&#39;s all so tiring. And if
you want to skip calls, you have to dip out of the dance.</p>
<p>You can do this by putting enterprise pricing up front and center. I don&#39;t care
how large the number is — put it on your pricing page. If you feel like you&#39;re
giving up too much money, maybe <em>#nocalls</em> isn&#39;t for you.</p>
<p>When somebody asks for a call to discuss pricing, all you have to do is say
something simple like, <em>&#34;Our enterprise pricing is available here. Let me
know if you have any questions.&#34;</em></p>
<h4 id="4-they-don-t-trust-you">4. They don&#39;t trust you</h4>
<p>Last, but most certainly not least, is trust. If an enterprise doesn&#39;t trust
you, they will not buy from you — <em>period.</em> How do you gain trust? Well, first
off, <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/dont-die/">don&#39;t die</a>. Trust is a function of time — i.e. the longer you
exist, the more people will trust that you&#39;ll continue to exist.</p>
<p>But there are other facets of trust as well, and enterprises will send you huge
time-consuming questionnaires to alleviate all of their concerns. They might
even want to jump on a call. All they&#39;re trying to do is be compliant, and you
can help them be compliant without calls.</p>
<p>You can do that by clearly articulating how your company handles data, how you
handle security, and how you handle incidents. I&#39;m sure SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI
certifications would help, too, but we don&#39;t hold those yet (but our
infrastructure providers do).</p>
<p>(At Keygen, we have a <a href="https://keygen.sh/security/">security</a> page that outlines all of this, and
essentially answers the questions that are in most security questionnaires
we&#39;ve seen.)</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It may be controversial (I&#39;m almost sure of it), but here&#39;s my philosophy on
enterprise sales while avoiding sales calls entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>No sales calls, except for a short <em>&#39;discovery call&#39;</em> if absolutely needed.
Discovery calls are just a formality.</li>
<li>Use email. Ask leads to CC relevant teammates (e.g. engineering).</li>
<li>Explain your value clearly. Don&#39;t muddy the waters by doing too much. Avoid
vague messaging that prompts more questions.</li>
<li>Build trust. (Step one: <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/dont-die/">don&#39;t die</a>.)</li>
<li>Focus on security, and spell it out in public docs.</li>
<li>Document every problem to avoid repeating answers (i.e. allow them to easily
find the answers themselves).</li>
<li>Use fixed- or transparent-pricing. (If you like calls, ignore this.)</li>
<li>Make onboarding self-serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m sure some people will scoff at some or all of this, but maybe others who are
like myself will read this and realize they don&#39;t have to do sales like everybody
else. Enterprise sales don&#39;t have to be crazy.</p>
<p>If you want to go <em>#nocalls</em>, maybe try out some of the things above.</p>
<p>If you want to do calls, do the opposite of all of these things.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

  <em>Edit:</em> some readers have (rightfully) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725385">pointed out</a> that we do indeed have
  a <em>&#39;book a call&#39;</em> button on our enterprise pricing page, and so there seems to
  be a disconnect. I&#39;ve been practicing a strict <em>#nocalls</em> philosophy for years
  and years and years, and the <em>&#39;book a call&#39;</em> button being back is relatively
  new.</small></p><p><small>
<p>  I briefly touched on this in the conclusion, but this call is a short 15 min
  <em>&#39;discovery call&#39;</em>, <em>not</em> a sales call. It&#39;s essentially a formality to intro
  each other, make sure we&#39;re human, and move onto email for any further
  discussion. There is no further call.</p>
<p>  Essentially, over the years of strictly <em>#nocalls</em>, I discovered that not all
  enterprises will shoot you a cold email to start the conversation, so this
  call is to capture those leads, with the end-goal of having all real
  discussion in email.</p>
<p>  The point of <em>#nocalls</em> is to dip out of the dance, not of all communication.</p>
<p>  tl;dr: some enterprises will bounce if they don&#39;t see a <em>&#39;book a call&#39;</em> button.</p>
