    <h1>Rise of ‘zombie’ VCs as startup valuations plunge</h1>

Rather, it&#39;s a business that, while still generating cash, is so heavily indebted it can just about pay off its fixed costs and interest on debts, not the debt itself.</p><p>Life becomes harder for zombie firms in a higher interest rate environment, as it increases their borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England all raised interest rates again earlier this month.</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107193626"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107193626" data-vilynx-id="7000285520" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107193802-021323_CW_iso_thumb.jpg?v=1676325384&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Robert Le of PitchBook discusses the research firm&#39;s Q4 report on crypto VC investment"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>In the VC market, a zombie is an investment firm that no longer raises money to back new companies. They still operate in the sense that they manage a portfolio of investments. But they cease to write founders new checks amid struggles to generate returns.</p><p>Investors expect this gloomy economic backdrop to create a horde of zombie funds that, no longer producing returns, instead focus on managing their existing portfolios — while preparing to eventually wind down.</p><p>&#34;There are definitely zombie VC firms out there. It happens during every downturn,&#34; Michael Jackson, a Paris-based VC who invests in both startups and venture funds, told CNBC.</p><p>&#34;The fundraising climate for VCs has cooled considerably, so many firms won&#39;t be able to raise their next fund.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Why VCs are struggling</h2><div><p>VCs take funds from institutional backers known as LPs, or limited partners, and hand small amounts of the cash to startups in exchange for equity. These LPs are typically pension funds, endowments, and family offices.</p><p>If all goes smoothly and that startup successfully goes public or gets acquired, a VC recoups the funds or, better yet, generates a profit on their investment. But in the current environment, where startups are seeing their valuations slashed, LPs are becoming more picky about where they park their cash.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re going to see a lot more zombie venture capital firms this year,&#34; Steve Saraccino, founder of VC firm Activant Capital, told CNBC.</p><p>A sharp slide in technology valuations has taken its toll on the VC industry. Publicly-listed tech stocks have stumbled amid souring investor sentiment on high-growth areas of the market, with the <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/">Nasdaq</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> down nearly 26% from its peak in November 2021.</p></div><div><div role="button" tabindex="0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256" aria-labelledby="title desc" role="img" focusable="false" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><title>Stock Chart Icon</title><desc>Stock chart icon</desc><g transform="translate(1.4065934065934016 1.4065934065934016) scale(2.81 2.81)"><path d="M 87.994 0 H 69.342 c -1.787 0 -2.682 2.16 -1.418 3.424 l 5.795 5.795 l -33.82 33.82 L 28.056 31.196 l -3.174 -3.174 c -1.074 -1.074 -2.815 -1.074 -3.889 0 L 0.805 48.209 c -1.074 1.074 -1.074 2.815 0 3.889 l 3.174 3.174 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 15.069 -15.069 l 14.994 14.994 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 1.614 -1.614 c 0.083 -0.066 0.17 -0.125 0.247 -0.202 l 37.1 -37.1 l 5.795 5.795 C 87.84 23.34 90 22.445 90 20.658 V 2.006 C 90 0.898 89.102 0 87.994 0 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 65.626 37.8 v 49.45 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 23.518 L 65.626 37.8 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 47.115 56.312 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 42.03 L 47.115 56.312 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 39.876 60.503 c -1.937 0 -3.757 -0.754 -5.127 -2.124 l -6.146 -6.145 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 59.844 C 41.952 60.271 40.933 60.503 39.876 60.503 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 22.937 46.567 L 11.051 58.453 c -0.298 0.298 -0.621 0.562 -0.959 0.8 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 48.004 L 22.937 46.567 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path></g></svg><p><img src="https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg" alt="hide content"/></p></div><p>A chart showing the performance of the Nasdaq Composite since Nov. 1, 2021.</p></div><div><p>With private valuations playing catch-up with stocks, venture-backed startups are feeling the chill as well.</p><p>Stripe, the online payments giant, has seen its internal market value drop 40% to $63 billion since reaching a peak of $95 billion in March 2021.

The IPO window has for the most part been shut as several tech firms opt to stall their listings until market conditions improve. Merger and acquisition activity, too, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/dealmakers-brace-slow-2023-recovery-after-global-ma-sinks-2022-12-21/" target="_blank">slowed down</a>.</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>New VC funds face a tougher time</h2><div><p>In the past two to three years, a flood of new venture funds have emerged due to a prolonged period of low interest rates. A total of 274 funds were raised by VCs in 2022, more than in any previous year and up 73% from 158 in 2019, according to numbers from the data platform Dealroom.</p><p>LPs may be less inclined to hand cash to newly established funds with less experience under their belt than names with strong track records. </p><p>&#34;LPs are pulling back after being overexposed in the private markets, leaving less capital to go around the large number of VC firms started over the past few years,&#34; Saraccino said.</p><p>&#34;A lot of these new VC firms are unproven and have not been able to return capital to their LPs, meaning they are going to struggle mightily to raise new funds.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline3"></a>When will zombie VCs emerge?</h2><div><p>Frank Demmler, who teaches entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Tepper School of Business, said it would likely take three to four years before ailing VC firms show signs of distress.</p><p>&#34;The behavior will not be as obvious&#34; as it is with zombie firms in other industries, he said, &#34;but the tell-tale signs are they haven&#39;t made big investments over the last three or four years, they haven&#39;t raised a new fund.&#34;</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107168007"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107168007" data-vilynx-id="7000277952" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107168009-GettyImages-1244772036.jpg?v=1673993256&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="FTX&#39;s collapse is shaking crypto to its core. The pain may not be over"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>&#34;There were a lot of first-time funds that got funded during the buoyant last couple of years,&#34; Demmler said.</p><p>&#34;Those funds are probably going to get caught midway through where they haven&#39;t had an opportunity to have too much liquidity yet and only been on the investing side of things if they were invented in 2019, 2020.&#34;</p><p>&#34;They then have a situation where their ability to make the type of returns that LPs want is going to be close to nil. That&#39;s when the zombie dynamic really comes into play.&#34;</p><p>According to industry insiders, VCs won&#39;t lay off their staff in droves, unlike tech firms which have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/tech-jobs-hit-the-hardest-by-layoffs-last-year-report.html">laid off thousands</a>. Instead, they&#39;ll shed staff over time through attrition, avoiding filling vacancies left by partner exits as they prepare to eventually wind down.</p><p>&#34;A venture wind down isn&#39;t like a company wind down,&#34; Hussein Kanji, partner at Hoxton Ventures, explained. &#34;It takes 10-12 years for funds to shut down. So basically they don&#39;t raise and management fees decline.&#34;</p><p>&#34;People leave and you end up with a skeleton crew managing the portfolio until it all exits in the decade allowed. This is what happened in 2001.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
