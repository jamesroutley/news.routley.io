    <h1>MinIO Removes Web UI Features from Community Version, Pushes Users to Paid Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section></section><section><p><img src="https://img.bgo.one/news-image/44093987_1.jpg" alt="MinIO Removes Web UI Features from Community Version, Pushes Users to Paid Plans" fetchpriority="high"/></p></section><section><p>MinIO, a popular open-source object storage solution, has made significant changes to its community version that have sparked controversy among users. The company has removed key web-based management features from the free version, directing users to either use command-line tools or upgrade to paid plans.</p>
<h3>Major Features Stripped from Community Version</h3>
<p>The latest changelog reveals that MinIO has deprecated several core management features in the web interface. Account and policy management, configuration settings, and other administrative functions are no longer available through the browser-based console. Instead, users must rely on the <code>mc</code> command-line client to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>This change affects how users interact with their MinIO deployments. Previously, administrators could manage their storage systems through an intuitive web interface. Now, they must learn command-line syntax or pay for the commercial version to regain web-based management capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Deprecated Features in MinIO v2.0.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account and policy management (web UI)</li>
<li>Configuration management (web UI)</li>
<li>Bucket management tools (web UI)</li>
<li>Administrative console features</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SeaweedFS</strong> - Apache 2.0 license</li>
<li><strong>Garage</strong> - AGPL license</li>
<li><strong>Zenko</strong> - Apache 2.0 license</li>
<li><strong>OpenMaxIO</strong> - Community fork of pre-change MinIO</li>
</ul>
<h3>Community Response and Concerns</h3>
<p>The decision has drawn comparisons to Redis&#39;s recent licensing changes, with users expressing frustration about the removal of functionality they previously relied on. Many see this as a classic example of enshittification - the gradual degradation of services to drive revenue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Deprecated support has another meaning. I hate when this kind of things happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some community members are already exploring alternatives. A fork called OpenMaxIO has emerged, preserving the last version before these changes were implemented. However, its long-term viability remains uncertain.</p>
<h3>Technical Impact and Alternatives</h3>
<p>While the core storage functionality remains intact, the user experience has significantly changed. Organizations that depend on web-based management may need to retrain staff or consider migration to other solutions.</p>
<p>Several alternatives are gaining attention, including SeaweedFS, Garage, and Zenko. These projects offer S3-compatible storage with varying licensing models and feature sets. Users are actively discussing these options as potential replacements for MinIO in self-hosted environments.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>MinIO&#39;s strategy appears focused on monetizing enterprise features while maintaining the core storage engine as open source. The company argues this approach helps sustain development while serving both community and commercial users.</p>
<p>However, the timing and execution of these changes have created uncertainty in the community. Users must now decide whether to adapt to command-line management, pay for commercial licenses, or migrate to alternative solutions that better align with their needs and expectations.</p>
