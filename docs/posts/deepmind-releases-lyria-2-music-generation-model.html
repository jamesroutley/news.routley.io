  <h4 data-block-key="lsvmh">Musicians today are drawing inspiration and crafting their sound using a broad ecosystem of tools — from mobile apps to traditional Digital Audio Workstations, specialized plug-ins and hardware. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful new part of this creative toolkit, opening doors to novel workflows and sonic possibilities.</h4><p data-block-key="9nm0a">Google has long collaborated with musicians, producers, and artists in the research and development of music AI tools. Ever since launching the <a href="https://magenta.withgoogle.com/blog/2016/06/01/welcome-to-magenta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Magenta</a> project, in 2016, we’ve been exploring how AI can enhance creativity — sparking inspiration, facilitating exploration and enabling new forms of expression, always hand-in-hand with the music community.</p><p data-block-key="f8beg">Our ongoing collaborations led to the creation of <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/ai-and-music-experiment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Music AI Sandbox</a>, in 2023, which we’ve shared with musicians, producers and songwriters through YouTube’s <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Music AI Incubator</a>.</p><p data-block-key="5lk3q">Building upon the work we&#39;ve done to date, today, we&#39;re introducing new features and improvements to Music AI Sandbox, including <a href="https://toground.link/technologies/lyria/">Lyria 2</a>, our latest music generation model. We&#39;re giving more musicians, producers and songwriters in the U.S. access to experiment with these tools, and are gathering feedback to inform their development.</p><p data-block-key="m6r">We&#39;re excited to see what this growing community creates with Music AI Sandbox and encourage interested musicians, songwriters, and producers to sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmU9T4KF-3ks57ACPnXqz4f9CX4guYEJrDhYSft9zAZItn_w/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="ak3mo">Music AI Sandbox</h2><p data-block-key="635bc">We created Music AI Sandbox in close collaboration with musicians. Their input guided our development and experiments, resulting in a set of responsibly created tools that are practical, useful and can open doors to new forms of music creation.</p><p data-block-key="3rm1k">The Music AI Sandbox is a set of experimental tools, which can spark new creative possibilities and help artists explore unique musical ideas. Artists can generate fresh instrumental ideas, craft vocal arrangements or simply break through a creative block.</p><p data-block-key="5svk0">With these tools, musicians can discover new sounds, experiment with different genres, expand and enhance their musical libraries, or develop entirely new styles. They can also push further into unexplored territories — from unique soundscapes to their next creative breakthrough.</p>

  <h3 data-block-key="ak3mo">Create new musical parts</h3><p data-block-key="8r0n0">Quickly try out music ideas by describing what kind of sound you want — the Music AI Sandbox understands genres, moods, vocal styles and instruments. The Create tool helps generate many different music samples to spark the imagination or for use in a track. Artists can also place their own lyrics on a timeline and specify musical characteristics, like tempo and key.</p>
