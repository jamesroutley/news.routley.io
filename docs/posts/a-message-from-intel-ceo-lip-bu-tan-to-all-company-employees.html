					<!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><p><em>The following note from Lip-Bu Tan was sent to all Intel Corporation employees on August 7, 2025:</em></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Dear Team,</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">I know there has been a lot in the news today, and I want to take a moment to address it directly with you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p>Let me start by saying this: The United States has been my home for more than 40 years. I love this country and am profoundly grateful for the opportunities it has given me. I also love this company. Leading Intel at this critical moment is not just a job – it’s a privilege. This industry has given me so much, our company has played such a pivotal role, and it&#39;s the honor of my career to work with you all to restore Intel&#39;s strength and create the innovations of the future. Intel&#39;s success is essential to U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership, national security, and economic strength. This is what fuels our business around the world. It’s what motivated me to join this team, and it’s what drives me every day to advance the important work we’re doing together to build a stronger future.</p><p><span data-contrast="auto">There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems. I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I’ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards. My reputation has been built on trust – on doing what I say I’ll do, and doing it the right way. This is the same way I am leading Intel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts. I fully share the President’s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security, I appreciate his leadership to advance these priorities, and I’m proud to lead a company that is so central to these goals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">The Board is fully supportive of the work we are doing to transform our company, innovate for our customers, and execute with discipline – and we are making progress. It’s especially exciting to see us ramping toward high-volume manufacturing using the most advanced semiconductor process technology in the country later this year. It will be a major milestone that’s a testament to your work and the important role Intel plays in the U.S. technology ecosystem. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Looking ahead, our mission is clear, and our opportunity is enormous. I’m proud to be on this journey with you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you for everything you’re doing to strengthen our company for the future. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Lip-Bu</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
