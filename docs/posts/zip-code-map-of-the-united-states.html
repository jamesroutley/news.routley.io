    <h1>Zip Code Map of the United States</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   
                            





<p>This zip code map of the United States visualizes over 42,000 zip codes in the 50 states. Zip codes are five digit postal codes used for mail delivery in the US. The points on the map show the geographic center of each zip code.  The interactive visualization lets you type in a zip code and will show you where that zip code lies on the map.  As you begin to type in the zip code, the map will highlight all the zip codes that begin with those numbers.  </p>


<p>For example, if you type in “0”, you will highlight all zip codes that start with the zero in the Northeastern US.  This will represent about 10% of the zip codes in the US.  When you type in another number, it will narrow down the zip codes that begin with those two digits (approximately 1% of zip codes).  It will progressively narrow down the number of zip codes as you type in more numbers, until you get to a full 5 digit zip code that represents 1 out of almost 43,000 zip codes (0.002% of zip codes). The map will then tell you the name of the city that that zip code is in.</p>




<p>You can explore how zip codes are distributed across the US by typing in different 1 and 2 digit numbers.  You can also click on the check box to show or hide the outlines of the states.</p>
