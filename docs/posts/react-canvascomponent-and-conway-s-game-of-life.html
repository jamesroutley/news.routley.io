    <h1>React CanvasComponent and Conway’s Game of Life</h1>

        <div><p>A few years ago, I was messing around with the HTML Canvas element and 2d rendering context in React and I came up with a very simple component that would let me run a <code>draw</code> function whenever the props updated. Here’s the code on <a href="https://codepen.io/mrcoles/pen/zJdbzP?editors=1010">codepen</a>.</p>
<p>For good measure, I included a simple demo implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> (which is a zero-player game, so don’t expect to be able to do anything after clicking start):</p>

<p>Since I originally wrote this, I’ve been preferring TypeScript over JavaScript and function components + hooks vs class components, so an update might be in order…</p></div>
