  <p><strong>What maps did you use to canoe the Danube?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you need a river permit to canoe on the Danube?</strong></p><p><strong>Where are there dams on the river?</strong></p><p>N.B. On <em>TID</em>s itinerary for 15.07.17 in location named &#39;Cunovo&#39; the description is to portage on the right bank to the old Danube river bed. This complicated section of the itinerary is deceiving, since there are really two options on the right hand side:Â You can go &#39;far right&#39; or to a large dam that is on the right hand side but does not go all the way to the river-bank. It is for this dam you want to head and, once closer, you will find sign posts to help you with the portage. In short: at 1852 go right but head for the dam not for the river-bank, here there are signs for canoes.</p><p><strong>How do I get around the dams?</strong></p><p>On some dams there are shoots that you can slide down in your canoe. Sometimes you will see a bell and rope on the bank near one of these banks or a lever to pull. By ringing the bell you alert the control tower who will open the gate for you. Once this has lowered and the green light shows you can plummet down the ramp. If, like us, you find you are not canoeing during tourist season there may be no one there to operate the ramp. For this you can either carry around or (be cheeky) and go down the slide anyway even though theres not much water on it. but be careful because you don&#39;t want to get stuck!</p><p>The two locks in Serbia/Romania marked as Djerdap I and II are the only places you may have problems. The lock keepers do not want to deal with canoes and there is no sign posted set up here. We got shooed away from the lock on either side of the dam but eventually convinced the Romanian side to let us in with a cruise ship and go down in the lock. At the second we chatted and were slowed by countless members of authority but were eventually allowed to walk around and place our canoe back in the river on the other side. With these locks prepare for a long wait and a lot of talking, ultimately you have a right to be allowed passed.</p><p><strong>Are there other obstacles on the River Danube?</strong></p><p>We joined the Danube at Kelheim but we are informed that in the first 200km or so from the source the river passes many light rapids, which do have the potential to damage canoes and kayaks if paddlers are not careful. From Kelheim onwards, however, there are no rapids</p><p><strong>What are the border formalities on the River Danube?</strong></p><p>As an international waterway you should not have to pay for your passage on the water at any borders. However, in Serbia we were charged a fee since we were deemed a leisure boat and had to pay a government charge. Still not sure whether we were conned on that one or not!</p><p>We were aware of kayakers in the past who had not needed any paperwork but us, in our canoe, were told we required a crew list for each country. This was a form we were given at each customs office which we would fill out stating our names and information about the canoe (its length, width, make, e.t.c.). It is this form which we stamped in and out at each border.</p><p>In short: at each border look for a customs office which will be on the riverside in the closest town. Stop and tell them what you are doing, showing your passports. As an international waterway they will let you pass.</p>
