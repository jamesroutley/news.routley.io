In the United States graph, the percentage starts around 15% in 1918, dips slightly mid-century, and then rises again to near 20% by the early 1970s. 

The Sweden graph shows a relatively stable line around 10–15% throughout the years, with no significant fluctuations.

In Spain, the share steadily increases, culminating in over 20% by 1972, indicating a growing trend in women having no births.
