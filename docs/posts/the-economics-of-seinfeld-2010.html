    <h1>The Economics of Seinfeld (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
<p>Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a “show about nothing.” Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances.</p>
<p>It is the simplicity of Seinfeld that makes it so appropriate for use in economics courses. Using these clips (as well as clips from other television shows or movies) makes economic concepts come alive, making them more real for students. Ultimately, students will start seeing economics everywhere – in other TV shows, in popular music, and most importantly, in their own lives.</p>
<p>We hope that you find these clips valuable and would appreciate your feedback.</p>
