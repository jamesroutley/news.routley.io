    <li><b>Marinship.</b> &#34;Shipyard construction was begun promptly after a telegram from the United States Maritime Commission was received by the W. A. Bechtel Company. The telegram was received on 2 March 1942, the Sausalito site selected on 3 March, and a proposal to build the shipyard presented in Washington DC was made on 9 March. Ten minutes into the presentation U. S. Maritime Commission administrators told the W.A. Bechtel Company to build the shipyard. Physical construction began on 28 March. Construction start was delayed two weeks to allow the 42 families living on Pine Point, which was scheduled to be demolished to build the shipyard, to move.&#34; The first ship was completed on September 15 of that year, 197 days after receiving the telegram. <i>Source: <a href="http://www.sausalitohistoricalsociety.com/2019-columns/2019/1/23/marinship-on-the-fast-track">Marinship on the Fast Track</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>The Spirit of St. Louis.</b> In 1927, Donald Hall and Charles Lindbergh designed and built <i>Spirit</i> in 60 days. &#34;To determine the amount of fuel the plane would need, Lindbergh and Hall drove to the San Diego Public Library at 820 E St. Using a globe and a piece of string, Lindbergh estimated the distance from New York to Paris. It came out to 3,600 statute miles, which Hall calculated would require 400 gallons of gas.&#34; <i>Source: <a href="http://www.sandiegoyesterday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/lindbergh.pdf">Ryan Airlines gave Lindbergh wings</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>The Eiffel Tower.</b> The Eiffel Tower was built in 2 years and 2 months; that is, in 793 days. When completed in 1889, it became the tallest building in the world, a record it held for more than 40 years. It cost about $40 million in 2019 dollars. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eiffels-Tower-Thrilling-Extraordinary-Introduced/dp/0143117297/">Eiffel&#39;s Tower</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>The Berlin Airlift.</b> On 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union initiated a blockade of Berlin. Two days later, the Berlin Airlift commenced. Over the following 463 days, the US, the UK, and France flew 277,000 flights with 300 aircraft to deliver the supplies required to support 2.2 million Berlin residents. On average, a supply aircraft landed every 2 minutes for 14 months. As part of this effort, Tegel airport was built. Planning started in July 1948; construction started August 5 1948; the first landing took place November 5 1948 (92 days after construction started); the official opening of the airport took place December 5 1948. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Candy-Bombers-Untold-Airlift-Americas/dp/0425227715/">The Candy Bombers</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>The Pentagon.</b> The construction of the world&#39;s largest office building was led by Brehon Somervell. The decision to proceed with the project was made on a Thursday evening. Initial drawings were completed that Sunday. Construction started two months later, on September 11 1941, and was finished on January 15 1943, 491 days later. When asked when something was needed, Somervell&#39;s go-to response was &#34;the day before yesterday&#34;. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pentagon-History-Steve-Vogel/dp/0812973259">The Pentagon</a>.</i></li>

In April 2000, the MTA decided to build the Second Avenue Subway. The first phase, with 3 stations, opened on January 1 2017. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1904/10/28/archives/our-subway-open-150000-try-it-mayor-mcclellan-runs-the-first.html&amp;legacy=true">The New York Times</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>TGV.</b> On April 30 1976, the French government approved a plan to build a high-speed rail link between Paris and Lyon, the first high-speed rail line in Europe. This line was to use completely new electric locomotives, also to be developed in France as part of the project. The ensuing line opened on September 26 1981, 1,975 days later. On September 24 1996, the California High-Speed Rail Authority was formed. The completion of the first phase of California&#39;s high-speed rail project, a line connecting San Francisco and Anaheim, is currently estimated to happen in 2033, 37 years (i.e. around 13,000 days) after the authority was formed. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Track-Railway-Modernization-1944-1983-dp-0275973778/dp/0275973778">On the Fast Track</a>.</i></li>

    <li><b>Xerox Alto.</b> Work on the Xerox Alto, the first GUI-oriented computer, started in November 1972 because of a bet: &#34;Chuck said that a futuristic computer could be done &#39;in three months&#39; and a Xerox exec bet him a case of wine that it couldn’t be done&#34;. Building the Alto required extensive hardware, operating system, and application <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/alto.pdf">design</a> and implementation.

[...] 22 months after breaking ground, Fab 15 started production output." This factory, Fab 15, produced 28nm chips. In 2012, Apple gave TSMC the contract to produce the A8 CPU for the iPhone with a 20nm process—"with no backup plan". To manufacture these chips, TSMC embarked upon Fab 14 Phase 5. This project cost $9 billion and required 6,000 people. Construction started on April 9 of 2012, finished early the following year, and saw the first A8 chips produced in July 2013, 15 months later. <i>Source: various sources, including a <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/static/archive/video/30th%20Anniversary%20Forum%20Transcript_all.pdf">talk</a> from Apple's Jeff Williams</i></li> -->

    <li><b>COVID-19 vaccines.</b> On January 10 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was <a href="https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319">published</a>. 3 days later, Moderna <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19">finalized</a> the sequence for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna#COVID-19_vaccine_candidate">mRNA-1273</a>, its mRNA vaccine candidate; the first batch was manufactured on February 7. On February 24 (45 days after genome publication), Moderna shipped the first batch of mRNA-1273 to the NIH for use in their Phase 1 clinical study. 266 days of clinical trials and regulatory coordination followed. On November 16, Moderna <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy">announced</a> that the vaccine&#39;s efficacy was 94.5%. <i>Source: linked materials.

<p>San Francisco proposed a <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/two-mile-long-van-ness-bus-lane-project-faces-two-year-delay/">new bus lane</a> on Van Ness in 2001. Its opening was delayed to <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/van-ness-avenue-brt-to-finally-begin-service-early-next-year/">2022</a>, yielding a project duration of around 7,600 days. “The project has been delayed due to an increase of wet weather since the project started,” said Paul Rose, a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency spokesperson. The project will cost $310 million, i.e. $100,000 per meter. The Alaska Highway, mentioned above, constructed across remote tundra, cost $793 per meter in 2019 dollars.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s going on?</h2>

<p>The physical infrastructure projects enumerated above occurred before 1970 to a disproportionate degree. Why? Some works containing hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Marc Dunkelman <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/11/29/penn-station-robert-caro-073564">investigated</a> why Penn Station renovation efforts have repeatedly failed.</li>

    <li>Alon Levy points out that not only has <i>construction</i> slowed but so too has <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2021/06/20/quick-note-deterioration-of-speed/">actual operation</a>.</li>

    <li>Lynne Sagalyn <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ground-Zero-Politics-Manhattan/dp/0190607025">wrote a book</a> about why redeveloping Ground Zero took so long. Ed Glaeser, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/books/review/power-at-ground-zero-lynne-b-sagalyn.html">reviewing</a> it for the <i>Times</i>, writes &#34;her ­story teaches us how and why America has changed since 1931, when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could build the George Washington Bridge — the world’s longest suspension bridge at the time — in 49 months.&#34;</li>

    <li>Herbert Kaufman <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U1V3EAQ">wrote a book</a> about red tape; the foreword from Philip Howard includes the claim that the nature of bureaucratic constrictions in the US changed in the 60s.</li>
    
    <li>Howard also wrote a <a href="https://www.commongood.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2YearsNot10Years.pdf">report</a> entitled <i>Two Years Not Ten Years: Redesigning Infrastructure Approvals</i>, diving deeper on this topic. George Will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-we-waste-a-massive-amount-of-infrastructure-money--before-building-even-starts/2017/06/09/e8834994-4c67-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html">wrote a column</a> about it.</li>

    <li>In <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Government-James-Q-Wilson/dp/1133594379">American Government: Brief Version</a></i>, the authors contrast an &#34;Old System&#34; and a &#34;New System&#34; of American government; they, too, argue that something significant changed in the 60s.</li>

    <li>Mancur Olson <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Decline-Nations-Stagflation-Rigidities/dp/0300030797">argued</a> that stable societies naturally tend to become less dynamic and more beholden to special interest groups with time. Empirical support for the claim is mixed. Synthesizing some themes above, Francis Fukuyama <a href="https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/interview-francis-fukuyama">argued</a> that interest groups have now made the US a &#34;vetocracy&#34;.</li>
