<li>girl (non-gender-denominational) what did i even do in week 26??</li>
<li>i got to 58 days of daily journalling - today would&#39;ve been day 60 - but i couldn&#39;t be bothered yesterday on some deep existential level so i missed a day. luckily, given your definition of luck, <a href="https://new.750words.com/">750 words</a> has a &#34;streak fairy&#34; feature where if I write 1500 today i can keep my streak intact. but like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvoJdMvJwWM">i still know it&#39;s broken</a> so what then?</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been working on snapback, which is my actual name for the system (app? website? both? something else?) i&#39;m trying to make to track my habits. it was codename &#34;no good cookie&#34; for a while, for reasons i&#39;ve forgotten. i wrote it in svelte and dislike how it is turning out so far so i&#39;m gonna start again.</li>
<li>on snapback, a friend is helping me think about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling">&#34;data model design&#34;</a> which sounds esoteric to me but has been explained as &#34;what the essential data structures and relationships would be whether it was run from the command line or an android app&#34;.</li>
<li>the whole thing with the data modelling has made me think &#34;why don&#39;t more people write about how they approach side projects&#34; and I think I&#39;ve answered for myself that:
a) they like to show a finished project and step back through it, which will always be less raw but also less embarrassing if you decide you no longer care about the project. it&#39;s also way easier to come up with a coherent narrative.
b) this one starts off with a tangent. <tangent> as much as i want to be a <a href="https://mas.to/@TodePond/112710297107707298">scrappy fiddle</a> person I think I don&#39;t think in discreet parts like that (yet?) so i would be showing off things that are broken in some way (beyond very simple projects). i once met someone at a meetup who told me he had been working on a side project for <high number="" of=""> years but didn&#39;t feel it was good enough to release. I suggested maybe releasing it and getting some feedback and he was very upset about the concept. Long side to say that I get there&#39;s a bunch of points between embryonic, broken and &#34;perfect in an infinite amount of time and you will never see it before then&#34;.  it&#39;s scary to share a beautiful complete project that might flop (even in the sense of no likes, comments, emails or views), or have the equally scary but smaller possibility of your sketched out project being seen as irredeemably boring/contrived/pretentious/awful before it has a chance to unfurl fully, but yeah.
c-z) the same stuff that stops people blogging and/or coding in the first place stops them making tiny scrappy things and talking about them.</high></tangent></li>
<li>all this to say: i&#39;m torn on whether to blog more about snapback as i&#39;m new to from scratch/greenfield coding but I guess how better to learn than to do??</li>
<li>oh yeah, i asked about <a href="https://social.gfsc.studio/@oluOnline/112695250191471039">an umbrella term</a> for a bunch of stuff I&#39;m just going to call <a href="https://notes.olu.online/possible-technologies">possible technologies</a> for now cos it feels complicated.</li>
<li>happy half complete year also! Q3 planning is done which is cool; I should revisit my <a href="https://olu.online/24-hopes-for-2024/">24 Hopes for 2024</a> at some point and see what i no longer care about.</li>
