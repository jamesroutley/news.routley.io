    <p>
      There are two main types of emails on the internet: plain text and HTML.
      Many people, particularly in technical communities, strongly prefer or
      even require the use of plain text email from participants. However, your
      mail client may not have it set up by default. We&#39;ll help you get it
      configured, and introduce you to the norms and conventions of plain text
      email.

      Etiquette recommendations for plain text emails
    </a></h2>
    <p>
      A few notes on the subject of plain text email etiquette:
    </p>
    <h3>Top posting</h3>
    <p>
      When you reply to an email, many email clients will include a quoted
      version of the entire message that you are responding to beneath your
      reply. This leads to long email threads which contain the entire history
      of the discussion in an increasingly long trailer on every email. This is
      called &#34;top posting&#34;, and it&#39;s strongly frowned upon by many users of
      plain text email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plain text email makes it easier to incorporate the original text into
      your reply much more meaningfully. Consider these two examples:
    </p>
<pre>Yes, that sounds good.

&gt; Are you okay with maroon?
&gt;
&gt; Tim said on 2019-03-23 at 10:43 PM:
&gt;&gt; Do we know what color we should use for the background?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jim said on 2019-03-23 at 10:30 PM:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there anything left to do on the site?</pre>
    <p>
      This email uses top-posting, and this approach is discouraged. A better
      approach might look more like this:
    </p>
<pre>Jim said on 2019-03-23 at 11:02 PM:
&gt; Are you okay with maroon?

Yes, that sounds good.</pre>
    <p>
      You can also edit the original email more, quoting it several times to
      make it clear what points you are responding to, like so:
    </p>
<pre>Hey Drew,

Can you look into the bug which is causing 2.34 clients to disconnect
immediately? I think this is related to the timeouts change last week.

Also, your fix to the queueing bug is confirmed for the next release,
thanks!</pre>
<pre>Hey Sarah, I can look into that for sure.

&gt; I think this is related to the timeouts change last week.

I&#39;m not so sure. I think reducing the timeouts would *improve* this issue,
if anything. I&#39;ll look into it.

&gt; Also, your fix to the queueing bug is confirmed for the next release,
&gt; thanks!

Sweet! Happy to help.</pre>
    <p>As the old joke goes...</p>

      <li><strong>A</strong>: Because it reverses the logical flow of conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Q</strong>: Why is top posting frowned upon?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wrapping your text</h3>
    <p>
      Plain text emails are generally encouraged to be wrapped at 72 columns,
      by inserting a newline and resuming the content on the next line. This is
      encouraged to make email more comfortable to read and quote in many of
      the contexts where technical users may encounter it, such as terminal
      emulators. Of course, it&#39;s far too annoying to do this manually as you
      write — the <a href="#recommended-clients">recommended clients</a>
      will do this for you, as well as any client shown above with &#34;Wraps text
      or uses format=flowed&#34;.

    <h2 id="why-plaintext"><a href="#why-plaintext">
      Why is plain text better than HTML?
    </a></h2>
    <p>
      HTML emails are mainly used for marketing - that is, emails you probably
      don&#39;t want to see in the first place. The few advantages they offer for
      end-users, such as links, inline images, and bold or italic text, aren&#39;t
      worth the trade-off.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML as a vector for phishing</h3>
    <p>
      HTML emails allow you to make links which hide the URL behind some
      user-friendly text. However, this is an extremely common vector for
      phishing attacks, where a malicious sender makes a misleading link which
      takes you to a different website than you expect. Often these websites are
      modeled after the login page of a service you use, and will trick you into
      entering your account password. In plain text emails, the URL is always
      visible, and you can more easily make an informed choice to click it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many phishing emails have also taken the step of carefully replicating
      the visual style of an email you might trust, such as the appearance of a
      PayPal email. With plain text, it&#39;s much more difficult to trick you like
      this.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy invasion and tracking</h3>
    <p>
      Virtually all HTML emails sent by marketers include identifiers in links
      and inline images which are designed to extract information about you and
      send it back to the sender. Examine the URLs closely - the strange numbers
      and letters are unique to you and used to identify you. This information
      is used to hack your brain, attempting to find advertisements which are
      more likely to influence your buying habits. HTML emails are good for
      marketers and bad for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Higher incidence of spam</h3>
    <p>
      HTML emails open up a lot of possibilities which are exploited by
      spammers to circumvent spam filters, such as making large amounts of text
      invisible, using hidden elements, and so on. Many people discard HTML
      emails (particularly mailing lists) on the simple basis that it
      dramatically reduces the amount of spam emails they receive.
    </p>
    <h3>Mail client vulnerabilities</h3>
    <p>
      HTML is an extremely large and complicated set of specifications designed
      without emails in mind. It&#39;s designed for browsing the world wide web, on
      which a huge variety of documents, applications, and more are available.
      Implementing even a reasonable subset of these standards represents
      hundreds of thousands of hours of work, or even millions. A large subset
      (perhaps the majority) of these features are not desirable for emails, and
      if included can be leveraged to leak information about you, your contacts,
      your calendar, other emails in your inbox, and so on. However, because of
      the herculean effort necessary to implement an HTML renderer, no one has
      built one specialized for emails which is guaranteed to be safe. Instead,
      general purpose web browsers, with many of their features disabled, are
      employed in most email clients. This is the number one source of
      vulnerabilities in email clients which result in information disclosure
      and even the execution of arbitrary malicious code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=452&amp;product_id=3678&amp;version_id=&amp;page=1&amp;hasexp=0&amp;opdos=0&amp;opec=1&amp;opov=0&amp;opcsrf=0&amp;opgpriv=0&amp;opsqli=0&amp;opxss=0&amp;opdirt=0&amp;opmemc=0&amp;ophttprs=0&amp;opbyp=0&amp;opfileinc=0&amp;opginf=0&amp;cvssscoremin=0&amp;cvssscoremax=0&amp;year=0&amp;month=0&amp;cweid=0&amp;order=3&amp;trc=421&amp;sha=e340a73ad8b935c928250f8f7668f55ce061c8ec" rel="noopener nofollow">This is a list</a> of 421 remote code execution vulnerabilities in
      Thunderbird. If you&#39;re bored, try finding one that doesn&#39;t exploit web
      tech.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML emails are less accessible</h3>
    <p>
      Browsing the web is a big challenge for users who require a screenreader
      or other assistive tools to use their computer. The same problems apply to
      email, only more so - making an accessible HTML email is even more
      difficult than making an accessible website due to the limitations imposed
      on HTML emails by most mail clients (which they have no choice but to
      impose - for the security reasons stated above). Plain text emails are
      a breeze in comparison for screenreaders to recite, especially for users
      with specialized email clients designed for this purpose. How do you speak
      bold text aloud? How about your inline image?
    </p>
    <h3>Some clients can&#39;t display HTML emails at all</h3>
    <p>
      Some email clients don&#39;t support HTML emails at all. Many email clients
      are designed to run in text-only environments, like a terminal emulator,
      where they&#39;re useful to people who spend a lot of time working in these
      environments. In a text-only interface it&#39;s not possible to render an HTML
      email, and instead the reader will just see a mess of raw HTML text. A lot
      of people simply send HTML emails directly to spam for this reason.
    </p>
    <h3>Rich text isn&#39;t that great, anyway</h3>
    <p>
      Rich text features desirable for end users include things like inline
      images, bold or italicized text, and so on. However, the tradeoff isn&#39;t
      worth it. Images can simply be attached to your email, and you can employ
      things like *asterisks*, /slashes/, _underscores_, or UPPERCASE for
      emphasis. You can still communicate your point effectively without
      bringing along all of the bad things HTML emails come with.

      Recommendations for software which sends emails
    </a></h2>
    <p>
      Thanks for your interest in making plain text emails more accessible to
      your users!
    </p>
    <h3>For senders of automated emails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you must use HTML, send a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME" rel="noopener nofollow">multipart/alternative</a>
        email with both a plain text and HTML version included. Your programming
        language probably includes tools for creating these kinds of emails.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For senders of user-authored emails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allow users to compose emails in plain text, and consider making this
        the default. When the user composes a message in plain text, send a
        text/plain email instead of a multipart/alternative email with a
        generated HTML part.
      </li>
      <li>
        When composing a plain text email, hard-wrap their lines at 72 columns by
        inserting newlines at the nearest word boundary. Optionally, use
        <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt" rel="noopener nofollow">format=flowed</a> instead to
        allow plain text emails to be displayed and composed without hard
        wrapping.
      </li>
      <li>
        When users reply to an email in plain text, don&#39;t encourage top-posting
        by leaving their cursor above the quoted message. Instead, add two
        newlines after the quoted message and leave their cursor there. Allow
        the user to edit the quoted message. Quote each line of the original
        message with &gt; and a single space, followed by the quote.
      </li>
      <li>
        When users send an HTML email explicitly, convert it to text/plain and
        send a multipart/alternative email which includes both versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        When displaying multipart/alternative emails, give the user the option to prefer
        to view the plain text part by default.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Email clients which meet all of these criteria and prefer plain text by
      default are entitled to a spot on our recommended clients list.
