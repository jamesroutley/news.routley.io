<p>Short answer: no, Soundcore Motion+ sounds the same via bluetooth and aux-in.</p>
<p>Today I noticed that my awesome bluetooth speaker <a href="https://www.soundcore.com/products/a3116011" target="_blank">Anker Soundcore Motion+</a> sounds kind of shitty. There is an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanwing.soundcore" target="_blank">Android app</a> by Anker Soundcore with EQ settings and some EQ presets. I connected my phone to the speaker and the app showed that the preset &#34;Bass Off&#34; is turned on:</p>
<p>It was easy to check if the EQ settings affect playback via aux-in - I set the bass frequencies (80, 150, 300 Hz) to the maximum and everything else to the minimum and checked if the music would become very low-heavy when played from my laptop - it did. I reverted the EQ settings to the custom setup shown in the screenshot above and decided to compare the sound via bluetooth from my phone and via aux-in from my laptop. I connected Motion+ to my laptop and also connected it to my phone via bluetooth, at the same time. I would then turn on the same part of the same version of the same song &#34;Levitating&#34; on my phone and on my laptop in order and compare using my ears. I felt like it sounded a little better when played from my phone, but I wasn&#39;t sure and suspected that it might be a placebo-like effect - finding signal when in fact there is none. In particular, I felt like some high-pitched drum kit sounds were more pronounced when played from one device than from the other but I wasn&#39;t sure about this. I decided that doing some objective measurements is in order.</p>
<p>When a professional reviewer posts a review of a speaker or a headset, they usually produce a frequency response plot like this:</p>
<p>So, how did I measure the frequency response? I googled &#34;sine sweep&#34; and found this website: <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_sinesweep20-20k.php" target="_blank">https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_sinesweep20-20k.php</a>. It offers an audio file download under &#34;The sound files - Logarithmic (20Hz-20kHz, -3dBFS, 20s)&#34; (<a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/Audio/audiocheck.net_sweep20-20klog.ogg" target="_blank">Direct link</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210721100035/https://www.audiocheck.net/Audio/audiocheck.net_sweep20-20klog.ogg" target="_blank">Internet Archive link</a>). This file plays a single sine wave, with frequency going up from 20 Hz to 20 kHz logarithmically. So, I played it from my laptop via aux-in with Spectroid open on my phone and got the following plot:</p>
<p>I eyeballed the two (red) plots and I think they look more or less identical. So I guess there is actually no difference in sound and I just imagined it. I might&#39;ve thought that the sound from aux-in was worse because in the mornings loud sounds are sometimes unpleasant for me, but this goes away further into the day.</p>
