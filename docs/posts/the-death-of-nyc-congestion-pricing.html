Thus New York’s public transit policy is fundamentally America’s public transit policy—and NYC’s urban development is in many ways America’s urban development.</span></p><p><span>That’s why it was so important when </span><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/mta-pauses-new-york-city-congestion-pricing-plans-indefinitely/5479563/" rel="">earlier this month</a><span>, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced that America’s first congestion pricing scheme would be “indefinitely paused”. The policy would have charged vehicles for entering the perpetually gridlocked streets of Lower Manhattan, using the money raised to then fund many of the city’s transit projects—and it was slated to officially begin operating less than 30 days from the announcement. In the short term, the flip-flop will be extremely costly for the city and state, but more broadly the cancellation and the dynamics that led up to it are emblematic of many of the problems holding back American cities &amp; infrastructure.</span></p><p><span>In one sense, the congestion pricing scheme is a radical new experiment in American transportation policy. Cars compete for scarce urban road space with more efficient modes of transportation like buses, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/12uoj82/good_thing_there_are_no_people_in_the_congestion/" rel="">emit large amounts of noxious chemicals and particulate matter from tailpipes and tires</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/fatal-car-crash-statistics/" rel="">are the leading cause of death for Americans under 55</a><span>, and in large quantities become disruptively loud for workers and residents. Lower Manhattan is among the few places in America where substantial transit alternatives to driving exist, so a congestion tax should induce mode shifts away from cars and toward the subway—to the benefit of the local and global climate. Wealthier residents are more likely to drive and poorer residents more likely to take transit, so congestion pricing serves redistributive purposes as well. New York’s scheme promised to be a pioneering first for the nation, a pilot project that if successful could be copied in cities throughout the US.</span></p><p><span>Yet in another sense, the plan should be entirely unremarkable. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_Licensing_Scheme" rel="">Congestion pricing has existed in some form throughout cities across the world for 50 years</a><span>, and is fundamentally just a fancy version of the normal tolling systems that are common on bridges, tunnels, and other roadways. People who drove into Lower Manhattan were already “paying” for the privilege to do so, just with the time and gasoline lost to bumper-to-bumper traffic rather than in hard cash. As with any heavily overcrowded bridge or highway, mispricing was causing economic inefficiency—charging for entry would allow priority vehicles to get where they’re going faster, incentivize better use of existing roadways, and open up a funding stream that could be used to expand beyond current infrastructure constraints.

People were increasingly driving into the city and underutilizing transit infrastructure—thus congestion pricing, while initially envisioned for a pre-pandemic world, rapidly became a necessary part of plans for a post-COVID recovery. Taxing traffic, with all its negative externalities, was certainly much more politically palatable and economically beneficial than attempting to raise payroll taxes further, which would have strained New York’s already-slow post-COVID jobs recovery.

Contractors who work with the MTA on these projects already charge a premium for having to manage the substantial risk that construction is delayed or canceled—introducing “the Governor might suddenly decide your job is over” as another risk to worry about will just increase those cost premiums, thin the pool of companies who are capable of working with the MTA, and reward the politically savvy.</span></p><p>The fact that infrastructure plans can go through years of study, environmental review, public consultation, pilot projects, revisions, lawsuits, construction, delays, and more only to then be shelved days before final implementation is a large part of why public works are so expensive in the first place. The number of veto points for American infrastructure is extremely high—even one “no” across from any number of officials throughout construction can stop a project dead—and that veto power makes it easy to extract money and concessions from projects. Pick more costly construction methods to minimize surface disruption, reduce daily construction time to leave existing traffic unimpeded, move infrastructure to suboptimal locations to appease powerful voting constituencies, expand stations to meet interagency demands for back office space, and in the absolute worst cases just use discretionary powers to do quid-pro-quo corruption. Also, imagine if you were among the hundreds of state, local, and federal civil servants who worked on any part of the congestion pricing or MTA capital investment plans—would you want to remain at your job after having years of work tossed aside at the last minute? The hollowing out of institutional capacity within transportation agencies is a serious driver of cost problems, with planning becoming a bespoke project-by-project activity heavily dependent on expensive outside consultants rather than a regular in-house activity.</p><p><span>As a more practical matter, hundreds of millions were already (over)spent on congestion pricing between years of studies, protracted legal battles, construction of physical infrastructure, contracts for implementation, and much more—all that money is wasted by pulling the plug at the last possible second. The cancellation of congestion pricing without an alternative funding stream will hurt the MTA’s credit rating, </span><a href="https://x.com/ReinventAlbany/status/1800272448774144022" rel="">increase its debt-servicing expenses</a><span>, and functionally impose even more costs on New Yorkers. Before the congestion pricing cancellation, the MTA had actually made some rare positive efforts to control infrastructure construction costs, including </span><a href="https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/blog/mta-finds-savings-for-second-avenue-subway-phase-2" rel="">saving $1.3B in Phase II of the Second Avenue Subway project</a><span>, yet instead of building on that the Governor has decided to throw the entire infrastructure program into jeopardy.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png" width="1456" height="930" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:930,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:358926,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40a3da86-1f39-4893-b2d4-100d7540ea8a_2886x1843.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>America invests little into public transportation infrastructure by the standards of similarly-wealthy European and Asian countries (or even relative to Canada and Mexico). Pre-pandemic, it was normal for urban mass transit to receive only 6-9% of all state and local land transportation spending, and for bus and train passenger terminals to receive roughly another 3-5%. However, relative spending on both items has cratered post-COVID, with the share of construction spending going to mass transit falling to the lowest levels in a decade this year. Even when these investments are made, American cities struggle to make the best of new infrastructure.</p><p><span>Public transit is a network system that depends on scale to be successful—a two-line metro is more than twice as valuable as a 1-line metro, and a metro that goes between dense downtown neighborhoods is much more valuable than one that meanders through sprawly suburbs.
