Avalonia already has its own thriving ecosystem. We see strong, sustained growth in our community, so why invest this much effort into making MAUI run on top of Avalonia?</p><p>The honest answer is that we care about .NET client developers first, and about which on ramp they use second. Many teams have already chosen MAUI, which they like and want more from. If we can provide them with Linux and browser support, along with improved desktop performance, without requiring a rewrite, that aligns with our mission to delight developers and solve complex problems.</p><p>This is not entirely selfless. Building a MAUI backend is also a way for us to learn. Running MAUI on Avalonia highlights what is missing for Avalonia to feel completely natural on mobile, which APIs are problematic, which tooling gaps matter, and where we need to raise our game to stay competitive. The work we are doing here directly contributes to strengthening Avalonia.</p><p>There is also a long term benefit in familiarity. By using Avalonia as the backend for their existing MAUI apps, developers gain insight into our renderer, capabilities and way of thinking. Some of those teams will quite reasonably stay with MAUI. Others, when they start a new project or need something lower level, may build directly on Avalonia instead. If this backend becomes a bridge that brings more people into the Avalonia ecosystem over time, that is a win.</p><p>So this project is not about “saving” MAUI from other frameworks. It is about giving existing MAUI developers more headroom and additional platforms, learning from their needs, and ensuring Avalonia is an obvious, competitive choice for whatever they build next.</p><h2>Why This Matters for MAUI Developers</h2><p>If you have followed MAUI since its launch, you will know the two requests that never went away.</p><p>Developers want Linux support, both for desktop and for embedded devices. They also want a drawn control model that provides consistent behaviour across platforms, rather than relying on the native toolkit available on each system.</p><p>The Avalonia backend tackles both of those head on. Avalonia is a mature drawn UI framework.</p><p>It provides:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Hardware accelerated rendering on every platform</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>A consistent layout and styling system</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Smooth animations at high refresh rates</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Custom rendering and visual effects capabilities</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Broad platform coverage</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>A fully supported platform that is receiving significant investment</p></li></ul><p>These are not theoretical promises. They are the reasons Avalonia is used in production by companies such as Unity, JetBrains and Schneider Electric.</p><p>By building MAUI on top of Avalonia, you get a predictable, drawn UI foundation and an expanded set of platforms, without having to throw away your existing codebase. You do not need to abandon MAUI to get Linux and the web. You can bring MAUI with you, while also improving the experience on Windows and macOS.</p><h2>Performance and Next Generation Rendering</h2><p>Performance is an important part of this story.</p><p>A drawn, GPU friendly UI stack gives you more headroom than wrapping native toolkits.</p><p>We are collaborating with the Flutter team at Google to bring Impeller, their GPU first renderer, to .NET. That work is already in progress and as it lands, the MAUI backend will inherit those gains.</p><p>The aim is simple: faster rendering, lower battery usage and smoother animations across desktop, mobile and embedded, using the same underlying technology that is pushing Flutter forward.</p><p><!--$--><a href="https://avaloniaui.net/blog/avalonia-partners-with-google-s-flutter-t-eam-to-bring-impeller-rendering-to-net">Read more about our Impeller collaboration with Google →</a><!--/$--></p><h2>Looking Forward</h2><p>We are particularly grateful to the MAUI engineers who have shared feedback and ideas as we have developed this backend. The .NET client ecosystem is at its best when different teams can cross pollinate and push each other forward.</p><p>This is just the beginning. As Linux and browser support matures, MAUI can finally live up to its promise as a truly multi platform app UI. We will keep sharing previews, benchmarks and updates as development continues, and once we are happy with the stability of the backend we will release the source code as fully open source under the MIT licence.</p><p><!--$--><a href="https://avaloniaui.net/maui-interest"><strong>→ Register your interest in the early access ←</strong></a><!--/$--><strong></strong><br/></p></div></div><div><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>We are bringing .NET MAUI to Linux and to the browser, powered by Avalonia.</p><p>For the past few months, we have been working on an Avalonia powered backend for .NET MAUI, with guidance and feedback from engineers in the MAUI ecosystem.

That single target means we can move faster, ship features consistently, and avoid the need to endlessly fix platform-specific edge cases.</p><p><img alt="" width="1276" height="285" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/H4IFZdeFuwE4I7XSlLN5GlTBeZY.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/H4IFZdeFuwE4I7XSlLN5GlTBeZY.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=2552&amp;height=571 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/H4IFZdeFuwE4I7XSlLN5GlTBeZY.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=2552&amp;height=571 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/H4IFZdeFuwE4I7XSlLN5GlTBeZY.png?scale-down-to=2048&amp;width=2552&amp;height=571 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/H4IFZdeFuwE4I7XSlLN5GlTBeZY.png?width=2552&amp;height=571 2552w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1400px) 100vw, (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1399.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 799.98px) 100vw"/></p><h2>Why Is Avalonia Building a Backend for MAUI?</h2><p>It is a fair question. Avalonia already has its own thriving ecosystem. We see strong, sustained growth in our community, so why invest this much effort into making MAUI run on top of Avalonia?</p><p>The honest answer is that we care about .NET client developers first, and about which on ramp they use second. Many teams have already chosen MAUI, which they like and want more from. If we can provide them with Linux and browser support, along with improved desktop performance, without requiring a rewrite, that aligns with our mission to delight developers and solve complex problems.</p><p>This is not entirely selfless. Building a MAUI backend is also a way for us to learn. Running MAUI on Avalonia highlights what is missing for Avalonia to feel completely natural on mobile, which APIs are problematic, which tooling gaps matter, and where we need to raise our game to stay competitive. The work we are doing here directly contributes to strengthening Avalonia.</p><p>There is also a long term benefit in familiarity. By using Avalonia as the backend for their existing MAUI apps, developers gain insight into our renderer, capabilities and way of thinking. Some of those teams will quite reasonably stay with MAUI. Others, when they start a new project or need something lower level, may build directly on Avalonia instead. If this backend becomes a bridge that brings more people into the Avalonia ecosystem over time, that is a win.</p><p>So this project is not about “saving” MAUI from other frameworks. It is about giving existing MAUI developers more headroom and additional platforms, learning from their needs, and ensuring Avalonia is an obvious, competitive choice for whatever they build next.</p><h2>Why This Matters for MAUI Developers</h2><p>If you have followed MAUI since its launch, you will know the two requests that never went away.</p><p>Developers want Linux support, both for desktop and for embedded devices. They also want a drawn control model that provides consistent behaviour across platforms, rather than relying on the native toolkit available on each system.</p><p>The Avalonia backend tackles both of those head on. Avalonia is a mature drawn UI framework.</p><p>It provides:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Hardware accelerated rendering on every platform</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>A consistent layout and styling system</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Smooth animations at high refresh rates</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Custom rendering and visual effects capabilities</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Broad platform coverage</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>A fully supported platform that is receiving significant investment</p></li></ul><p>These are not theoretical promises. They are the reasons Avalonia is used in production by companies such as Unity, JetBrains and Schneider Electric.</p><p>By building MAUI on top of Avalonia, you get a predictable, drawn UI foundation and an expanded set of platforms, without having to throw away your existing codebase. You do not need to abandon MAUI to get Linux and the web. You can bring MAUI with you, while also improving the experience on Windows and macOS.</p><h2>Performance and Next Generation Rendering</h2><p>Performance is an important part of this story.</p><p>A drawn, GPU friendly UI stack gives you more headroom than wrapping native toolkits.</p><p>We are collaborating with the Flutter team at Google to bring Impeller, their GPU first renderer, to .NET. That work is already in progress and as it lands, the MAUI backend will inherit those gains.</p><p>The aim is simple: faster rendering, lower battery usage and smoother animations across desktop, mobile and embedded, using the same underlying technology that is pushing Flutter forward.</p><p><!--$--><a href="https://avaloniaui.net/blog/avalonia-partners-with-google-s-flutter-t-eam-to-bring-impeller-rendering-to-net">Read more about our Impeller collaboration with Google →</a><!--/$--></p><h2>Looking Forward</h2><p>We are particularly grateful to the MAUI engineers who have shared feedback and ideas as we have developed this backend. The .NET client ecosystem is at its best when different teams can cross pollinate and push each other forward.</p><p>This is just the beginning. As Linux and browser support matures, MAUI can finally live up to its promise as a truly multi platform app UI. We will keep sharing previews, benchmarks and updates as development continues, and once we are happy with the stability of the backend we will release the source code as fully open source under the MIT licence.</p><p><!--$--><a href="https://avaloniaui.net/maui-interest"><strong>→ Register your interest in the early access ←</strong></a><!--/$--><strong></strong><br/></p></div></div></div></div>
