    <h1>Pages that didn&#39;t make it into &#34;How DNS Works&#34;</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! A couple weeks ago I released a new zine called <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/">How DNS Works</a>.</p>

<p>When I started writing that zine (in, uh, January 2021), I originally had in
mind a broader zine on &ldquo;everything you need to know to own a domain&rdquo;. So it had
a bunch of pages on domain registration, TLS, and email.</p>

<p>At the time I thought &ldquo;I can just explain DNS in like 5 pages, it&rsquo;s not
that complicated, there will be lots of space for other topics about domains&rdquo;.
I was extremely wrong about that and it turned out I needed all 28 pages to
explain DNS. So I ended up deciding to just focus the zine on DNS and all those
other topics didn&rsquo;t make it into the final zine.</p>

<p>This morning it occurred to me that instead of letting all of the old draft
pages languish in purgatory on my hard drive, I could post those extra pages
here all together on my blog. So here they are!</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer-not-super-cohesive">disclaimer: not super cohesive</h3>

<p>I will say (as a disclaimer) that these pages aren&rsquo;t as cohesive as I usually
like my zines to be and they definitely do not tell you everything you need to
need to know to own a domain.</p>

<h3 id="domain-registration">domain registration</h3>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/buying-domain.png">

<h3 id="email">email</h3>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/receiving-email.png">
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/sending-email.png">
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/spf-dkim.png"></p>

<p>I should say that these 3 pages don&rsquo;t really do email justice &ndash; email security
is a HUGE topic that honestly I don&rsquo;t know a lot about.</p>

<h3 id="tls">TLS</h3>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/why-tls-matters.png">
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/tls-certificates.png"></p>

<p>These two pages also don&rsquo;t remotely cover TLS, it&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;ll write more in
depth about TLS at some point. Who knows!</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>

<p>though I will say: if you liked these, you might be interested in buying <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/">How DNS Works</a> :)</p>
