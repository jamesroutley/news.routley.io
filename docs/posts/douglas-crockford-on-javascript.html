    <h1>Douglas Crockford on JavaScript</h1>

                        <h2>Crockford on JavaScript</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5Np9OqDHU" target="_blank">this short video</a>, Douglas Crockford argues that it’s time for the software industry to move on from JavaScript.</p>
<p><img alt="Douglas Crockford in an interview with the transcript caption “we should stop using JavaScript.”" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/3705507f-e09f-41fd-a003-c913fc9cc93b.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"/> </p>
<p>The message is notable coming from Crockford. His 2008 book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> was among the first to champion the idea that JavaScript can, with some self-restraint, be used to engineer maintainable applications. (He also created <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON</a>.)</p>
<p>In the video, Crockford’s message is that as an industry, we’ve fallen into a trap of incrementalism and complacency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It used to be that we’d get new computer languages about every generation. […] And then it kind of stopped. There are still people developing languages, but nobody cares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crockford’s core gripe, if I can paraphrase it, is that we are crushing ourselves with the accumulated complexity we’ve piled on top of bad foundations, and it’s hindering our ability to build.</p>
<p>In my view it’s not that we’ve stopped caring, but that the web as a platform <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/all-software-is-web-software" target="_blank">has eaten up</a> other platforms faster than other languages have become viable <em>within</em> the web platform.</p>
<p>The movement of application software onto the web as a platform might end up being the sort of generational inflection point that catapults us past JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>That’s not to say that JavaScript is going away.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the best programming language for a given program depends on where the complexity in the program lies.</p>
<p>In browser-based applications, the complexity has traditionally been in managing UI state. Modern JavaScript is decent enough at this that languages focused on addressing UI complexity like <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm</a>, <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a>, and <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" target="_blank">ReScript</a> are relegated to “cult favorite” status.</p>
<p>But as increasingly complex software targets the browser, developers are wrangling codebases where UI is <em>not</em> the dominant source of complexity, like CAD tools and scientific data visualization.</p>
<p>It’s these developers who start to hit walls with JavaScript’s fundamental design, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>. Although modern JavaScript interpreters go to great lengths to run unoptimized code impressively fast, the language itself doesn’t give developers many levers for optimizing hot-path code.</li>
<li><strong>Object lifecycle management</strong>. Creating objects that manage non-memory resources becomes a tangled mess of destructor callbacks, because the language lacks the features that would enable the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization" target="_blank">RAII pattern</a> common in C++ and Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Limited standard library</strong>. JavaScript has only a handful of built-in data structures. When working on something where asymptotic complexity matters, it’s a hurdle not to have  canonical implementations of standard CS 101 collections like queues and ordered maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, none of these are walls you’ll hit if you’re writing a blog or e-commerce site, which is why JavaScript isn’t going away. But <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/bull-case-for-rust-on-web" target="_blank">I don’t take it as a given</a> that just because browsers are becoming the dominant platform for applications, JavaScript will be the dominant language for complex application software.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p><strong>I wrote a <a href="https://www.latent.space/i/125082085/recap-what-aiux-hackers-are-building-in-nyc" target="_blank">guest post</a></strong> over at Latent Space recapping our AI×UX event a few weeks back.</p>
<p><strong>As announced</strong> yesterday <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank">by Apple</a>, Mac users will be able to add web apps directly to their dock from Safari. When launched from the dock, apps have a more native-feeling UI, with all browser chrome hidden except the forward/back buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Wasmer <a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wasix" target="_blank">announced WASIX</a></strong>, which extends standard WASI for more coverage of POSIX, including Berkeley sockets and threads.</p>
<p><strong>Felt <a href="https://felt.com/blog/svg-to-canvas-part-2-building-interactions" target="_blank">blogged about</a></strong> how they replaced DOM-based event propagation with their own event handling when they switched from SVG to canvas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dylibso.com/blog/wasm-udf/" target="_blank">WebAssembly is eating the database</a></strong> one UDF at a time, according to dylibso’s blog. Dominique and Steve wrote about Wasm’s potential as a polyglot UDF runtime for databases.</p>
<p><strong>This <a href="https://cohost.org/tef/post/1601060-restful-is-antimemet" target="_blank">rant about REST</a></strong> is a bit into the weeds but I found it cathartic and you might too.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
