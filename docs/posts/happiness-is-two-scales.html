            <p>The common way to talk about happiness is as a single scale: unhappy at one end, neutral in the middle, happy at the other end. </p><p>I think that model is wrong.</p><p>Instead, happiness and unhappiness are two separate, independent scales.[^1] A good life requires tackling each one separately.</p><p>This dramatically changes how you deal with various life-problems. If someone (including yourself) is struggling with low well-being, it&#39;s important to ascertain which of two problems are happening:</p><ul><li>not enough happiness </li><li>too much unhappiness</li></ul><p>If someone has a lot of unhappiness, they need to get rid of some negative influence in their life. If they don&#39;t have enough happiness, they need to add something positive to their life.</p><p>What are the actual, actionable upshots of this?</p><p>First, a lot of the best changes in your life can end up feeling weirdly neutral in the longer-term: they get rid of something really negative, but the lack-of-negative doesn&#39;t actually create a positive, and over time you forget what it was like to live with the negative every day. Removing unhappiness doesn&#39;t actually increase happiness, it just.... removes unhappiness, which is good but unrelated.</p><p>Another consequence is that you can have any combination of happiness and unhappiness. For example, you can be very happy and very unhappy at once: this often seems to be true for people who are running stressful but autonomous projects (startups, non-profits, artistic projects, whatever).</p><p>Equally, you can feel not-at-all-happy but also not-at-all-unhappy. It&#39;s a strange kind of feeling, and very distinct from (say) &#34;moderately happy and also slightly unhappy&#34;, or &#34;very happy and also very unhappy.&#34; [Edit: <a href="https://thewhippet.org/153-shake-off-shackles-of-the-page/#happiness-and-unhappiness-are-two-separate-scales">McKinley Valentine says</a> this is called anhedonia, and writes about it].</p><p>The single-scale model tries to squash all these different feelings onto a single line, and that just doesn&#39;t work. Happiness and unhappiness are two separate, independent variables.</p><hr/><p>[^1]: this sentence either will or won&#39;t make sense to you: In the Big Five system, positive emotion is extroversion and negative emotion is neuroticism. They are uncorrelated. Neither word means the same as its everyday-language meaning.</p><hr/><p>With thanks as always to <a href="https://www.atvbt.com/author/jehan/">Jehan</a> and <a href="https://kaamyasharma.net/">Kaamya</a>.</p>
