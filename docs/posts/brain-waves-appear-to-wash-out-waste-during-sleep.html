            <p>Many important cellular functions occur during sleep, including the brain’s removal of waste and toxins. However, researchers previously lacked an understanding of the mechanisms behind this complex process. Now, research involving mice <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07108-6">recently published</a> in <i>Nature</i> suggests that brain waves are responsible for the self-cleansing.</p>            <p>Researchers observed neurons in the brains of sleeping mice. As neurons fired electrical signals, they acted as coordinated pumps, producing rhythmic waves that appeared to flush cerebrospinal fluid through brain tissue, washing out waste. After the researchers silenced certain areas of the brain to stop the waves, cerebrospinal fluid lost the ability to flow, leaving detritus in place.</p>            <p>First author Li-Feng Jiang-Xie, PhD, of the Washington University School of Medicine, noted in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1035658">press release</a> that this knowledge has potential implications for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, in which the accumulation of metabolic waste and “junk proteins” can lead to neurodegeneration.</p>
