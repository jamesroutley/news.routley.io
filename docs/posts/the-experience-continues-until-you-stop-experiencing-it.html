In private journals later acquired by the Museum of Digital Art, he writes: “The collapse of the USSR has demonstrated that entire realities can dissolve.

Critics and audiences are sharply divided: former participants in Popov’s original experience largely criticize the film for “domesticating” what was a raw and boundary-dissolving event, with one writing, “What was once a descent into the core questions of consciousness and identity has become merely another low-budget thriller with art-house pretensions.”</span></p> <p><span>Several former “Safe Space” participants organize a public protest at the film’s Los Angeles premiere, distributing pamphlets that read: “You Are Not Experiencing Safe Space. You Are Watching Its Corpse.” The protest gains media attention when attendees report that the pamphlets contain QR codes leading to disturbing audio files that some speculate may have been provided by Popov himself, though he neither confirms nor denies involvement.</span></p> <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> <div><figure> <picture data-loaded="false"><source data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere.png" media="(min-width: 1000px)"/> <source data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere-1024x717.png, https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere.png 2x" media="(min-width: 400px)"/> <img src="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere-50x35.png" data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere-512x358.png, https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-premiere-1024x717.png 2x" alt="Safe Space premiere in Los Angeles." width="1280" height="896"/> </picture> </figure></div> </section> <section id=""><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h3>2024</h3> <p>Popov emerges from his characteristic silence to initiate legal proceedings against Strange Machine, the distribution company behind “Safe Space.” The lawsuit presents a complex paradox: while claiming copyright infringement on the title and concept, Popov simultaneously argues that the film is “an unauthorized extension of an ongoing artistic work” rather than a separate creative product. In a rare public statement, Popov writes: “The boundaries of an experience are defined by its creator. To claim continuation without permission is to misunderstand the nature of the work.”</p> <p>The legal dispute intensifies when Strange Machine counters that, according to Popov’s own artistic philosophy as outlined in “The Architecture of Experience,” the participant becomes co-creator of the experience. They cite Popov’s 2017 statement that “The experience continues until you stop experiencing it” as evidence that Kubicki’s film is a legitimate outgrowth of his participation. They further allege that mysterious packages and communications received by Kubicki between 2016-2021 constitute Popov’s tacit authorization of the project.</p> <p>The case attracts significant attention in both legal and artistic circles, raising unprecedented questions about the ownership of experiential art, the boundaries of intellectual property, and the nature of consent in immersive experiences. Several former participants in Popov’s works come forward with claims that they too have been “continuing the experience” through various means, suggesting a larger pattern of designed aftermath.</p> <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> <div><figure> <picture data-loaded="false"><source data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster.png" media="(min-width: 1000px)"/> <source data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster-691x1024.png, https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster.png 2x" media="(min-width: 400px)"/> <img src="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster-34x50.png" data-srcset="https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster-346x512.png, https://static.strangemachine.tv/safe-space-movie-poster-691x1024.png 2x" alt="Safe Space film poster." width="1024" height="1517"/> </picture> </figure></div> </section> <section id=""><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h3>2025-</h3> <p><span>Despite the ongoing legal battle, Popov continues to develop new works from his desert compound.
