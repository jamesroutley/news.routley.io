    <h1>Tell HN: DigitalRiver/MyCommerce stopped paying vendors since July</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We&#39;re a small family company and the $20k MyCommerce owes us is a big deal.</p><p>For those who don&#39;t know MyCommerce is a platform for selling software online. They&#39;re merchant of record, they handle taxes, generate license keys, etc so they&#39;re a bit higher level than Stripe or PayPal. We&#39;re with them since 2005. Things started going south in August. July payment was due on August 15 but never came. Few days afterwards they sent and email that they&#39;re changing contract terms and that payments will now be sent 60 days instead of 15 days after the month. Sadly, I didn&#39;t switch to another payment processor immediately that day - accountants were on holiday, we were investigating our options, and we were generally happy for 20 years with them. We switched only in September, where they worsened contract terms even more, introducing monthly fee, hourly fee for support, increased payment thresholds, etc. By the time we switched, MyCommerce already sat on entire revenue from July, August, and half of September. Their support is not helpful.</p><p>This is not only about us, it&#39;s about myriad other vendors, mostly small ones. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t have online space to share our findings and experiences. I only found today that it was discussed on kvraudio forum, and a bit on LinkedIn. There are many small vendors who are now in a hole for tens of thousands of dollars/euros.</p><p>It looks pretty much that MyCommerce / DigitarRiver Gmbh are in financial trouble. There are news of layoffs and new management. It&#39;s questionable whether we&#39;ll see any of our money and when. But the troubling part is MyCommerce still operates and takes orders. If there are vendors who still only know about what MyCommerce officially told them and wait for delayed payments - please reconsider your position.</p><p><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=612462" rel="nofollow">https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=612462</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=614929&amp;start=30" rel="nofollow">https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=614929&amp;start=...</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lorant-barla_mycommerce-digitalriver-contracts-activity-7244193845607878657-iS4S/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lorant-barla_mycommerce-digit...</a></p></div></div></div>
