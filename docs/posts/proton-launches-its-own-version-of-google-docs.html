    <h1>Proton launches its own version of Google Docs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/protons-windows-and-macos-mail-app-is-out-of-beta-and-available-now-110010822.html" data-ylk="slk:Proton;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Proton</a> now has its own version of Google Docs in its Drive cloud storage service, and like the company&#39;s other products, it comes with end-to-end encryption. The company says its flavor of Docs &#34;offers a unique solution in a market where most popular products neglect privacy&#34; and recommends it for use in the healthcare, media, finance and legal industries. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb3Rvbi5tZS9ibG9nL2RvY3MtcHJvdG9uLWRyaXZlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMmYyMGEyYS05ZGEzLTQyZmMtYjhmMC03MGI3ZDRlMGFhNmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWZaQ6nJO7zP4rH3JS2Y44qB7q_HbbOpt8RRVvU6nYbn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fproton.me%2Fblog%2Fdocs-proton-drive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Proton Docs;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Proton Docs</a> has advanced formatting and image embed options like Google Docs has and can create, open and edit documents in multiple formats, including Microsoft .docx.</p><p>It has collaboration tools similar to Google Docs&#39;, as well. Users can invite anyone to view and edit their documents, though those without a Proton account will be prompted to create one first. The free tier of Proton Drive includes essential document features so people don&#39;t have to pay for the service if they don&#39;t want to. Participants will be able to add comments to the document, reply to them and resolve them. And users will see other participants&#39; presence and their cursor placements in real time, so that they know who&#39;s working on which part of the document and so that their edits don&#39;t clash.</p><p>Proton didn&#39;t say whether the launch of Docs means it&#39;s going to roll out analogues of Google&#39;s other Workspace apps in the future, but the company did <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/proton-encrypted-email-vpn-calendar-rebrand-103024950.html" data-ylk="slk:expand its offerings;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">expand its offerings</a> with several different products over the last few years. In addition to Drive cloud storage — and, of course, its email service — the company has a VPN, an encrypted calendar and even a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/proton-launches-its-own-password-manager-115039870.html" data-ylk="slk:password manager;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">password manager</a>. Docs will make its way to Proton users over the coming days.</p><p>This article contains affiliate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission.</p></div></div>
