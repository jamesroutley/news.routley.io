                            <p>Astonishingly good, avoiding all of the traps that feminist writing of this era tends to fall into, and providing a excellent history of the &#34;professionalization&#34; (masculinization) of medicine in the United States.</p>
<p>This book does a excellent job of looking at the interlocking systems of gender, class, and race, and provides a essentially anarchist view of what &#34;professionalization&#34; means and how it operates — focusing on the medical context, but much more broadly applicable. The discussion of Nightingale nursing in particular was excellent — laying bare the class implications of it is a very different history than what I&#39;m used to.</p>
<p>I wish there were more historical sources for some of the claims about witches in particular — while everything they say seems plausible, I would prefer to know thier primary sources.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>
