  <h3 id="simbricks-full-system-simulation-for-heterogeneous-systems">SimBricks: Full-System Simulation for Heterogeneous Systems</h3>
  <p>SimBricks is an open-source simulation framework that enables full end-to-end
evaluation of modern heterogeneous systems in simulation. Our primary aim is to
enable rapid prototyping and meaningful performance evaluation. SimBricks
modularly combines and connects battle-tested simulators for different
components: machines (e.g. QEMU, gem5, Simics), hardware components (e.g.
Verilator, Tofino, FEMU SSD), and networks (e.g. ns-3, OMNeT++). SimBricks
simulations run unmodified full system stacks, including applications, operating
systems such as Linux, and hardware RTL.</p>

  <h3 id="late-full-system-evaluation-slows-development-and-increases-risk">Late Full-System Evaluation Slows Development and Increases Risk</h3>
  <p>Heterogeneous hardware-software systems are complex, slow, and expensive to
build, in academia and industry alike. These systems aim to drastically improve
performance and energy efficiency of the <em>complete</em> system or application.
However, engineers can only measure overall system performance once all software
and hardware components have been implemented and manufactured. As a result, key
metrics for evaluating design and implementation are only available late in the
project lifecycle, once a physical testbed can actually be fully built.</p>

  <h3 id="early--continuous-full-system-results-accelerate-building-heterogeneous-systems">Early &amp; Continuous Full-System Results Accelerate Building Heterogeneous Systems</h3>

  <p>Enabling developers to run and measure the full system early speeds up and
reduces risks for building heterogeneous systems. Developers can choose optimal
design parameters before implementation based on reliable metrics. Full-system
integration tests reduce the need for extensive hardware testbenches that merely
emulate the real behavior. And once the hardware implementation is complete, a
reliable full-system performance evaluation before manufacturing provides early
feedback to developers, reviewers, and customers.</p>

  <h3 id="modular-simulation-enables-early-and-continuous-evaluation">Modular Simulation Enables Early and Continuous Evaluation</h3>

  <p>Simulation generally enables early evaluation when a physical implementation is
out of reach. However, typical heterogeneous systems require a broad range of
components not supported by any individual simulator. To address this, we take a
modular approach of combining different best-of-breed simulators for the
individual components. We flexibly connect and synchronize multiple parallel
instances of these simulators into a broad range of complete, <em>end-to-end</em>
virtual testbeds.</p>

        and connect to a PCIe behavioral NIC model. All three hosts are
        connected through a network simulated in ns-3."/>

    <h2>Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Open &amp; modular architecture</h3>
        SimBricks defines fixed, natural component interfaces to enable flexible
        modular composition of simulators to run a broad range of
        heterogeneous systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Accurate &amp; efficient synchronization</h3>
        SimBricks ensures accurate simulation through correct time
        synchronization, but with minimal runtime overhead even for systems with
        many components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Loose coupling for easy integration</h3>
        SimBricks component simulators run as separate processes that
        communicate through message passing, enabling integration of simulators
        using arbitrary languages and simulation models.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Parallel execution for fast simulation</h3>
        SimBricks runs simulators in parallel on different host cores and
        connects them through optimized shared-memory queues; proxy process
        enable scaling out across machines.
