      <span>Abstract:</span>  Class invariants -- consistency constraints preserved by every operation on
objects of a given type -- are fundamental to building, understanding and
verifying object-oriented programs. For verification, however, they raise
difficulties, which have not yet received a generally accepted solution. The
present work introduces a proof rule meant to address these issues and allow
verification tools to benefit from invariants. It clarifies the notion of
invariant and identifies the three associated problems: callbacks, furtive
access and reference leak. As an example, the 2016 Ethereum DAO bug, in which
$50 million were stolen, resulted from a callback invalidating an invariant.
