(Colors in the infrared range are not visible to people because <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/james-webb-space-telescope-first-color-photo-rcna37584" target="_blank">infrared light</a> has longer wavelengths than the eye can detect.)</p><p>Using a technique called spectroscopy, scientists can split the infrared<strong> </strong>light from stars and galaxies into different colors, similar to how sunlight hitting a prism separates into a rainbow of visible hues. An object’s spectra can reveal many useful characteristics, including its composition, density, temperature and motion.</p><p>The SPHEREx observatory will use its spectrometers to survey the sky in three dimensions and measure these characteristics in hundreds of millions of galaxies, said Jamie Bock, principal investigator of the SPHEREx mission and a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. </p><p>Bock said these observations could unlock answers about galaxy formation and enable the observatory to investigate the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/how-did-earth-get-its-water-scientists-think-they-ve-ncna1011441" target="_blank">origin of water</a> and other organic materials in our Milky Way galaxy.</p><p>“In splitting up the light, we can use that to determine the distance to galaxies, to build up that three-dimensional map, and we also see the fingerprints of water,” Bock said.</p><p>Tracing the origins of water could not only help scientists figure out how life evolved on Earth; the work might also yield clues about where key ingredients for life may be found elsewhere in our galaxy.</p><p>“This is a new capability, and with any new capability comes the potential for discoveries and surprises,” Bock said.</p><p>In charting the celestial sky, the SPHEREx mission will also tackle one of astronomy’s most enduring mysteries: What happened in the first moments after the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/" target="_blank">Big Bang that created the universe</a> around 13.8 billion years ago.</p><p>One theory, proposed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, suggests the universe underwent a remarkable trillion-trillion-fold<strong> </strong>expansion in the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang. The theory, known as cosmic inflation, has been used to explain the universe’s flat geometry and lack of curvature, and as a possible reason for how some of the largest structures in the universe — galaxies and clusters of galaxies, for instance — came to be.</p><p>But astronomers have long struggled to piece together what drove cosmic inflation or why it happened in the first place. The SPHEREx mission could test the theory in new ways, since determining the precise distribution of hundreds of millions of galaxies would help scientists hone in on the physics of cosmic inflation and how such a rapid expansion may have occurred.</p><p>“What SPHEREx will do will test certain models of inflation by tracing out in three dimensions hundreds of millions of galaxies over the entire sky,” Brock said. </p><p>Domagal-Goldman said the SPHEREx mission’s study of galaxies, cosmic inflation and the origins of the universe could advance humanity’s understanding of fundamental physics.</p><p>“We’re very privileged in the long story of the human existence on this planet to live at a time where we can actually answer questions about the universe,” he said.</p></div><div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/denise-chow-ncpn814621" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/denise-chow-ncpn814621">Denise Chow</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/denisechow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:denise.chow@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Denise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Dennis Romero</p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>
