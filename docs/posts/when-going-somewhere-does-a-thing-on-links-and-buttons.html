    <h1>When going somewhere does a thing: on links and buttons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>When going somewhere does a thing: on links and buttons</h2><p>At the Fronteers conference, <a href="https://www.matuzo.at">Manuel</a> during his presentation did an exercise on building HTML that seemed fairly straightforward. On the <a href="https://mxb.dev">site of Max Böck</a> there&#39;s a <em>thing</em> you can click to open up a theme selector. What&#39;s that thing?<span id="more-3042"></span></p><p>Of course, it&#39;s a button! Because it opens the theme selector at the top of the page. <em>It does something!</em> Add an aria-expanded to the button, make sure focus is set and you&#39;re good to go. It&#39;s <em>obviously</em> a button.</p><p>But what if it&#39;s not?</p><p>After Manuels excellent talk I was discussing this with a group of folks and I was adamant that it obviously was <em>a button</em> because it clearly <em>opened a thing</em> but… I didn&#39;t have a great argument for why it also couldn&#39;t also be a link. After all, all the arguments for a link are pretty sound. It stuck with me and in this article I want to explore both.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-links-and-buttons">When to use links and buttons</h2><p>The &#34;common&#34; logic for when to use links or buttons is as follows:</p><ol><li>If it goes somewhere, it&#39;s a link.</li><li>If it does something, it&#39;s a button.</li></ol><p>But if you ask me, those two things aren’t always mutually exclusive. I&#39;ll give implementation examples of both that I think are fine.</p><h2 id="what-were-building">What we&#39;re building</h2><p>The functionality we&#39;re building is the following: The top right button on <a href="https://mxb.dev">mxb.dev</a> opens a theme selector at the top of the page, and the theme selector has a close button that closes it again. That&#39;s it. Here&#39;s a video:</p><h2 id="using-a-button">Using a button</h2><p>This is the example Manuel gave and it&#39;s essentially the same as what I wrote in <a href="https://polypane.app/blog/the-perfect-responsive-menu/">The perfect responsive menu</a>.</p><p>The button looks like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;button aria-expanded=&#34;false&#34; aria-controls=&#34;theme-selector&#34;&gt;
    Open Theme Selector
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>and the theme selector looks like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;div id=&#34;theme-selector&#34; hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  … pretend there&#39;s a theme controller here
  &lt;button aria-expanded=&#34;false&#34; aria-controls=&#34;theme-selector&#34;&gt;
    Close
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>Then when clicking the button, using javascript, the <code>hidden</code> attribute of <code>theme-selector</code> is removed, the <code>aria-expanded</code> of the button is set to true, the JS moves the focus to the theme selector and then adds some CSS makes the theme selector appear (in the live implementation it&#39;s using an additional class, but you could also use the <code>[hidden]</code> attribute being there or not instead).</p><p>In the theme selector, we have a close button that does the same in reverse.</p><p>Here&#39;s how it works in a codepen:</p><p data-height="300" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="jOxKbBx" data-user="Kilian"> <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Kilian/pen/jOxKbBx"></a> by Kilian Valkhof (<a href="https://codepen.io/Kilian">@Kilian</a>)</span></p><h2 id="using-a-link">Using a link</h2><p>Okay, here we go. Why this can be a link: Links <em>go somewhere</em>, including different parts of the same page. So we can add a link that goes to <code>#theme-selector</code>:</p><pre><code>&lt;a href=&#34;#theme-selector&#34; id=&#34;theme-selector-controller&#34;&gt;
    Open Theme Selector
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><p>Using the <code>:target</code> pseudo-class, we can make the theme controller appear after clicking the link:</p><pre><code>#theme-selector:target {
  display: block;
}
</code></pre><p>This will make the theme selector stay open while we interact with it. Inside <code>#theme-selector</code> we add a second link that links back to our original button:</p><pre><code>&lt;a href=&#34;#theme-selector-controller&#34;&gt;
    Close Theme Selector
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><p>After clicking that, the <code>#theme-selector</code> no longer matches the target, so it&#39;s hidden again. You can see it in action here:</p><p data-height="300" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="wvjXKmp" data-user="Kilian"> <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Kilian/pen/wvjXKmp"></a> by Kilian Valkhof (<a href="https://codepen.io/Kilian">@Kilian</a>)</span></p><h3 id="whats-wrong-with-the-link-solution">What&#39;s wrong with the link solution?</h3><p>The browser gives us all the building block for a link solution. It works without javascript and as far as I can tell, the accessibility is decent too: using <code>display</code> means the theme selector is hidden from assistive technologies and the browser itself makes sure the focus is managed.</p><p>The only things you lose is that the &#34;button&#34; is no longer aware of the expanded status and can’t be used as a toggle anymore. The toggle functionality I don’t have a solution for, but you could also say that now that the browser is maintaining a <code>target</code> that&#39;s what holds that status.</p><p>In short, it&#39;s simple, doesn&#39;t need javascript, manages focus and the link clearly <em>goes somewhere</em>. It follows all the rules.</p><p>So why do I still prefer the (much more complex!) button example?</p><h3>Addendum</h3><p>Here’s what <a href="https://benmyers.dev/">Ben</a> had to say about this: the above is accurate, but it’s not something he would recommend in practice for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Buttons can explicitly convey the expanded/collapses state, which is useful information in itself.</li><li>Links and buttons have different keyboard triggers (both can be triggered with <kbd>enter</kbd> but buttons can also be activated with a <kbd>space</kbd>) and if you’re a sighted used, you might expect a button and be surprised when <kbd>space</kbd> does nothing.</li></ul><p>He also brought up the point of links opening in a new tab when you middle-click. Does it make sense to have that functionality on a new tab?</p><p>All in all, he helped me understand why I still preferred the button and explained it as such: <q>links are a semantically okayish way to do this; buttons are a more semantic way to do it</q>. Thanks Ben!</p><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.matuzo.at">Manuel</a> and <a href="https://benmyers.dev/">Ben</a> for feedback on drafts of this article.</em></p></div></div>
