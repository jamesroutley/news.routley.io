  <p>If you are of a certain vintage, this image is burned indelibly somewhere
in your posterior parietal complex:</p>

<p>Oh, my old friend.  How it’s been a long time.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-significance">Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>For the uninitiated, what are we looking at?  Could it be the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_error">Moiré Error</a> from
Doom? Well, no. You are looking at (part of) the boot up screen for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X
Window System</a>, specifically the pattern it uses as the background of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_window">root
window</a>.  This pattern is technically called a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stipple">stipple</a>.</p>
<p>What you’re seeing is pretty important and came to symbolize a lot for me as a
computer practitioner.  Over time, I came to develop a relationship with it
roughly as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] if you gaze for long into a stipple, the stipple gazes also into you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would compel me to say that?</p>
<p>Well, part of it is nostalgia, but the other part is practical.  For a long time
the X Window System had a reputation for being difficult to configure.  In
retrospect, I’m not 100% sure why it earned this reputation, because the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XF86Config">configuration file format</a>, which is plain text, has remained essentially the
same since I started using Linux in the mid-1990s.  On the other hand, the
amount of hand-written input required for the configuration file has fallen
gradually over time.  This is where the critique lies: the amount of information
that needed to be gathered.  In the old days, it used to be that mouse,
keyboard, video card, monitor, fonts, plugin+module data, etc. needed to be
spelled out in detail in <code>/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>.  If you were starting out with a
bare configuration file (e.g., after a fresh install of a system), researching
the necessary parameters for your hardware could be a real pain in the ass.  In
this era, I had dial-up Internet, and Google wasn’t a thing yet.</p>
<p>And this leads to to an interesting observation: <strong>you wouldn’t want to wing it
with the configuration</strong>, because allegedly <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/126523/can-one-really-fry-a-monitor-by-setting-the-wrong-horizsync-and-vertrefresh">you could break your monitor with a
bad <code>Monitor</code> setting</a>.  That never happened to me or my friends, or at least
none of my friends ever fessed up to it happening to them.  What I will fess up
to is giving my monitor a bad case of electrical whine on a few occasions.  Here
is an example <code>Monitor</code> setting found in an <code>XF86Config</code> file from Red Hat 5.0
(1997–8) vintage) to give you an idea of just the level of detail required for
the monitor:</p>

</div><p>Did your blood pressure raise looking at that?  Mine did.  Remember: this
information wasn’t a casual Google Search away for many of us back then.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with the stipple I mentioned earlier?  Combine the
onerousness of configuration above with the fact that computers weren’t
particularly fast, and the answer will become clear.  I recall in the era that
the X Window System took on the order of — what felt like — tens of seconds to
start even for relatively simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_window_manager">window managers</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twm">twm</a>.  <em>We were using
spinning disks, after all!</em>  So it could take a while to get the X Window System
properly configured through trial and error. Misconfiguration could mean any of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(allegedly) frying your hardware</li>
<li>suboptimal display (e.g., bad resolution, missing fonts) operation</li>
<li>misconfigured peripheral (e.g., no mouse)</li>
<li>misconfigured user space windowing environment (e.g., no window manager, or
it is broken)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have gotten older, I became acutely aware that one of the most important
things that matters for technical learning and productive use is a tight
edit-run cycle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; and that’s where the stipple comes in.  That stipple above
is <strong>the first thing</strong> that the X Window System would display on startup if
things were going reasonably well with the X Server and its configuration. So
seeing that meant you knew the things were at least partially (if not most of
the way) working. And that was because it could take multiple seconds longer for
the window manager to follow with its startup.  Heaven forbid you were starting
a full-blown desktop environment in this era.</p>
<p>Was this the stipple’s actual purpose?  I’m frankly uncertain.  I’d hoped that
someone would have written about this already, but nobody really has — at least
that I could find.  The best I found is a whimsical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322160540/http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq11.html">historical excerpt from the
OpenBSD FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We test as above, and… SUCCESS! We have what appears to be a very nice, high
resolution display. Note that ALL that is expected is a mesh pattern (very
good for seeing how good your monitor REALLY is and also great for calibrating
LCD displays, called the “root weave”) and a movable cursor. It is not
intended to be functional at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, given OpenBSD’s reputation of being a methodical project, I’m
inclined to give the FAQ authors some credence.  The early smoke testing success
signal combined with implicit branding seem like as good of a guess as any.</p>
<h2 id="today">Fast Forward to Today</h2>
<p>So why write about something that seems purely like an indulgence?  Surely the
stipple still lives with us today and requires no further discussion?  Well, up
until the early-2010s (at least on the Linux distributions I was using), this
boot up scene was common to see — <strong>until it suddenly wasn’t</strong>.</p>
<p>Linux distributions had a reputation for not being particularly bleeding edge
with the packages they contained.  So to my surprise one day this startup
behavior just stopped.  I took note of it, but I never researched why (life
comes at you fast, and I was distracted by more important things: moving abroad,
starting a family, starting a new job, etc).</p>
<p>So why did the stipple go away?  I’m not terribly certain to be honest (there
was no central bug tracker<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>), but I’ll posit some guesses based on the
contextual history:</p>
<p>There was a desire in the mid-2000s to 2010s to improve the boot speed of Linux
and its overall accessibility to newcomers.  <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> was sinking a lot of cash
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)">Mir</a>. This was also happening in the backdrop of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a>’s development.  In short, there was concerted momentum to modernize
the ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to my detective work, in September 2008, a commit lands
(<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44">0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44</a>) in the <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">X.Org</a> server that adds a
flag to the X Server called <code>-retro</code> that backs a global variable called
<code>party_like_its_1989</code>. This commit removes the default stipple and the customary
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/font/xfree86-type1/-/blob/e2a0089fc5b6404a6ab417ec6b1b75645283358f/cursor.pfa"><code>X_cursor</code></a> behaviors from boot, which look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/xfree86-startup.png" alt="X Window System starting up"/></p>
<p>Looking at this, the global variable’s name alone tells us the sentiment: out
with the old; in with the new.  I’m just surprised it took several years for the
new default behavior to land in whatever distribution I was using at the time,
which is why I made the remark above about distributions not having been super
bleeding edge.  Why did it take until the mid-2010s for me to notice the
disappearance?</p>
<p>Thinking aloud, the flag’s help description of <code>&#34;start with classic stipple and cursor&#34;</code> doesn’t really do a good service to the reader.  Let me give you a
concrete formulation of what I mean: <strong>have you ever encountered the word
“stipple” before reading this, and did you already know what the word means?</strong> I
don’t want to be unkind to the maintainers, but I think this flag’s description
is probably lost on a majority of readers (probably intentionally so).</p>
<h3 id="getting-it-back">Getting our Stipple Back</h3>
<p>All of this talk about the stipple’s evoking a desire to bring it back.  So how
do we do that in modern software?  Do you still use <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/startx.1.xhtml"><code>startx</code></a> to start your X
Server?  I’m guessing not; but if you did, it’s as easy as:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>startx -- -retro  <span># note the preceeding -- to provide options to the X Server</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>To make that permanent with <code>startx</code>, you could amend your <code>~/.xserverrc</code> file
to include the <code>-retro</code> flag:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>cp -i /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc ~/.xserverrc
</span></span><span><span>cat ~/.xserverrc

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>exec</span> /usr/bin/X -nolisten tcp<span>&#34; &#34;</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>&#34;  # add -retro before the -nolisten
</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>And of course a similar workflow as the above can be applied to all users on
the system if you amend the <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</code> file.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager">GNOME Display Manager</a> (GDM), you
appear to be out of luck with due to the <a href="https://github.com/GNOME/gdm/blob/main/daemon/gdm-x-session.c"><code>/usr/libexec/gdm-x-session</code></a> shim not
providing a mechanism to pass through arbitrary options to the X Server.</p>
<p>Users of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDM_(display_manager)">X Display Manager</a> (XDM) can amend <code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> file to
include the <code>-retro</code> argument à la:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Users of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM">LightDM</a> can amend the <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> file such that it

</div>
</div><p>I’m sure there’s a way to do this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Desktop_Display_Manager">SDDM</a>, but it won’t install on my machine
due to a networking problem.</p>
<p>Failing that, you can always use <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/xsetroot.1.xhtml"><code>xsetroot</code></a> to just replace your root window’s
background.</p>
<p>But — wow — isn’t that a fuck-ugly fractal of fragmentation?  I mean, I get on a
technical level why each thing that is managing the X Server takes a different
approach (independent development by individual engineers with different design
philosophies and requirements), but this just a stupid amount of toil to pass a
measly flag. I guess it’s a shame that X.Org went the flag route and didn’t
expose a mechanism in the X Server’s configuration file.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of the Stipple</h2>
<p>So how is the stipple defined?  Is it defined as a file (asset) for the X Server
to load at runtime? This part sent me on a goose chase.  I did not discover
commit <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44">0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44</a> until relatively late in my
research, and it would have simplified my research into this question.</p>
<p>Herein lies some fun duality; the stipple is defined <strong>both</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>statically in the X Window System source code in device-independent X
(<a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/XserverSourceLayout/">dix</a>)’s (<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/blob/72036261738c10d718cb42696289ae85b7f6f703/dix/window.c#L542-550"><code>window.c</code></a>) as an inline value literal and</li>
<li>as a standalone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap">X BitMap</a> file called <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/data/bitmaps/-/blob/master/root_weave?ref_type=heads"><code>root_weave</code></a> that gets installed as a
file in <code>/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/root_weave</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For startup, however, the X Window System only uses the static source code
definition (the data backing the <code>_back_lsb</code> or <code>_back_msb</code> variables from dix’s
<code>window.c</code> based on your machine’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a>).</p>
<p>Behold, the stipple has a real name: <strong>root weave</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The definition of the root weave bitmap data literal and that of the
file appear to be different.</p>
<h2 id="history">History of the Root Weave</h2>
<p>Now, if you clicked the link for <code>root_weave</code> above, you probably noticed an
interesting detail: this file was last changed approximately 20 years ago.  So
it’s old, right?  Well, this is where things get most interesting in my opinion.</p>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">we celebrated the X Window System’s 40th birthday</a>!  And
this led to me wonder: could we determine the introduction of root weave?</p>
<p>I worked backwards:</p>
<ul>
<li>I skipped checking the X.Org sources, because I knew root weave existed long
before, and I remember the X.Org and XFree86 schism relatively well.</li>
<li>OK.  Now on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a>.  Well, here’s the initial<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> commit from <code>Wed Apr 27 07:07:10 1994 +0000</code> (approximately 30 years ago) introducing it, so evidently
we didn’t go far enough back:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/03432c3ccba2746d2fb95a636a87fe732bede83c/programs/Xserver/dix/window.c#L83-84">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/03432c3ccba2746d2fb95a636a87fe732bede83c/programs/Xserver/dix/window.c#L83-84</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/fa85847d3586bfdd5abd4d495668d9b47ff56545/include/bitmaps/root_weave">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/fa85847d3586bfdd5abd4d495668d9b47ff56545/include/bitmaps/root_weave</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what predates XFree86?  Was XFree86 derived or forked from something else?
Can we find anything in source released from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena">Project Athena</a>?  Luckily X.Org
has a <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/">historical release archive</a>.  I trawled through the predecessors of
X11, and sure enough all of them have both the static source definition and
the bitmap!  The earliest release they had was X10R3, which according to
Wikipedia dates to February 1986.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I think we can conclude that root weave hails from somewhere between June
1984 (X1) and February 1986.</p>
<h2 id="bitmap-ecosystem">An Ecosystem of X BitMap Files</h2>
<p>It turns out that root weave is not the only X BitMap file that comes installed,
and there are a bunch of other ones that are about as old as it.  We
have some other weaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cross weave: kind of meh</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/cross_weave_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of “cross_weave”"/></p>

<li>
<p>wide weave: I like it</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are plenty of others bitmaps (some newer).  I made a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print">contact

<p>I’m certain there is some fun and weird history with these images.  Is there
anyone around who can recount it, though?  The one that caught my eye was
“woman”.  OK, why is there one called “woman,” and why is it so aesthetically
different from the rest?  By coincidence, in my research I came across the
<a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/X11R1/">release notes for X11R1</a>; it hints that “woman” was used to demonstrate a
regression in the server’s code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the “woman” bitmap, the small images are corrupt on color screens (server
bug likely). The program dumps core when colors are specified in .Xdefaults.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Among other things, try the command “xsetroot -bitmap include/bitmaps/woman”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious.</p>
<h2 id="detours">Other Detours</h2>
<p>Seminal software often inspires and influences other software.  Sometimes these
others are derivative products.  A good analogue for this are derivative game
engines and the tree they form (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine#Derivative_engines">Quake I derivatives</a>).  This exercise
prompted a whole bunch of fundamental history questions around software
provenance and lineage to which I didn’t have the answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What was XFree86 based on?  Was it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">clean room implementation</a> or a
derivative?  I simply didn’t know.  It turns out XFree86 is derived from the
original Project Athena.</p>

<p>What about other X Window System servers, particularly commercial ones?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For instance, what about the X Server for Solaris?  Solaris 9 (I have no
ability to check earlier releases) also includes the same weave X BitMap
files.  As best as I can tell, its native X Server (<code>Xsun</code>) is a derivative
of Project Athena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And one of the first Linux installations I ever used came with a commercial
X Server made by the now-defunct company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030731165914/http://metrolink.com/">Metro Link</a>, which offered a
low-touch server called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030812132431/http://www.metrolink.com/products/metrox/index.html">Metro-X</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  I managed to find an ISO
of Red Hat 5.0 with Metro-X, so I booted it up.  Nearly same story with it
including these weaves, too.  This server looks to be more closely related
to XFree86, though.</p>
<p>What was fascinating about Metro-X was that it was legitimately easy to
configure in this era of non-trivial setup (even for newbies).  I remember
that fondly.  It had somewhat modern — by today’s standards — X Server
device probing functionality that just worked.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the Metro-X setup wizard (it looks like it
is built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(software)">Motif</a>, which would have been customary for the era, based
on the symbols in the <code>configX</code> binary):</p>

<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/metro-x-card.png" alt="Metro-X Card Settings"/></p>
<p>Again, all of this was automatically probed correctly, which is nuts
considering this is Linux in 1997 (Linux Kernel 2.0.32).</p>
<p>1998-era XFree86 came with a graphical configurator, but I don’t recall it
having any autoprobing capability; it merely managed the configuration file.
Let’s contrast Metro-X’s <code>configX</code> with XFree86’s <code>XF86Setup</code>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Athena_Widgets">X Athena
Widgets</a> and TCL-based tool that appears to be short-lived (removed in
2003):</p>

<p>Regrettably Metro Link appears to have folded in October 2003, so the rest
will be in the annals of history.</p>

<h2 id="revisiting">Revisiting the Era with Fresh Eyes</h2>
<p>Playing around with several old versions of Linux and adjacent ecosystem
software provided an opportunity to see if the good ol’ days were in fact any
good.  Well, to be honest, this was some rough software to work with.  A lot of
creature comforts that I am used to are not there (e.g., no <code>-r</code> flag for
<code>grep</code>), and the overall user experience is extremely unpolished.  If we take a
step back from configuring the X Servers of that era and look at how the servers
are bootstrapped in terms of how <code>startx</code> and friends are implemented, wow, it
is a lot more complicated (e.g., <code>serverargs</code> and <code>clientargs</code> machinations that
look well intentioned but also incredibly fragile).</p>
<p>To counterbalance that, I have to say in spite of some improvements in the
intervening years, Linux and X seem like an accretion disk. Not enough acquired
complexity was shed.</p>
<p>I will remark that in spite of my job being a software engineer, I had never
spent a lot of time looking at the source code for the X Server (XFree86 or
X.Org) before.  It’s really nuts to see that a lot of the architecture from
X10R3 and X11R1 still persists in the code today, which is a statement that can
be said in deep admiration for legacy code but also disturbance from the power
of old decisions. Without having looked at the internals of any Wayland
implementation, I can sympathize sight unseen with the sentiments that some
developers have toward the X Window System: the code is a dead end.  I say that
with the utmost respect to the X Window System as a technology and an ecosystem.
I’ll keep using X, and I will be really sad when it’s no longer possible for me
to do so for one reason or another, as I’m extremely attached to it quirks.  But
it’s clear the future is limited.</p>
<h2 id="other-futures">Our Lost Futures</h2>
<p>We could have ended up with a different default stipple. The images above with
cross and wide weave hinted at that.</p>
<p>Here’s what it would have looked like with some of the other fun contenders from
the included bitmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tie_fighter</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/tie_fighter_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of “tie_fighter”"/></p>
<p>Lucasfilm, Ltd. would not have approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>xlogo16</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/xlogo16_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of “xlogo16”"/></p>
<p>Maybe a wet dream a certain of Space Karen.  I personally like the X (as in X
Window System) logo when it stands on its own, and I wish it wasn’t now
tainted with the connotations of this booger.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’d like to imagine that there was a timeline where X had
stronger branding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And taking things in a more absurd direction, let’s consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1">Windows 3.1</a> with
respect to the stipples above.  Windows 3.1 had a very strong design language
in my mind — as did Windows NT up to and including Windows 2000.  It also turns
out that Windows 3.1 (maybe even Windows 3.0 if memory serves) had a
bitmap-style background pattern feature that included a pattern composition
tool.  So I took a stab at making the weaves in the editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-composer.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Pattern Composer"/></p>
<p>Interesting, what would have Windows 3.1 have looked like with these weave
patterns?  Let’s find out!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>root weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-root-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Root Weave"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cross weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-cross-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Cross Weave"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wide weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-wide-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Wide Weave"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this leads me to wonder what would Edward Tufte have said about the
original X ecosystem and its aesthetics.  A lot of it was spartan and clear, yet
there is some gratuitous <a href="https://books.google.ch/books/about/Visual_Design_of_the_User_Interface.html">administrative debris</a> here and there (like this
stipple).</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>
<p>Diving deep into this gave me a lot of joy — and a great chance to revisit the
past. In case of errors, omissions, or other cool details, get in contact with
me.</p>
<p>So knowing now that root weave and all of that is from 1986, should I send X.Org
a pull request to rename the <code>party_like_its_1989</code> global variable to
<code>party_like_its_1986</code> or <code>party_like_the_1980s</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.  Something tells me
they wouldn’t welcome it.</p>
