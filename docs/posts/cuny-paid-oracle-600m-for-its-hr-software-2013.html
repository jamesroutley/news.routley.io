Every once in a while I get a question, either privately or in a department meeting, regarding CUNYFirst. Here is what I know of CUNYFirst, based on a few years of working with the project as a &#34;training liaison&#34; (which is a fancy term for room-scheduler).</p></div>

<h3><a href="http://pscbc.blogspot.com/2013/06/93-vote-no-confidence-in-pathways.html">93% Vote No Confidence in Pathways</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
The referendum votes have been tallied: a total of 4,322 votes were  cast, out of a total number of 7,202 possible votes: a 60% turnout.   Of  those, 3,996 full-time faculty agreed that they have No Confidence in  Pathways, with only 323 voting Disagree (and 3 void ballots).    An absolute majority of the full-time faculty are on record as having no  confidence in Pathways.  That is a stunning rebuke to the new  curriculum and the coercive process used to implement it.   I will send a longer message to the entire membership shortly, but for  now I want to congratulate you all on your extraordinary collective  effort in defense of our students&#39; right to a rigorous education.   Equipped with this result, we can take the campaign to a new level in  the fall.   In solidarity,  Barbara Bowen

In the Fall of 2023, we asked all departments or units to write and sign letters to the college President, Michelle Anderson. We wanted her to know what our colleagues do well. We wanted her to hear our vision for work and mission at Brooklyn College. We wanted her to understand what we all need to thrive. We wanted to model a mission-driven discourse, not a workplace lead by austerity.  We wanted our President to hear us. Professor Naomi Braine reads the Sociology Dept Letter Professor Jillian Cavanaugh reads the Anthropology Letter     Twelve letters, signed by 100s of our colleagues were submitted—although many more were penned (many felt uneasy about being visible in this way). 1) Synthesis letter signed by over 80 faculty and staff 2) Sociology Department , 26 signatures 3) Anthropology Department, 16 signatures 4) Accounting Department , 14 signatures 5) Library , 28 signatures 6) PRLS , 6 signatures 7) Psychology Department , 30 signatures 8) English Department , over 100 signat
