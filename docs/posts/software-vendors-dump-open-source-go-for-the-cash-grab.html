				<p>Essentially, all software is built using open source. By Synopsys&#39; count, <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?intcmp=sig-blog-ossra22" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">96% of all codebases contain open-source software</a>.</p><p>Lately, though, there&#39;s been a very disturbing trend. A company will make its program using open source, make millions from it, and then — and only then — switch licenses, leaving their contributors, customers, and partners in the lurch as they try to grab billions. I&#39;m sick of it.</p><p>The latest IT melodrama baddie is <a href="https://redis.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Redis</a>. Its program, which goes by the same name, is an extremely popular in-memory database. (Unless you&#39;re a developer, chances are you&#39;ve never heard of it.) One recent valuation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BU1WT/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows Redis to be worth about $2 billion</a> — even without an AI play! That, anyone can understand.</p><p>What did it do? To quote Redis: &#34;Beginning today, <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">all future versions of Redis will be released with source-available licenses.</a> Starting with Redis 7.4, Redis will be dual-licensed under the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Redis Source Available License (RSALv2)</a> and <a href="https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Server Side Public License (SSPLv1)</a>. Consequently, Redis will no longer be distributed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">three-clause Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</a>.&#34;</p><p>For those of you who aren&#39;t open-source licensing experts, this means developers can no longer use Redis&#39; code. Sure, they can look at it, but they can&#39;t export, borrow from, or touch it.</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-licensing-war-commons-clause/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Redis pulled this same kind of trick in 2018</a> with some of its subsidiary code. Now it’s done so with the company’s crown jewels.</p><p>Redis is far from the only company to make such a move. Last year,  <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a> dumped its main program Terraform&#39;s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mozilla Public License (MPL)</a> for the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Business Source License (BSL) 1.1</a>. Here, the name of the new license game is to prevent anyone from competing with Terraform.</p><p>Would it surprise you to learn that not long after this, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/software-company-hashicorp-is-said-to-weigh-potential-sale?sref=y7UfZ5i4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HashiCorp started shopping itself around for a buyer?</a> It didn&#39;t surprise me.</p><p>Before this latest round of license changes, MongoDB and Elastic made similar shifts. Again, you might never have heard of these companies or their programs, but each is worth, at a minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars. And, while you might not know it, if your company uses cloud services behind the scenes, chances are you&#39;re using one or more of their programs,</p><p>There is a threefold reason these companies did this. First, all of them, at one point or another, mistook &#34;open source&#34; as a business model. It wasn&#39;t then, it isn&#39;t now, and it never will be.</p><p>Second, having made that first mistake, they discovered the hard way that while they could make millions, other companies, usually the hyper-cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), were making just as much, if not more, from their programs. They did it by providing their software as a service to businesses. </p><p>It&#39;s a matter of scale. People want to use the software as a service, not as a one-off they need to work on themselves.</p><p>Finally, hidden behind the financial curtain, venture capitalists don&#39;t want hugely successful companies; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unicorn.asp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they want unicorns</a>. If a business isn&#39;t worth a billion dollars before its initial public offering (IPO), it&#39;s not a winner in their books.</p><p>Welcome to life in Silicon Valley,</p><p>So, what&#39;s the simplest way to do this — besides firing employees to replace them with insufficiently ready AI bots? Drop the open-source license. They&#39;ve developed their program with the help of others; they got their customers thanks to open-source assurance; why let anyone else get a share of the pie?</p><p>Software companies are ticked off. At least two Linux distros, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fedora</a> and <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">openSUSE</a>, are considering getting rid of the Redis program. If they do, you can expect their big commercial brothers, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a> and <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/server/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)</a> to follow suit.</p><p>Who&#39;s really furious about this, though, are developers. It&#39;s their work, after all, that&#39;s disappearing into semi-proprietary vaults, never to be touched by them again. </p><p>So, as they&#39;ve done before and they&#39;ll do again, at least two sets of programmers are forking it. First off the mark was Drew DeVault, founder and CEO of <a href="https://sourcehut.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SourceHut</a>, with <a href="https://redict.io/posts/2024-03-22-redict-is-an-independent-fork/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Redict</a>. He was quickly followed by Madelyn Olson, principal engineer at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon ElastiCache</a>, itself an <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/opensearch-aws-rolls-out-its-open-source-elasticsearch-fork/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">open-source fork of Elastic</a>. However, as Olson observed, this as-yet-unnamed<a href="https://twitter.com/reconditerose/status/1771237000592642274" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Redis fork</a> is not an AWS project. AWS is working on its own response.</p><p>They can do this because while Redis has changed its license going forward, they can&#39;t take back the code they&#39;d licensed under the previous code. You can still do whatever you want, according to the terms of the old license, with earlier versions of the code.   </p><p>This is a big deal in open-source and high-end IT circles, but it also matters to everyone who uses software. Remember, I just pointed out how important open source is to software development. Suppose programmers get sick and tired of companies taking their donated code and decide they won&#39;t put up with this anymore.</p><p>Some businesses making the license shift say they&#39;re doing it to pay the developers what they&#39;re worth. I&#39;m all in favor of open-source programmers making more money. But I can assure you that even the very best developers won&#39;t be the ones making the real cash from these proposals. It&#39;s the venture capitalists, private equity groups, and top brass who will get serious coin.</p><p>This is not what open source is all about. Making money, sure. Even Richard M. Stallman, Free Software&#39;s founder, said, &#34;There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to maximize one&#39;s income, as long as one does not use means that are destructive. [But] extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of it is destructive.&#34;</p><p>For once, Stallman and I agree.</p>
