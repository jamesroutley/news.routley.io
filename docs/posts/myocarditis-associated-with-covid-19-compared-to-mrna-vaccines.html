We undertook a self-controlled case series study of people aged 16 or older vaccinated for COVID-19 in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021 to investigate hospital admission or death from myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias in the 1–28 days following adenovirus (ChAdOx1, <i>n</i> = 20,615,911) or messenger RNA-based (BNT162b2, <i>n</i> = 16,993,389; mRNA-1273, <i>n</i> = 1,006,191) vaccines or a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test (<i>n</i> = 3,028,867). We found increased risks of myocarditis associated with the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines and the first and second doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine over the 1–28 days postvaccination period, and after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We estimated an extra two (95% confidence interval (CI) 0, 3), one (95% CI 0, 2) and six (95% CI 2, 8) myocarditis events per 1 million people vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively, in the 28 days following a first dose and an extra ten (95% CI 7, 11) myocarditis events per 1 million vaccinated in the 28 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273. This compares with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1 million patients in the 28 days following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We also observed increased risks of pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Similar associations were not observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines, apart from an increased risk of arrhythmia following a second dose of mRNA-1273. Subgroup analyses by age showed the increased risk of myocarditis associated with the two mRNA vaccines was present only in those younger than 40.</p></div></section>

No association between ChAdOx1 vaccine and myocarditis or pericarditis has been reported. The same reports showed that these events are more likely to occur in adolescent and young adults, mostly after the second dose. Evaluation of the risks of adverse events following vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection in different age groups provides crucial information to determine whether the risks from the vaccine outweighs the risks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.</p><p>In England, the vaccination campaign began on 8 December 2020 with the BNT162b2 vaccine followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine on 4 January 2021. In the first phase, priority was given to the most vulnerable, in a schedule based primarily on age. The mRNA-1273 vaccine became available in England on 13 April 2021. Since 7 April 2021, ChAdOx1 vaccine has not been recommended for individuals younger than 30 years of age, and since 7 May 2021 for individuals younger than 40 years of age.</p><p>The English National Immunisation (NIMS) Database of COVID-19 vaccination includes data on vaccine type, date and doses for all people vaccinated in England. We linked NIMS, at individual patient level, to national data for mortality, hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 infection data to examine the associations between the first and second dose of ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines and cardiac adverse events: myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiac arrhythmias. We used the same population to investigate the associations between a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (before or after vaccination) as a secondary exposure and the same cardiac adverse events. We also assessed risks for the same outcomes following vaccination or a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in younger persons (&lt;40 years old). Incidence rate ratios, the rate of hospital admission or death from each outcome in risk periods after vaccination or a positive test relative to baseline periods, were estimated using self-controlled case series (SCCS) methodology<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Petersen, I., Douglas, I. &amp; Whitaker, H.

This observation was not limited to the mRNA vaccines as we also found an excess in myocarditis events following the first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine. The excess risk was observed in men and women but was only consistently observed following both mRNA vaccines in those younger than 40 years, although this may, in part, reflect the small number of individuals over the age of 40 years receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine in England.</p><p>Whilst myocarditis can be life-threatening, most vaccine-associated myocarditis events have been mild and self-limiting<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Witberg, G. et al.

The risk observed here is small and confined to the 7-day period following vaccination, whereas the lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantial.

Moreover, evidence of myocardial injury, irrespective of whether due to myocarditis or myocardial ischemia, is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Lala, A. et al.

We estimate that the absolute number of excess myocarditis events in the 28 days following a first dose of adenovirus or mRNA vaccine is between one and six per million persons vaccinated, and the excess risk following the second dose of the mRNA-1283 vaccine is ten per million. By contrast, we estimate 40 excess myocarditis events per million in the 28 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risks are more evenly balanced in younger persons aged up to 40 years, where we estimated the excess in myocarditis events following SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 10 per million with the excess following a second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine being 15 per million. Further research is required to understand why the risk of myocarditis seems to be higher following mRNA-1273 vaccine. Although the wider societal benefits of controlling the spread of virus to those who are more vulnerable are substantial, these data may help inform public health policy and the choice of vaccine offered to younger adults.</p><p>This study has several strengths. First, the United Kingdom offered an ideal place to carry out this study given that three vaccinations have been rolled out at speed and scale. Second, this was a population-based study of data recorded prospectively and avoided recall and selection biases linked to case reports. Third, the large sample size provided sufficient power to investigate these rare outcomes, which could not be assessed through clinical trials. Fourth, the SCCS study design removes potential confounding from fixed characteristics, and the breakdown of our study period into weekly blocks accounted for temporal confounding. Of note, the estimated IRRs are consistently less than 1 in the pre-exposure period before vaccination and greater than 1 in the prerisk period before a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. This was expected since events are unlikely to happen shortly before vaccination (relatively healthy people are receiving the vaccine) and more likely to happen before a SARS-CoV-2 positive test (as a standard procedure, patients admitted to hospital are tested for SARS-CoV-2). We also assessed the robustness of our results through analyses of control outcomes and several sensitivity analyses.</p><p>There are some limitations that we should acknowledge. First, although we used an established methodology for evaluating vaccine safety, we cannot determine whether our findings are causal. Second, we relied on hospital admission codes and death certification to define our outcome measures. As such, we are not able to determine what proportion of patients underwent cardiac imaging or biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. It remains possible that our findings have been influenced by referral bias, with troponin testing performed more widely following vaccination due to media reports of vaccine-associated myocarditis. Our sensitivity analysis restricted to those persons vaccinated before the CDC announcement does not discount this possibility, although the different results could also be explained by the fact that the population who received the BNT162b2 vaccine were older in the restricted study period. Third, the mRNA-1273 vaccine roll-out began in April 2021 in the United Kingdom; as a consequence, the number of events in patients who received this vaccine was low. Although the signal associated with myocarditis is strong for this vaccine, care is needed in the interpretation, and it would be useful to replicate our results in similarly large datasets internationally. Fourth, we are unclear about the biological plausibility of the observed reduced risks of pericarditis and arrhythmia linked to vaccination and, although these findings are consistent of those of Barda et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Barda, N. et al. Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in a nationwide setting. N. Engl. J. Med. 385, 1078–1090 (2021)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01630-0#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d84666778e11248">21</a></sup>, they should be interpreted with caution. Fifth, in this study, we performed several comparisons, which may lead to some erroneous inferences. As a consequence, careful interpretation is needed, especially for the borderline associations found. Finally, it is also important to note that control outcomes were chosen to assess the validity of the association between cardiac adverse events and vaccination. Control outcomes for a SARS-CoV-2 positive test are more challenging to find, as the entire health system is affected by the pandemic. Caution is needed in interpretation of the findings for a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in light of this.</p><p>In summary, this population-based study quantifies for the first time the risk of several rare cardiac adverse events associated with three COVID-19 vaccines as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 in adults was associated with a small increase in the risk of myocarditis within a week of receiving the first dose of both adenovirus and mRNA vaccines, and after the second dose of both mRNA vaccines. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of hospitalization or death from myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmia.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Methods"><div id="Sec13-section"><h2 id="Sec13">Methods</h2><div id="Sec13-content"><h3 id="Sec14">Ethical approval</h3><p>National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained from East Midlands-Derby Research Ethics Committee [reference 04/03/2021].</p><h3 id="Sec15">Data</h3><p>We used the National Immunisation Database (NIMS) database of COVID-19 vaccination to identify vaccine exposure.

Separate analyses were carried out in cases with each cardiac outcome of interest. People were considered eligible for inclusion in each study cohort if they had received at least one vaccine dose, were at least 16 years old and were admitted to hospital with, or died from, the outcome of interest between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021 (last data update). Patients were followed up from the study start (1 December 2020) to the earliest of the end of the study period or when they died. Patients with a hospital admission for the same outcome in the 2 years before the start of the study period were excluded.</p><h3 id="Sec18">Outcomes</h3><p>The outcomes in this study are selected cardiac conditions with previous indications of association with SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. These included myocarditis, pericarditis and arrythmia. We used the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes to define each outcome, as listed in Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01630-0#MOESM1">11</a>. The outcomes were identified as the first hospital admission due to the event of interest, or death recorded on the death certificate with the International Classification of Diseases-10 code related to the outcome of interest within the study period. A histogram showing the number of admissions in England from 1 April 2019 to 24 August 2021 is presented in Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01630-0#Fig6">4</a>.</p><h3 id="Sec19">Exposures</h3><p>The exposure variables were a first or second dose of the ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, or SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as the first SARS-CoV-2 positive test in the study period. All exposures were included in the same model. We defined the exposure risk intervals as the following prespecified time periods: 0, 1–7, 8–14, 15–21 and 22–28 days after each exposure date, under the assumption that the adverse events under consideration are unlikely to be related to exposure later than 28 days postexposure. We assumed that the risks may be different after each vaccine dose (first and second), and hence we allowed for a dose effect, by defining a separate risk interval after each dose: 0, 1–7, 8–14, 15–21 or 22–28 days after the first dose and 0, 1–7, 8–14, 15–21 or 22–28 days after the second dose. To avoid overlapping risk periods, we assumed that later exposures (second dose) take precedence over earlier ones (first dose), except for the 28-day prerisk period for the second dose, as shown in Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01630-0#Fig7">5</a>. A prerisk interval of 1–28 days before each exposure date was included to account for potential bias that might arise if the occurrence of the outcome temporarily influenced the likelihood of exposure. The baseline period for the vaccination exposures comprised the remaining time from 1 December 2020 until 29 days before the first dose date and from 29 days after the first dose until 29 days before the second dose (if applicable), and from 29 days after the second dose until 24 August 2021 or the censored date if earlier. A SARS-CoV-2 positive test was considered as a separate exposure in the models, which allowed overlapping risk windows with vaccination exposure.</p><h3 id="Sec20">Seasonality and COVID-19 pandemic period</h3><p>Hospital admissions were likely influenced by the pressure on the health systems due to COVID-19, which was not uniform during the pandemic period. To allow for these underlying seasonal effects, we split the study observation period into weeks and adjusted for week as a factor variable in the statistical models.</p><h3 id="Sec21">Statistical analysis</h3><p>We described characteristics of each cohort (vaccinated patients with the outcomes of interest) in terms of age, sex and ethnic group. The SCCS models were fitted using a conditional Poisson regression model with an offset for the length of the exposure risk period. Separate analyses were carried out for each cardiac outcome of interest. IRR, the relative rate of hospital admissions or deaths due to each outcome of interest in exposure risk periods relative to baseline periods, and their 95% CI were estimated by the SCCS model adjusted for week as a time-varying covariate. Exposure terms for vaccines and for a SARS-CoV-2 positive test were included in the same model.</p><p>We investigated if the associations between vaccine exposures and outcomes are sex- or age-dependent by running subgroups analyses amongst those aged under 40 years and those aged 40 years and older and by gender. We also conducted analyses restricted to those with a SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hospital admissions for the events of interest can trigger COVID-19 testing. Such events may well be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the reverse causality involved in their detection induces bias.
