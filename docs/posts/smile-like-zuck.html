<p>I made a game about learning to smile using your mouth and eyes.</p>
<p>It’s called <a href="https://smilelikezuck.com">Smile Like Zuck</a> and it’s about making the same face as Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

A user&#39;s webcam is visible along with an image of Mark Zuckerberg. The user matches their face to Zuck&#39;s face and a progress bar begins to climb. When it reaches the top, a new image of Zuck begins and the process repeats."><p>Loading...</p></video><p>people are calling this &#39;surprisingly fun&#39;</p></div>
<p>Did you know that when humans smile, they try to use their eyes as well as their mouths?</p>

<h2 id="toc:why">Why</h2>
<p>A week or two ago I prototyped a more general “match your face to someone making a funny face” game. It was fine, but it lacked direction.</p>
<p>There’s this great <a href="https://terkelg.github.io/zuckerberg.smile/">zuck smile</a> thing by <a href="https://terkel.com/">Terkel</a> that popped back into my head, and that gave me the idea for Smile Like Zuck. (Thanks Terkel!)</p>
<div><video controls="" playsinline="" poster="/images/smile-like-zuck/terkelzuck-firstframe.png" width="2456" height="1382" preload="metadata" alt="A website with a picture of mark zuckerberg and a slider. Dragging the slider causes zuck to smile more."><p>Loading...</p></video><p>I think about this all the time</p></div>
<p>Humans smile when they’re happy, but sometimes they also smile when they’re uncomfortable!</p>
<h2 id="toc:how">How</h2>
<p>The face-tracking here is powered by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide">mediapipe</a>, which is a neat tool from Google that makes it easy to do hand and face tracking in the browser.</p>
<p>At this point I have a lot of practice using Mediapipe (including with React, which can be a little challenging) - I’ve written about some of my tricks <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/blog/paccam/">here</a> if you’re curious.</p>
<p>One new trick I’m using is <em>always</em> cropping images to have a 3/4 aspect ratio. I didn’t do this with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/blog/stranger-video/">stranger video</a> and it resulted in a frame that was constantly pulsing in and out because the facial bounding box mediapipe gives you is not that stable.</p>
<p>So with Smile Like Zuck I take the bounding box, add a bit of padding, and then “grow” it in the smaller dimension until it has a 3/4 aspect ratio. I think this looks much nicer.</p>
<p>Smiling is challenging because it requires tensing and relaxing the 43 muscles in the human face!</p>

<p>Play it at <a href="https://smilelikezuck.com">smilelikezuck.com</a>.</p>
<p>Humans <em>laugh</em> when they think that something is funny. Funny means surprising but not threatening!</p>
<h2 id="toc:nolen-i-dont-like-this-one">Nolen, I don’t like this one</h2>
<p>I’m sorry! I will try to do better :)</p>
<p>Some people say that smiling can help relieve physical pain!</p>
<h2 id="toc:anything-you-want-to-plug">Anything you want to plug</h2>
<p>I made this at <a href="https://recurse.com">the recurse center</a>, which is like a writer’s retreat for programming. It’s a great place to learn how to build useful human software like this.</p>
<p>When being photographed, humans try to look at the camera - that way it seems like they’re making “eye contact” with whoever is viewing the image!</p></article></div>
