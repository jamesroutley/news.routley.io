<p>This week on Machine-Centric Science, I interviewed Martynas Jusevičius, currently at AtomGraph and
based in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>Topics we spoke about included: cell-based UI as computational canvases (e.g. Jupyter), personal
knowledge graph tools and block UI protocols, the Solid Pod spec and ecosystem for decentralized
data ownership and visiting, and the roles both of researchers and those who develop software for
them in realizing FAIR-principled implementations.</p>
<p><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/59aa8998">HAVE A LISTEN »</a></p>

<p>“The RDF graph data model…seems like the only realistic implementation at this point for the FAIR
principles.”</p>
<p>“To me, FAIR data is more or less equal to Linked Data.”</p>
<p>“The software has to be built around these principles. And that’s maybe quite a radical idea because
for a long time, data was just like an add-on to software, right? But essentially now it’s the
inverse. It’s the data that is at the center – that’s the data-centric paradigm.”</p>
<p>“…there has to be some kind of paradigm shift, both in how researchers see this, but also for
those who develop software for researchers, that what scientific publishing produces is not just
PDFs…Through fair data, we can look at scientific publishing as this huge network of research
artifacts that can be navigated, explored – as a knowledge graph naturally – but also recombined,
reused and repurposed in different things.”</p>
