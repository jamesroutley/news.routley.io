  <p>In my opinion, the UI design of Windows peaked in the late 1990s. The classic, utilitarian icons from Windows 98 just look amazing.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-they-so-good">Why are they so good?</h3>

<p>Rather than some designer’s flashy vision of the future, Windows 98 icons made the operating system feel like a place to get real work done. They had hard edges, soft colors and easy-to-recognize symbols.</p>

<p>It’s obvious that the icons were meticulously crafted. Each 256-color .ico file includes a pixel-perfect 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 version that looks equally good on the taskbar and desktop.</p>

<p>Maybe its nostalgia, but I still prefer the classic icons of Windows 98 over the shiny, drop-shadowed icons of later years. You can download the entire Windows 98 collection of .ico files <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uv7YxbSqGbe5fNlEK9GqDiX0c_blAYmn/view">here</a>.</p>
