    <h1>Plan 9 Is a Uniquely Complete Operating System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>A large contributor to the &#34;feel&#34; of an Operating System comes from the software it chooses to include by default. There are entire linux distributions that differentiate themselves just based on the default configured software. There is room for so many options of base software because there are in general many different options to pick. Linux being just a kernel itself specifically creates an environment which encourages this (to some extent). This is both a blessing and a curse, for people wanting to write software targeting linux there now is some matrix of options they must test under if they want it to work with all the various software choices. BSD systems, unlike Linux, tend to include more than just a kernel by default, generally including some &#34;blessed&#34; c library, c compiler, libraries and programs. This makes targeting the system a bit easier, in the sense that you can assume there is a larger set of software on a BSD machine than you could with some system that uses a Linux kernel. Even with BSD however, not all of the software is in control of those in charge of the system itself, there is still a large amount of shared code between these systems for things like the c compiler. There are some pros and cons to this situation. On the plus side these systems get to reap the benefits of the work put in to these other projects (gnu, llvm, and so on), but this also does lead to there being some differences in design. Put in another way, if someone wanted the ability to touch every line of code (in the upstream sense), they would have to be a member of some non trivial amount of communities.</p>
<p>Plan 9 is unique in this sense that everything the system needs is covered by the base install. This includes the compilers, graphical environment, window manager, text editors, ssh client, torrent client, web server, and the list goes on. Nearly everything a user can do with the system is available right from the get go. I think this is super important for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everything is one monorepo, a single commit hash communicates your entire kernel and user space state.
</li><li>
There is a consistency of design between all the code in the system.
</li><li>
There is no matrix of configurations to test your software against.
</li><li>
Programs can assume the presence of a fairly large collection of software.
</li><li>
There is an encouragement to write new software that adapts to the Plan 9 style instead of importing existing software.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course some downsides to this approach as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Plan 9 implementations tend to not be as feature rich as the proper upstream variants.
</li><li>
There is a larger barrier to entry when adding new programs or features to the system.
</li><li>
In general the system becomes somewhat isolated from the general flow of software outside of it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally like to think the pros outweight the cons, but I do acknowledge this design is part of the reason why Plan 9 has generally been stuck as just a hobbyist curiosity.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight this difference because I think in general people are not aware of the amount of independent implementations that have been written for 9front as part of following this design. There is no other system that provides this many examples of its own interfaces, that are by themselves generally useful programs.</p>
<p>Some examples I&#39;m fond of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ssh.c/f.html">ssh</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/git/f.html">git</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/torrent.c/f.html">torrent client</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ktrans/f.html">Japanese, Korean &amp; Chinese IME</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/cifsd/f.html">SMB server</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/tinc.c/f.html">tinc VPN</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically because of this design, Plan 9 becomes an excellent learning resource for anything that it supports. It becomes a sandbox for individuals to learn and experiment with any topic of operating systems. In these regards I do think that Plan 9 is a truly unique collection of software.</p>
<p>If by some chance this writing interested you in the Plan 9, I encourage you to download the 9front iso and give it a go. As of the time of this writing the amd64 <a href="http://9front.org/releases/2024/04/28/0/">release iso</a> is a measily 467M and includes everything I&#39;ve talked about.</p>
