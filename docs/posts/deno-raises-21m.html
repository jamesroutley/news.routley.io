<p>Developers today struggle with endless complexity in building web services.
There is a jungle of tooling that must be well understood and delicately
combined. There are thousands of megabytes of dependencies, many of which are
unnecessary, insecure, and out-of-date. Long running builds are undertaken on
every code change. Cloud services are either too limited (supporting only static
content) or way too complicated (requiring irrelevant configuration relative to
the application problem). Why can&#39;t engineers just focus on the problem at hand,
rather than all of these tangential issues?</p>
<p>JavaScript is unlike other programming languages in that it is
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/javascript_containers#the-universal-scripting-language" rel="noopener noreferrer">the universal scripting language</a>.
Its universality combined with security from the browser and its raw performance
lends itself to a solution for these problems, at least for a certain common
class of applications.</p>
<p>Deno is JavaScript for the serverless era. Our earlier project, Node.js, has
shown how useful JavaScript outside of the browser can be: <em>nearly</em> <em>every
website</em> uses Node in some form or another. Deno refines and extends this idea.
The open source Deno runtime shows how clean and productive a modern,
batteries-included, programming environment can be. It has quickly grown to one
of the top projects on Github (#44 in stars at time of writing). Tens of
thousands of users utilize the runtime every week. The Deno software stack was
built for more than simply improving local development and system APIs. We also
use it to build the most modern, user-friendly, serverless-at-edge system: Deno
Deploy.</p>
<p>Deno Deploy is an Isolate Cloud. Early in cloud computing, virtual machines were
the compute abstraction; completely general purpose, they could emulate any
system. Later Docker popularized the idea of Linux Containers, allowing
lighter-weight isolation packages. Linux Containers shared the kernel with the
host machine, achieving faster package builds and faster startup times. An
Isolate Cloud is similarly a compute abstraction but using the most minimal
package possible: only the application code. Not only the kernel but also the
runtime environment is provided by the host machine. This is what allows Deno
Deploy to achieve its cutting-edge deployment times, instant cold starts, and
surprising scale.</p>

<p>The density possible with an Isolate Cloud allows Deno Deploy to do amazing
things. For example, it is integrated with GitHub in such a way that on every
push it will provision a new server running specifically that code, deployed to
the edge, worldwide, and persisted permanently. Want to access the code your app
was running a month ago at commit f7c5e19? It will be served up instantly at a
moment&#39;s notice. It costs you nothing to have that bit of JavaScript responding
to requests indefinitely.</p>
<p>Most users of Deploy are self-serve customers, but through
<a href="https://deno.com/deploy/subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno Deploy Subhosting</a> we can support even
larger use-cases. For example, Netlify is partnering with Deno to provide
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/edge-functions-explained/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify Edge Functions</a>.
Netlify&#39;s Edge Functions run on Deno Deploy. Similarly
<a href="https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/31/supabase-edge-functions" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase Edge Functions</a>
are also built on Deno Deploy.</p>
<p>This new round of investment will allow us to have the highest quality engineers
working on Deno for years to come. We will make sure this infrastructure is
reliable for companies small and large. The Isolate Cloud technology has clear
commercial applications – we do not want to be timid about pursuing them – thus
we will use this investment to hire on the business side of the Deno company.</p>
<p>Try <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno Deploy</a> - you will be surprised at the speed
and simplicity.</p>
