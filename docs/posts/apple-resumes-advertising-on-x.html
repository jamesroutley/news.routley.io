<dd>
<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in
more than a year. The company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">had stopped advertising</a> on
the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial
remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>For example, the @Apple account is <a href="https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659">running an ad</a> promoting
Safari’s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors
contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. The @AppleTV account has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701">also
been running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href="https://x.com/breakingbaht/status/1724892505647296620">a tweet from a rando</a> that stated “I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.”</p>

<p>Musk clearly learned his lesson. Since then, he’s been lying low, out of the public eye, and refraining from any sort of controversial statements or actions. He barely even tweets anymore. The one and only time I can recall him even being in the news in the last 18 months was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1">this year-ago profile in the Wall Street Journal</a> documenting Musk’s health and nutrition regimen. So it’s all cool now and Apple feels comfortable advertising on the social network Musk wholly owns.</p>
