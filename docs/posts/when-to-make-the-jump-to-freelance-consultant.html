    <h1>Ask HN: When to make the jump to freelance/consultant?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m working full time as a data engineer/scientist but I also have one ongoing customer (a previous employer).</p><p>Another previous employer is launching a startup and has recently pinged me because they need to build a series of data pipelines and ML models for their product.</p><p>I&#39;ve to talk to them about specifics but I don&#39;t see myselft having enough available time to make it work.</p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about starting my own data/ml services company for a while but I don&#39;t really know when to make the jump. I think (is a guess for the time being) that the income from this new job, in addition to the income of my current client, could be enough for my living expenses of this year, so I&#39;m thinking if this is a good time to make the jump or not.</p><p>The problem that I see is that this new lead is from a previous partner of my current client, so both jobs are related to my previous employer, I don&#39;t have a pipeline of possible prospects for my service, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to generate a pool of prospects while doing the work for this customers.</p><p>My guess is that I should wait until there is a sign that I could probably get a stream of clients to keep the wheel going, and try to find the time to take this new job, maybe negotiating terms to make it possible.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Edit: I&#39;ve savings already as I plan to buy a new home (I&#39;m in Argentina, we buy it cash, no mortgage). I need three more months of salary to accomplish the home budget.</p></div></div></div>
