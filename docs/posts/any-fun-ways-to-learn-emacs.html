    <h1>Ask HN: Any fun ways to learn Emacs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve been using vim for years, but after a traumatic brain injury my muscle memory for typing got a bit scrambled at the same time my need for something that was <i>always</i> installed everywhere dwindled. I’d kind of like to finally see what the deal is with emacs, but as holding down multiple keys simultaneously is now more than a bit hard (and so is memorizing all the chords) I’m looking for a game or typing tutor or similar sort of experience that can help me pick up emacs gradually and help me build a new muscle memory without having to actually work on anything important.</p><p>Over the years I’ve seen a bunch of games aimed at getting used to vim-style navigation, but not come across anything emacs-centric.</p><p>Alternatively I suppose I could just got evil, but as I’ve not used emacs practically I’m a bit confused how you don’t end up with a hybrid of home row touch typing plus having to wander about for whatever chords remain, which seems more like the worst of both worlds rather than the best.</p></div></div></div>
