    <h1>Why &#39;Atomic Habits&#39; may not be working for you</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><b>The backstory</b></p>

<p>I want to do well in these areas on a daily basis: <mark>Sleep, Meditation, Exercise, 16 hour IF, Journaling, Deep Work, Hobby, Reading</mark>. Over the past several years, I have figured out that these few things (80:20) work well for me, and I am not on the lookout for new habits or ideas to improve.</p>

<p>I noticed that other than 1 or 2, I was doing terrible in almost every other area. In the last few months, the one that was thriving was ‚ÄòDeep Work&#39; ‚Äî thanks to the rewrite. But what I really wanted was balance. I was hoping that I&#39;d get that balance back once the rewrite was over. But I was wrong. Despite trying several things, I would fail from time to time.</p>

<p>In addition to the above problems, I started noticing that I was wasting a lot of time on the internet and also procrastinating on very simple things. I have the <a href="https://heyfocus.com/" target="_blank">Focus app</a> on my laptop, which does not let me browse social media beyond a set time period. Similarly, I have disabled Safari on my phone. But it had become very easy for me to turn these safety measures off and use them however I pleased. Restarting habits after a break can be a big challenge. That‚Äôs when I started re-reading ‚ÄòAtomic Habits‚Äô hoping that it would help me return to normalcy.</p>

<p><b>What is atomic habits?</b></p>

<p>Many claim that the entire book could have been condensed into a single blog post. While that is not entirely wrong. I enjoyed listening to it on Audible. It has many anecdotes that lead to several ideas. I am fine with this approach as long as it is not very repetitive and does not deviate from the main theme. Sometime back, I shared the following with a friend.</p>

<p><mark>Watching a TED talk gets you high for an hour. Watching an inspiring movie gets you thinking for a day. Reading a book keeps us motivated for about a week.</mark></p>

<p>Atomic Habits is a decent book in that regard. You&#39;ll come across a lot of entertaining and inspiring stories.</p>

<p>Does it not work? It definitely works! When I first read it, it was like discovering some secret that was preventing me from becoming the best version of myself. I followed it religiously for a good amount of time. I was impressed with the results. I recommend it to a lot of people. I even gifted it to many of my friends and acquaintances on certain occasions. Such was the belief. </p>

<p><b>Why rant if it works?</b></p>

<p>Also, this time I was finding many things in the book silly / inconvenient / difficult etc. For example:</p>

<p><b>Make it Invisible</b> - I want to get rid of WhatsApp but I can&#39;t. It has become the de-facto medium.</p>

<p>After all this, I started thinking that there is something seriously wrong with us. <mark>Why is something that is good for us and we sincerely want to do so hard to do?</mark>  Why is this feeling like drudgery? The common approach of most authors in the habit space is:</p>

<blockquote>Me: I am not feeling like doing xyz.</blockquote>

<p>After a heavy dinner, we swear we will never eat so much again. But we repeat it the following day. We tell ourselves we will exercise tomorrow, but that tomorrow never comes. Sometimes I wonder if this is some sort of split personality disorder? The person deciding has no relation whatsoever to the person supposed to actually do the stuff. Why does this happen? </p>

<p>I feel this is like putting a bandaid on a broken leg. There is something else at play. As Einstein said - <mark>You cannot solve a problem at the same level at which it was created.</mark>  Without getting a control over our thoughts, we cannot control our actions.</p>

<p><b>So, why does this happen?</b></p>

<blockquote>We are addicted to something else which is simple and more enticing than one of our good habits.</blockquote>

<p>It could be a visit to Twitter or Instagram. Or a quick email check in the name of ‚Äúwork‚Äù. Many a time, it could be negative thought patterns - we keep thinking about things that went wrong / could go wrong. While this may not seem like a big deal, regret and anxiety can cripple us. </p>

<p>Our brain craves stimulation - News / Netflix / Food / &lt;insert-addiction-here&gt;. Excessive indulgence in the above has resulted in a resistance similar to that of addictive drugs / insulin. So it is extremely difficult for us to do something less stimulating, such as sitting idle for a few minutes. </p>

<p>In such a state, forget building new good habits. We stop doing things that we were perfectly fine with till yesterday. It is no fun to have a feeling that there is too much to do all the time. As tasks pile up, we stop doing simple but less important tasks by saying, <mark>Doing this won‚Äôt matter when I have so much backlog and more important things pending.</mark> We eventually do only what is absolutely necessary to survive. Our quality of life nosedives, and we start feeling terrible and helpless.</p>

<p><b>Hmmm, how do I fix this?</b></p>

<p>For the vast majority of people, the only thing that needs to be changed is their mindset. In order to get our house in order, we need to get de-addicted to whatever we are hooked to. and that is achievable through meditation.</p>

<p>Meditation helps us get the energy to do what is needed in life. Once we start meditating, distractions subside, addictions become powerless, and we actually do what is important.</p>

<p><b>Will it work for me?</b></p>

<blockquote>Turn on a timer for 20 minutes. Focus on your breath. If you catch yourself thinking about something, tell yourself now is not the time time to think about it and get back to focusing on your breath<br/></blockquote>

<p>No shortcuts, no guided meditation etc.. Just sit for 20 minutes first thing in the morning. <mark>The tougher it is, more you will benefit from it.</mark> At the end of 20 minutes, irrespective of how many times you got distracted, it‚Äôs a victory.  If you have the appetite, you can add another 20 minutes slot in the evening/night.</p>

<p><strong>My experience:</strong> I started meditating and started noticing the following (in chronological order):</p>

<p>1. Repetitive thoughts dwindled, and I was feeling relaxed within a day or two. I wondered how on earth I allowed this kind of misery all this time? </p>

<blockquote>There were times when I gave in to my bad habits. But after a while, I would feel that the earth would continue to spin if I did not give in, and that was the turning point üòä </blockquote>

<p><b>What about my habits?</b></p>

<p>So far, I have not felt like skipping meditation on any day. But I am aware that day will soon arrive, and I will try my best to avoid it. The human brain is capable of convincing itself of anything. We are creatures of convenience.</p>
