<p>Facing possible legislation that would require messaging services to offer backdoors in end-to-end encryption, Apple is saying it would rather remove apps like iMessage and FaceTime entirely from the UK market (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66256081">via BBC News</a>).</p>



<p>The new Online Safety Bill is currently under review. Apple, WhatsApp, Signal, and other services have voiced their opposition to the proposal.</p>



<p>The UK government <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/27/apple-online-safety-bill-encryption/">wants the ability to scan end-to-end encrypted messages</a>, for child-abuse material and other illegal content. They argue the existing law accommodates this but is technically outdated by the security provisions of modern technology.</p>



<p>Apple has submitted a nine-page opposition to the planned bill. It strongly objects to requirements such as backdoors for end-to-end encryption, reporting changes to product security features before they are released and being forced to disable security features before an appeals process can take place.</p>



<p>The company said it would not make changes for one country that would weaken security for all of its users, threatening instead to disable iMessage and FaceTime for UK customers.</p>



<p>The proposed law is currently undergoing an eight-week consultation period. Obviously, Apple and others hope the government will revise the bill in response to the criticism.</p>



<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/07/apple-confirms-that-it-has-stopped-plans-to-roll-out-csam-detection-system/">Apple previously withdrew plans</a> for its own CSAM-scanning feature for iCloud Photos, following pushback from customers and human rights groups. Appleâ€™s solution was more privacy-preserving than what is now proposed by the UK government.</p>
