    <h1>Ask HN: Has Google search become quantitatively worse?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I used to have better time googling in the past. I struggle to find things I remember finding in the past using google. I think I might be stuck in some old habits of googling and I&#39;ve lost touch with modern google.<p>For example, google seems to want full sentences instead of just keywords now. &#34;How do I do X?&#34; seems to get me better(?) results then &#34;X + some relevant keyword&#34;. But I can&#39;t seem to get past this &#34;most popular responses&#34; google things I need. I do appreciate youtube videos marked at certain times but watching video isn&#39;t always what I want to do.
Tangentially, has youtube search been integrated to youtube search or something now? I used to be able to search obscure music in youtube. &#34;Sal dulu a&#34; would both recommend &#34;Sal dulu antasma&#34; and list it but now unless i search for that particularly, it doesn&#39;t show up.</p><p>Any pro tips on how to google (or use search engines) like a modern human would be appreciated. Or modern version of google dorking (which also seems to not work like it used to for me). Thank you.</p></div></div>
