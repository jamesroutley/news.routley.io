    <h1>Halt and Catch Fire Syllabus (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="about">
      

<p>This site features a curriculum developed around the television series, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;q=halt+and+catch+fire">Halt and Catch Fire</a> (2014-2017), a fictional narrative about people working in tech during the 1980s-1990s.</p>

<p>The intent is for this website to be used by self-forming small groups that want to create a “watching club” (like a book club) and discuss aspects of technology history that are featured in this series.</p>

<p>There are 15 classes, for a “semester-long” course:</p>
