    <h1>Ask HN: My GPT project has become a local hit but I can&#39;t afford the bill</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello,</p><p>I&#39;m an HN user for 5-6 years but I wanted to use an alt for this as it&#39;s a bit sensitive.</p><p>Last week I created a ChatGPT clone for my city. It&#39;s basically a laravel app hooked up to GPT3.5-turbo with a custom prompt that makes local references and talks in the way that people in my city talk.</p><p>It&#39;s been a surprise hit and now I&#39;ve had 20,000 chats coming through in one day - people where I live really seem to love it</p><p>The problem is that I likely can&#39;t afford to keep hosting this. It&#39;s cost me $50/day for one day, and Adsense doesn&#39;t allow &#39;chat apps&#39;, so I&#39;m at a loss at how to cover the bill for this app. I&#39;ve already optimised the prompt and reduced the number of tokens I&#39;m sending</p><p>The app a joke really, but it&#39;s a local joke that seems to be quite popular and connecting with my city. Should I try to raise donations? Is there an advertising provider I could use that would potentially cover the costs? Is there an alternative to OpenAI that is comparable to GPT-3.5 that I could self-host cheaper?</p><p>Any and all advice appreciated. I don&#39;t care about profit - I just want to keep the app online so people can enjoy it.</p></div></div></div>
