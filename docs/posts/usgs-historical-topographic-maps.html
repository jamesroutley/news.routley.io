    <h1>USGS Historical Topographic Maps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In collaboration with the US Geological Survey (USGS), we recently updated Esri’s online USGS historical topographic map collection with over 1,745 new maps, bringing the total number of maps in our collection to over 181,000 (181,008 to be exact). We also corrected a number of maps that our users reported as having georeferencing or other errors.</p>
<p>These maps are part of the USGS <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/historical-topographic-map-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historical Topographic Map Collection</a> (HTMC) which includes all the historical topographic quadrangle maps (quads) that had been printed since the USGS topographic mapping program was initiated in 1879. More about this below.</p>
<p>Esri’s USGS historical topographic map collection contains historical quads (excluding orthophoto quads) dating from 1884 to 2006 with scales ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:250,000. The scanned maps can be used in ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Enterprise. They can also be downloaded as georeferenced TIFs for use in other applications.</p>

<p>We make it easy for you to explore and download these maps, or quickly create an ArcGIS Online map, using our <a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/topomapexplorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historical Topo Map Explorer app</a>. Originally launched in 2014, we recently updated the app with a new look and new features, like overlaying the historical maps on a satellite image or 3D hillshade and adding labels for current geographic features (figure 1). The app provides a visual interface to search and explore the historical maps by geographic extent, publication year, and map scale. Learn more about the app in <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/historical-topo-map-explorer-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a> by John Nelson and friends. You can also access the app from ArcGIS online <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/historical-topo-map-explorer-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1. The recently updated Historical Topo Map Explorer app helps you visually explore and access over 181,000 historical scanned USGS topo maps, and you can add terrain, satellite imagery, and labels to the display.</em></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the historical maps in Esri’s collection are part of the USGS HTMC (<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/historical-topographic-map-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a> to learn more). This collection is the product of the USGS <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/publications/scanning-and-georeferencing-historical-usgs-quadrangles-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historical Quadrangle Scanning Project</a> which was launched in 2011 to provide a digital archive of the irreplaceable collection of topographic maps in the USGS Reston Map Library. The HTMC includes all scales and all editions of the topographic maps published by the USGS from 1884, when “John Wesley Powell persuaded the U.S. Congress to authorize the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to begin systematic topographic mapping of the United States” (see <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/publications/a-125-year-history-topographic-mapping-and-gis-us-geological-survey-1884-2009-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this source</a>) thus initiating the US topographic mapping program, and 2006, when “the final maps created using traditional cartographic methods and lithographic printing processes were published (see <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/national-geospatial-program/historical-topographic-maps-preserving-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this source</a>).”</p>
<p>Regarding the map scales, according to the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/0015/report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USGS</a>:</p>
<p><em>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publishes maps at various scales. The scale used for most U.S. topographic mapping is 1:24,000. USGS maps at this scale cover an area measuring 7.5 minutes of latitude and 7.5 minutes of longitude and are commonly called 7.5-minute quadrangle maps. Map coverage for most of the United States has been completed at this scale, except for Puerto Rico, which is mapped at 1:20,000 and 1:30,000, and for a few States that have been mapped at 1:25,000. Most of Alaska has been mapped at 1:63,360, with some populated areas also mapped at 1:24,000 and 1:25,000.</em></p>
<p>Previously available only as printed lithographic copies, the historical maps were scanned “as is” to create high-resolution images that capture the content and condition of each map sheet. All maps were georeferenced, and map metadata was captured as part of the process.</p>
<p>For the Esri collection, the scanned maps were published as an <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ee19794feeed4e068ba99b2ddcb6c2db" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcGIS Online image service</a> that can be viewed on the web and allows users to download individual scanned images.</p>
<p>For maps that are not in the Esri collection and maps after 2006, the USGS <a href="https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Map Downloader app</a> is the primary portal for finding and downloading maps and other data products of the USGS National Geospatial Program. The <a href="https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/viewer/#4/40.01/-100.06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topoView app</a> provides a visual overview of the HTMC and serves maps in additional formats. You can also create on demand maps using the <a href="https://topobuilder.nationalmap.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topoBuilder app</a>.
