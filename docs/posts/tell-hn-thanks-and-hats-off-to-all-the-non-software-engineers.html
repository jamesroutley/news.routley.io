    <h1>Tell HN: Thanks and hats off to all the non software engineers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It&#39;s amazing what civil, mechanical, structural, electrical and all other &#34;real world&#34; engineers have built for us. They need to be paid way more than software engineers IMO considering how critical their work is. Yes, I know it&#39;s a pipe dream, cause supply and demand. &#34;Have you seen how much big tech makes?&#34;.</p><p>Whenever my mind wanders off and lands on a video of practical engineering, it boggles my mind how complex real world systems are put in place. Big hats off to those engineering these systems so us pampered folks can whine about RTO vs WFH and Rust vs Go.</p></div></div></div>
