    <h1>Nintendo forces Garry&#39;s Mod to delete 20 years of content</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>PC gaming classic <em>Garry&#39;s Mod</em> is nearly 20 years worth of content, as Nintendo has issued a takedown notice for all Nintendo-based user content in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/4200245595694413052" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/4200245595694413052" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Steam Workshop</a> for the game. Garry, the eponymous creator of the game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494" data-url="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">confirmed on Twitter/X </a>today that there is no mistake, Nintendo themselves issued the major takedown notice.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit, so this will now continue as planned.

However, Garry took to the internet to confirm Nintendo&#39;s involvement. He tweeted, &#34;I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit, so this will now continue as planned. Sorry. 🫸🍄🗑️&#34; The Garry&#39;s Mod Steam page notes that the process of complying with the takedown will take much time, adding &#34;If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot.&#34; </p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tKXorSz375XcqBEPYFASsL"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Join the experts who read Tom&#39;s Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news — and have for over 25 years.
