            <p>As Windows 11 is now upon us, users of Windows are faced with upgrading their software before Windows 10 support ends and you’ll no longer get security or other updates. If your PC is older than a few years, however, you’ll have additional challenges because Windows 11 has new hardware requirements that your system may not meet.</p>
<p>Even if your equipment does meet the requirements, there are numerous reasons why you should reconsider the casual path of just installing a newer Windows and look at other options</p>
<p>And if you are concerned about privacy, flexibility, sustainability, and other factors, consider a real upgrade … to Linux.</p>
