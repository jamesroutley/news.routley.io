    <h1>The next two years of software engineering</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
        <p>The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new generation of developers is entering the workforce with a different calculus: pragmatic about career stability, skeptical of hustle culture, and raised on AI assistance from day one.</p>

<p>What happens next is genuinely uncertain. Below are five critical questions that may shape software engineering through 2026, with two contrasting scenarios for each. These aren’t really predictions, but lenses for preparation. The goal is a clear roadmap for handling what comes next, grounded in current data and tempered by the healthy skepticism this community is known for.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="1-the-junior-developer-question">1. The Junior developer question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Junior developer hiring could collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry. Both futures require different survival strategies.</strong></p>

<p>The traditional pathway of “learn to code, get junior job, grow into senior” is wobbling. A <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Harvard study of 62 million workers</a> found that when companies adopt generative AI, junior developer employment drops by about 9-10% within six quarters, while senior employment barely budges. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/engineering-graduates-ai-job-losses/">Big tech hired 50% fewer fresh graduates</a> over the past three years. As <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">one engineer cynically put it</a>: ~”Why hire a junior for $90K when an AI coding agent costs less?”</p>

<p>This isn’t just AI. <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">Macro factors like rising interest rates and post-pandemic corrections</a> hit around 2022, before AI tools became widespread. But AI has accelerated the trend. A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team. Companies are quietly not hiring juniors more than they’re firing anyone.</p>

<p>The flip scenario: AI unlocks massive demand for developers across every industry, not just tech. Healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance all start embedding software and automation. Rather than replacing developers, AI becomes a force multiplier that spreads development work into domains that never employed coders. We’d see more entry-level roles, just different ones: “AI-native” developers who quickly build automations and integrations for specific niches.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">Bureau of Labor Statistics still projects ~15% growth</a> in software jobs from 2024 to 2034. If businesses use AI to expand output rather than strictly cut headcount, <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">they’ll need humans to seize the opportunities AI creates</a>.</p>

<p>The long-term risk of the pessimistic scenario is often overlooked: today’s juniors are tomorrow’s senior engineers and tech leaders. Cut off the talent pipeline entirely and you create a leadership vacuum in 5-10 years. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Industry veterans call this the “slow decay”</a>: an ecosystem that stops training its replacements.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Make yourself AI-proficient and versatile. Demonstrate that one junior plus AI can match a small team’s output. Use AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) to build bigger features, but understand and explain every line if not most. Focus on skills AI can’t easily replace: communication, problem decomposition, domain knowledge. Look at adjacent roles (QA, DevRel, data analytics) as entry points. Build a portfolio, especially projects integrating AI APIs. Consider apprenticeships, internships, contracting, or open source. Don’t be “just another new grad who needs training”; be an immediately useful engineer who learns quickly.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Fewer juniors means more grunt work landing on your plate. Lean on automation for routine tasks, but don’t do everything yourself. Set up CI/CD, linters, and AI-assisted testing to catch basic issues. Mentor unofficially through open source or coaching colleagues in other departments. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Be frank with management about the risks of all-senior teams</a>. If junior demand rebounds, be ready to onboard effectively and delegate in ways that use AI. Your value is in multiplying the whole team’s output, not just your own code.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="2-the-skills-question">2. The Skills question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Core programming skills could atrophy as AI writes most code, or become more critical than ever as human developers focus on oversight. The coming years determine whether we trade understanding for speed.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/">84% of developers now use AI assistance regularly</a>. For many, the first instinct when facing a bug or new feature isn’t to write code from scratch, but to compose a prompt and stitch together AI-generated pieces. Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.</p>

<p>The skillset is shifting from implementing algorithms to knowing how to ask the AI the right questions and verify its output. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The first rung of the ladder now demands prompting and validating AI</a> rather than demonstrating raw coding ability. Some senior engineers worry this produces a generation who can’t code well independently, a kind of deskilling. AI-generated code introduces subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities that less-experienced developers might miss.</p>

<p>The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. This is the “high-leverage engineer” who uses AI as a force multiplier but must deeply understand the system to wield it effectively.</p>

<p>If everyone has AI coding agent access, what distinguishes great developers is knowing when the AI is wrong or suboptimal. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">As one senior engineer put it</a>: “The best software engineers won’t be the fastest coders, but those who know when to distrust AI.”</p>

<p>Programming shifts: less typing boilerplate, more reviewing AI output for logical errors, security flaws, and mismatches with requirements. Critical skills become software architecture, system design, performance tuning, and security analysis. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">AI can produce a web app quickly, but an expert engineer ensures the AI followed security best practices</a> and didn’t introduce race conditions.</p>

<p>Developer discourse in 2025 was split. Some admitted they hardly ever write code “by hand” and think coding interviews should evolve. Others argued that skipping fundamentals leads to more firefighting when AI’s output breaks. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The industry is starting to expect engineers to bring both</a>: AI speed and foundational wisdom for quality.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch. When AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) suggest code review why it works, identify weaknesses. Occasionally disable your AI helper and write key algorithms from scratch. Prioritize CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity, memory management. Implement projects twice, once with AI, once without, and compare. Learn prompt engineering and tool mastery. Train yourself in rigorous testing: write unit tests, read stack traces without immediately asking AI, get comfortable with debuggers. Deepen complementary skills AI can’t replicate: system design, user experience intuition, concurrency reasoning. Show you can both crank out solutions with AI and tackle thorny issues when it fails.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Position yourself as the guardian of quality and complexity. Sharpen your core expertise: architecture, security, scaling, domain knowledge. Practice modeling systems with AI components and think through failure modes. Stay current on vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. Embrace your role as mentor and reviewer: define where AI use is acceptable and where manual review is mandatory (payment or safety code). Lean into creative and strategic work; let the junior+AI combo handle routine API hookups while you decide which APIs to build. Invest in soft skills and cross-domain knowledge. Stay current on new tools and best practices. Double down on what makes a human developer indispensable: sound judgment, system-level thinking, and mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-role-question">3. The Role question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: The developer role could shrink into limited auditing (overseeing AI-generated code) or expand into a pivotal orchestrator position designing and governing AI-driven systems. Either way, adding value means more than just coding.</strong></p>

<p>The extremes here are stark. In one vision, developers see their creative responsibilities diminished. Rather than building software, they mostly audit and babysit AI outputs. AI systems (or “citizen developers” using no-code platforms) handle production; human developers review auto-generated code, check for errors, bias, or security issues, and approve deployments. Maker becomes checker. The joy of code creation replaced by the anxiety of risk management.</p>

<p>There are reports of engineers spending more time evaluating AI-generated pull requests and managing automated pipelines, less time crafting code from scratch. Programming feels less like creative problem-solving and more like compliance. As one engineer lamented: “I don’t want to end up as a code janitor, cleaning up what the AI throws over the wall.”</p>

<p>The alternative future is far more interesting: developers evolve into high-level orchestrators, combining technical, strategic, and ethical responsibilities. AI “workers” mean human developers take on an architect or general contractor role, designing the overall system, deciding which tasks go to which AI or software component, weaving solutions from many moving parts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">A CEO of a low-code platform articulated this vision</a>: in an “agentic” development environment, engineers become “composers,” orchestrating ensembles of AI agents and software services. They won’t write every note themselves, but they define the melody: architecture, interfaces, how agents interact. This role is interdisciplinary and creative: part software engineer, part system architect, part product strategist.</p>

<p>The optimistic take: as AI handles rote work, developer roles shift toward higher-value activities by necessity. Jobs may become more interesting. Someone has to decide what the AI should build, verify the product makes sense, and continuously improve it.</p>

<p>Which way it goes may depend on how organizations choose to integrate AI. Companies that see AI as labor replacement might trim dev teams and ask remaining engineers to keep automations running. Companies that see AI as a way to amplify their teams might keep headcounts similar but have each engineer deliver more ambitious projects.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Seek opportunities beyond just writing code. Volunteer for test case writing, CI pipeline setup, or application monitoring: skills aligned with an auditor/custodian role. Keep your creative coding alive through personal projects so you don’t lose the joy of building. Develop a systems mindset: learn how components communicate, what makes APIs well-designed. Read engineering blogs and case studies of system designs. Familiarize yourself with AI and automation tools beyond code generation: orchestration frameworks, AI APIs. Improve communication skills, written and verbal. Write documentation as if explaining to someone else. Ask senior colleagues not just “Does my code work?” but “Did I consider the right things?” Prepare to be verifier, designer, and communicator, not just coder.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Lean into leadership and architectural responsibilities. Shape the standards and frameworks that AI and junior team members follow. Define code quality checklists and ethical AI usage policies. Stay current on compliance and security topics for AI-produced software. Focus on system design and integration expertise; volunteer to map data flows across services and identify failure points. Get comfortable with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Airflow, serverless frameworks, agent orchestration tools). Double down on your role as technical mentor: more code reviews, design discussions, technical guidelines. Hone your ability to quickly assess someone else’s (or something’s) code and give high-level feedback. Develop product and business sense; understand why features get built and what customers care about. Shadow a product manager or join customer feedback sessions. Protect your creative passion through prototypes, hackathons, or emerging tech research. Evolve from coder to conductor.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-specialist-vs-generalist-question">4. The Specialist vs. Generalist question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Narrow specialists risk finding their niche automated or obsolete. The fast-changing, AI-infused landscape rewards T-shaped engineers: broad adaptability with one or two deep skills.</strong></p>

<p>Given how quickly models, tools and frameworks rise and fall, betting your career on a single technology stack is risky. A guru in a legacy framework might suddenly find themselves in less demand when a new AI tool handles that tech with minimal human intervention. Developers who specialize narrowly in “a single stack, framework or product area” might wake up to find that area declining or redundant.</p>

<p>Think of COBOL developers, Flash developers, or mobile game engine specialists who didn’t pivot when the industry moved. What’s different now is the pace of change. AI automation can make certain programming tasks trivial, undercutting roles that revolved around those tasks. A specialist who only knows one thing (fine-tuning SQL queries, slicing Photoshop designs into HTML) could find AI handling 90% of that work.</p>

<p>Hiring managers chase the newest niche. A few years ago everyone wanted cloud infrastructure specialists; now there’s a surge in AI/ML engineers. Those who specialized narrowly in yesterday’s technology feel stalled as that niche loses luster.</p>

<p>The opposite outcome is specialization in a new form: the “versatile specialist” or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMHneaMO-dg">T-shaped developer</a>. Deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stroke), broad familiarity with many others (the horizontal stroke). <a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">These engineers become the “glue” in multidisciplinary teams</a>; they communicate with specialists of other stripes and fill gaps when needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Companies no longer want developers who are either too shallow or too narrowly focused</a>; they want a strong core competency plus ability to work across the stack. Part of the reason is efficiency: a T-shaped engineer can often solve problems end-to-end without waiting on handoffs. Part is innovation: cross-pollination of knowledge leads to better solutions.</p>

<p>AI tools actually augment generalists more, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components. A back-end engineer can rely on AI help to create a reasonable UI; a front-end specialist can have AI generate server boilerplate. An AI-rich environment lets people operate more broadly. Meanwhile, deep specialists might find their niche partly automated with no easy way to branch out.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Nearly 45% of engineering roles now expect proficiency in multiple domains</a>: programming plus cloud infrastructure knowledge, or front-end plus some ML familiarity.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Establish a broad foundation early. Even if hired for a specific role, peek outside that silo. If you’re doing mobile, learn backend basics; if you’re doing front-end, try writing a simple server. Learn the deployment process and tools like Docker or GitHub Actions. Identify one or two areas that genuinely excite you and go deeper: this becomes your vertical expertise. Brand yourself as a hybrid: “full-stack developer with cloud security focus” or “frontend developer with UX expertise.” Use AI tools to learn new domains quickly; when you’re a novice in backend, have ChatGPT generate starter API code and study it. Build the habit of continuous re-skilling. Participate in hackathons or cross-functional projects to force yourself into generalist mode. Tell your manager you want exposure to different parts of the project. Adaptability is a superpower early in your career.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-education-question">5. The Education question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Will a CS degree remain the gold standard, or will faster learning paths (bootcamps, online platforms, employer training) overtake it? Universities may struggle to keep up with an industry that changes every few months.</strong></p>

<p>A four-year computer science degree has long been the primary ticket into software roles. But that tradition is being questioned.</p>

<p>One future: universities remain important but struggle to stay relevant. Degrees stay the default credential, but programs lag behind rapidly evolving needs, hampered by slow curriculum update cycles and bureaucratic approval processes. Students and employers feel academia is disconnected from industry, teaching theory or outdated practice that doesn’t translate to job skills.</p>

<p>Recent grads report never learning about cloud computing, modern DevOps, or AI tooling during their degree. If universities demand high time and financial investment while delivering low-relevance education, they risk being seen as expensive gatekeepers. But many companies still require a bachelor’s degree out of inertia, so the burden shifts to students to fill the gap with bootcamps, online courses, and self-taught projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">Student loan debt is enormous, and companies spend billions training new grads</a> because those grads lack skills needed in the workplace. Universities might add an AI ethics class here, a cloud computing elective there, but by the time they implement something, industry tools have moved on.</p>

<p>The disruptive scenario: traditional education gets increasingly replaced by new systems. Coding bootcamps, online certifications, self-taught portfolios, employer-created training academies. Many high-profile employers (Google, IBM) have dropped degree requirements for certain technical roles. <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">In 2024, nearly 45% of companies planned to eliminate bachelor’s degree requirements</a> for at least some positions.</p>

<p>Bootcamps have matured. They produce grads who get hired at top companies alongside CS grads. These programs are shorter (12-week intensive) and focus on practical skills: current frameworks, cloud services, teamwork. The hiring currency is shifting toward live portfolios, micro-credentials, and verified skills. A strong GitHub portfolio or recognized certification can bypass degree requirements.</p>

<p>Employer-driven education is emerging: companies creating their own training pipelines or partnering with bootcamps. Some big tech companies have started internal “universities” for non-traditional candidates. AI itself offers new ways to learn: AI tutors, interactive coding sandboxes, personalized instruction outside university settings.</p>

<p>A modular ecosystem of learning is far more accessible than an expensive four-year degree. A kid in a country without strong CS universities can take the same Coursera courses and build the same portfolio as someone in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Aspiring/junior developers:</em> If in a traditional CS program, don’t rely on it exclusively. Augment coursework with real-world projects: build a web app, contribute to open source. Seek internships or co-ops. If your curriculum misses hot topics, learn them through online platforms. Earn industry-recognized certifications (GCP, AWS, Azure) to signal practical knowledge. If self-teaching or in a bootcamp, focus on a compelling portfolio: at least one substantial project with good documentation. Be active in the developer community: contribute to open source, write technical posts. Network through LinkedIn, meetups, dev events. Get an experienced developer to vouch for you. Keep learning continuously; the half-life of technical skills is short. Use AI as your personal tutor. Prove your skills in concrete ways: portfolio, certification, and ability to talk intelligently about your work will open doors.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers and leaders:</em> Your credential alone won’t carry you forever. Invest in continuous education: online courses, workshops, conferences, certifications. Validate your skills in new ways; be prepared for interviews that assess current competency through real problems. Maintain side projects with new tech. Reassess job requirements: do you really need a new hire to have a CS degree, or do you need certain skills and learning ability? Push for skills-first hiring to widen your talent pool. Support internal training programs or apprenticeship-style roles. Champion mentorship circles for junior devs without formal backgrounds. Engage with academia and alternatives: advisory boards, guest lectures, feedback on curriculum gaps. Reflect this in your own career growth: real-world achievements and continuous learning matter more than additional degrees.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="the-through-line">The Through-Line</h2>

<p>These scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Reality will draw elements from all of them. Some companies will reduce junior hiring while others expand it in new domains. AI will automate routine coding while raising standards for the code humans touch. Developers might spend mornings reviewing AI outputs and afternoons crafting high-level architecture.</p>

<p>The consistent thread: change is the only constant. By keeping a finger on technology trends (and skepticism around them), you avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. By updating skills, diversifying abilities, and focusing on uniquely human aspects (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) you remain in the loop.</p>

<p>Whether the future brings a coding renaissance or a world where code writes itself, there will always be demand for engineers who think holistically, learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.</p>

<p>The best way to predict the future is to actively engineer it.</p>
