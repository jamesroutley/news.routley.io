    <h1>The Beauty of Pulse Arc Welding</h1>

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="4"><SPAN color="DIMGRAY"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><img src="https://www.hermansilver.com/large-english-tray.jpg" width="700" height="552"/></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="3">As any silversmith 
        knows, silver solder is the ideal material to use when joining 
        sterling by the traditional method of brazing. Sometimes I will 
        receive an object which has been lead-soldered in the area in need of 
        repair (or re-repair). Sometimes the joined area is not visibly 
        accessible, and I don&#39;t know if lead has been used.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="3">In either case, I 
        cannot use silver solder because the high temperature required will 
        melt any lead in the joint and allow it to form its own alloy with 
        the silver. The lead is acting like the Ebola virus and devouring the 
        silver. Not pretty! And, using a low temperature tin/silver solder 
        won&#39;t give me a sound joint or good silver color. For this reason, I 
        use the German-made Lampert PUK04 pulse arc welder – the first 
        silversmith in North America to own this latest model. Pulse arc 
        welding allows me to use solid sterling wire for a prefect color 
        match (silver solders contain less fine silver than sterling).</SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="3">The pulse arc 
        welding principle: Non-toxic argon gas is pumped through a handpiece 
        and engulfs the welding area with a protective atmosphere to 
        eliminate firestain. An electric arc (energy flow) is created from 
        the point where the electrode touches the workpiece. As the electrode 
        retracts, the arc is drawn up from the point of contact. Exactly 
        here, melting occurs, and the result is a clean and stable weld.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="2"><img src="https://www.hermansilver.com/handpiece-tip.jpg" width="700" height="476"/></SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="3">The high degree of 
        precision is made possible by touching the workpiece with the tip of 
        the electrode. The electrical arc necessary for welding is thus 
        generated from exactly this point. By varying the angle at where the 
        electrode tip touches, welds can be accurately steered in the desired 
        direction and previously applied metal &#34;distorted&#34; or 
        modeled. The heat is so localized that I can handle the object 
        without getting burned, even at 1,640 degrees – the melting 
        point of sterling!</SPAN></SPAN></p>

         Sterling Kiddush Cup</SPAN></SPAN></p>
       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">This Kiddush cup was made from 
        very thin material. I reshaped the torn area which extended 3/4 of 
        the way around the stem. I then brought together both sides of the 
        split and welded them together. All voids were filled by welding with 
        sterling wire for a perfect color match. I straightened the stem and 
        leveled the bottom and top rims. I then removed the dried polish and 
        performed a very light hand polishing.</SPAN></p>

       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">Sometimes engraving must be 
        filled in if the material is too thin to eradicate. So was the case 
        with this knife handle.</SPAN></p>

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><SPAN size="3">This 5½&#34;
         Wallace sterling cut glass jar cover was stamped and spun out of 
        extremly thin material. The image on the left shows light coming 
        through three areas of a flower as well as other areas on the piece. 
        These areas were worn through from over polishing. The edges of the 
        open spaces were the approximate thickness of a piece of tin foil 
        (.001&#34;). The PUK worked beautifully, and I used .25mm sterling 
        wire for a perfect color match.</SPAN></SPAN></p>

       <p>
        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">This plate came to me with chased 
        lettering that the customer wanted removed and the overall look 
        brought back to its original beauty. I couldn&#39;t planish out the 
        lettering because the metal would dramatically deform and loose 
        thickness. I couldn&#39;t fill it in with silver solder because of all 
        the pin holes and color difference that would result. And 
        electroforming wouldn&#39;t do. This job required the use of my PUK and 
        was going to very complex. The lower parts of the lettering were very 
        thin as it was chased on a steel form, and the slightly rounded 
        corners would be more difficult to level with the overall disk.

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">Someone had the clever idea to 
        engrave these 1730 caster bodies with &#34;salt&#34; and 
        &#34;pepper.&#34; (The tops were left off to show a larger area of 
        the engraving.) Engraving the function of these pieces is certainly 
        not something I would have done, but to each his own. Since the 
        engraving was too thin to remove by filing, I used sterling wire and 
        the PUK to fill it in. When I photographed the &#34;after&#34; 
        image I had not yet polished the bottom sections of the casters (and 
        the change in the tarnish color is due to the casters handling while 
        welding). The total time it took to fill in the engraving, 
        repatinate, and hand finish the casters was three hours. Larger 
        images can be found <a href="https://www.hermansilver.com/english-sterling-casters.htm">here</a>.</SPAN></p>

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">This rare Jensen piece shows 
        chased lettering that I filled in with sterling (left). The image on 
        the right shows the finished job. A few pin pricks were left to blend 
        with the rest of the surface. If this hadn&#39;t been done, the filled 
        surface would have looked too refined.</SPAN></p>

        <SPAN face="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">This ring&#39;s amber was glued onto 
        the setting with decorative wires above, only 1/16&#34; from the 
        stone. As you can see in the image on the left, the wires had come 
        apart. Since I couldn&#39;t remove the stone, I had to weld the wires 
        back together with the stone in place. Here&#39;s the process I used: I 
        pried open the wires and removed the silver solder. The wires were 
        then sprung back together. I slid index card stock between the wires 
        and the amber to prevent the stone from burning during welding. The 
        wires were then welded together with sterling filler wire.</SPAN></p>
