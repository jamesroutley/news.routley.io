    <h1>Notes on Taylor and Maclaurin Series</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>A Maclaurin series is a power series - a polynomial with carefully selected
coefficients and an infinite number of terms - used to approximate arbitrary
functions with some conditions (e.g. differentiability). The Maclaurin series
does this for input values close to 0, and is a special case of the Taylor
series which can be used to find a polynomial approximation around any value.</p>
<div id="intuition">
<h2>Intuition</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s say we have a function <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> and we want to approximate it with
some other - polynomial - function . To make sure that 
is as close as possible to <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/>, we&#39;ll create a function that has
similar derivatives to <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/>.</p>

<p>The full Maclaurin series that accomplishes this approximation is:</p>
<p>We&#39;ll get to how this equation is found in a moment, but first an example that
demonstrates its approximation capabilities. Suppose we want to find a polynomial
approximation for . Following the definition of the Maclaurin
series, it&#39;s easy to calculate:</p>
<p>(try it as an exercise).</p>
<p><img alt="Successive approximation of cos(x) with Maclaurin series" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2024/maclaurin-cos.png"/></p><p>The dark blue line is the cosine function . The light blue
lines are successive approximations, with <em>k</em> terms of the power series
 included:</p>
<ul>
<li>With <em>k=1</em>,  since that&#39;s just the value of  at 0.</li>
<li>With <em>k=2</em>, , and indeed the line looks parabolic</li>
<li>With <em>k=3</em> we get a 4th degree polynomial which tracks the function better,
and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>With more terms in the power series, the approximation resembles
 more and more, at least close to 0. The farther away we get from
0, the more terms we need for a good approximation <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<div id="how-the-maclaurin-series-works">
<h2>How the Maclaurin series works</h2>
<p>This section shows how one arrives at the formula for the Maclaurin series,
and connects it to the intuition of equating derivatives.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll start by observing that the Maclaurin series is developed around 0 for
a good reason. The generalized form of a power series is:</p>
<p>To properly approximate a function, we need this series to <em>converge</em>; therefore,
it would be desirable for its terms to decrease. An <em>x</em> value close to zero
guarantees that  becomes smaller and smaller with each successive
term. There&#39;s a whole section on convergence further down with more details.</p>
<p>Recall from the <em>Intuition</em> section that we&#39;re looking for a polynomial that
passes through the same point as <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> at 0, and that has derivatives
equal to those of <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> at that point.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s calculate a few of the first derivatives of ; the function
itself can be considered as the 0-th derivative:</p>
<p>Now, equate these to corresponding derivatives of <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> at .
All the non-constant terms drop out, and we&#39;re left with:</p>
<p>So we can set the coefficients of the power series, generalizing the
denominators using factorials:</p>
<p>Which gives us the definition of the Maclaurin series:</p>
</div>
<div id="taylor-series">
<h2>Taylor series</h2>
<p>The Maclaurin series is suitable for finding approximations for functions
around 0; what if we want to approximate a function around a different value?
First, let&#39;s see why we would even want that. A couple of major reasons come
to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have a non-cyclic function and we&#39;re really interested in approximating
it around some specific value of <em>x</em>; if we use Maclaurin series, we
get a good approximation around 0, but its quality is diminishing the
farther away we get. We may be able to use much fewer terms for a good
approximation if we start it around our target value.</li>
<li>The function we&#39;re approximating is not well behaved around 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s the second reason which is most common, at least in calculus. By &#34;not well
behaved&#34; I mean a function that&#39;s not finite at 0 (or close to it), or that
isn&#39;t differentiable at that point, or whose derivatives aren&#39;t finite.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a very simple and common example of such a function - the natural
logarithm . This function is undefined at 0 (it approaches
). Moreover, its derivatives are:</p>
<p><em>None</em> of these is defined at 0 either! The Maclaurin series won&#39;t work here,
and we&#39;ll have to turn to its generalization - the Taylor series:</p>
<p>This is a power series that provides an approximation for <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> around
any point <em>a</em> where <img alt="f(x)" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/3e03f4706048fbc6c5a252a85d066adf107fcc1f.png"/> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness">finite and differentiable</a>. It&#39;s easy to use exactly the
same technique to develop this series as we did for Maclaurin.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s use this to approximate  around , where this
function is well behaved.  and substituting  into its
derivatives (as listed above) at this point, we get:</p>
<p>There&#39;s a pattern here: generally, the <em>n</em>-th derivative at 1 is 
with an alternating sign. Substituting into the Taylor series equation from
above we get:</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a plot of approximations with the first <em>k</em> terms (the function itself
is dark blue, as before):</p>
<p><img alt="Successive approximation of ln(x) with Taylor series around a=1" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2024/taylor-ln.png"/></p><p>While the approximation looks good in the vicinity of 1, it seems like all
approximations diverge dramatically at some point.
The next section helps understand what&#39;s going on.</p>

<h2>Convergence of power series and the ratio test</h2>
<p>When approximating a function with power series (e.g. with Maclaurin or Taylor
series), a natural question to ask is: does the series actually converge to the
function it&#39;s approximating, and what are the conditions on this convergence?</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to treat these questions a bit more rigorously. We&#39;ll be using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test</a> to check for
convergence. Generally, for a series:</p>
<p>We&#39;ll administer this test:</p>
<p>And check the conditions for which , meaning that our series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence">converges absolutely</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with our Maclaurin series for :</p>
<p>Ignoring the constant term, we&#39;ll write out the ratio limit. Note that because
of the absolute value, we can ignore the power-of-minus-one term too:</p>
<p>Since the limit contents are independent of <em>x</em>, it&#39;s obvious that
that  for any <em>x</em>. This means that the series converges to 
at any <em>x</em>, given an infinite number of terms. This matches our intuition for
this function, which is well-behaved (smooth everywhere).</p>
<p>Now on to  with its Taylor series around . The
series is:</p>
<p>Once again, writing out the ratio limit:</p>
<p>To converge, we require:</p>
<p>The solution of this inequality is . Therefore, the series
converges to  only in this range of <em>x</em>. This is also what we
observe in the latest plot. Another way to say it: the <em>radius of convergence</em>
of the series around <em>x=1</em> is 1.</p>
