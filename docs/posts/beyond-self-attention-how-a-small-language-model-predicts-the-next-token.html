After getting it working, I wanted to understand, as deeply as possible, what it was doing internally and how it produced its results.</p><p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original paper</a>, as well every transformer tutorial I found, focuses primarily on <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/the-transformer-attention-mechanism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-head self-attention</a>, the mechanism by which transformers learn multiple relationships between tokens without relying on recurrences or convolution. But none of the papers or tutorials I encountered give a satisfying explanation of what happens <em>after attention</em>: <strong>how exactly do the results of the attention computation turn into accurate predictions for the next token?</strong></p><p>I thought I could run a few example prompts through the small but working transformer I’d trained, examine the internal states, and figure this out. What I thought would be a quick investigation turned out to be a 6-month deep dive, but yielded some results I think are worth sharing. Specifically, I have a working theory that explains how the transformer produces its predictions and some empirical evidence that suggests this explanation is at least plausible.</p><p>For those readers familiar with transformers and eager for the punchline, here it is: Each transformer block (containing a multi-head self-attention layer and feed-forward network) learns weights that associate a given prompt with a class of strings found in the training corpus. <strong>The distribution of tokens that follow those strings in the training corpus is, approximately, what the block outputs as its predictions for the next token.</strong> Each block may associate the same prompt with a different class of training corpus strings, resulting in a different distribution of next tokens and thus different predictions. The final transformer output is a linear combination of each block’s predictions.</p><p>I implemented imperative code that does what I’m proposing the transformer is doing. It produces outputs very similar to the transformer, which I’ll review in detail in a <a href="#evaluating-the-approximation">later section</a>.</p><p>In this post, I’m going to briefly introduce the model and training data, demo some evidence for my proposed explanation, give a detailed walkthrough of the imperative code implementation of it, and present the supporting evidence I have for my theory. I’ve tried to keep the main narrative succinct, with links to relevant technical details and justifications in the <a href="#appendices">appendices</a> or other notebooks in the <a href="%28https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments%29">repo</a>.</p><blockquote><p>This project is my first foray into this type of open-ended ML research. I’m sure I have made errors or omissions that would be obvious to more experienced researchers.

It came from <a href="https://karpathy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrej Karpathy</a>’s video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out</a> (highly recommend).</p><p>I typed in the code by copying what I saw on the screen as I watched the video. For things that weren’t clear onscreen, I referenced the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo for the video</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nanoGPT repo</a>. After getting it working, I made only minor changes to make it work with the rest of the code in/structure of <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my repository</a>, resulting in <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/models/transformer.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this implementation</a>. In summary: the core language model is Andrej Karpathy’s work, not mine. The analysis and all the supporting code behind it are my original contributions. I’ll acknowledge and cite influential papers, posts, tutorials, and other resources in the relevant places.</p></blockquote><h3 id="model-overview">Model Overview <a href="#model-overview">🔗</a></h3><p>The model is a 6-block, decoder-only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28machine_learning_model%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transformer</a>:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/a9f2adc6c1c25ebb263caf42df37f4429c4ed44eda0a0a228cba52b7a00aeb9d.png" alt=""/></p><p>It’s trained on the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinyShakespeare data set</a> which contains 40,000 lines of Shakespeare’s plays. After about an hour of training on an RTX 4000 GPU, it is able to produce reasonable-looking faux Shakespeare.</p><p>Given a prompt, the model predicts tokens that it thinks should follow. Let’s look at an example: starting with the prompt, <code>ROMEO:</code>, and sampling 500 tokens from the model’s predictions, we get:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>ROMEO:

bold virtue that is made a bawd of earth, then the

Second Citizen:

First Citizen:

king.

</code></pre><p>It’s not Shakespeare but structurally, it’s plausible Shakespeare. It looks like the script for a play, the language sounds archaic, the character names/titles come from real Shakespeare plays. Most of the words are English words. Punctuation and capitalization are mostly sensible. Clearly, none of the text actually makes sense, but still, it’s not bad for an hour of training.</p><p>The <strong>tokens in the model are characters</strong>, not words. Given a prompt, the model predicts a probability distribution for the next character. For example, given the prompt <code>&#39;my most gr</code>, the model predicts these probabilities for the next token:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>&#39;a&#39; 0.819

In the transformer I studied, across all 6 blocks, the feed-forward networks comprise over 65% of the total trainable parameters, so they must play some important role.</p><p>As I’ll show <a href="#transformation-via-vector-addition">later</a>, it turns out that the output of the feed-forward network is the primary factor that determines how a block transforms its input into its output.</p><h2 id="demo-my-proposal-in-action">Demo: My Proposal In Action <a href="#demo-my-proposal-in-action">🔗</a></h2><p>In this section, I’m going to show an example that illustrates what I’m proposing the transformer is doing.

</code></pre><p>There’s a clear pattern across these: they all end in <code>y l</code> and several of them end in <code>ly l</code>. Similarity in the space of feed-forward network outputs seems to correspond to human-interpretable patterns.</p><p>Next, imagine we went back to the training corpus, found each of these strings and built a distribution of all the characters that came after them. We’d find, for example:</p><ul><li><code>&#39;hat only l&#39;</code> is followed by <code>i</code> (“T<code>hat only l</code><strong>i</strong>ke a gulf it did remain”)</li><li><code>&#39;l gladly l&#39;</code> is followed by <code>e</code> (“I’l<code>l gladly l</code><strong>e</strong>arn.”)</li><li><code>&#39;n all my l&#39;</code> is followed by both <code>a</code> and <code>i</code> (“I<code>n all my l</code><strong>a</strong>nds and leases whatsoever” and “never saw you before i<code>n all my l</code><strong>i</strong>fe”)</li></ul><p>Doing this for the complete set of 94 strings, we’d end up with this distribution:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/170aed320bd4ab2e2647d8d1ef50b499b215ce1905cff1b5db6fe78dd83c3df3.png" alt=""/></p><p>The various tokens in our model’s vocabulary appear on the x-axis and the normalized frequency of occurrence on the y-axis. This plot shows that <code>i</code> was the most frequent, then <code>o</code>, then <code>a</code>, and finally, <code>e</code>.</p><p>Now let’s look at the final output of the transformer as a whole when given <code>And only l</code> as a prompt:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/08cb64e75759e2a329a0a296931433b06c02c2fb92b6dd0bb440af807cde1d86.png" alt=""/></p><p>This is a probability distribution representing the model’s predictions for the next token. Notice that it’s strikingly similar to the normalized frequency distribution shown in the previous plot!</p><p>We can quantify how similar they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellinger_distance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellinger distance</a> is a measure of overlap between probability distributions. Given distributions \(P\) and \(Q\), the Hellinger distance between them is:</p><p>$$
H(P, Q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (\sqrt{p_i} - \sqrt{q_i})^2}
$$</p><p>Or, in code:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>def</span> <span>hellinger_distance</span>(

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hellinger distance of 0 means the two distributions are identical and 1 means they have no overlap.</p><p>The Hellinger distance between the two distributions above - the distribution formed from the tokens that follow the strings with similar feed-forward network outputs and the distribution the model predicts - is 0.07: very nearly identical.</p><p>For the sake of keeping the demo brief, I chose an example where the first block’s similar strings alone are enough to produce a distribution that closely matches the final output of the transformer. Typically, we’d need to need to do the same exercise - finding the strings in the training corpus that produce similar feed-forward network outputs to the prompt and building a distribution from the tokens that succeed them - for all 6 transformer blocks, and then calculate a weighted sum of the resulting distributions in order to get a good match. We’ll do that in the next section and see that <strong>across a sample of 20,000 prompts, the average Hellinger distance between distributions computed this way and the corresponding transformer output was just 0.17</strong>.</p><p>This small average Hellinger distances suggests the results produced by this approach are a good approximation for the transformer’s outputs. In addition, as I’ll explain in the <a href="#interpretation-why-does-the-approximation-work">interpretation</a> section, I think the approach itself is a reasonable approximation of what the transformer is actually doing.</p><h2 id="implementation-approximating-the-transformer-output-with-feed-forward-network-outputs">Implementation: Approximating the Transformer Output with Feed-forward Network Outputs <a href="#implementation-approximating-the-transformer-output-with-feed-forward-network-outputs">🔗</a></h2><p>In this section, I’m going to walk through in some detail and with code, the exact procedure I used to approximate the transformer’s output using strings that produced similar feed-forward network outputs. If you’re not interested in the implementation, skip this section and proceed to the <a href="#evaluating-the-approximation">evaluation</a> section.</p><p>To recap, this is the procedure to compute the approximation:</p><ol><li>Run a prompt through the model and save the feed-forward network outputs for each block.</li><li>For each block:<ul><li>Find the strings in the training corpus that produce the most similar feed-forward network outputs to the prompt for that block.</li><li>For each string found, build a frequency distribution of the tokens that come after it in the training corpus.</li><li>Sum the frequency distributions for all strings found for the current block.</li></ul></li><li>Compute a weighted sum of the frequency distributions for each block computed in the previous step.</li><li>Normalize the weighted sum to get a probability distribution.</li></ol><h3 id="procedure-setup">Procedure Setup <a href="#procedure-setup">🔗</a></h3><p>The first step of the procedure - running a prompt through the model and saving the feed-forward network outputs for each block - is straightforward to accomplish with some basic PyTorch hooks. But the first part of step two - finding the strings in the training corpus that produce similar feed-forward network outputs - requires some additional machinery to do efficiently.</p><p>I did all the analysis with length 10 strings for compute and storage efficiency (but I also observed that the results hold for both shorter and longer strings). The 1,115,394-character long training corpus contains 858,923 unique, length 10 substrings. Each feed-forward network output is a 384-dimensional vector of <code>float32</code> values and the model produces 6 of them (one for each block). Comparing the 6 384-dimensional feed-forward outputs for any prompt to 6 * 858,923 = 5,153,538 feed-forward outputs from all the other strings takes a long time. To able to work with this data, I had to pre-compute things. I built the following pipeline:</p><ol><li>I chose 20,000 length 10 strings from the training corpus at random to use as prompts in this experiment.</li><li>Overnight, I ran a process to compute the cosine similarity between the feed-forward network outputs the model produced for the 20,000 prompts and those it produced for the 858,923 unique length 10 substrings of the training corpus. I did this in batches and saved the results to disk.</li><li>Even after pre-computing the cosine similarity results, searching through all of them to find the closest matches took a long time. Experiments showed matches of interest never had a cosine similarity below 0.7, so I ran another step to pre-filter the results of step 2 to just those entries with cosine similarity &gt;= 0.7. This greatly reduced the number of entries to search through.</li></ol><p>The code for this pre-computation and pre-filtering is too much to include in this post, but the implementation is available in <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/experiments/cosine-sims.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the <code>cosine-sims</code> experiment notebook</a>.</p><h3 id="procedure-walkthrough">Procedure Walkthrough <a href="#procedure-walkthrough">🔗</a></h3><p>In this section, we’ll build up the code step by step and run it on one prompt at a time and for just one block.

We’ve also got at least one really excellent sample (a min of 0.0013) and at least one really terrible one (max of 0.9994).</p><p>Let’s look at the distribution:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/e9c543696d0748c74bccfac0780e9e6a5cd7610dafc6e650fb5dab2192fc8399.png" alt=""/></p><p>Indeed, the distribution is skewed left, indicating most queries have Hellinger distance scores on the lower end.</p><p>The numbers and the distribution graph look promising, but is the approximation really a good one? It’s hard to say without something to compare against and it’s not obvious what a good comparison might be.</p><p>A thought experiment: let’s imagine that for some prompt, the model produced a distribution that looked like this:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/d01e3755f6278cc6f19ae5656ab3ba6fd7b4ecb59c69303db814b6cc43fb0435.png" alt=""/></p><p>The tokens <code>b</code> and <code>d</code> have nearly the same predicted probability (0.49 vs 0.51). The model predicts an approximately equal chance of these tokens coming next. Now imagine our approximation, or another model, predicted this distribution:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/02bddd27aedd082ab84a2b5dd45dacae4e745dc49ed363df5725916e4b370844.png" alt=""/></p><p>Nearly the same, but the probabilities are reversed: <code>b</code> has probability 0.51 and <code>d</code> has 0.49. Would we care about this difference? Clearly both distributions are saying that <code>b</code> and <code>d</code> are about equally likely. If used for inference, either distribution would probably produce acceptable results. For most use cases I could imagine, the difference would just be noise.</p><p>The Hellinger distance between the two imagined distributions above is 0.0141. Not zero, but we’re saying it doesn’t matter for practical purposes. If 0.0141 is a Hellinger distance that doesn’t matter much, what about 0.02? Or 0.025? We can imagine there is some threshold Hellinger distance below which we wouldn’t care and above which we would consider distributions to be meaningfully different. What is that threshold value?</p><p>If we knew it, then we could look at how close the average Hellinger distance between our approximation’s predictions and model’s come to this threshold. That would be a measure of the goodness of the approximation.</p><p>I did an experiment to estimate what the threshold is. I trained the same transformer architecture three more times, starting with a different random seed each time and stopping at approximately the same training and validation loss as I did for the original model. This gave me three alternative transformers with roughly the same performance, but with different weights due to the different random initial starting points:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Seed</th><th>Est. Training Loss</th><th>Est. Validation Loss</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Original Model</td><td>1337</td><td>0.9334</td><td>1.5063</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate 1</td><td>1442</td><td>0.9293</td><td>1.5038</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate 2</td><td>88</td><td>0.9294</td><td>1.4991</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate 3</td><td>99999</td><td>0.9339</td><td>1.4941</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>I used the same training/validation sets, hyperparameters, optimizer, etc. for the three alternate models as for the original model. The training code and output for the alternate models is in <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/experiments/alternate-models.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the <code>alternate-models</code> experiment notebook</a>. Training code for the original model is at the end of <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/models/transformer.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the main transformer notebook</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I then ran the same 20,000 prompts through the alternative models and calculated the Hellinger distance between their outputs and that of the original model. <a href="#ii-evaluation-of-main-model-vs-3-alternate-models">Appendix II</a> shows the code used to do this. The table below shows the aggregate results.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Comparison</th><th>Mean Hellinger Distance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Original vs Alternate 1</td><td>0.1064 ± 0.0823</td></tr><tr><td>Original vs Alternate 2</td><td>0.1057 ± 0.0817</td></tr><tr><td>Original vs Alternate 3</td><td>0.1053 ± 0.0828</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The original model and the three alternate models are “equivalent” in the sense that they perform about equally well in terms of training and validation loss. I could have used any of them as the basis for this post. In other words, the differences between them likely aren’t meaningful - just noise.</p><p>Across all three alternate models, the average Hellinger distance was ~0.11 ± 0.08. We only have 3 data points, so it’s not a perfect measure, but ~0.11 is probably a reasonable lower bound for the threshold Hellinger distance we are looking for.</p><p>For comparison, the average Hellinger distance between the model and the approximation was ~0.17. A little higher than 0.11, but within a standard deviation.</p><p>Plotting the distributions of the various Hellinger distances shows this nicely:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/d82fe84ec51461c861f5fbc1c2c273935d4d8ac8ceceaeeb292d79cd5fb9ee19.png" alt=""/></p><p>There is clearly less deviation between the alternates and the original model than between the approximation and the original model, but it’s not wildly different. I think this result suggests the approximation is quite good. Most of the difference is within the “acceptable noise” threshold.</p><h2 id="interpretation-why-does-the-approximation-work">Interpretation: Why Does the Approximation Work? <a href="#interpretation-why-does-the-approximation-work">🔗</a></h2><p>The analysis in the previous section shows that the outputs of the approximation are quite similar to the transformer’s outputs. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the approximation procedure is similar to what the transformer is actually doing. The approximation and the transformer might just represent two different ways of computing the same result.</p><p>My intuition is that this is not the case: <strong>I think the approximation is at least something like what the transformer is doing</strong>. In this section, I’ll break down <em>how</em> I think the transformer computes something similar to the approximation and then present some supporting evidence.</p><p>The key ideas are:</p><ul><li>The transformer, as its name suggests*, performs a series of transformations on its embedded input. The transformer blocks transform embeddings within embedding space and the final linear layer at the end transforms from embedding space to logit space.</li><li>Within each transformer block, the transformation from input to output embedding is done via vector addition: the block’s output embedding is its input embedding plus the output of the self-attention layer, plus the output of the feed-forward network. Of the two added components, the feed-forward network output value is dominant in determining the final output.</li><li>Within embedding space, subspaces exist that correspond to specific tokens. An embedding within the subspace for a particular token produces an output distribution in which all the probability is concentrated on that token (that token has probability near 1 and all other tokens have probability near 0). Embeddings that lie between the subspaces for multiple tokens result in outputs that distribute all the probability across those tokens.</li><li>The feed-forward network output at each block is an “adjustment vector” that orients the block output towards the subspaces for the tokens that the approximation procedure would predict: those that follow the strings in the training corpus that produce similar feed-forward network outputs at that block.</li></ul><p>In the subsections below, I’ll go into each of these ideas in more detail.</p><blockquote><p>*It’s unclear whether the name “transformer” alludes to transforming an input sequence to an output sequence (the use case in the original paper was machine translation) or the transformations within the layers of the model.</p></blockquote><h3 id="the-model-is-a-series-of-transformations">The Model is a Series of Transformations <a href="#the-model-is-a-series-of-transformations">🔗</a></h3><p>Once the input to the model has been embedded, we can view the model as a series of transformations:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/c0b6c591002c7e1f931a0bcc794b88454aab02158d1125bef2f8422dbc0e8264.png" alt=""/></p><p>The sequence of 6 transformer blocks takes a tensor in embedding space (\(\mathbb{R}^{384}\), since <code>n_embed=384</code>) as input and outputs another tensor in embedding space.

If we imagine the embedding space reduced to just two dimensions, it might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/12e04e2fdd477aaa55660b4020a4ae6b9a72c55038f98009049330cfecfc4291.png" alt=""/></p><p>The red vector represents the input embedding. The green vector represents the self-attention output (<code>sa_out</code> in code), and the blue vector represents the feed-forward network output (<code>ffwd_out</code> in code). The gray arrow represent the final sum, or the output of the first block: where you end up when you arrange the individual vectors tip to tail.</p><p>The plot above shows the additions that happen within just one block. Subsequent blocks add their self-attention outputs and feed-forward network outputs, starting from the output of this block. If we add the vectors from those other blocks to the diagram, it looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/24b90fb31e5e330043b12b6a3b0bf9e8bed15bbd4cd57e98f0cbdc4b393fc71f.png" alt=""/></p><p>Again, the red arrow represents the input vector, each green arrow represents one block’s self-attention output, each blue arrow represents one block’s feed-forward network output. Arranged tip to tail, their endpoint represents the final output from the stack of 6 blocks, depicted by the gray arrow.</p><p>Though it’s only in two dimensions, the diagram above is based on real data and is drawn “to scale”, in a way: the length of each 2D vector is the same as the \(\mathbb{R}^{384}\) vector it represents for a real query (index 57). In addition, the cosine similarity between each 2D blue / green arrow and the sum of the arrows that precede it is the same as the cosine similarity between the corresponding self-attention/feed-forward network output and the block input in the real data.</p><blockquote><p>Code to generate the 2D representation from real data is in the <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/analyses/70_embedding_adjustments.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embedding adjustments analysis notebook</a>.</p></blockquote><p>We can observe two interesting patterns:</p><ul><li>The feed-forward network outputs are generally longer than the self-attention outputs (the vectors have larger norms)</li><li>Within a given block, the feed-forward network output and the self-attention output point in roughly the same direction.</li></ul><p>Look at what happens when we eliminate the self-attention outputs from the vector sum, leaving just the feed-forward network outputs:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/7fff50753ede8a54541e69eaf00215ea285f523817e8361d1fe08ac5e0c6cd8a.png" alt=""/></p><p>The inner blue curve in the above plot represents the sum of the input vector and only the feed-forward network outputs from each block. The tip to tail arrangement of these vectors ends at a point far from where the previous arrangement (including the self-attention outputs) ended. But notice that the feed-forward-only endpoint (shorter gray arrow) is quite closely aligned in <em>direction</em> with the original endpoint (longer gray arrow).</p><p>This plot shows values for only one query and we lose a lot of information dropping from 384 dimensions to 2. But the pattern does seem to hold in general and in the full, high-dimensional embedding space. The <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/analyses/70_embedding_adjustments.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embedding adjustments analysis notebook</a> provides a deep-dive into this phenomenon across all 20,000 queries.</p><p>The takeaway is that <strong>simplifying the transformation performed by the blocks to just the contributions of the feed-forward networks results in an output vector that is shorter (has a smaller norm) than the original output but points in roughly the same direction</strong>. And the difference in norms would have no impact on the transformer’s final output, because of the LayerNorm operation after the stack of blocks. That LayerNorm step will adjust the norm of any input vector to similar value regardless of its initial magnitude; the final linear layer that follows it will always see inputs of approximately the same norm (see <a href="#iii-the-output-embeddings-norm-doesnt-matter-because-of-the-final-layernorm">Appendix III</a> for a walk-through of this).</p><p>An important clarification: I’m not suggesting that we could remove the self attention computation from the transformer. The feed-forward networks take the self-attention output as part of their input (<code>ffwd_out = self.ffwd(self.ln2(x + </code><strong><code>sa_out</code></strong><code>))</code>); they would compute very different values were the self-attention outputs removed. What I am saying is that, after all block processing has been completed as normal including the self-attention computations, we get roughly the same result if we consider only the feed-forward network contributions, as our approximation does. This is probably because the feed-forward network outputs pass on some of the information they receive as input from the self-attention output.</p><p>For some additional evidence that an approximation based only on feed-forward network outputs can produce similar outputs to the transformer, see <a href="#iv-summary-of-experiment-on-relative-impact-of-self-attention-and-feed-forward-network-outputs">Appendix IV</a>.</p><h3 id="token-subspaces">Token Subspaces <a href="#token-subspaces">🔗</a></h3><p>In the examples we’ve seen so far, the model outputs have been distributions that include significant non-zero probabilities for several tokens. For example:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/a90c56ba1e72733d29a614671ad61789b5196562087c1464273da469843cb54d.png" alt=""/></p><p>Though we haven’t seen one yet, we might wonder whether <strong>specific inputs</strong> exist that compel the model to predict a <strong>single token</strong> with <strong>near certainty</strong>. In other words, do some inputs cause the model to output a probability distribution in which just one token has probability very near 1 and all other tokens very near zero? Such a distribution might look like this:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/ecc30428196c016ef2970ee406b6ea46a79a2a24c1521d8843c2dc90f83ffc83.png" alt=""/></p><p>In fact, we can ask this question about any stage of the model. “Input” doesn’t have to refer to the initial input to the model, but could be the input to any layer within the model. For example, consider only the layers that transform the final block’s output embedding to logit space (the final LayerNorm and linear layers):</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/4c4339d5f6612480cf52b0d34f2c1732c99485033c1196076543f86ec0925af5.png" alt=""/></p><p>Is there some embedding block 6 might emit that would yield an output probability distribution in which some token, say the letter <code>a</code>, has probability very near 1?</p><h4 id="learning-token-subspaces">Learning Token Subspaces <a href="#learning-token-subspaces">🔗</a></h4><p>With the right math, it may be possible to find this embedding analytically. But it’s also possible to “learn” (in the sense of deep learning) such an embedding. Here’s the basic idea:</p><ul><li>Pick a point in the transformer where the input to subsequent layers is an embedding. This could be the input to any of the transformer blocks, or the point right after the final block (as shown in the diagram above).</li><li>Pick a token to learn an embedding for.</li><li>Create an embedding tensor and initialize it with random values. This tensor is the parameter the learning algorithm will optimize; the weights of the transformer are fixed.</li><li>Execute a forward pass by evaluating the transformer from the selected point, using the embedding as input. This will produce some set of logits.</li><li>Compute <a href="https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/#nll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative log likelihood loss</a> relative to the token we’re learning an embedding for.</li><li>Do a backward pass, updating the embedding tensor according to the gradients.</li></ul><p>My implementation of this is in <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/experiments/learn-embeddings.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the learned embeddings notebook</a>. I used it to learn embeddings for all tokens at various stages of the model and saved them. We can load one - a learned embedding that produces a distribution giving token <code>a</code> probability almost 1 - and check that it does what we expect when given to the part of the model shown in the diagram above:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/0dce2cb6b27518fe0a1a26685995c9050cf791b48cc4e407a080182039905dca.png" alt=""/></p><p>As expected, all the probability mass is concentrated on <code>a</code>. Inference using this distribution would generate <code>a</code> with near certainty.</p><p>The same procedure can learn embeddings for use at other parts of the model. If we wanted to find an embedding for <code>a</code> that could be input to block 6, we could run the same learning algorithm but use this part of the transformer in the forward pass:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/37991d03eeb45809255009149e32de771715221bb9d315efb6e2aa78b26a897c.png" alt=""/></p><p>It’s more computationally expensive to learn embeddings at earlier stages of the model because the optimizer has to contend with a larger computation graph involving operations from all included blocks. Thankfully, as I’ll explain <a href="#use-only-final-subspaces">shortly</a>, we need only the embeddings learned for the part of the transformer after all the blocks (embeddings that go straight into the final LayerNorm layer) to show how the transformer operates like the approximation.</p><h4 id="from-embeddings-to-subspaces">From Embeddings to Subspaces <a href="#from-embeddings-to-subspaces">🔗</a></h4><p>For any token, the procedure described in the previous section can learn an embedding that makes the model predict that token with probability near 1.

But I do know how to get a workable approximation of them <strong>if we’re willing to pretend that they are linear</strong>. They are almost certainly not linear, even at the end of the model, because of the non-linear LayerNorm operation. But they are likely <em>closer</em> to linear near the end of the model because the LayerNorm is the only non-linearity. Earlier in the model, each feed-forward network introduces an additional non-linearity via its ReLU operation.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jfG6vdJZCwTQmG7kb/re-examining-layernorm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This post on LessWrong</a> illustrates of the non-linearity of LayerNorm clearly.</p></blockquote><p>Pretending the subspaces are linear actually works quite well for the part of the model after the transformer blocks.

Given one of these vectors, any embedding that falls on its span will produce an output distribution that concentrates all the probability mass on the corresponding token. But many of the real transformer outputs we’ve seen distribute the probability mass across several tokens. How do we get from subspaces for individual tokens to embeddings that produce these more diverse distributions?</p><p>We can create embeddings that produce probability distributions where several tokens have substantial probability via linear combinations of the subspace approximation vectors for those tokens. This is the distribution we get when we create an embedding by simply adding the approximation vectors for the subspaces for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>:</p><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/211fa3aed3f5cbbe1a5adf41e014e27068c39ffaf21aff36c833a851b500e211.png" alt=""/></p><p>The sum of subspace approximations vectors for two tokens is an embedding somewhere in between the two subspaces, which results in a final distribution that is the combination of the two tokens.</p><p>Sadly, adding the approximation vectors for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, without weighting either one, results in not quite a 50-50 distribution across the two tokens (as shown above). I think there are three reasons for this:</p><ol><li>The approximation vectors are just approximations and not perfect representations of their subspaces.</li><li>The subspace approximation vectors are not perfectly orthogonal. To the extent that <code>a</code>’s vector has a small component that points in the direction of <code>b</code>, the sum results in an overweighting of <code>b</code>.</li><li>The final linear layer of the model produces logits of different magnitudes for different tokens.

Of course, there are other examples for which the correlation is less strong. Rather than looking at specific cases, let’s try to get a sense of how well the correlation holds up across all 20,000 prompts.</p><p>This immediately leads to a question: what is the right measure of aggregate performance? Unfortunately, even if the hypothesis - that the prompt’s feed-forward output aligns with the subspaces for tokens predicted from the strings with similar feed forward outputs - is true, a few practical issues make it difficult to demonstrate objectively:</p><ul><li>We don’t have exact definitions of the token subspaces, just imperfect, linear approximations.</li><li>Magnitudes don’t line up: the tokens with the most probability mass in the approximation’s predictions don’t always correspond to the subspaces with the greatest cosine similarity (because of the imperfect approximations, because the adjustment required may be bigger or smaller for some tokens vs others based on the input embedding’s current alignment, because, as explained in the <a href="#mixing-subspace-approximations">Mixing Subspace Approximations</a> section, the model is more “sensitive” to some tokens than others).</li></ul><p>Given these impediments, we can’t just do something simple like normalizing the cosine similarities and computing Hellinger distance with the predicted probability distribution.</p><p>Instead, we need to devise a criterion on which to judge whether the data from a particular prompt supports the hypothesis or not. Then we can evaluate aggregate performance by how many of the 20,000 prompts satisfy the criterion. I experimented with several different approaches and in the end came up with this candidate criterion:</p><p>High-level description: <em>Do the subspaces for the tokens containing 90% of the probability mass in the approximation’s predictions appear in the top half of all token subspaces when ranked by cosine similarity with the prompt’s feed-forward output vector?</em></p><p>Exact definition:</p><ul><li>Define <code>top_n</code> as the number of tokens required to cover at least 90% of the probability mass in the approximation’s predictions for this prompt.</li><li>Define <code>n_subspaces</code> as <code>tokenizer.vocab_size // 2</code> (32, based on our 65-token vocabulary).</li><li>Determine: Are the subspaces for the first <code>top_n</code> tokens predicted by the approximation in the first <code>n_subspaces</code> subspaces ranked by cosine similarity with the prompt’s feed-forward output vector?</li></ul><p>Admittedly, this is an arbitrary definition and reasonable people could debate any of the specifics. But I do think it gives as an indication of whether the data from a particular example prompt supports the hypothesis, while allowing for some of the measurement challenges noted above.</p><p>I evaluated this criteria at three places: the outputs of blocks 6, 5, and 4, using projection matrices derived from learned embeddings at each of these places.</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t evaluate at earlier blocks because the GPU time required to learn embeddings at those blocks became prohibitive. The further back in the model, the bigger the computation graph that the learning algorithm needs to optimize over.</p></blockquote><p>The table below shows the results:</p><blockquote><p>The code that produced these results appears at the end of <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/analyses/50_approximation_details.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the approximation details notebook</a></p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th>Block</th><th># of Prompts Satisfying Criterion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6</td><td>16357 (81.78%)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10142 (50.71%)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>7760 (38.80%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These numbers aren’t exactly a ringing endorsement. As expected, they get worse the further back we go, probably due to the increased non-linearity.</p><p><a id="use-only-final-subspaces"></a>
What if we always used the subspace approximations from the very end of the transformer (which are likely to be the most linear), even when comparing against feed-forward network outputs from earlier blocks?

I accidentally ran the analysis using the projection matrices for the final part of the transformer with the feed-forward network outputs from earlier blocks and was surprised when the numbers turned out to be so good.</p></blockquote><p>It’s valid to use the subspace approximations (and corresponding projection matrices) from the end of the transformer at earlier stages. All blocks operate in the same embedding space and each one seems to make a small refinement on the output of its predecessors, rather than wild changes in direction. So if any block’s feed-forward network output adjusts an embedding towards the subspaces for a set of tokens as defined at the end of the transformer, it is likely also adjusting it towards whatever the subspaces would be for those same tokens at the block where it operates.</p><blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logit lens post</a>, in the section “why? / is this surprising?” provides an explanation that supports this idea. In summary, the residual connections encourage the transformer to learn weights that operate within the same basis across blocks and the use of weight decay in training results in a computation that’s spread out over as many layers as possible, with each layer making only a small, incremental change.</p></blockquote><p>To put these numbers in perspective, I investigated how likely it would be for the criterion I’ve defined here to be satisfied by chance. In other words, if we assume the hypothesis is false and that the cosine similarities between the feed-forward network output and the token subspace approximation vectors are random, rather than expressing meaningful relationships, how likely would it be for the criterion to still be satisfied?</p><p>I ran a simulation of this, taking care to ensure that the distribution of randomly generated cosine similarities matches the real data, among other details. The implementation is at the end of <a href="https://github.com/spather/transformer-experiments/blob/master/nbs/analyses/50_approximation_details.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the approximation details notebook</a>.

But in fairness, they’re still not a slam dunk.</p><p>Even when we use approximations for the most linear subspaces we have, I think there is still a lot of noise in the measurement, for all the reasons outlined earlier in this section. Personally, I take the numbers to be overall supportive of the hypothesis, at least directionally, though I wish the evidence was more conclusive.</p><h3 id="final-summary-of-correspondence-between-transformer-and-approximation">Final Summary of Correspondence Between Transformer and Approximation <a href="#final-summary-of-correspondence-between-transformer-and-approximation">🔗</a></h3><p>The analyses in this post point towards two ideas. First, that the approximation and the transformer produce similar outputs. Second, that there is a correspondence between the approximation procedure and what the transformer is doing. I think the evidence for the first idea is quite strong. The evidence for the second is less clear cut, but still suggests it’s probably at least partially right.</p><p>To close, I want to provide a high-level summary of what I think that correspondence is, even if I can’t yet demonstrate it more definitively:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Concept</th><th>Transformer</th><th>Approximation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Prompts map to classes of strings in the training corpus.</td><td>The transformer learns an embedding scheme, along with weights in its self-attention and feed-forward networks, that cause strings in the training corpus with similar characteristics to produce similar output values. Prompts that share those characteristics also produce similar output values.</td><td>The approximation performs the same mapping as the transformer by examining the feed-forward network outputs from all substrings in the training corpus and identifying the ones similar to the outputs from a given prompt.</td></tr><tr><td>Predictions for the tokens likely to follow a prompt derive from the frequency distribution of tokens that follow strings in the training corpus that produce feed-forward network output values similar to those of the prompt.</td><td>A feed-forward network output is a compressed, latent representation, in the embedding space, of the frequency distribution of the tokens that follow strings in the training corpus that produce similar outputs. The weights in the final linear layer map the latent representation into logit space such that it become the correct probability distribution after applying the softmax operation.</td><td>The approximation reconstructs the same frequency distribution manually, by looking up the strings identified as having similar outputs in the training corpus and counting the tokens that follow them. Normalizing the frequency distribution turns it into a probability distribution.</td></tr><tr><td>Final output is a weighted sum of predictions from each block.</td><td>As shown <a href="#transformation-via-vector-addition">earlier</a>, the transformer output is roughly the vector sum of all feed-forward network outputs and the input embedding. The learned weights in the layers within a block determine the magnitude and direction of the output and thus how much it influences the overall direction of the final sum.</td><td>The approximation performs a weighted sum of the distributions determined for each block. The weights control the degree of influence of any given block and are manually selected to produce results as close to the transformer’s as possible.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="what-about-attention">What About Attention? <a href="#what-about-attention">🔗</a></h3><p>I began this post by observing that most explanations of how transformers work focus on attention but don’t say how attention results turn into the final predictions. I may be guilty of the opposite: I’ve written at length about how the transformers produce their output probabilities and said very little about attention.</p><p>To wrap up the analysis, I’d like to rectify this with a few words about attention. In the mechanism I’ve laid out, whether executed in the form of the approximation or the transformer, a key operation is mapping the prompt to a class of strings from the training corpus at each block. Predictions for the next token follow directly from the distribution of tokens that follow those strings in the training corpus. <strong>Making good predictions depends on mapping the prompt to the right class of training corpus strings. And that is the job of self-attention.</strong></p><p>The self-attention layers learn to identify patterns across the tokens that make up a prompt. Those patterns might be simple, such as a common sequence appearing at the beginning or end of the prompt (for example, as we saw <a href="#demo-my-proposal-in-action">earlier</a>, strings that end in ‘y l’). They can also be more general: instead of matching specific tokens, they might match <em>kinds</em> of tokens, such as vowels or capitals, in specific places. The learned weights in the attention heads determine which patterns they respond to, and thus which strings in the training corpus produce similar values. The output of the self-attention heads, when passed through the feed-forward network, yield representations in embedding space that encode information about the distribution of tokens in the training corpus that follow those strings.</p><p>Because the transformer has multiple blocks and each block has multiple attention heads (6 blocks and 6 heads per block in the one we looked at), it’s possible to evaluate each prompt against a large number of different potential patterns. The richness and diversity of the patterns that the attention heads can identify gives the transformer its predictive power.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts <a href="#closing-thoughts">🔗</a></h2><p>I started this project because I wanted to understand the transformer architecture. It’s given me a satisfying explanation of what at least one transformer is doing, but has been even more fruitful as an exercise in learning how to learn. This was my first foray into an open-ended ML research project on my own. It taught me how to interrogate the internals of models, how to set up experiments to answer questions, and, perhaps most importantly, how to keep moving the project forward when I felt stuck.</p><p>Language models have always seemed magical to me, from the first time I used ChatGPT. I wondered if finding a reductive explanation for what happens internally would rob them of their magic. In fact, I think the opposite has happened. I’ve come to appreciate the beauty in an elegantly simple mechanism that produces such rich complexity in its outputs.</p><p>I don’t know whether the results I found here have any generality beyond the small transformer I trained or if any of it will be of use to anyone else. Regardless, it’s been a joy to do this work and I’m grateful to have had the things I needed along the way: time, resources, and endless support from my family and mentors.</p><h2 id="appendices">Appendices <a href="#appendices">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="i-model-details">I: Model Details <a href="#i-model-details">🔗</a></h3><p>Some notable specs:</p><ul><li>Vocabulary size: 65 (the unique characters in the TinyShakespeare dataset)</li><li>Embedding size (<code>n_embed</code>): 384</li><li>Number of transformer blocks (<code>n_layer</code>): 6</li><li>Number of attention heads (<code>n_head</code>): 6</li><li>Context window size (<code>block_size</code>): 256</li></ul><p>The feed-forward networks comprise over 65% of the total trainable parameters:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span>all_trainable_params <span>=</span> [p <span>for</span> p <span>in</span> m<span>.</span>parameters() <span>if</span> p<span>.</span>requires_grad]

So the first right singular vector is effectively another embedding that produces an output predicting <code>a</code> with near certainty.</p><p>But it’s different from the other 100 learned embeddings in an important way: it’s the vector that is best aligned with <em>all</em> of them. More formally, it’s the vector that minimizes the squared distance to all 100 other embedding vectors. In this way, the first right singular vector is like a good summary of the embedding vectors we started from.</p><p>The first right singular vector is a unit vector (as are all the singular vectors):</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>tensor(1.0000)
</code></pre><p>Any vector along its span will produce an output distribution predicting <code>a</code>, similar to the one above (see <a href="#iii-the-output-embeddings-norm-doesnt-matter-because-of-the-final-layernorm">Appendix III</a> for an explanation of why the transformer output is invariant to the scale of the final embedding). So the span of this vector is a good, linear approximation to the subspace for token <code>a</code>.</p><p>The same results we saw here for token <code>a</code> hold for the other tokens too. For each, if we stack all the learned embeddings and perform SVD, we find that the first right singular vector forms a good linear approximation of the token subspace.</p></div></section></div></div>
