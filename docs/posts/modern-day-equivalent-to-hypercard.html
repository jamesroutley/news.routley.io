    <h1>Ask HN: Modern Day Equivalent to HyperCard?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>My son is 11 and his school uses Scratch to learn basic programming concepts.</p><p>I remember being introduced to HyperCard in the late 80’s/early 90’s. Does a modern day equivalent exist?</p><p>Caveat: I’m a marketer, not a coder (said in my best “Bones” McCoy voice). But I thought this would be a fun father-son thing to learn together and help expand his coding skills.</p></div></div></div>
