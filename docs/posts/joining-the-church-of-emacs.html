<p>Emacs, which stands for &#34;Eight Megabytes and Constantly Swapping&#34; is a 46
year-old text editing program.</p>
<p>Everything about Emacs, from its UI to the action performed when you press the
<code>Enter</code> key, is hackable. You are <em>encouraged</em> to extend the behavior of the
Emacs program by writing functions in the programming language it speaks:
<strong>Emacs Lisp</strong>.</p>
<p>In practice, this means you have over 2000 commands at your disposal, out of the box. </p>
<p>For example, the <code>align-regexp</code> command allows you to vertically align a region
of text based on a regular expression rule. Say you have the following
badly-formatted mess:</p>
<pre><code>one = 1
fortyTwo = 42
elite = 1337
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>align-regexp =</code> after selecting the above snippet will yield:</p>
<pre><code>one      = 1
fortyTwo = 42
elite    = 1337
</code></pre>
<p>This makes for a long-running Emacs joke; the idea that typing <code>M-x literally-anything</code> will result in exactly what you want is very amusing. In
fact, while writing this article I got tired of typing out the markdown syntax
for links, so I searched in the list of commands for &#34;markdown link&#34; and, lo and
behold, <code>markdown-insert-link</code> exists and is even bound to <code>SPC c l</code> (more on
this later). The following comic sums this up perfectly:</p>

<p>Ultimately, Emacs was built around empowering <em>end users</em>, not just developers and
plugin authors, to do any kind of computing they want, without ever leaving Emacs.</p>

<h2 id="emacs-lisp">Emacs Lisp</h2>
<p>At this point, I&#39;ve been using Emacs for a little over two months. During that
time, I haven&#39;t written much Emacs Lisp because I haven&#39;t needed to <em>program</em>
Emacs myself; almost everything that I needed to do was available in the form of
a package.</p>
<p>MELPA, Milkypostman’s Emacs Lisp Package Archive, is a repository of over 5000
automatically updated and curated Emacs Lisp packages. With access to so many
extensions, configuring my Emacs consisted of customizing a few built-in
properties and aggressively yanking other people&#39;s code — just like I&#39;ve done
with VS Code.</p>
<p>In a way, the &#34;real power&#34; of Emacs is lost on me. There are many aspects of my
workflow which would benefit from automation. However, as with all automation
endeavors, how do you know if the cost of writing that script is less than the
total time spent doing the task manually?</p>
<p>Still, using Emacs means you <em>most probably can</em> program that niche script, if
you really want to. And even better, someone might&#39;ve come up with a snippet to
do it already.</p>
<h2 id="eye-candy">Eye Candy</h2>
<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not a very good hacker. Because I care about the way user-facing
programs look and feel. And while Emacs is very attractive to the tinkerer in
me, its UI philosophy is in stark contrast to anything made in the last few
decades.</p>

<p>Back in 2020, a lively thread was started on the <code>emacs-devel</code> mailing list in
reaction to a Redditor asking &#34;Why is Emacs so square?&#34;. Somewhere in the chain
of replies, one can find the following message, by the original author of GNU Emacs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we should implement a mode that puts cosmetics on Emacs so it will
appeal to those who judge by the surface of things. </p>
<p>— Richard Stallman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about this drama, the view of Emacs developers around UI/UX,
and the challenge of making Emacs accessible to a wider audience in the
excellent article <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/819452/">Making Emacs Popular
Again</a>, by the LWN.net computing news site.</p>
<p>No big deal. Emacs is ridiculously malleable and I&#39;m not the first person to
attempt revamping the UI.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>With a good idea of what&#39;s possible, I sought to customize Emacs to my liking. I
was determined to make it look <em>OK</em>. First, I removed the title and menu bars,
the scroll bar, and any cruft that cluttered my 14&#34; laptop screen.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a custom dark color scheme, which was surprisingly simple. In a
nutshell, every UI element has a corresponding <em>face</em>; a set of properties that
controls its background color, its font-weight, its size and so
on. Consequently, writing an Emacs theme felt a lot like writing CSS.</p>
<p>Finally, I needed to get rid of the ugly status bar, or in Emacs-speak, the
<em>modeline</em>. However, handling how the modeline renders each piece of information
available user-facing was a complex undertaking and I didn&#39;t have enough
knowledge of how Emacs works to accomplish what I wanted.</p>
<p>For example, N Λ N O&#39;s modeline code alone is more than 500 lines. For
comparison, my entire configuration is under 400 lines of Emacs Lisp. Writing a
fancy and functional modeline would shatter my complexity budget.</p>
<p>Instead, I &#34;borrowed&#34; DOOM&#39;s modeline, which was luckily published as a
standalone package on MELPA. With that, I had something that indeed looked <em>OK</em>,
at least to me.</p>

<h2 id="modal-editing">Modal editing</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t like Emacs&#39; strong dependence on modifier keys. By default, opening a
file is <code>C-x C-f</code> (i.e. <code>Ctrl+X</code> followed by <code>Ctrl+F</code>) which I find to be very
awkward. Instead, I appreciate (Neo)Vim&#39;s modal editing approach better. </p>
<p>Modal text editing means for example that instead of typing <code>C-n</code> to move the
cursor down one line, you only type <code>j</code>. The downside of this is the
introduction of distinct <em>modes</em>. In &#34;normal&#34; mode, pressing <code>j</code> would indeed
move the cursor down one line, but in &#34;insert&#34; mode the &#34;j&#34; character would be
typed instead. In (Neo)Vim, switching to &#34;normal&#34; mode is done by pressing <code>ESC</code>
while <code>i</code> sends you back into &#34;insert&#34; mode. There are other modes as well, such
as &#34;visual&#34; (for making selections) and &#34;terminal&#34; (for terminal emulation).</p>
<p>There is a popular Emacs package called <code>evil</code>, which provides Vi
emulation. This makes Emacs an <strong>almost</strong> drop-in replacement for (Neo)Vim,
which was important to me as I was a very avid Neovim user before deciding to
switch teams.</p>
<p>Evil worked well for a while. Then I started to notice its keybindings weren&#39;t
working consistently across all of Emacs. I had my <em>leader</em> key set to Space
which meant I could configure it to open a file by typing <code>SPC f</code> from
anywhere. A big improvement over <code>C-x C-f</code>. This approach of using the Space key
for keybindings was popularized by Spacemacs. Yes, the word &#34;space&#34; in
&#34;Spacemacs&#34; supposedly refers to the Space key.</p>
<p>It turns out there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs#Emacs_pinky">many</a>
solutions to my problem with Emacs modifier keys, other than Evil. God Mode for
example works by straight out removing <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Alt</code> from all keybindings. So
that <code>C-x C-f</code> becomes <code>x f</code>. This was nice and all, but I wanted something more
Vim-like. And I was in luck.</p>
<p>Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs. Here is why I decided to go
with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inspired by God Mode, any keybinding of the form <code>C-a C-b C-c</code> is by default
routed to <code>SPC a b c</code>. This meant I wouldn&#39;t have to re-bind every single
Emacs command in order to avoid modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meow&#39;s modal editing model is very much an improvement over classic Vim. It
applies many of the ideas recently introduced by
<a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>. Read
<a href="https://esrh.me/posts/2021-12-18-switching-to-meow.html">this</a> blog article
for a more thorough comparison of Vim and Meow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meow was designed for consistency with Emacs. Unlike Evil, it provides
built-in support for using Space as the leader key. Now my <code>SPC f</code> keybinding
works everywhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What was lost in this little transition is my Vim muscle memory. On the upside,
I found myself to be using fewer keystrokes to achieve the same results. And in
any case, one could not expect to use Vi modal editing <em>everywhere</em>, and where
it is supported, it&#39;s not the default.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-magit">It&#39;s Magit!</h2>
<p>Magit is an Emacs package that provides a text-based interface to Git. Unlike
most GUI interfaces to Git, it exposes everything from the common to the most
advanced Git features with a few keystrokes. I can type <code>SPC v</code> (for <strong>V</strong>ersion
control) to bring up the Magit interface:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://fuzzypixelz.com/images/emacs_magit.png" alt="Magit buffer"/></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>A Magit buffer open to the bottom of my window</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As you can see, it displays the latest local and remote commits, untracked files
, and (un)staged changes. You can stage individual sections of a file by simply
scrolling to them and pressing <code>s</code>; something that is much less ergonomic in
command-line Git and is done through <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging">Interactive
Staging</a>.</p>
<p>Next, press <code>h</code> to bring out a view of all possible actions supported by Magit:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://fuzzypixelz.com/images/emacs_magit_help.png" alt="Magit help"/></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>The Magit help buffer</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This is a high-level view of everything you can do in (Ma)git. Pressing any of
the suggested keys will bring out further menus where Magit will narrow down
your action all while showing you all available options, at every step. </p>
<p>This transformed my Git workflow from reading the man pages and copying commands
from Stack Overflow, to completing my way through the Magit buffer. It also
helped me discover many cool features I wasn&#39;t aware of, such as
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/autosquashing-git-commits">Auto-squashing</a>; exactly
like one discovers functions by scrolling LSP auto-completions.</p>
<h2 id="org-anize-all-the-things">Org-anize all the things</h2>
<p>Emacs comes with support for a document format called
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Org is] a GNU Emacs major mode for keeping notes, authoring documents,
computational notebooks, literate programming, maintaining to-do lists,
planning projects, and more — in a fast and effective plain-text system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use Org for managing notes and to-do lists. Interestingly, the Org file format
includes syntax for scheduling to-do items, managing priorities, setting
deadlines, enforcing habits, and so on. All in plain text. With this information,
Org Mode can scan all your Org files to generate an Agenda view:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://fuzzypixelz.com/images/emacs_org_agenda.png" alt="Org Agenda example"/></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Actionable Agendas</strong>, from the Org Mode <a href="https://orgmode.org/features.html">website</a>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Next, I use the proprietary but very convenient Dropbox service to sync my Org
files with my Android phone. And luckily for me, I don&#39;t have to run Emacs
inside <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a>. Because the
<a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> application provides a touch-screen-friendly
interface to my Org files, and can send push notifications for upcoming to-do
items.</p>
<p>This is <em>very</em> basic usage of Org Mode. If you&#39;re more curious about how some of
the more demanding work schedules look like in Org Mode, I recommend reading
<a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/GTD/index.html">Get Things Done With Emacs</a>
by Nicolas P. Rougier.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
<p>This was a summary of <em>my experience</em> with configuring and using Emacs. I tried
to focus on what sets Emacs apart from other text editors and IDEs. And what I
found to be so special about it. Throughout the last two years, I have used Vim,
Neovim, VS Code, Jetbrains IDEs, DOOM Emacs, Spacemacs and now <em>vanilla</em> Emacs.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that Emacs isn&#39;t a very popular IDE. Only 5.33% of
respondents in the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment">2021 Stack Overflow Developer
Surgery</a>
claimed to use the thing. Despite that, there is a rich community around Emacs,
comprised of people determined to carry it through the 21st century. The fact that
this software project existed continuously for nearly half a century is a
testament to the stubbornness of the hackers involved with it. This gives Emacs
a unique sense of
<a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/">timelessness</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a tale as old as time: a stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic
vimmer -- tormented by Vimscript and his boundless productivity -- makes a
formal request to the netherworld for a transfer. They agree. The terms? He
must lure more unsuspecting souls into a life of eternal bikeshedding. Now he
runs the place. </p>
<p>— Henrik Lissner, author of DOOM Emacs</p>
