    <h1>Abstraction, not syntax</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope=""><header><p>written by </p></header><p><span>The world is growing tired of yaml.</span> Alternative configuration formats are making the rounds. Toml has steadily been gaining traction, in part due to tools like Cargo and adoption in the Python standard library. Json supersets (with <a href="https://jsonc.org/">comments</a>, <a href="https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/json-with-commas-comments.html">commas</a>, and <a href="https://json5.org/">the digit 5</a>) are flourishing, while <a href="https://kdl.dev/"><abbr>KDL</abbr></a>, <a href="https://kson.org/">kson</a> and now <a href="https://maml.dev/">maml</a> promise to hit the sweet spot between friendly and simple.</p><p>While <a href="https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell">I do believe that yaml is harmful</a>, all of the simpler formats are basically fine, and their differences are mostly superficial. The one real difference is in their data models. Most formats adopt the json data model of objects and arrays, while <abbr>KDL</abbr>, <a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/language/syntax/configuration/"><abbr>HCL</abbr></a>, and e.g. <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure">Nginx</a> adopt the <abbr>XML</abbr> data model of named nodes with attributes and children. The rest is just syntax. And yes, syntax <em>does</em> matter, but line noise is not the real problem here!</p><h2 id="syntax-is-superficial"><a href="#syntax-is-superficial"></a>Syntax is superficial</h2><p>Let’s look at an example: suppose we need to define cloud storage buckets to store backups. We want to back up two databases: Alpha and Bravo. For each we need three buckets: one for hourly, daily, and monthly backups. They should have a lifecycle policy that deletes backups after 4, 30, and 365 days. We don’t want to click around, so we’ll set this up using an infrastructure-as-code tool using the following hypothetical configuration file:</p><div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>

But the file also contains two bugs, and switching formats is not going to fix those. Can you spot them? To avoid spoilers, here’s a bit of yaml to pad the page.

Now suppose we need to add a third database, Charlie. We copy-paste the three stanzas, and change <code>bravo</code> to <code>charlie</code>. Congrats, we now copied the bugs. And now that <abbr>LLM</abbr>s are catching on, we don’t even have to copy the bugs manually any more!</p><p>Adopting a different format might make the file easier on the eye, but it doesn’t reduce repetition, and therefore it doesn’t address the real problem.</p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#abstraction"></a>Abstraction</h2><p>While reducing line noise is a noble goal, enabling abstraction is a more impactful feature. We can bikeshed about quote styles and trailing commas, but what we really need is a <em>for loop</em>. This is what that same configuration looks like in <a href="https://rcl-lang.org/"><abbr>RCL</abbr></a>:</p><pre><code>{
  <span>buckets</span> = [
    <span>let</span> period_retention_days = {
      <span>hourly</span> = <span>4</span>,
      <span>daily</span> = <span>30</span>,
      <span>monthly</span> = <span>365</span>,

      <span>lifecycle_policy</span> = { <span>delete_after_seconds</span> = days * <span>24</span> * <span>3600</span> },
    }
  ],
}
</code></pre><p>It’s a bit more to take in at first, but if you’ve ever seen Python, Rust or TypeScript, you can read this file. (For a more gentle introduction, check out <a href="https://docs.ruuda.nl/rcl/tutorial/">the tutorial</a>.) Note how we eliminated two categories of bugs, and made the file more maintainable:</p><ul><li>We can’t mix up regions, because the region is only defined <em>once</em>.</li><li>Instead of a comment that solemny swears that there are 31,536,000 seconds in 365 days, we have a <em>formula</em> that computes this. A large magic number is meaningless, but most people will recognize 3600 as the number of seconds in an hour, and 24 as the number of hours in a day.</li><li>If we ever need to add <code>charlie</code>, that’s a 1-line diff.</li></ul><p><em>This</em> is where the real win is!</p><h2 id="trade-offs"><a href="#trade-offs"></a>Trade-offs</h2><p>While generating configuration solves problems, it also creates new problems:</p><ul><li>The applications we need to configure probably don’t natively accept config in your favorite language. This means we need to introduce an intermediate build step to generate the final configuation files. Features like <a href="https://docs.ruuda.nl/rcl/generating_files/"><code>rcl build</code></a> help to reduce friction, but it’s still an additional step.</li><li><a href="https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/">Greppability</a> suffers. For example, the full names of the buckets no longer occur directly in the source code.</li><li>There is a fine line between tasteful abstraction and overcomplication. After how many lines of duplicated code does the power of a configuration language outweigh the simplicity of plain data?</li></ul><p>When we have configuration files under source control, we can mitigate these points somewhat by checking in the generated files. (Heresy, I know!) This restores the ability to search, and we can now review changes from both sides: we can see the diff in the generator, but also how it impacts generated files.</p><p>Configuration languages like <a href="https://cuelang.org/">Cue</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>, <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a>, or <a href="https://rcl-lang.org/"><abbr>RCL</abbr></a> are designed specifically to eliminate boilerplate in repetitive configuration, but you don’t necessarily have to introduce new tools. A bit of Python or Nix that outputs json or toml can go a long way. Remember that yaml <span title="As of yaml 1.2, but even if the target is different,
the pathological edge cases don’t matter in practice
when we control the generated json.">is</span> a json superset, so anything that takes yaml accepts json! Deduplication beats copy-pasting, and manipulating data structures is safer than string templating.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The world is growing tired of yaml, and alternative configuration formats are making the rounds. I applaud replacing yaml with simpler formats like toml, and I sure prefer working with pretty code over working with ugly code. However, I also think that arguing over which multi-line string syntax is superior, is missing a deeper issue.</p><p>When configurations grow more complex, what we really need is <em>abstraction</em> to eliminate duplication. Real abstraction over data structures, not string templating. That means turning configuration, at least to some extent, into code. How to navigate the balance between code and data remains a matter of applying good judgment, but for large enough configurations, the right balance is unlikely to be at 100% data.</p></article></div>
