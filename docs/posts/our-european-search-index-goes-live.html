    <h1>Our European search index goes live</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>We’ve started delivering search results from our new European-based search index to Ecosia users! This will help us build the kind of ethical and fair internet we believe in. </p><p>Last year <a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/eusp/"><u>we launched European Search Perspective (EUSP)</u></a>, a joint venture with Qwant. The launch marked a big step forward in our journey towards tech independence and digital sovereignty for Europe.</p><p>Now, we’ve taken the next step: our users in France are receiving a portion of their search results directly from EUSP’s own index. We’re aiming to serve 50% of French search queries by the end of the year, and will soon start rolling out to other countries.</p><h3 id="what-does-having-an-independent-search-index-mean"><strong>What does having an independent search index mean? </strong></h3><p>A search index is the database of information that search engines pull their results from. Until now, only a handful of companies have built their own – which means most smaller search engines have to depend on them to provide search results.</p><p>That’s why EUSP has developed <a href="https://staan.ai/"><u>Staan</u></a> (Search Trusted API Access Network), a search index aimed to support a sovereign, privacy-first search infrastructure for Europe. It’s built for alternative search engines and AI companies that need fast, reliable access to the latest web data, while safeguarding user privacy and data security.</p><p>By using Staan as one of our sources, we can start to build greater digital independence and transparency.</p><h3 id="why-is-this-independence-important"><strong>Why is this independence important? </strong></h3><p>Having our own search infrastructure is a critical step towards plurality; a healthy and diverse search market reflecting multiple perspectives, and building Europe’s own digital tools. </p><p>Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, which puts whole sectors at the mercy of political or commercial agendas. To put it bluntly: if Big Tech decided to pull the plug, Europe would be in trouble.</p><p>Creating a fully independent search index means we have more control. We can better serve our users, develop ethical AI, and double down on our mission to build tech that benefits people and the planet.</p><h3 id="an-open-foundation-for-competition-privacy-and-innovation"><strong>An open foundation for competition, privacy and innovation</strong></h3><p>Unlike Ecosia’s steward-owned model, EUSP is structured to allow outside investment –  enabling long-term scaling of its infrastructure. EUSP’s search index is also available to other tech companies, offering a foundation for competition, data privacy, and innovation in areas like generative AI. </p><h3 id="what-does-all-this-mean-for-you"><strong>What does all this mean for you?</strong> </h3><p>At first, you probably won’t notice much change when using Ecosia – this update is behind the scenes. But when we look at the bigger picture, it’s a meaningful step that helps you keep growing your climate impact. </p><p>How? Because it strengthens Europe’s long-term competitiveness, democratic control, and stability. If we have more autonomy over our own tools, we can focus on shaping the greener, fairer tech future we want, and continue expanding our mission to tackle the climate crisis, together.</p>
