	<p>things that i consider to be anti-antihuman.</p>
<h3>software</h3>
<ul>
<li>no lock in. users should not be only able to put data into software, but take their data out. difficulty of getting data out should not be 10x of the difficulty of putting data in.</li>
<li>data vs ui. do not focus on perfect UI. focus on the ability to view data in a lot of different ways.</li>
<li>no tracking for ads. if there is a need to collect analytical data - try to expose it back to the user.</li>
<li>people-first. strive to write software that empowers people and not plays on people&#39;s weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>speak to people same way how you speak in real life. this is the only way to get as close to &#34;authenticity&#34; as possible.</li>
<li>find your voice. it&#39;s hard enough to find your own writing voice. when you found it - use it. do not use someone else&#39;s voice. especially the corporate</li>
</ul>
<h3>support</h3>
<ul>
<li>talk in your own voice. see points on communication above.</li>
<li>if you feel something and want to say something - say it. if no - totally ok.</li>
</ul>
