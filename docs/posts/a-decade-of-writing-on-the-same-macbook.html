    <h1>A decade of writing on the same Macbook</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>A decade, really?</h2><p>Being able to use the same laptop for over a decade should not really demand a post. But, given how devices are considered &#34;old&#34; in just 3-5 years these days, I feel compelled to write something from this same device. This is mostly a reminder to myself, lest I forget of this possibility.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thapaliya.com/assets/images/writings/decade-old-laptop-spec.png" alt="MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)"/><figcaption>&#34;About this Mac&#34; for the laptop.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, you might immediately notice the dated Monterey running on it. Unfortunately, this is the final major version of macOS supported on the device. But, it really only EOL-ed half a year ago.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thapaliya.com/assets/images/writings/eol_date_macos_monterey.png" alt="End Of Life date for some MacOS versions"/><figcaption>macOS Monterey officially EOL-ed about 9 months ago. Screenshot taken on 26th June, 2025</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, I got around 9.5 years of continuous software updates on this device. I think that&#39;s pretty remarkable.</p><h2>The beginning of Macbooks for me</h2><p>I had been introduced to Fedora &amp; Ubuntu Linux around 2005/2006 and basically had started using it full time on my PC, though I did keep switching distros a lot. I have strong memories of device drivers crashing all the time. Back then, it wasn&#39;t as much of a smooth ride to use Linux as it is these days.</p><p>Around 2008, one of my friends got the White plastic Macbook and it just seemed so much more prettier &amp; &#34;stable&#34;. Influenced by that, I got my first Macbook in 2009, just before I went abroad for my Masters studies. Macbooks were of course, rather expensive so this first device wasn&#39;t really fully spec-ed. I just got something that would get me by for the duration of my studies.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thapaliya.com/assets/images/writings/macbook-2009-cdrom.png" alt="Remember the CD-ROM drives on a laptop?"/><figcaption>Ooh! Look at the CD-ROM drive. And the battery indicator, that was pretty cool!</figcaption></figure><p>For a personal portable device, I have never looked back again. That laptop easily carried me over for the next 5 years. The 2009 model was fairly self upgradeable, so I did max out the specs for disk and memory before selling it sometime around 2014. By then, I was already working at a startup that provided me a Macbook Air as a personal device.</p><h2>This current device - Macbook Pro (Early 2015)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thapaliya.com/assets/images/writings/macbook-2015-invoice-date.png" alt="A cropped invoice of the 2015 order."/><figcaption>I still have the invoice, not sure how useful at this point though.</figcaption></figure><p>In spring of 2015, I had just quit my job. Once again, I was in need of a personal laptop. I decided to buy a pretty beefy laptop(given the considerations in 2015) hoping it would last me at least 5 more years.</p><p>It easily lasted my more than 5 years. I had no initial plans of using it all the way to 10 years. In 2022, macOS Ventura was announced and my laptop was not going to get it. That&#39;s the first time I considered upgrading to another laptop. But, for all my personal needs, this device was more than enough.</p><p>Now, I do have to mention that there&#39;s a parallel timeline of NixOS based workstation/laptop that I started using since 2015. But, that&#39;s a post for another day.</p><p>It just hit me one day that I could just keep pushing this laptop to the 10 year mark, instead of selling it while I still somewhat could. That would be a pretty fun personal achievement for a device that I used everyday. In 2024, I joined Antler to start a tech. company. The majority of the software written for this startup so far is on this 10 year old laptop, which I do feel pretty smug about.</p><h2>What&#39;s next?</h2><p>Given my comfortablity of custom NixOS based setups, I felt towards the end of &#39;10s that I would probably not get another Macbook, esp. given the lack of GPUs etc. But, everything changed with the introduction of M-series Macbooks. After, looking at them from the sidelines, I am convinced that they&#39;re the best in class hardware for a laptop form factor right now.</p><p>So, once again it&#39;s time to get a new Macbook. Over the next month, I plan to phase out this laptop into one of the recent Apple silicon based devices. And, I hope to write a similar post once again in 2035. Wish me luck!</p><figure><img src="https://www.thapaliya.com/assets/images/writings/macbooks-2015-2025.png" alt="A 2025 Macbook on top of a 2015 Macbook"/><figcaption>Got the black one instead of the signature aluminium. Let&#39;s hope this was not a bad idea.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
