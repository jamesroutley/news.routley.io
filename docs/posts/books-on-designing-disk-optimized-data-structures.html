    <h1>Ask HN: Books on designing disk-optimized data structures?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Are there canonical books, resources, or readings for how to design data structures that will be primarily read and written to a <i>disk</i> rather than memory? Most of what I learned in school about big-O assumes that, for example, random access is O(1). However, random disk reads are really slow due to spacial locality.</p><p>People who write databases obviously have solutions to this problem - for example, DuckDB is based on a number of papers that have come out over the years on this topic.</p><p>If I wanted to design, ie, a tree structure which was intended to be read/written from a disk, are there general principles or patterns the have been developed to take advantage of locality of reference, minimize random reads, or decrease the overhead of writes, that I could familiarize myself with?</p><p>What is the CLRS for disk?</p></div></div></div>
