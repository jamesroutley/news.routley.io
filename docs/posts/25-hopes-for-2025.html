    <p>Writing this is a new tradition for me, it&#39;s funny! I&#39;ve done <a href="https://olu.online/23-hopes-for-2023">23 hopes for 2023</a> and <a href="https://olu.online/24-hopes-for-2024">24 for 2024</a> so here we go again.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not hoping for world peace (or more wishes) in this list, as ever, we&#39;re keeping it easy-breezy:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;ve booked a longsword class finally! I want to enjoy that enough to keep it up, or quickly work out I don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t know how long it takes to get out of beginner classes, but maybe that&#39;s a good goal...</li>
<li>I hope to post a long or short form video at least once a week for the whole of the year.</li>
<li>I hope to blog more on here.</li>
<li>I hope to keep up my <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=weeknotes">week notes</a>.</li>
<li>I hope to keep better note of what actually happened each week with obsidian, and to stay with obsidian for the whole year (at least! i would quite like to stop app-hopping).</li>
<li>I want to visit Paris, or take one trip somewhere outside the UK once I get my British passport.</li>
<li>I&#39;m hoping to actually do more sewing next year.</li>
<li>I&#39;m keeping up my clothing low buy (no buy in 2024!) habits, but I think I will need to buy activewear at some point as I have run most of my leggings into the ground.</li>
<li>I&#39;m hoping to be more flexible in my planning personally; I want to keep the big picture goals in mind but to be better at breaking things down into small steps.</li>
<li>Seeing as I have not done much Betwixtmas coding, I&#39;m hoping to get going on my project ideas, finish Complete CSS and get up to the present day with 0de5.</li>
<li>I&#39;m hoping to be more intentional with my time, but not in a tracking way, just being mindful of how my days pass.</li>
<li>Hoping to create more online in general, and to be more of a poster than a commenter, consumer or lurker (though I love all of those modes I want to try something new).</li>
<li>Gonna try and pitch and work on my writing a lot more.</li>
<li>Hoping to make time to learn some maths.</li>
<li>I want to do way more collaboration on all my projects. If you wanna collaborate, <a href="https://olu.online/contact">get in touch</a>.</li>
<li>I want to read more; looking like I&#39;ll hit 16 (or possibly 17!) books this year, which is less than I wanted but enough. I mostly have specific tech ethics titles in mind, but I have a long TBR to work through and should engage with it!</li>
<li>I want to be more realistic about my time and energy, and not trick myself into self-disdain when I could have easily not have overpacked my to-do list for [time period] and been happy.</li>
<li>I want to sing and play ukulele for fun more often, rather than trying to get &#34;better&#34; at either.</li>
<li>I hope if I end up moving this year, it&#39;s as smooth and painless as possible and that I start putting down roots and building community as soon as I get over the new environment discombobulation.</li>
<li>I want to help people more with tech ethics things practically, as well as talking about it.</li>
<li>I want to close open loops, finish projects, and get to the point I trust myself to finish stuff a lot more.</li>
<li>I want to embed myself in more online communities.</li>
<li>I know I mentioned longsword and exercise clothing already, but I do want to be a lot less sedentary. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be #athletic, but I do want to enjoy movement (and get into powerlifting if I ever find the right gym).</li>
<li>Hoping to work out my &#34;content&#34; &#34;strategy&#34; for the year, and what I&#39;m trying to do with this - *gestures vaguely around* - in the future.</li>
<li>I want to be confident cooking more meals.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you&#39;re having a wonderful day, and have a great year. What are you hoping for?</p>
