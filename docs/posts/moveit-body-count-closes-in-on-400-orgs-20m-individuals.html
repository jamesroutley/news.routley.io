    <h1>MOVEit body count closes in on 400 orgs, 20M&#43; individuals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The number of victims and costs tied to the MOVEit file transfer hack continues to climb as the fallout from the massive supply chain attack enters week seven.</p>
<p>In late May, Russian ransomware gang Clop exploited a security hole in Progress Software&#39;s MOVEit product suite to steal documents from vulnerable networks.</p>
<p>As of today, the number of affected organizations is closing is on 400 and include some really big names: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/clop_broke_into_the_doe/">US Department of Energy</a> and other federal agencies as well as huge corporations like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/10/in_brief_security/">energy company Shell</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/infosec_in_brief/">Deutsche Bank</a>, consulting and business services firm <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1681730221341544448">PwC</a>, and retail giant TJX Companies, which confirmed to <em>The Register</em> on Wednesday that &#34;some files were downloaded by an unauthorized third party before Progress notified us of the vulnerability.&#34;</p>

    

<p>TJX owns several retail brands including TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, HomeSense and Sierra.</p>

        


        

<p>Despite being one of the compromised companies, the TJX spokesperson added: &#34;We do not believe there was any unauthorized access to any customer or associate personal information on TJX&#39;s systems or any material impact to TJX.&#34;</p>
<p>Plus, it&#39;s looking like Estée Lauder Companies, which owns more than 20 beauty brands and disclosed a &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230718384629/en/The-Est%C3%A9e-Lauder-Companies-Inc.-Provides-Information-on-Cybersecurity-Incident">cybersecurity incident</a>&#34; the same day that Clop <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/AlvieriD/status/1681429241878175744">listed</a> the company on its leak site, may be among the victims too.</p>

        

<p>As of July 19, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.emsisoft.com/en/blog/44123/unpacking-the-moveit-breach-statistics-and-analysis/">383 organizations</a> and over 20 million individuals have been compromised, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1682060156857909248">according to</a> cybersecurity outfit Emsisoft, which sourced its figures from breach notifications, SEC filings, other public data, and Clop&#39;s leak site.</p>
<p>But, as the infosec team notes, some of the companies whose MOVEit installations were breached provide services to many other organizations.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That one-to-many impact is a very attractive thing for hackers, and that is what makes supply chain threats so sinister</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case in point: Clop exploited a deployment of MOVEit used by payroll services provider Zellis whose customers include British Airways, the BBC, and the Boots pharmacy chain in the UK, among others, and as a result these companies all saw their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/british_airways_boots_moveit/">employees&#39; records stolen</a> by the Russian gang via the software flaw.</p>
<p>And, as Emsisoft reports, another MOVEit user – the National Student Clearinghouse – partners with more than 3,500 schools in the US and processes information belonging to 17.1 million students. </p>
<p>So it&#39;s likely that the total number of victims will keep growing.  </p>

        

<p>&#34;While this may not be in the same league as the SolarWinds incident, it&#39;s nonetheless one of the most significant hacks of recent years,&#34; Emsisoft Threat Analyst Brett Callow told <em>The Register</em>. &#34;The costs will be absolutely massive, including credit monitoring for millions and lawsuits out the wazoo.&#34;</p>
<p>Progress Software is facing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.classaction.org/news/progress-software-corporation-pbi-research-services-hit-with-class-action-over-moveit-data-breach">multiple lawsuits</a> claiming poor security led to the MOVEit bug – <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/victims-of-cyberattack-on-file-transfer-tool-pile-up-6017b8b3?mod=tech_lead_pos11">at least 13</a>, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p>&#34;To make matters worse, the potential for misuse of the stolen information is significant,&#34; Emsisoft added. &#34;And it&#39;s not only how Cl0p may misuse the information that&#39;s a concern. Once it&#39;s released online, it becomes available to the global community of cyber-miscreants to use in BEC schemes, identity fraud, etc.&#34;</p>
<p>Progress Software declined to comment on how many organizations have been affected by the MOVEit bugs.</p>

</ul>
<p>&#34;We remain focused on supporting our customers and this report suggests that frequent and transparent updates have been helpful in encouraging customers to rapidly apply the fixes we have released,&#34; a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. &#34;We are continuing to work with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to investigate the issue and ensure we take appropriate response measures.&#34;</p>
<p>The spokesperson added: &#34;To our knowledge at this time, none of the vulnerabilities discovered after the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/01/moveit_transfer_zero_day/">May 31 vulnerability</a> have been actively exploited.&#34;</p>
<p>And there have been others since the end of that month.</p>
<h3>A very buggy timeline</h3>
<p>The May 31 bug – a SQL injection vulnerability – was the first. Progress patched this one, tracked as CVE-2023-34362, the next day. A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/12/security_in_brief/">second bug</a>, CVE-2023-35036, came to light on June 9, and was also patched the next day.</p>
<p>Progress disclosed a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/16/third_moveit_bug_fixed/">third hole</a>, CVE-2023-35708, on June 15.</p>
<p>Finally (we hope), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Service-Pack-July-2023">three additional vulnerabilities</a> – CVE-2023-36934, CVE-2023-36932, and CVE-2023-36933 – were spotted and fixed on July 5.</p>
<p>Despite the growing victim count, vulnerable orgs are doing a decent job at remediating MOVEit bugs, according to cybersecurity ratings company Bitsight.</p>
<p>Since the May 31 disclosure, &#34;the number of organizations vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 has dropped such that at least 77 percent of the originally affected organizations are no longer vulnerable,&#34; Bitsight researcher Noah Stone <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bitsight.com/blog/new-research-reveals-rapid-remediation-moveit-transfer-vulnerabilities">wrote</a> in a Thursday blog. &#34;At most 23 percent of the initially affected organizations are still vulnerable while higher rates of vulnerability exist among the later CVEs.&#34;</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, more organizations are still vulnerable to the three most recent bugs disclosed earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#34;At most 56 percent of organizations originally affected by the newest collection of CVEs … remain vulnerable,&#34; Stone said.</p>
<p>Threat hunters at Huntress discovered the second MOVEit bug, and the firm&#39;s senior security researcher, John Hammond, says these types of supply chain attacks are increasingly attractive to criminals because they provide more bang for the buck.</p>
<p>&#34;Whether or not it be attacks like this MOVEit Transfer example, or even past high-impact intrusions like the Kaseya VSA ransomware incident or SolarWinds exploitation, all of these attacks have a certain supply chain aspect that absolutely expands the potential number of victims, bleeding into downstream organizations and the provider/customer relationship,&#34; Hammond told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>&#34;That one-to-many impact is a very attractive thing for hackers, and that is what makes supply chain threats so sinister.&#34;</p>
<p>However, he added, these types of intrusions mean &#34;threat actors can only play that card once for each attack. After downstream victims are compromised, the well dries up, and the adversaries have to move onto their next attack.&#34; ®</p>
