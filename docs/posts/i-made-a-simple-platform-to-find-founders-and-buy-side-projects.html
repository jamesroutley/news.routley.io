    <h1>Show HN: I made a simple platform to find founders and buy side-projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I got overwhelming support and feedback from my last post about secondfounder.com but still, I felt the need of connecting founders together so that they can together buy a side project. It&#39;s very often when a non-technical founder buys a project they have to find a technical founder to take that project further.</p><p>Today I have implemented this feature in secondfounder.com</p><p>Link: <a href="https://secondfounder.com/find-founder" rel="nofollow">https://secondfounder.com/find-founder</a></p><p>Your feedback is always welcome.</p><p>Thanks</p></div></div></div>
