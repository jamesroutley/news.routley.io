The sun’s light reflects off this tail, allowing us to view comets from Earth.</p><p>Nishimura, which has the scientific name C/2023 P1, will pass closest to the sun on 17 September. It will be 33m km (20m miles) from the sun, which is less than a quarter of the distance between the Earth and the sun, Biver said.</p><p>The comet will then pass harmlessly by Earth at a distance of 125m km.</p><p>For stargazers, the comet will be easiest to observe this Saturday and Sunday, particularly in the northern hemisphere. “The best thing to do is look at the sky before sunrise, in a north-eastern direction to the left of Venus, in a clear sky, free of pollution,” Biver said.</p><p>People with small binoculars will easily be able to enjoy the spectacle. But, if conditions allow, the comet may also be visible by the naked eye.</p><p>The comet’s tail is greenish, because it contains more gas than dust, Biver said.</p></div></div></div>
