<p>It&#39;s been nearly 10 years since
<a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.0/">KDE Plasma 5</a>,
which is the last major release of the <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">desktop</a>.
On February 28 the project <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/">announced</a> its &#34;mega release&#34; of KDE
Plasma 6, KDE Frameworks 6, and KDE Gear 24.02 — all based on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6">Qt 6</a> development framework. This
release focuses heavily on migrating to Wayland, and aspires to be a seamless
upgrade for the user while improving performance, security, and support
for newer hardware. For developers, a lot of work has gone into removing
deprecated frameworks and decreasing dependencies to make it easier to write
applications targeting KDE.</p>

<h4>What&#39;s in Plasma 6</h4>

<p>For the purpose of this article, we&#39;ll mostly look at Plasma and <a href="https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/">Frameworks</a>, as Gear 24.02
contains too many applications like KMail, Kate, and the Kdenlive
video editor that deserve more attention in their own right. I ran <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/">Fedora
Kinoite&#39;s</a> <a href="https://planet.kde.org/siosms-blog-2023-11-21-kinoite-nightly-images-with-plasma-6/">nightly</a>
releases with pre-release Plasma 6 packages, which has proved pleasantly
stable and performant on an aging ThinkPad X280 with 16GB of RAM and a
Core i7-8650U CPU.</p>

<p>The difference between Plasma 5 and 6 is apparent, but not
pronounced. Users who are comfortable with Plasma 5 are unlikely to feel
discomfited with Plasma 6, or have a hard time adapting to the changes
sprinkled throughout the desktop. Plasma 6 has
a number of changes to default settings. The big change, of course, is <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188">Wayland
as the default</a> graphical session.</p>

<p>Plasma 6 also has a smattering of smaller, less controversial changes. For example, prior to
Plasma 6, the desktop defaulted to single-click to open a folder, launch a
program, or open a file. Users coming from other operating systems or
Linux desktop environments are often used to double-clicking to do these
things. Now, KDE upstream has relented on using a single-click to open files and
defaults to double-click instead. Distributions like Fedora, Kubuntu, and
Manjaro had been changing the upstream default anyway, so KDE developer Nate Graham <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/72">suggested</a>
disabling the feature. &#34;<q>Distros are closer to users and clearly the feedback they&#39;ve been
getting is that double-click is a better default...Let&#39;s admit it and switch
to double-click by default ourselves</q>&#34;.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/963854/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/Plasma-6-sm.png" alt="[KDE Plasma 6 desktop]" title="KDE Plasma 6 desktop"/></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Plasma 6 is also supposed to do away with the default of using the scroll
wheel on the desktop to switch virtual desktops. However, this setting is
still active in Fedora Kinoite as of this writing. Scrolling to switch virtual
desktops has been the default for some time, but Graham argued in another <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/55">proposal</a>
to disable the feature because it can easily surprise users with unexpected
and unwanted behavior. Users who prefer the old behavior can toggle it
back on in the &#34;Mouse Actions&#34; settings under &#34;Desktop Folder Settings&#34;,
so it&#39;s not going away entirely. Another change to scrolling behavior
in this release is that clicking on a scrollbar moves the window to
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/92">the
location clicked</a>, rather than one &#34;page&#34; at a time. This is meant to
reduce the amount of fiddling with the scroll wheel to move up or down a long
&#34;distance&#34;, in order to be a better option for users with repetitive strain injuries
(RSIs) — or for users who&#39;d like to avoid RSIs in the first place.</p>

<p>Breeze is Plasma&#39;s default theme and it has been updated for Plasma 6, but it&#39;s a subtle change
— sort of like repainting a room and changing the color from &#34;flat white&#34;
to &#34;eggshell white&#34;. It has some changes to spacing that make it feel a
little less crowded, and it has fewer lines separating UI elements. The System
Settings application has also been revamped. This may be more noticeable, as
some of the settings have migrated to new locations. The nice thing about KDE
is that so much is configurable, but finding configuration settings is still
a challenge in Plasma 6. For example, the aforementioned setting to scroll
virtual desktops is found in the Desktop Folder Settings application, but
not in the System Settings application under the Virtual Desktop settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/">Dolphin</a>, KDE&#39;s file manager,
had its configuration settings redesigned to make them easier to navigate. The
prior version of Dolphin included six tabs of settings for navigation, its
context menu, startup behavior, view modes, behavior of the trash, and
general settings. The redesign condenses this into four tabs, scooting the
navigation options and startup options into the new interface tab. It also adds
a fifth tab for user feedback, with options to contribute statistics and
participate in surveys. These are, as one would expect from an open-source
project that respects its users, set to share no data by default. Users
who wish to participate, though, can choose just how much participation
they&#39;re willing to engage in. This ranges from sharing just a few details
like version of the application and operating system, to more telemetry
like screen resolution, time Dolphin is used, how many network shares are
available, and more.</p>

<p>The Dolphin interface changes are minor. Instead of showing recent
files from today and yesterday, Dolphin now shows recent files and recent
locations. Settings for file history are system-wide, and found in System
Settings rather than Dolphin&#39;s settings — users can opt for keeping
history &#34;forever&#34; or a period of months, or turn off history entirely. (Days or
hours do not appear to be an option.) Users can also specify the applications
allowed to access file history, rather than granting access to any application.

</p><p>Plasma 6 on Wayland has some support for <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/05/18/hdr-and-color-management-in-kwin.html">high
dynamic range (HDR) and color management</a>, depending on the application
and if one has a supported monitor. Sadly, the monitors I have on hand are not
supported. One thing that did work nicely, however, was setting the
scaling for a laptop monitor and external monitor, independently. It was easy to set the
external monitor to 100% scaling while the ThinkPad screen was set to 125% so that windows appeared
to be the same size when moved from one monitor to the other.</p>

<p>The Plasma Search feature, which is part of <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> and the
<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Kickoff">Kickoff</a>
application launcher, has been <a href="https://write.as/alexander-lohnau/profiling-and-optimizing-krunner">refactored</a>
and is claimed to be much faster in this release. The release announcement
claimed major speedups for searching local documents and for applications,
while reducing CPU usage. It&#39;s hard to verify this, but KRunner did feel snappy
when performing web and document searches. <a href="https://apps.kde.org/spectacle/">Spectacle</a>,
KDE&#39;s screenshot utility, now takes screenshots and recordings of the entire desktop, an application
window, or just a selection of the screen. This promises to be a handy tool
to create tutorials, or share a recording of application behavior when filing
a bug.</p>

<p>KDE giveth, and KDE taketh away. As is common with major updates, some
features and settings have been removed due to design changes or difficulty
with underlying drivers or software. For example, GUI configuration for <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/merge_requests/1509">Synaptics
touchpads</a> and <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man4/evdev.4.xhtml">evdev</a>
input devices has been removed because the drivers have been superseded with <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/what-is-libinput.html">libinput</a>
in Wayland. Unmaintained features like the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/57">Air theme</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/65">icon
view for System Settings</a>, and <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/khotkeys/-/merge_requests/23">KHotkeys</a>
were all scuttled in this release. The ability to grab
wallpapers from the Unsplash free stock image site was removed due to <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/422">API
changes</a> and the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/487">QuickShare
applet</a> for file transfer was dropped because it never worked as
intended.</p>

<h4>Under the hood</h4>

<p>Even though Plasma 6 may not feel like a major update, a lot of work has gone
into KDE Frameworks 6 to make it possible. I asked KDE developer
Carl Schwan by email about the developer-facing changes and plans for KDE 5 now
that Plasma 6 has been released. Schwan said most of the work in
Frameworks 6 was about reducing rather than adding features. Schwan pointed
to removal of deprecated frameworks, like KHtml, the KJS javascript engine,
and KHotkeys. The project has also worked to get rid of deprecated Qt APIs,
such as QtCodecs, and to decrease dependencies between frameworks so external
Qt applications can just use one or two KDE frameworks. Schwan also said that
KDE has removed a lot of APIs &#34;which were barely used or [...] have better
alternatives either in another framework or in Qt itself&#34;. In particular,
he noted that KDE&#39;s plugin system has moved from two APIs to a single API.</p>

<p>Schwan said that Qt 6 itself didn&#39;t have many API changes, but
it did add an abstraction layer for graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan,
OpenGL, and DirectX &#34;instead of only supporting OpenGL+Angle&#34;. In
addition, Qt has switched to <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, away
from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html">qmake</a>
build system, which Schwan said helped a lot to improve developer
tooling. Finally, Qt 6 brought a number of improvements to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwaylandcompositor-index.html">Qt Wayland</a>,
which Schwan said had been driven forward in part by KDE developers.</p>

<h4>Support for KDE 5 and X11</h4>

<p>Plasma 6 is likely to be a little
bit rough around the edges for a while, and users might want to review <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=critical&amp;bug_severity=grave&amp;bug_severity=major&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=CONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;classification=Applications&amp;classification=Plasma&amp;keywords=qt6%2C%20&amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;list_id=2462812&amp;query_format=advanced">known
issues</a> before deciding to upgrade. Obviously
Plasma 6 won&#39;t be immediately available in most
distributions, but users can refer to KDE&#39;s community wiki for <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_6#How_to_use/test_it">instructions</a>
on how to test Plasma 6 right away. Users can choose to <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build#Plasma">build
from source</a>, try the <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download">KDE neon</a>
testing edition, or try one of the other distribution-specific methods for
Fedora, Gentoo, KaOS, NixOS, or openSUSE.</p>

<p>There is no rush to switch — KDE 5 is not quite out of the picture
just yet. On February 12, on the Plasma development list, David Edmundson <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123325.html">said</a>
he&#39;d seen enough patches that should go
into 5.27 to warrant another release. Justin Zobel <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123329.html">agreed</a>
and noted that &#34;<q>many distros won&#39;t [adopt] it for some
time. Major bugfixes and security fixes should definitely
continue being applied until such time that most major distros
have updated to 6</q>&#34;. Valorie Zimmerman, from the Kubuntu project, <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123331.html">said</a>
this is good news since the next long-term support (LTS) release for Kubuntu is
coming in March and won&#39;t be based on Qt 6. On February 19, Jonathan Riddell <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123333.html">reported</a>
the Plasma team planned to do a Plasma 5.27.11 release on March 6.</p>

<p>Even though many in the Fedora project are eager to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961899/">drop X11 support</a>, KDE upstream
plans to continue including X11 support for users who depend on it in the
short term. Users can expect to see support
in Plasma 6 as well, but Schwan says there&#39;s &#34;no fixed timeline&#34; with
various estimates ranging from two to five years before support is fully
removed. He stressed that there will be &#34;plenty of communication
beforehand&#34; and the project &#34;certainly won&#39;t drop the support from
one day to the other&#34;.</p>

<p>Overall, Plasma 6 looks to be a smooth upgrade for users, and
KDE Frameworks 6 seems to be a solid foundation for the next few
years of KDE development. It should be interesting to watch how 
Plasma evolves over the next few years.</p></div></div>
