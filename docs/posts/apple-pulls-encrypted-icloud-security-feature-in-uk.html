    <h1>Apple Pulls Encrypted iCloud Security Feature in UK</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/"><p>Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The move comes after UK officials secretly ordered Apple to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud content worldwide.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">UK government&#39;s demand</a> came through a &#34;technical capability notice&#34; under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), requiring Apple to create a backdoor that would allow British security officials to access encrypted user data globally. The order would have compromised Apple&#39;s Advanced Data Protection feature, which provides end-to-end encryption for iCloud data including Photos, Notes, Messages backups, and device backups.<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,&#34; Apple said in a statement. &#34;ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices.&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#39;s decision to pull the feature rather than comply with the UK&#39;s demands is consistent with the company&#39;s previous statements that it would consider withdrawing encrypted services from the UK rather than compromise security. Apple has long opposed creating backdoors in its products, maintaining that such access points would inevitably be discovered by malicious actors.</p>
