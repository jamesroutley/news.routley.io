      <span>Abstract:</span>  Are you an AI researcher at an academic institution? Are you anxious you are
not coping with the current pace of AI advancements? Do you feel you have no
(or very limited) access to the computational and human resources required for
an AI research breakthrough? You are not alone; we feel the same way. A growing
number of AI academics can no longer find the means and resources to compete at
a global scale. This is a somewhat recent phenomenon, but an accelerating one,
with private actors investing enormous compute resources into cutting edge AI
research. Here, we discuss what you can do to stay competitive while remaining
an academic. We also briefly discuss what universities and the private sector
could do improve the situation, if they are so inclined. This is not an
exhaustive list of strategies, and you may not agree with all of them, but it
serves to start a discussion.
