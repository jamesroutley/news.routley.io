Inspired by <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com">WTF Happened in 1971</a> I wanted to make a website detailing many charts that show something weird is happening.
</p>

<p>
Beginning around the late 2000s and accelerating through the 2010s, a series of troubling trends emerged. Measures of well-being, including happiness and life satisfaction, began to show signs of strain. Youth mental health entered a state of crisis, with rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm rising to unprecedented levels. Concurrently, metrics of cognitive performance and academic achievement, such as international test scores and measures of fluid intelligence, appeared to stagnate or decline after decades of progress. Labour productivity growth, a cornerstone of economic prosperity, slowed to a crawl.
</p>

<p>
We had many major events in that time including the Great Recession and COVID-19 that had an large impact, but my hypothesis is that the introduction of the iPhone, and thus the modern mobile age is causing a huge impact on attention and is limiting life outcomes of millions around the globe.
</p>

<p>
This is not an attempt to say these trends are monocausal - it is worth remembering that Correlation != Causation - but it is at the very minimum interesting that the charts seem to line up around 2007, and increase in magnitude of upward or downward slope as adoption of smartphones increase.

This is a work in progress. I want the arguement to get strong over time, it is probably a little weaker than it should be right now, but I think it&#39;s obvious <span>something</span> interesting has happened since 2007.

<h2 id="org73018c4">IQ Scores</h2>
<div id="text-org73018c4">
<p>
The &#34;reverse Flynn effect&#34; refers to a recent decline or plateau in average IQ scores in some developed countries, contrasting with the historical rise in IQ scores known as the Flynn effect. This trend, sometimes called the negative Flynn effect, is attributed to factors like changes in education, lifestyle shifts such as increased screen time, and other environmental influences

Smartphones achieved market saturation much faster than technologies before it.

<p>
By 2014 there was over a billion smart phone devices.

From 2014 to 2024 that number increased to 4.88 billion (source: <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world</a>)

<p>
Around 60% of the world&#39;s population has a smartphone.
In some markets smartphone adoption is at 82.2% - which is to say, these devices are ubiquitous and especially so in advanced nations.

Internet traffic is now primarily coming from mobile devices. It took a while for this to flip, but the act of &#39;Going online&#39; went from one where you sat at a desktop, to one of being constantly online, connected 24/7/365

Between 2010 and 2021 there was increase of self-reported sleep problems in age groups 15 to 45 of 15% (34 -&gt; 49%).

<h2 id="orgb9c7380">Loneliness</h2>
<div id="text-orgb9c7380">
<p>
Survey data consistently identifies young adults as the demographic most acutely affected by loneliness. One comprehensive survey found that 61% of young adults in the U.S. aged 18 to 25 identified as &#34;seriously lonely&#34;. Globally, the figures are similarly high, with one study finding that 27% of young adults aged 19 to 29 experience feelings of loneliness. When compared generationally, the contrast is stark. One report found that 80% of Generation Z individuals (born roughly 1997-2012) reported feelings of isolation over the past year, significantly higher than the 72% of Millennials and 45% of Baby Boomers who said the same

<h2 id="orga01c568">Productivity</h2>
<div id="text-orga01c568">
<p>
Economic productivity, specifically labour productivity (output per hour worked), is the primary driver of long-term improvements in living standards.
</p>

<p>
After a period of growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Labour productivity growth is slowing following the 2007-2009 
</p>

<p>
The Great Recession and COVID are obviously huge drivers of lost productivity, but it stands to reason that if we&#39;re sleeping less, are more depressed, and have less socially active lives, our productive output will suffer in some way.
