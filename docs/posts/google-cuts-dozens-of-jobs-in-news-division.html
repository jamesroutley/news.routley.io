A small number of employees were impacted. We&#39;re supporting everyone with a transition period, outplacement services and severance as they look for new opportunities at Google and beyond.&#34;</p><p>Google News presents links to articles from thousands of publishers and magazines. It&#39;s a popular tab for people who use Google search, allowing them to find top-ranked stories on a particular topic.</p><p>The layoffs come amid a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/19/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates-latest-news.html">war between Israel and Hamas</a> that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza since Oct. 7, and 20 months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Both wars have spawned a surge in the spread of misinformation across the web, heightening the importance of Google and other sites that users count on to find up-to-date news.</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107185555"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107185555" data-vilynx-id="7000283302" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107185556-GettyImages-1244644880.jpg?v=1682592778&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Is the bubble bursting for tech workers?"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Sen.
