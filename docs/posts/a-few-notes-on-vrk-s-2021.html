<ul><li>I remember I gave magdalene like a half-listen when it came out, maybe heard the first track or two, then passed on the album…</li><li>…there was a youtube comment I read probably 8-10 years ago from a kanye stan that said something like “if you hate kanye’s music, it’s just that your brain needs to evolve to understand his level of genius. try coming back to it in 4-5 years and see if you’ve caught up”</li><li>— I think about this all the time. I’ve found this applicable to me with so much art and music and it applies here as well. in 2019 my brain had not yet evolved to fka twigs’ level, and luckily by 2021 my brain had leveled up because how did I pass on this (see also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Rro6TQgpU">home with you</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y6yXR8YEdI">mirrored heart</a>)</li><li>anyway I watched cellophane this year because of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-nas-x-fka-twigs-montero-cellophane-video-similarities-1149549/">some controversy</a> about montero’s similarities, and it took my breath away</li></ul>

<h2>🪴 looking back</h2>



<p><strong>theme of 2021: healthy personal goal-setting</strong></p>



<p>Like many/most? people, I find it incredibly difficult to pick up new routines, hobbies, and habits and stick to them. But this year felt like a turning point. I think I’m starting to figure out how to actually <em>stick</em> to things in my personal life.</p>



<p>I’m getting much better at knowing what motivates me and what type of motivation I need in a given moment. Before when I wasn’t feeling motivated to do what I set out to do, I’d be harsh on myself, like <em>“ugh just do it, why can’t you do it” “you’re so lazy”</em> – which was not only not helpful, but it gave me an excuse to give up, like giving up was the wise thing to do. <em>“I’m lazy so this is futile” “I’m going to fail so why try”</em></p>



<p>Sometimes I need an <em>“ehh c’mon just go do it,”</em> a self-kick in the pants, but I realized that used to be my only motivational hammer, and it’s not what I need most of the time.</p>



<p>Instead I’ve practiced <strong>neutral, curious introspection</strong> – <em>“I haven’t been studying Korean this week. Why is that? Am I bored? Have I not made the time? Is my bar for what I’m considering ‘studying’ too high?”</em> Analyzing the situation with the same neutral curiosity I apply toward a piece of code that’s not working the way I thought it would.</p>



<p>I’ve also done much more research on <em>how</em> to stick to goals, what tools and processes and systems may help me. I remember for years people told me that I need to “just do the thing” and that thinking about the tools, process, and method is procrastination. Boy that was wrong.</p>



<p>In 2021 I think I went through 5 different ways of learning Korean vocabulary — <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, then physical paper cards, then “what if I don’t study vocabulary and instead read everyday,” then <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, then <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi Cards</a>, and FINALLY mochi cards worked for me.</p>



<p>This was not procrastination, this was <strong>experimentation</strong>. My methods of learning vocabulary <em>weren’t working for me</em>, so I could have concluded <em>“it’s me, I’m the problem</em>,<em>“</em> and then… give up I guess? but instead I was like hmm what if I try something else? Which kept me motivated, conversely kept me <em>doing the thing</em>, and then also led me to a tool that actually works for me.</p>



<p>There’s inertia in changing tools but there’s also a spark of renewed energy. Like even if you are changing tools &amp; learning methods only for the sake of changing things up… that’s… fine?? Or if you’re changing the tool purely for the aesthetics, like buying a pretty new notebook or switching from Anki to Mochi because you find Anki is hideous… that’s not only completely valid, I’ve found it to be really effective.</p>



<p>Of course there’s a balance to be had, I’ve recently put a moratorium on myself for buying <a href="https://talktomeinkorean.com/store/">new Korean textbooks</a> until I finish <em>just one</em> that I already have, but embracing experimentation and changing a routine, within keeping that routine, has been a breakthrough for me.</p>



<p>Some fruits of my personal goal-setting:</p>



<ul id="block-e4e260ed-262d-46a6-a962-f63404f2d754"><li>I have never in my life used a planner for more than a day or two — in 2021, I used my muji planner for the whole year (and bought the 2022 edition!)</li><li>I have never in my life finished a journal — in 2021, I completed a journal!</li><li>I have never in my life finished a habit tracker — in 2021, I completed multiple Korean study trackers! and perhaps more importantly, my Korean is at a level I never dreamed I’d be able to achieve without living in Korea</li></ul>



<p>There are plenty of things I didn’t do in 2021 as well, like I haven’t been great about diet and exercise, I read almost nothing, didn’t write as much as I’d like, I am embarrassed by all the texts and emails and DMs from people I adore I haven’t replied to… but I’m getting better at viewing these facts neutrally. What if I could look at this information without shame? It’s a thought I’m carrying with me in 2022.</p>
