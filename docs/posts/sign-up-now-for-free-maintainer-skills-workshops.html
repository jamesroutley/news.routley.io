   <span><a href="https://opencollective.com/"><img src="https://opencollective.com/static/images/opencollectivelogo.png" alt="OpenCollective logo" title="OpenCollective logo" width="30%"/></a> Maintainers of open source projects often need help learning how to address issues such as &#34;how do we recruit and promote project members?&#34;, &#34;what do we spend our money on?&#34;, and &#34;how do I finally have the difficult conversation I&#39;ve been putting off with that one contributor?&#34;

</span></p><p>So, starting in early 2022, <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource/updates/training-coaching-and-workshops-for-community-leaders">I&#39;m running eight videoconference sessions -- a combination of workshops, training, co-working, and discussion -- that you can sign up for right now!</a> OSC will &#34;offer a limited number of places to leaders of projects hosted by Open Source Collective on a series of coaching, training, and workshops designed to work through these issues and to begin building a library of documentation.&#34; OSC is sponsoring this so it&#39;ll be free of cost to participants.

</p><p>You&#39;re eligible if you are part of an open source project fiscally hosted by <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource">Open Source Collective</a>. And in the sign-up form you can mention what challenges you&#39;re currently facing, and what problems you&#39;re looking to solve, so we can customize the topics we cover and the session structures we use.

</p><p>If you&#39;re eligible and interested, please sign up by about December 9th, so we can start scheduling.</p>
