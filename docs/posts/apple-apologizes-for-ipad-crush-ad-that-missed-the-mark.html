    <h1>Apple apologizes for iPad &#39;Crush&#39; ad that &#39;missed the mark&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apple has apologized after a commercial meant to showcase its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151128/apple-ipad-pro-2024-hands-on">brand-new iPad Pro</a> drew widespread criticism among the creative community. In a statement <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321">provided to <em>Ad Age</em></a>, Tor Myhren, Apple’s vice president of marketing, said the company “missed the mark.”</p><p>“Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,” Myhren told <em>Ad Age</em>. “Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151128/apple-ipad-pro-2024-hands-on">M4-powered iPad Pro</a>, which the company described as its thinnest product ever. To advertise all the creative possibilities with the iPad, it released a “Crush!” commercial that shows things like a piano, record player, paint, and other works flattening under the pressure of a hydraulic press. At the end, only one thing remains: an iPad Pro.</p><p>The ad rubbed some creatives the wrong way. Hugh Grant <a href="https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1788183871504204257">called it</a> a “destruction of human experience,” while <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> director Reed Morano <a href="https://twitter.com/reedmorano/status/1788298509780685261">told Apple CEO</a> Tim Cook to “read the room” in a post on X. Apple didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div></div>
