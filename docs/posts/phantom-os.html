              <h2>What is this OS about?</h2>
              <p>Phantom is, basically, a virtual machine (VM) working in a huge persistent virtual memory. Part of the VM classes (some
              classes, called &#39;internal&#39;) are implemented in kernel, giving VM code access to low level kernel services. Persistent
              virtual memory is completely orthogonal to object space and VM (no relation between, for example, object boundary and
              virtual memory page, etc.) and is implemented so that abrupt computer failure or loss of power leaves system in coherent
              state. On the application code (VM bytecode) level OS shutdown (either manual or caused by failure) is not even &#39;seen&#39; -
              applications and their data are &#39;never die&#39;, they continue their work after the next OS boot up as if no shutdown ever
              happened.</p>

              <h4>Persistent memory and snapshots</h4>
              <p>Phantom does regular snapshot of the whole virtual memory. Snapshots are done asynchronously and without stopping the
              world, but resulting snapshot is synchronous - all the memory is being snapped at the very same moment in OS&#39;s
              &#39;personal&#39; time. It means that snapshot state is captured like if all the system was stopped, dumped to disk and then
              run again. But without stopping.</p>

              <h4>Native code</h4>
              <p>Hi-performance code (number-crunching, video or sound processing, etc) requires good
                low-level access to the processor
                and memory. It is supposed that Phantom will be able to run native code in a special binary-object-bound thread.
                One
                binary object will provide code (CS content), others will be available as DS/SS and, possibly, ES/FS/GS (on other
                architectures there objects will be just mapped in thread address space). It will let Phantom to execute
                highly-optimised native code.
          
                It is supposed that to support some portability it will be possible to provide not exactly native, but LLVM-level
                code
                for this environment.</p>

              <h4>Virtual machine</h4>
              <p>Phantom bytecode is traditional stack-machine bytecode. It is very like Java bytecode, but there is no difference
              between built-in and user types on the method boundary level. Any object (even integer) is class instance. There is some
              specific support for integer calculations though, to speedup things.
              
              It is supposed that Phantom bytecode can represent any Java program, and Java to Phantom bytecode converter is being
              written. Other languages are supposed to be brought through the Java bytecode or directly, by writing specific language
              frontend.
              
              C# (CLR) bytecode converter is planned, but no work is in progress yet.</p>

              <h4>Kernel communication</h4>
              <p>There is set of (internal) classes, which methods are implemented in kernel. These classes
                offer kernel interface in
                object environment. Unlike Java, in Phantom all the class code is either internal (native, in Java terms), or
                bytecode-level.</p>

              <h4>Drivers</h4>
              <p>Currently drivers are written in C and live in the kernel completely. Future releases will have possibility to write
              drivers in userland by providing required kernel frameworks. Userland driver will be restricted to communicate with
              given (by kernel) set of hardware resources only, and its interrupt-handling method will be guaranteed to not to be
              paged out.</p>

              <h4>POSIX environment</h4>
              <p>There is (very simple) POSIX subsystem in Phantom. It is not persistent (yet?). As an example, Quake application is
              compiled for POSIX subsystem.</p>

            <p>Basically, most of <a href="https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland" target="_blank">code</a> we upload is very straighforward and, sometimes, dumb. That, to some extent,
            is on purpose. We want to have a working system first and polish it next. Besides, not all the concepts and design
            decisions are final, so it is of no use to finalize all the implementation desisions now as well.</p>

                <p>
                  Phantom is a different approach on the OS than any other out there, with the primary goal of being immortal. In Phantom,
                  powering off the computer will not cause programs to lose state. They can pick up where they left off as soon as the
                  machine is turned back on.
