    <h1>Optimizing Django by not being silly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I just saw <a href="https://ayende.com/blog/202147-A/optimizing-by-170-000-by-not-being-silly">this post</a> and it reminded me of a time when we had a
similar situation, but with string operations in our VM. The project is now
defunct but the code is open. Let’s go back in time.</p>

<p>It was 2018 and I had just joined a team that was bringing up a new Python
runtime (then nicknamed <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-2021-python-language-summit-cpython.html">Pyro</a>, now called <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison">Skybison</a>). The
goal was to use the last 30 years of VM engineering research and folk knowledge
to re-design everything from scratch for performance. Also, importantly, we
were going to only have one way to encode strings: UTF-8<sup id="fnref:surrogates" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:surrogates" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (this is
important for later).</p>

<p>We started from a tiny C++ core that could only run bytecode produced by the
CPython runtime’s compiler. When I joined, the focus was on adding new
features. At the time, the big project was getting <code>importlib</code> working. We
needed some string functions such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rpartition">str.rpartition</a>, so I
wrote a quick and dirty implementation. This helped get
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/5fc889ffbfd271c651f563ab0afe2d345bacbca5/Lib/importlib/util.py#L88"><code>find_spec</code></a> and a bunch of other functions working.</p>

<p>Eventually, we got <code>importlib</code>, then we started work on <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/blob/08f3f441eef002602de86641c443287e0b994711/.github/workflows/cmake.yml#L63-L70">“Django
minimal”</a>, then we started benchmarking <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/django-workload">“Django
workload”</a>. This was around a year later: October 2019.</p>

<p>It’s a really cool feeling watching a project grow up. What used to shell out
to CPython to compile bytecode from inside the runtime (<em>wild</em> thing to do in
practice, but it worked well for bringup) now had its own bytecode compiler and
could run a webserver and was being profiled and optimized for performance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in order to be a fast Python runtime, you have to run Python
code quickly. And we soon hit the weirdest bottleneck in Django URL parsing. It
showed up as something ludicrous like <code>strIndex</code> taking 90% of total run-time
for a given request.</p>

<p>Now, let me refresh your memory about UTF-8: indexing into an arbitrary string
is an O(N) operation because the codepoints (characters, roughly) are variable
length. You need to start from the beginning and count up until you hit the
expected index. For runtimes that use UTF-8, you want to avoid loops that look
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)):</span>
    <span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>  <span># each index operation is O(N)!
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and instead do something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>c</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span><span>:</span>
    <span>c</span>  <span># we already have the character from str.__iter__, which is fast
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our C++ code to index into a string looked something like the following. The
core bit is that <code>str.__getitem__</code> calls <code>offsetByCodePoints</code> to turn the index
(in codepoint-space) to an offset (in byte-space). This in turn calls <code>offset</code>
which has to loop through the encoded string, jumping <code>numChars</code> bytes
(depending on how wide each codepoint is):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>METH</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>__getitem___intrinsic</span><span>)(</span><span>Thread</span><span>*</span> <span>thread</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>offset</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>len</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// .. fetch the code point and put it on the stack ...</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>index</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, keeping all of that that in mind, let’s look at my implementation of
<code>str.rpartition</code>, the hackily implemented function from earlier (full commit
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/commit/15c0e6b2b11e9aed4ca58d73b3bc1857d40d1265">here</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>rpartition</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>):</span>
        <span># TODO(T37438017): Write in C++
</span>        <span>before</span><span>,</span> <span>itself</span><span>,</span> <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>sep</span><span>[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>before</span><span>[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>itself</span><span>[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>after</span><span>[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Haha. Oh. Oof. No. Want to count all the ways this is horrible? <code>rpartition</code>
should be able to instead iterate backwards through the string <em>once</em> (fast!),
splitting precisely twice. Instead, this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reverses strings (allocating a bunch of short-lived new strings)</li>
  <li>makes a bunch of method calls</li>
  <li>reverses strings <em>again</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I rewrote the function to do the right thing, which was to have the surface
implementation bits in Python (argument parsing, type checking) and then shell
out to our fast core string utility:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>rpartition</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>):</span>
        <span>_str_guard</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
        <span>_str_guard</span><span>(</span><span>sep</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>_str_rpartition</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, we didn’t have this fast core string utility yet, so I had to
implement it. See <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/commit/17748e5cd2d5fac78bb87bec3e946c7073a37366">the rewrite commit</a> for some fun
C++.</p>

<p>I don’t have benchmark numbers for you because this was six years ago and the
project was still secret back then. All I remember was that <code>strIndex</code>
completely disappeared from the profiles. You can trace some of the other fun
performance work by paging through the commits around this time.</p>
