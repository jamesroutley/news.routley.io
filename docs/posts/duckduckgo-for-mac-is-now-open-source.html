<p dir="auto">We are excited to engage the community in development!</p>

<p dir="auto">DuckDuckGo is growing fast and we continue to expand our fully distributed team. We embrace diverse perspectives, and seek out passionate, self-motivated people, committed to our shared vision of raising the standard of trust online. If you are a senior software engineer, visit our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/hiring/#open" rel="nofollow">careers</a> page to find out more about our openings!</p>


<p dir="auto">We use submodules, so you will need to bring them into the project in order to build and run it:</p>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code></p>

<p dir="auto">If you&#39;re not part of the DuckDuckGo team, go to Signing &amp; Capabilities to select your team and custom bundle identifier.</p>

<p dir="auto">We use Swift Package Manager for dependency management, which shouldn&#39;t require any additional set up.</p>

<p dir="auto">We use <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwifLint</a> for enforcing Swift style and conventions, so you&#39;ll need to <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation">install it</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We have taken steps to update our terminology and remove words with problematic racial connotations, most notably the change to <code>main</code> branches, <code>allow lists</code>, and <code>blocklists</code>. Closed issues or PRs may contain deprecated terminology that should not be used going forward.</p>
