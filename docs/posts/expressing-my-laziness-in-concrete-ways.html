    <h1>Expressing my laziness in concrete ways</h1>
    
    
<p>
I&#39;m a lazy programmer sometimes.  Let me tell you a story about 
something I wrote earlier this year that&#39;s not exactly the finest set of 
programs ever produced.  It&#39;s about the whole
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/01/18/http/">feed rate limiting</a>
thing on my web server.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been getting reports of people who run into the block even when 
they didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  They didn&#39;t start up something that 
polled every two seconds and pulled the full ~500K feed every single 
time, for example (and yes, this has happened at least once).
</p>
<p>
No, the problem goes like this - someone sees the little orange feed 
icon up there (on the web view, that is) and clicks on it and gets a 
screenful of XML.  My server also goes &#34;okay, you just got the feed&#34;.  
Then they take the URL, hand it over to their feed reader, and it 
reaches out and tries to make the same request.  My server says &#34;hey 
wait a minute you clown, you JUST GOT IT&#34;, and rejects it with a 429.
</p>
<p>
See the problem?  It can&#39;t tell the difference between a pairing of a 
one-time human request + their feed reader&#39;s startup sequence and 
someone who&#39;s actively hammering the thing.  It&#39;s because the thing is 
relatively stupid.  It knows about IP addresses, request types 
(conditional or not), and elapsed times.  That&#39;s it.
</p>
<p>
In order to support some kind of &#34;you&#39;re going to make a handful of 
closely-spaced unconditional requests at startup but will be good 
thereafter&#34; leniency, it would have to  actually have some thought put 
into it.  Now you&#39;re talking about more of a &#34;token bucket&#34; system, or 
something else of that sort where it does some time-based accounting and 
allows for &#34;bursty&#34; behavior at first.  That means tracking a lot more 
than just &#34;the last time you got a full copy of the feed&#34;.
</p>
<p>
But you know what?  That&#39;s work.  It&#39;s not fun, it&#39;s not interesting, 
and it doesn&#39;t do me any favors besides avoiding receiving feedback 
messages from confused users of feed readers.  So, I&#39;ve been lazy, and I 
haven&#39;t done it.  I&#39;ve instead done a bunch of other things which also 
had to be done and had slightly better contexts.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll admit something else: I don&#39;t have a ready solution to this.  I&#39;ve 
never written a burst-handling inflow system before.  It would be 
different if I could just reach back into my head and go &#34;oh yeah, this 
is just one of those things from XYZ project&#34;.  But nope, this time 
there&#39;s nothing in the past to &#34;borrow&#34; in the present.
</p>
<p>
Also, this feels more like a &#34;moving average&#34; type of problem, which 
then means *actual math*, and that&#39;s just not my bag, normally.  So, I 
find reasons to do something else.  Repeat as necessary.
</p>
<p>
Again, most feed readers and their users are doing just fine.  This is 
something I have to do in order to deal with the pathological cases who 
are small in number but large in impact.  I suspect that just a handful 
of them take up way more resources than all of the normal, happy, good 
people put together.
</p>
<p>
As with so many technologies, they would all be unnecessary if not for 
the people who are causing the problems.  It&#39;s why some of us get 
wistful for the &#34;old days&#34; when the net was far smaller and the amount 
of bad behavior was accordingly tiny - eternal September and all that.
</p>
<p>
Do I want to write rate-limiters?  Hell no.  I&#39;d rather do anything 
else.
