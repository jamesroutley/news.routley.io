    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>I&#39;ve been laying down the tracks on this blog as it&#39;s rolling along, so I thought I&#39;d write up a little improvement I made recently. This will also serve as it&#39;s first real test, so fingers crossed that it actually works and doesn&#39;t produce an embarrassing mistake.</p>
<p>Like pretty much any blog, my posts are dated. However, previously those dates were hand entered by me as I wrote the markdown files. That left the annoyingly likely possibility that a typo or forgetting to update the frontmatter would leave me with posts time travelling from the past or future. It was also highly imprecise - only recording the date. While it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever post anything where precise timestamps are required, it still bugged me. Being of a technical nature, I decided to automate this, and learned something along the way!</p>
<p>Since my blog is hosted as a GitHub repo, I decided to try and hook this into the git commit process. I already had <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit</a> set up with a hook that strips metadata from pictures<sup title="So I don&#39;t dox myself."><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> with <a href="https://exiftool.org/">exiftool</a>, so that seemed like the right place to start. Here&#39;s my final <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>repos:
	- repo: local
	hooks:
	- id: no-spicy-exif
		name: Ban spicy exif data
		description: Ensures that there is no sensitive exif data committed
		language: system
		entry: exiftool -all= --icc_profile:all -tagsfromfile @ -orientation -overwrite_original
		exclude_types: [&#39;svg&#39;]
		types: [&#39;image&#39;]
	- id: timestamp-posts
		name: Add createdAt and modifiedAt timestamps to posts automatically
		types: [&#39;file&#39;, &#39;markdown&#39;]
		language: script
		entry: ./timestamp.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The way it works is that if there are any markdown files in the git diff, it runs the script <code>timestamp.sh</code>. What&#39;s <code>timestamp.sh</code>?</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

# this is a pre-commit hook for setting a timestamp
# in the frontmatter of markdown files

my $date = time();
my @files = `git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD`;

foreach (@files) {
    if (/\.md$/) {
      open FILE, $_ or die $!;
      my @lines = &lt;FILE&gt;;
      close FILE or die $!;
      my $file = join(&#39;&#39;, @lines);
      if ($file =~ m/---\n(.*?)---\n(.*)/s) {
        my $frontmatter = $1;
        my $body = $2;
        if (!($frontmatter =~ /^createdAt: .*$/m)) {
          $frontmatter = $frontmatter . &#34;createdAt: $date\n&#34;;
        } elsif (!($frontmatter =~ s/^modifiedAt: .*$/modifiedAt: $date/m)) {
          $frontmatter = $frontmatter . &#34;modifiedAt: $date\n&#34;;
        }
        open FILE, &#34;&gt;$_&#34; or die $!;
        print FILE &#34;---\n$frontmatter---\n$body&#34;;
        close FILE or die $!;
        system &#34;git add $_&#34;;
      }
    }
}

<p>There you go, easy! Well, maybe if you know perl. I... don&#39;t. The last time I touched perl scripts would have to be over a decade ago in high school, and I didn&#39;t do much with it then. This script was <strong>heavily</strong> based on a <a href="https://gist.github.com/bensteinberg/1359f6da5e182dacd1de358737524bc4">gist by bensteinberg</a> I found from a quick search. However, there were some changes I wanted to make, which meant I needed to dust off those skills and dive in.</p>
<p>The first couple of lines are pretty simple, just defining some variables. I store a unix timestamp<sup title="`my $date = time();`"><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and the array of changed files<sup title="``my @files = `git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD`​``"><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>. From there we loop over each of those files and check whether they&#39;re markdown files. If not we move onto the next item in the array, if so we continue. There are a couple of lines of file manipulation that I don&#39;t fully understand the syntax of, but they work so it&#39;s fine.<sup title="Side note, I love the `or die` syntax for crashing if an operation fails and that should be universal. Maybe an alternative could be `then perish`."><a id="footnote-ref-4" href="#footnote-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>After that we enter into the <strong>regex zone</strong>. This was the trickiest part of the script for me. I&#39;m familiar enough with regex, but the perl-specific tricks (like <code>​=~</code> checking for matches) gave me some trouble to figure out. First we&#39;re checking whether the markdown file has frontmatter<sup title="A block at the beginning of the file surrounded by `---`."><a id="footnote-ref-5" href="#footnote-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> and extracting it if so. Then we check whether it already has a <code>createdAt</code> timestamp, and if not we add one by concatenating it to the frontmatter string.<sup title="```
    if (!($frontmatter =~ /^createdAt: .*$/m)) {
      $frontmatter = $frontmatter . &#34;createdAt: $date\n&#34;;
    }
    ```"><a id="footnote-ref-6" href="#footnote-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> If it <em>does</em> already have a <code>createdAt</code> property then we move on to checking whether it has the <code>modifiedAt</code> property. This was the most confusing step for me, so I&#39;m gonna break it down.</p>
<pre><code>} elsif (!($frontmatter =~ s/^modifiedAt: .*$/modifiedAt: $date/m)) {
  $frontmatter = $frontmatter . &#34;modifiedAt: $date\n&#34;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is saying that if <code>$frontmatter</code> does <em>not</em> contain a match for that regex, then we add the <code>modifiedAt</code> property to the end. But what&#39;s that regex doing?</p>
<pre><code>s/^modifiedAt: .*$/modifiedAt: $date/m
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from the beginning, the <code>s</code> before the slash means that we&#39;re performing a find-and-replace. The first match of <code>^modifiedAt: .*$</code> will be replaced by <code>modifiedAt: $date</code>. The search pattern starts with a caret (<code>^</code>) and ends with a <code>$</code>, which means that the contained pattern must start and end the string being tested, in this case <code>$frontmatter</code>. Naively this might seem to only occur if &#34;modifiedAt: ...&#34; were the only entry in the frontmatter, but the <code>m</code> at the end of the whole expression means that each line is tested individually! So putting it all together, this regex tests whether a <code>modifiedAt</code> property is present, and if so it gets updated to <code>$date</code>, the current<sup title="I guess potentially very slightly past, depending on your execution speed."><a id="footnote-ref-7" href="#footnote-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup> unix timestamp. The fact that that replacement happens <em>inside</em> the conditional surprised me to begin with, and honestly it&#39;s still a bit unintuitive, but I appreciate the conciseness.</p>
<p>Once that&#39;s done all that&#39;s left is cleanup. We open the file, replace its contents with our new updated ones, and <code>git add</code> our changes so they are included in our still-in-progress commit. And that&#39;s it! I&#39;m sure there are improvements that could be made - for one thing, I think that the script gets called for <em>every</em> markdown file included in the diff, which means that if I try to add two posts at once that they might both get <code>createdAt</code> tags when the script is run for the first time, and then both get near <code>modifiedAt</code> timestamps when it gets run again. I&#39;m not so prolific a writer that I expect to publish multiple blog posts at once, but if anyone sees an easy fix please write in! I&#39;m glad that I was able to see a problem, fix it, and learn something from the process all at once.</p>
