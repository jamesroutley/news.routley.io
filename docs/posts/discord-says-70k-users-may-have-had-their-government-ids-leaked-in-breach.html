A <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1975834621503062495">tweet by vx-underground</a> said that the company was being extorted over a breach of its Zendesk instance by a group claiming to have “1.5TB of age verification related photos. 2,185,151 photos.”</p><p>When we asked about the tweet, Wexler shared this statement:</p><div><blockquote><p>Following <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">last week’s announcement</a> about a security incident involving a third-party customer service provider, we want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041820932-Help-I-m-old-enough-to-use-Discord-in-my-country-but-I-got-locked-out">age-related appeals</a>. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.</p><p>All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts. We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.</p></blockquote></div><p>In its announcement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">last week</a>, Discord said that information like names, usernames, emails, the last four digits of credit cards, and IP addresses also may have been impacted by the breach.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
