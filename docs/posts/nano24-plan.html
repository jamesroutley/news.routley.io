    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quartz-body"><div><article><p>Hello and welcome to my live storytelling page for Nano24! It’s been too much for me to do consistently this November, but I DID write I am proud of in the first 10 days. I’m still trying to write more as time allows, and I commend anyone who has managed to write every day.</p>

<p>Since 2020, I’ve been participating yearly in <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano">NaNoWrimo (National Write a Novel Month)<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, a challenge and community where participants set out to write a novel in November. It’s been an incredible way to challenge myself as a writer and just as a human being.</p>

<p>I’m doing a couple things differently this year. I’m going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Live-release everything I’ve written<code>*</code></li>
<li>Write a short story every three days.</li>
</ol>
<p>My ultimate goal for Nano this year <em>was</em>:
<em><strong>Finish out the month with an interconnected sci-fi anthology published on this very page.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you want to find out what I’m going to write about, visit this page at the end of any day in November 2024 to see what I’ve written that day!</p>

                  <p>I Am Still live publishing! </p>
                  
                </div>
<p>Although I haven’t able to do it every day, please feel free to check back and see if there’s anything new here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>*</code> Why release everything live? First, the artistic lesson I’ve been tinkering with lately has been this: art is about being playful or vulnerable enough to share, the exact opposite of perfectionism.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, I believe that the most important aspect of great storytelling is engagement with and responsiveness to an audience. So if you’re here, reach out! You’re basically as important to my process as you want to be.</p>
