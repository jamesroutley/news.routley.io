    <h1>US Government makes $42M bet on open cell networks: Open RAN dream stays alive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US government has <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2024/biden-harris-administration-awards-42m-wireless-innovation">committed $42 million</a> to further the development of the 5G Open RAN (O-RAN) standard that would allow wireless providers to mix and match cellular hardware and software, opening up a bigger market for third-party equipment that’s cheaper and interoperable. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) grant would establish a Dallas O-RAN testing center to prove the standard’s viability as a way to head off Huawei’s steady cruise toward a global cellular network hardware monopoly. </p><p>Verizon global network and technology president Joe Russo <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fnew-grant-ntia-o-ran-carriers-vendors-globally">promoted the funding</a> as a way to achieve “faster innovation in an open environment.” To achieve the standard’s goals, AT&amp;T vice president of RAN technology <a href="https://about.att.com/blogs/2024/open-ran.html">Robert Soni says</a> that AT&amp;T and Verizon have formed the Acceleration of Compatibility and Commercialization for Open RAN Deployments Consortium (ACCoRD), which includes a grab bag of wireless technology companies like Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, Dell, Intel, Broadcom, and Rakuten. </p><p>Japanese wireless carrier Rakuten formed as the first O-RAN network in 2020. The company’s then CEO, Tareq Amin, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23297756/5g-rakuten-mobile-ceo-oran-cloud-network-decoder">told <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel</a> in 2022 that Open RAN would enable low-cost network build-outs using smaller equipment rather than massive towers — which has long been part of the promise of 5G. </p><p>But O-RAN is about more than that; establishing interoperability means companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T wouldn’t be forced to buy all of their hardware from a single company to create a functional network. For the rest of us, that means faster build-outs and “more agile networks,” <a href="https://symphony.rakuten.com/blog/open-ran-explained-all-you-need-to-know-and-more">according to Rakuten</a>.</p><p>In the US, Dish has been working on its own O-RAN network, under the name Project Genesis. The 5G network was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/24/23445995/dish-5g-network-genesis-las-vegas-trial">creaky and unreliable</a> when former <em>Verge </em>staffer Mitchell Clarke tried it out in Las Vegas in 2022, but the company said in June last year that it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762646/dish-network-june-2023-boost-fcc-population-coverage-5g-genesis">made its goal</a> of covering 70 percent of the US population. Dish has struggled to <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/wall-street-is-fed-up-with-dish-network">become the next big cell provider</a> in the US, though — leading satellite communications company EchoStar, which spun off from Dish in 2008, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/2/24022413/dish-network-echostar-acquisition-5g-boost-mobile-wireless">purchase the company</a> in January.</p><p>All of this adds up to a united front against Huawei’s domination of global cellular equipment and infrastructure. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/12/oran-biden-china-huawei-technology/"><em>The Washington Post </em>writes</a> that O-RAN “is Washington’s anointed champion to try to unseat the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies” as the world’s biggest supplier of cellular infrastructure gear. The <em>Post</em> points out that Biden has made O-RAN a priority point of discussion with global leaders in recent years, and that both Congress and the NTIA have allocated around $2 billion for the advancement of the standard.</p><p>This $42 million grant is a drop in the bucket compared to all of that, but the establishment of a testing center is a key step in the process; it creates an arena where ACCoRD partners can establish that the standard can work and get the buy-in of other big players across the world. The <em>Post</em> notes that Ericsson and AT&amp;T made big commitments in December, with <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2023/commercial-scale-open-radio-access-network.html">a $14 billion, five-year contract</a> to infuse most or — in the case of Ericsson — all of their hardware with O-RAN compatibility within the next couple of years, giving the standard some hefty momentum.</p></div></div>
