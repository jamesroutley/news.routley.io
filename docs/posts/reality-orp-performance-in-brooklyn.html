                This past Friday, Andrei and I drove down to Greenpoint to
                perform an audiovisual set as REALITY ORP at a DIY venue called
                <em>Light and Sound Design</em>. The show was organized by
                <a href="https://www.kabaird.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ka Baird</a>, and featured fellow audiovisual artist duo
                <a href="https://mshr.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSHR</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The show went extremely well, and lots of friends came. The
                people who ran the venue were super nice, and the space was very
                well set up, with lots of comfortable seating and even a few
                foam pads and cushions in the very front for people to watch the
                show while lying down.

                was running the quadrophonic sound setup.

                After we performed, with Andrei on music (electronics, synths,
                percussion, and processed vocals) and me on video (modular
                synth, feedback, oscillators, cameras, etc.), I lay down in the
                front row to experience MSHR&#39;s set. They are currently touring
                with two sets: a hardware-based music set, which we saw them
                perform in New Haven last week, and an audiovisual set, which
                they performed at this show, so we got to see both. Their
                performance was really great â€” though I don&#39;t have much
                documentation to share here, you can view a past version of the
                same set on their Peertube:
