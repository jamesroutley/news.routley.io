<p>What&#39;s a better way to get to know someone than by reading through their stream-of-consciousness journal? Here are some entries / thoughts / headlines from mine over the past few days.</p>
<h3 id="snippets-quickly-jotted-down">snippets quickly jotted down</h3>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast &#34;Looking for a cofounder!&#34;</li>
<li>Set up calendar scheduling software</li>
<li>Store files in garden!!! Coding in space!! Fully fledged editor</li>
<li>Landscape is an extremely human endeavor</li>
<li>Decentralized video game</li>
<li>There were societies where people weren&#39;t constantly trying to get you to want things</li>
<li>Anyone can host a world at a url</li>
<li>Everyone has their own map but square tiles can be shared</li>
<li>The most influential tool for thought won&#39;t look like one</li>
<li>Games on a graph with one axis being complexity of rules and the other being clearness of goals</li>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="https://shimmeringvoid.substack.com/p/engineering-and-evolving-ideaspace">Engineering and Evolving Ideaspace</a> by <a href="https://www.bf.wtf/">Ben</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Stories, images, films, games, music etc. all point to some level of pre-conceptual understanding in our minds. Perhaps these media reach the Jungian unconscious where they resonate with our primordial archetypes. Perhaps they simply point to fragments of the shared human experience, showing us we&#39;re never alone in the most fundamental of ways. Artists compress these wisdoms into artwork in a similar sense to nature compressing structure and behaviour into genes. DNA itself is an interpreted language, it cannot be understood without the surrounding chemical context. Similarly, art encodes memes into forms that only make sense when considered by human minds (at least for now). Somehow, just like a robust gene, great art carries its message across generations, borders and even millennia.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/mayli/status/1282058872505729027">May-Li Khoe</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>make your life a personal work of art filled with whatever random things energize you âœ¨</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>those little random ðŸŒ± will bloom into things you never would have imagined if you give them the space outside a conventional career to grow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/hazelweakly/status/1584301619969417217">Hazel Weakly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every day I think about how I could just start a company and instantly attract world tier talent by saying &#34;we&#39;re committed to psychology safety, healing, and ethical computing&#34;</p>

<h3 id="slightly-longer-form-thoughts">slightly longer-form thoughts</h3>
<p>What would it look like to have a waveform for describing alphabets? Polynomials, linear algebra, etc are alphabets.</p>
<p>Kind of like waveform collapse?</p>
<p>What if I defined some sort of literal alphabet made of linear algebra. &#34;vectors&#34; with the operations of addition, multiplication, etc. With the goal being to generate things.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#34;A notation for creativity&#34;</p>
<p>what would that look like? What would be the evaluation? An image? Text?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Computer vision with laptop camera to read paper - write notation by hand and have a real-time repl. Would be dope.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Instead of having a bunch of tiles that all connect, I can have a port with lots of different routes/portals to other people&#39;s worlds (or even my own)</p>
<p>This gives you the same spatial understanding of the world as a big tile-based map does but maybe a bit more fun and they wouldn&#39;t have to be square? You could have tiles to other people&#39;s worlds too...</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&#34;what if islands were linear combinations of certain base features&#34; - understandable, debuggable, fun - kind of like atoms being orbits</p>
<h3 id="summary">summary</h3>
<p>I just want to summarize all this a little bit. Make it a bit more digestible.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve recently been thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>generative art and algorithms for making landscapes</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>spatial memory</li>
<li>notation</li>
<li>video games</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
