    <h1>Spotify CFO cashes in £7.2M in shares after value surges on news of job cuts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>One of Spotify’s top executives cashed in more than $9m (£7.2m) in shares as the value of the world’s biggest music streaming service surged after it announced it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/04/spotify-cut-jobs-amid-rising" data-link-name="in body link">laying off almost a fifth of its workforce</a> to cut costs.</p><p>Paul Vogel, Spotify’s chief financial officer, moved to sell the $9.4m worth of stock on Tuesday, a day after investors sent the company’s share price soaring in response to reports that the cuts would help it <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-12-04/an-update-on-december-2023-organizational-changes/" data-link-name="in body link">sustain profitability amid slowing economic growth</a>.</p><p>Vogel was not the only one to cash in on the jump. Spotify’s share price rose by as much as 8% on the day of the announcement and has remained elevated sinceand two other senior executives have cashed in more than $1.6m in shares, according to <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001639920/f18a146d-db7a-45f3-a5b1-eb0557f8fb90.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p><p>On Friday, the last day of trading before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Spotify</a> announced it was to lay off about 1,500 staff, the company traded at $180 a share. On Monday, the day of the cuts announcement, it surged to $194 rising to $199 on Tuesday, when the SEC filing shows that Vogel sold 47,859 shares.</p><p>Investors have continued to fuel the share price rises, which hit a 52-week high of $202.88 during trading on Wednesday, valuing the Stockholm-based company at $37.9bn.</p><p>The sale of stock immediately after a round of cuts is completely legal, but the optics of appearing to cash in on a share-price surge as many staff face redundancy at Christmas are not the best.</p><p>“Despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is too big,” Spotify’s founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in a blog post announcing the cuts on Monday.</p><p>“I recognise this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us.”</p><p>Spotify cut 6% of its jobs in January, bringing its global workforce down to 9,200, and four months later it cut another 200 jobs, mostly in its podcasting division.</p><p>The company has struggled to achieve profitability and reported a net loss of around $500m for the nine months to September, despite growing its monthly active users to 574 million in the third quarter.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>It has also found it difficult to make its expensive foray beyond music into podcasting pay off.
