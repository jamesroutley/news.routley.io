No, you can get started with Vecti for free and use Vecti for as long as you want
                without needing a card on file. You&#39;re only asked to provide a card when you want to
                upgrade your plan.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
You can choose between a monthly or annual billing cycle.</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
Your plan automatically renews at the end of each billing cycle, but you can stop it
                from renewing by cancelling at any time. You will still pay the remainder of the
                term for the professional plan.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
You will not lose any of your work if you downgrade. The projects and workspaces
                will still be available, yet with some limitations. You will not be able to create
                more projects (if you have more than 5 already). You will also lose the
                professional features.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">Yes, we provide free plans for students and teachers! Please contact us.</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
We do not have any discounts for non-profit organisations. Anyone is welcome to use
                Vecti&#39;s free plan.
