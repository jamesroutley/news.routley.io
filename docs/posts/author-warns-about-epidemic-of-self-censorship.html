Nobody deserves it. It is unconscionable barbarism. It is a virtual vigilante action whose aim is not just to silence the person who has spoken, but to create a vengeful atmosphere that deters others from speaking.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>BBC Newsnight: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaks to Kirsty Wark</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 2020, Adichie&#39;s 2006 novel Half Of A Yellow Sun was voted the best book to have won the Women&#39;s Prize for Fiction in its 25-year history.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the other Reith Lectures, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Rowan Williams will explore freedom of worship; Dr Fiona Hill, former White House adviser to the President on Russia, will talk about freedom from fear; and author and musician Darren McGarvey will discuss freedom from want.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&#39;s Reith Lecture is on </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001fmtz">BBC Sounds</a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0dhrlhm/the-reith-lectures-2022-the-four-freedoms-1-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-freedom-of-speech">BBC iPlayer</a><i>.
