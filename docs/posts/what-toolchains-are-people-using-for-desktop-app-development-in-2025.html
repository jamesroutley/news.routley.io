    <h1>Ask HN: What toolchains are people using for desktop app development in 2025?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I recently came across a comment [0] here that highlighted the challenges of building native desktop apps with LLMs. The commenter pointed out how scarce training resources have become—few blog posts, tutorials, or open-source projects exist compared to web or mobile development. They also noted that while desktop app development was a solid career path in the 90s, it&#39;s now seen as a dead end for most, outside of big players like Microsoft or Adobe.</p><p>This got me thinking: My own experience with desktop development dates back to the late 90s using Turbo Pascal 6 in Delphi, and I&#39;m out of the loop on modern practices. With the evolving landscape, I&#39;m curious about what tools and workflows developers are actually using today.</p><p>Some questions to spark discussion:</p><p>- What programming languages and frameworks are popular for desktop apps?
- Are there any go-to IDEs, build tools, or libraries that make development easier?
- Do the above answers change if you care about code performance or efficiency (whatever that means to you)?
- Is native desktop app development still viable as a career, or are most greenfield projects shifting to web-based alternatives?</p><p>I&#39;d love to hear from folks with recent experience—success stories, pitfalls, and recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance for sharing!</p><p>[0] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44841291</a></p></div></div></div>
