    <h1>Llama.ttf: A font which is also an LLM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p><code>llama.ttf</code> is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p><code>llama.ttf</code> is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to &#34;shape&#34; text.
        
        </p>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>So in case that doesn&#39;t make sense (after all, does it?), here&#39;s an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4bOyYctgFI?si=XAAcj3uf02vxdXwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <p>Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bOyYctgFI#t=6m09s">6:09</a> if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <code><a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a></code> (60 MB download, since it&#39;s
        based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model demoed above) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where HarfBuzz is used
        and built with Wasm support.
      
        The simplest way to experiment with this is probably to build <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/tree/4cfc6d8e173e800df086d7be078da2e8c5cfca19">HarfBuzz</a> with <code>-Dwasm=enabled</code> and build
        <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/tree/382d52fc05dbb543dfafb969182104d6c4856c63">wasm-micro-runtime</a> with <code>-DWAMR_BUILD_REF_TYPES=1</code>,
        then add the resulting shared libraries, <code>libharfbuzz.so.0.60811.0</code> and <code>libiwasm.so</code> to the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>
        environment variable before running a HarfBuzz-based application such as gedit or GIMP; no recompilation of the applications is required.
      </p>
      <h3>More fun with fonts</h3>
      <p>If this didn&#39;t seem pointless enough, here are some other weird things people have done with fonts and LLMs:
        </p><ul>
          <li>tom7&#39;s Super Metroid speedrun documentation-inspired language for formatting text nicely with LLMs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc</a></li>
          <li>Erk&#39;s presentation on programmable fonts with HarfBuzz-Wasm, very much an inspiration for this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M</a></li>
          <li>A completely playable Pok√©mon-inspired game inside a font: <a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html">https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html</a></li>
        </ul>
