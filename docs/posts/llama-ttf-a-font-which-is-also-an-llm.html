    <h1>Llama.ttf: A font which is also an LLM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">Harfbuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to &#34;shape&#34; text.
        
        </p>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>So in case that doesn&#39;t make sense (after all, does it?), here&#39;s an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4bOyYctgFI?si=XAAcj3uf02vxdXwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <p>Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bOyYctgFI#t=6m09s">6:09</a> if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> (60 MB download, since it&#39;s based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support.</p>
      <h3>More fun with fonts</h3>
      <p>If this didn&#39;t seem pointless enough, here are some other weird things people have done with fonts and LLMs:
        </p><ul>
          <li>tom7&#39;s Super Metroid speedrun documentation-inspired language for formatting text nicely with LLMs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc</a></li>
          <li>Erk&#39;s presentation on programmable fonts with Harfbuzz-Wasm, very much an inspiration for this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M</a></li>
          <li>A completely playable Pok√©mon-inspired game inside a font: <a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html">https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html</a></li>
        </ul>
