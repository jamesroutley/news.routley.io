This policy arose from three patterns observed over the years:</p><ol type="1"><li id="block-1c5192c9496b809c90a4ea9891e730c6">Most people don&#39;t have political views, they have political <em>tribes</em></li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80448e62d0300dd31ff4">Developing the political reasoning skills to graduate from tribes to views is incredibly difficult</li></ol><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8060bc23d25030417062">and the kicker:</p><ol start="3" type="1"><li id="block-1c5192c9496b800f8555e7e7ff3beba6">Most people don&#39;t <em>want</em> to graduate from tribes to views</li></ol><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80ea8a2dea93b0866624">Often when someone asks &#34;who did you vote for&#34;, what they&#39;re actually doing is verifying your adherence to group culture, like a congregation member asking &#34;you believe in god, right?&#34; loudly in church.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b809a8cecc9c459846e40">The insidious nature of this question comes from the false representation as earnest, intellectual discourse. Many who ask it may truly believe they‚Äôre engaging earnestly, but their responses quickly reveal an angle more akin to religious police.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80e084bbf9ce0b19d56b">Most vulnerable to this behavior are the intellectually honest + socially clueless, who engage in good faith, unaware of the pending social ambush.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8064b9ebc1ff5013b0b8">Why does this happen?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b804fbb4ddb4bed32bfed">I think there are two main reasons, the first being the sheer intellectual difficulty of crafting an informed political view leads people to tribalism out of convenience.</p><span id="1c5192c9496b802dbf6bdeef78340b3c"></span><h3 id="block-1c5192c9496b802dbf6bdeef78340b3c">Being informed is tough</h3><p id="block-1c5192c9496b809c9acee436a46641f4">To have an informed view on any given issue, one needs to:</p><ol type="1"><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80ac87b1c87778ac2ca1">understand economics, game theory, philosophy, sales, business, military strategy, geopolitics, sociology, history, and more</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80ff8812ccb60cb5b25e">be able to understand and empathize with the various (and often opposing) groups involved in a topic</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80fb92bdfd4951138ddc">detect and ignore their own bias</li></ol><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80f6bffbd98f9a692e30">How can you prioritize limited resources with deadly consequences without understanding utilitarianism vs deontology (i.e. the trolly problem)?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8054b658fdf068823037">Understand China-US relations without understanding communism vs capitalism, the fear of tyranny vs the threat of invasion, or how and where computer chips are made?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80d2a94bdc61c6ca9073">How military power dictates realities, economies affect happiness, or how frivolous lawsuits can protect consumers? How companies are built, how elections are won, or the role nuclear families and 30-year fixed mortgages play in America?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b800cbf44c954a27478fc">And even with all this knowledge, can you empathize with both sides of common issues -- the poor renter vs struggling landlord? The tired worker vs underwater business owner? Rich vs poor, immigrant vs legacy, parent vs child -- the list goes on</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8077af72e731b6ede007">Each side has both villains and victims. Both landlords and renters can be perpetrators and innocent. Both workers and business owners can be exploited and stolen from.</p><p id="block-1c8192c9496b804f88fbf53281487a98">Yet most people can only identify with one narrative, usually one they&#39;ve experienced or have a connection to. To acquire, then properly apply this knowledge while honestly detecting your own bias is such an undertaking it&#39;s no wonder I only know one or two people capable of it[2].</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80d08647fb2f338586b0">So it&#39;s no surprise humans resort to what‚Äôs worked for thousands of years: find our tribe and rep their beliefs, hard.[3]</p><div id="block-1c9192c9496b80c28d82db1ceb944bff"><p><img alt="note: this graph is not meant to imply independent thinkers are only in the middle, but was a visual representation of Paul Graham‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Two Kinds of Moderate‚Äù.

It can be our friends, church, or even our favorite news station. Throughout history this method has been so successful we&#39;ve literally evolved to do it. It&#39;s why we laugh when others laugh, run when others start running, want things because others want them -- tribalism is built-in.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8052bd2cc906761bfb5e">But when you acquire opinions in bulk like this, suddenly you don‚Äôt have a reasoned view, you have an ideology. Your opinions on sex can predict your opinions on taxation [17]. And it removes the ability to discourse because suddenly learning is replaced with cheering, discovery replaced with winning/losing. </p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8025869edd21efe65b8a">Despite this inherent weakness, overcoming tribalism to improve our reasoning is still doable, <em>if </em>we desire. But this brings us to the second, darker reality:</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80508084e669099e1895">Most people don&#39;t <em>want</em> to graduate from tribalism.</p><span id="1c5192c9496b806d9c09e67284a2c18b"></span><h3 id="block-1c5192c9496b806d9c09e67284a2c18b">People don&#39;t want to leave the tribe</h3><p id="block-1c5192c9496b806f9a84ef1fad95674f">By far, relationships determine the happiness of ones life, and relationships are not beholden to truth. In fact, they are very commonly built on the opposite.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b809e865bf17b120274f3">Whether a boss&#39; reprimands are deserved or not, employees bond over a common enemy. Entire groups form on the basis of beliefs, false or otherwise. We have a word for this: ‚Äúreligion&#34;.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80cabbbcefa2957fe487">Despite organized religion dropping in attendance, religious patterns of behavior are still everywhere, just adapted to a secular world.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80498df3fb58f5e586d4">Health, exercise, politics, work, self-improvement -- these are all things I&#39;ve seen friends employ their religious muscle into, across all spectrums and political aisles. And as we get older, I&#39;m seeing more and more of my supposedly-secular friends engage in such behavior[4].</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8082a1e6ca074ceb5344">The same religious components are always there:</p><ul><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80169222ef95b47940c3">proclamations of faith</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80739c2bfb6d51af99a2">circular reasoning</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b802ca979ecf943f3c8fd">an evil force (Obama, Elon, Big Pharma, the food industry, corporations, immigrants)</li></ul><p id="block-1c5192c9496b809b922ee26589532477">And despite the variety of what these religious patterns can be applied to, they all have one thing in common: they are fantastic for finding community and identity.</p><p><img alt="image" loading="lazy" width="480" height="299.15227629513345" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/f953b73b-9c13-4964-a56a-048f20a10744/image/w=640,quality=90,fit=scale-down 1x, https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/f953b73b-9c13-4964-a56a-048f20a10744/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down 2x" src="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/f953b73b-9c13-4964-a56a-048f20a10744/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down"/></p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80fb9234d31255ec108f">So people are often faced with two options:</p><ol type="1"><li id="block-1c5192c9496b807f9a8cc93517cc5c85">A simple world with community, identity, and shared values</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80358bbde0e13a00928c">A messy, complex world that takes more brainpower and alienates most of society</li></ol><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80c0b100fb9bd050e21b">I&#39;ll often ask: if the opposite of your beliefs were true, would you want to know?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80578955c61ae9fa039c">Surprisingly, I&#39;ve had good friends, who enjoy political debate, explicitly answer ‚Äòno‚Äô.

It is much simpler and happier to think party B is evil and continue bonding with your friend group made up of party A. [5]</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80a580bbf9df04244c95">People don&#39;t want research and probabilities, they want a sports team[6] and simple religious code.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b805db234e0d2f7a85b17">At first this confused me, but on further inspection I think it makes complete sense. If you believe happiness is found from community (as I do), and your community, or even identity, is formed around a false belief, then not wanting to pop this bubble, no matter its validity, is understandable even if I can‚Äôt quite condone this myself[7].</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b802bba60c4e801187a25">The Matrix portrayed it best -- when faced with the choice of calming delusion vs harsh reality, most people will choose the former.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8046870cf4b1c6724558">Or better illustrated:</p><p><img alt="image" loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=640,quality=90,fit=scale-down 1x, https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down 2x" src="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down"/></p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b808da9d9db8151eff411">And this is fundamentally why I don&#39;t discuss politics with friends.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80689d6ac709d21ec219">It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want or am scared of opposing views (in fact the opposite is true[8]), but rather because of how common others‚Äô desire to &#34;remain in the bubble&#34; is.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8049a416edf8397bc548">If someone is self-aware enough to consciously acknowledge their choice to remain in the bubble, that‚Äôs totally fair. I respect it like I‚Äôd respect anyone who chooses to participate in a more traditional religion. My issue is when this view is falsely passed off as an intellectually-driven one.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80ca8336d4a8d1890ebb">Because if a desire to seek truth isn&#39;t there, the conversation becomes the worst kind of debate, a pointless rhetorical one filled with fallacies and truthiness. Instead of trying to discover, it tries to convince -- more akin to lawyers than scientists, and one that rarely has a satisfying resolution.</p><span id="1c5192c9496b80eca230d40e1e9b6905"></span><h3 id="block-1c5192c9496b80eca230d40e1e9b6905">The social gamble</h3><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80c38b01fa42a5156796">So how can we handle requests for such discussion?</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80a38be6fc3db5dde65e">One is to avoid the conversation entirely, since besides often being a social trap, discovering how many friends prefer a false image to reality can be depressing.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80d4879df1de6f7852bd">However, one reason to persevere is to find the 1% of people that also want to see the world as it is.

The potential payoff is huge: a potential friend, with deeper connection and understanding if you can get to the &#34;aha&#34; moment.

I&#39;m not sure. A friend and I theorized one reason I might be more tribalism-allergic than others is due to a lack of tribe. Being quite culturally American while ethnically Indian, there isn&#39;t really a place in the world I can go where I fit in.

Unless both debaters are skilled and intentionally trying for honest debate; the lack of record, tonality, and audience quickly devolve a conversation into the he-said-she-said, gaslighting, fallacy-ridden spectacle we see in presidential debates. But writing offers a reprieve: an idea can be articulated fully, without interruption, can be referenced and re-read.

You&#39;re only alive because your ancestors sought out objective truth to find food and survive. Yes, there are many instances where the only accounts of an incident are heavily biased, but that does not mean objective truth doesn&#39;t exist. Some actions were taken, with some combination of intentions at the time -- even if we can&#39;t realistically discover them, acknowledging their existence, and pursuing them with probabilistic guesses, is much more honest than just throwing our hands up and saying &#34;everyone is correct&#34; or just picking the one we like best.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80859a22f23fd9c95c89">[16] This is based on my favorite method for fixing mistakes in sports, over-correcting. if I&#39;m hitting too far left, I try and make the &#34;opposite&#34; mistake by hitting too far right.
