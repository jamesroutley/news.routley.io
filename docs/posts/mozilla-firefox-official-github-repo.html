        <p>It all started with a post on X I made, more than a month ago</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">is anybody doing vibe coding in rust?</p>— DebamitroChakraborti (@debamitro) <a href="https://twitter.com/debamitro/status/1905308219477545266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> 
<p>Based on the responses, I knew I had to try it out. So I started looking for a project to do.</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I had vibe coded a tiny <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/gmail-size-classifier">python project which classified Gmail messages by size</a>.
I decided to create a Rust version of it. I thought if I succeeded, it would be easier to distribute as a desktop application.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-ui-framework">Choice of UI framework</h2>
<p>I tried out <a href="https://iced.rs">iced</a> which both Cursor and Windsurf seemed to understand.
I was actually surprised to see Rust vibe coding working out, even though I used a counter increment/decrement app for
the test drive. But after that I started some digging, and wanted to try out <a href="https://www.gpui.rs">gpui</a>.
I think I was inspired by <a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a> where this framework was born. And I liked its simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="adventures-with-gpui">Adventures with gpui</h2>
<p>My first attempts to generate working gpui code using both Cursor and Windsurf were quite rough.
Nothing was compiling, and I had to correct almost all of the code in order to get going. Once the build succeeded, I didn’t want to stop.
My UI needs were simple enough, and all I needed was a window with a button. Everything else was going to be done by a local http server.</p>
<p>The great thing about gpui is that if you know html and <a href="http://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a> you can create gpui UIs.
There is only one building block, and it is called ‘div()’ for obvious reasons. Everything else is done by adding style classes.</p>
<h2 id="the-server">The server</h2>
<p>This was the guts of the project. I am glad that I chose <a href="https://rocket.rs">rocket</a> for this part.
Windsurf glided through this part with minimum issues.</p>
<h2 id="and-weeks-passed">And weeks passed</h2>
<p>I kept going on with the project, falling into the rabbit hole of Rust aided by AI coding tools.
I should say that I was mostly finding out what code to write, and using AI help to fix build errors.
There were some things like <a href="https://tokio.rs">tokio</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs">rocket</a> that I didn’t need to think about - AI coding tools know them well.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-the-project">Current state of the project</h2>
<p>Last week I managed to upload <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/gmail-size-classifier-rs/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta">a MacOS .dmg file</a> with the app to the <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/gmail-size-classifier-rs">github repo</a>.
It is open source, although I plan to upload pre-built Windows and Linux binaries as well, for ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A few years ago I actively spent <a href="https://debamitro.github.io/blog/almost-6-weeks-of-rust">6 weeks learning Rust</a>. At that time I could compile a few lines of code after spending an entire day!
I used to tell people that if you want to become a philosopher go learn Rust. Fast forward to today, I am at least 3x more productive. I didn’t learn any more Rust in these years - I didn’t even touch it.
But I have the power of AI a.k.a. ‘vibe coding’. And even though it is not an expert in Rust yet, it knows more than what I had learned in those 6 weeks.</p>
