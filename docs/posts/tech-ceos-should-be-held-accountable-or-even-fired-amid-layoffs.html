                                <p><strong>Happy first-Monday-of-the-month. </strong>I&#39;m Matt Weinberger, deputy editor of Insider&#39;s tech analysis team, filling in for Diamond Naga Siu. </p>
                        
                        <p>This particular Monday comes with something of a hangover in the tech industry, after a week that saw <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-new-era-efficiency-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-could-be-cutting-more-costs-its-cfo-just-said-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-no-layoffs-tim-cook-iphone-earnings-season-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Apple</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/aws-slowing-growth-amazon-earnings-steeper-decline-ahead-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Amazon</a> report earnings that showed just how much of a toll the economy has taken on Silicon Valley. </p><p>The tech CEOs have struck a tone of contrition, apologizing for over-hiring and losing focus at the height of the pandemic, even as they all lay off workers (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-no-layoffs-tim-cook-iphone-earnings-season-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">all except Apple</a>, that is) and call for a renewed drive towards efficiency. But where does the buck really stop?  </p><p>My friend Ed Zitron argues in a column for Insider that workers are taking the fall and losing their livelihoods for what&#39;s ultimately those CEOs&#39; fault: &#34;Any executive who participates in decision-making that leads to hundreds or thousands of people losing their jobs should be the one leading them out the door,&#34; he writes. </p><p>The one thing that everybody seems to agree on is that it&#39;ll get darker before the next dawn in Silicon Valley, so expect a lot more conversation over how and why we got here. </p>

Twitter wants $100 from developers. </strong>Twitter CEO Elon Musk says that it&#39;s considering charging developers $100 a month for access to the social network&#39;s API, which lets third-party software access the platform&#39;s data. Musk says it&#39;d help guard against &#34;bad&#34; bots, but it remains to be seen how those developers will respond. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-twitter-api-access-monthly-charge-clean-bots-2023-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Read the full story.</a></p><p><strong>7. &#34;As cities move to ban gas stoves, I tried going all-electric in the kitchen.&#34;</strong> Insider&#39;s Adam Rogers set out to answer one simple question: How well does induction actually cook?
