    <h1>SQLite Doesn&#39;t Use Git</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><p><span><div><p>Sep 10, 2022</p><article><div><p>Instead, it uses <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki">Fossil</a> as a version control system. Some thoughts.</p><p>Fossil is also developed by the same primary author as SQLite (D. Richard Hipp). Like SQLite, they share some similar design philosophies (at a very high level):</p><ul><li>All-in-one product – Fossil takes the main ideas of VCS and extends them by including bug tracking, wiki, alerting, chat, and a web interface. Whether or not that makes it more of an alternative to git or GitHub is another question. <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/what-comes-after-git">What comes after git?</a> (APIs – ok, everything else might be feature creep).</li><li>SQLite as a database – Fossil uses SQLite as a database instead of Git&#39;s object model. This makes it easy to back up and store repositories. </li><li>Fossil does not support rebase. Here&#39;s an article from the author titled, <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/rebaseharm.md">Rebase Considered Harmful.</a> While Fossil has the ability to squash merges, the primary workflow supported is merging. I appreciate the opinionated workflow (vs. git&#39;s <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/squash-merge-or-rebase">squash, merge, or rebase</a>), but I still believe that a squash+merge (or sometimes, rebase) workflow pairs better with pull requests.</li><li>85% of the commits (to SQLite) are from two users. The project has around 37 contributors (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/reports?type=ci&amp;view=byuser">activity report</a>). Fossil is a bit more diverse, with 128 different contributors (top 2 contributors at 49%). On the surface, this is contrary to most open source projects, although I still believe the bulk of the work on many OSS projects comes from a few key contributors. The project is also notorious for not accepting outside patches or contributions.</li></ul><p>Fossil not only serves as a good testing ground for SQLite but an alternative approach to version control systems – a category that hasn&#39;t evolved much since git was developed.</p></div></article></div><div><div><p>Subscribe for daily posts on startups &amp; engineering.</p></div></div></span></p></div></div></div></div>
