<p><a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/youtube-original-content-group-shutdown-1235156299/">Variety</a> reports that Google&#39;s original video content group, YouTube Originals, is dead. The YouTube division was founded six years ago to make exclusive, original content for the pay-per-month YouTube Premium service. Now, the group is being shuttered, and YouTube&#39;s global head of original content, Susanne Daniels, is leaving the company in March.</p>
<p>Just after the news broke, YouTube Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl posted a statement on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An update on YouTube Originals: <a href="https://t.co/PixhgZ2yhU">pic.twitter.com/PixhgZ2yhU</a></p>
<p>— Robert Kyncl (@rkyncl) <a href="https://twitter.com/rkyncl/status/1483502275804872704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p>YouTube is the web&#39;s de facto video site, but Google still tends to chase any hot new web video trend that appears. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/youtubes-tiktok-clone-shorts-is-out-of-beta-and-open-for-all-us-users/">YouTube Shorts</a> is a clone of TikTok. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/hands-on-with-youtube-gaming-google-built-itself-a-twitch-killer/">YouTube Gaming</a> is a clone of Twitch. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3sIHuMMZec">YouTube Stories</a> was meant to be an answer to Snapchat. YouTube Originals was a swipe at Netflix, which, in 2016, was turning heads with award-winning shows like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>. Back then, the $12-per-month YouTube Premium started life as &#34;YouTube Red,&#34; and its offerings were called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/youtube-red-offers-premium-youtube-for-9-99-a-month-12-99-for-ios-users/">YouTube Red Originals.</a></p>                                            
                                                        
<p>
At first, YouTube put a decidedly YouTube spin on original content and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2017/03/i-used-youtube-red-for-months-heres-why-i-cancelled-my-subscription/#h3">threw big budgets</a> at the platform&#39;s star content creators, resulting in shows like <em>Scare PewDiePie</em>, created by the executive producers of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/the-walking-dead/"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>. YouTube Originals eventually pivoted to produce more Hollywood-style content and saw some success in 2018 with <em>The Karate Kid</em> sequel <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/youtubes-karate-kid-sequel-cobra-kai-shouldnt-work-yet-it-does/">Cobra Kai</a>.</em></p>
<p>We&#39;ve seen this story about a million times from Google—after a new initiative does not achieve immediate, incredible success, the company starts scaling back its plans after about two years. By the end of 2018, reports surfaced that YouTube was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/youtube-may-make-originals-free-with-ads-for-all-to-watch-by-2020/">shifting focus</a> and that YouTube Originals would be ad-supported, just like normal YouTube videos. YouTube Originals&#39; more successful projects moved on to other video services, with Netflix picking up <em>Cobra Kai</em> for seasons 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube Premium is still around for $12 per month. The main perks are ad-free YouTube and YouTube Music, while the mobile app gets background playback and the ability to download content for offline use.</p>
