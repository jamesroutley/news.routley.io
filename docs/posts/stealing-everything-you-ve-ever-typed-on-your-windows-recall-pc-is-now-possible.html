<p><a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">Stealing everything you’ve ever typed or viewed on your own Windows PC is now possible with two lines of code — inside the Copilot+ Recall disaster</a> (<a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/112537206611365804" title="@GossiTheDog">via</a>) Recall is a new feature in Windows 11 which takes a screenshot every few seconds, runs local device OCR on it and stores the resulting text in a SQLite database. This means you can search back through your previous activity, against local data that has remained on your device.</p>
<p>The security and privacy implications here are still enormous because malware can now target a single file with huge amounts of valuable information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During testing this with an off the shelf infostealer, I used Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — which detected the off the shelve infostealer — but by the time the automated remediation kicked in (which took over ten minutes) my Recall data was already long gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Kevin Beaumont&#39;s argument here about the subset of users this feature is appropriate for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a surface level, it is great if you are a manager at a company with too much to do and too little time as you can instantly search what you were doing about a subject a month ago.</p>
<p>In practice, that audience’s needs are a very small (tiny, in fact) portion of Windows userbase — and frankly talking about screenshotting the things people in the <em>real world</em>, not executive world, is basically like punching customers in the face.</p>
