    <h1>According to Atlanta Fed we&#39;re already in a recession</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Welcome back to </span><strong>PAV Chartbook</strong><span>: market charts, data, research, and insights pulled from various sources around the Internet by a solo retail investor.</span></p><p><strong>1. CFO outlooks.</strong><span> CFOs are optimistic about their respective companies. Not so much when it comes to the overall economic outlook.</span></p><p><strong>2. Are we already in a recession?</strong><span> According to the Atlanta Fed (and the “textbook” definition), we are already in a recession. GDPNow projection for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) is now -1.6%. That’s a tick lower than the -1.5% estimate from just 4 days ago.</span></p><p><strong>3. What everyone else thinks.</strong><span> The median forecast for Q2 GDP growth is now down to 0.7% (seasonally adjusted annual rate).</span></p><p><strong>5. Starts slowdown.</strong><span> Housing starts dropped to a 14-month low as homebuilder sentiment declines. Starts are down 14% YoY.</span></p><p><strong>6. Mortgage rates.</strong><span> The negative sentiment is driven primarily by affordability (or a lack thereof). The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 5.82% from 5.74%. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png" width="1057" height="511" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:511,&#34;width&#34;:1057,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:69549,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85b0e9a3-c5e4-4c02-a0d0-0bf9589b0705_1057x511.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p><strong>7. Median sales price of existing US home = $416,000.</strong><span> Even so, median US home prices reached another all-time high and are now up 41% over the last 2 years.</span></p><p><strong>8. Inventory: a long way to go.</strong><span> A big reason for stubborn home prices is inventory, which is admittedly rising rapidly, but still historically low.</span></p><p><strong>9. Home prices chill out?</strong><span> Home prices have enjoyed positive YoY growth for 124 consecutive months. They’re definitely still rising, but the pace at which they’re rising has slowed.</span></p><p><strong>10. Demand is weak.</strong><span> Demand for home loans fell for the 3rd straight week as mortgage applications dropped 6.3%. Demand is now at its lowest level since April 2020.</span></p><p><strong>11. 5-month streak.</strong><span> Existing home sales fell for the 5th straight month in June, this time by 5.4%. It marks the </span><a href="https://calculatedrisk.substack.com/p/nar-existing-home-sales-decreased-4c7#:~:text=This%20was%20the-,tenth,-consecutive%20month%20with" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">10th</a><span> straight month with sales down YoY. Interestingly, days-on-market is at </span><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-slid-5-4-in-june#:~:text=the%20market%20for-,14%20days,-in%20June%2C%20down" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">record lows</a><span>. My guess is a combination of low inventory and buyers wanting to finalize sales before mortgage rates increase further.</span></p><p><strong>12. The meat of earnings season.</strong><span> Roughly 50% of the S&amp;P 500 reports next week—buckle up!</span></p><p><strong>13. Earnings growth and PMI.</strong><span> Expectations for Q2 EPS earnings growth (excluding energy) are very negative. More so than the global composite PMI is implying.</span></p><p><strong>14. Recession likely?</strong><span> Fund managers are not very optimistic.</span></p><p><strong>15. Lehman Bros-levels.</strong><span> The same managers are predictably walking on eggshells. Their positioning is more risk-off now than during the Great Financial Crisis.</span></p><p><strong>16. More pessimism.</strong><span>  Will global profits improve next year? Fund managers have never been more certain that they will not.</span></p><p><strong>17. But the consensus…</strong><span> This is interesting because consensus earnings estimates—despite all of the doomsday talk of negative revisions—are showing “total resilience”.</span></p><p><strong>17. Positioning.</strong><span> Here’s how these same fund managers were positioned ahead of the current rally.</span></p><p><strong>18. Value vs. Growth.</strong><span> Fund managers now have less conviction in value over growth stocks.</span></p><p><strong>19. Short the world.</strong><span> The chart below shows global macro hedge fund beta to world equities. It means these funds are now the shortest they’ve been on equities in 36 months.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
