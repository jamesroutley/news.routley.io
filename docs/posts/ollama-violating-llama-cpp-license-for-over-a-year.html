    <h1>Ollama violating llama.cpp license for over a year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p dir="auto">ollama uses projects like llama.cpp as a statically linked dependency. The terms of the MIT license require that it distribute the copyright notice in both source and binary form. Yet if I <code>grep</code> for &#34;Georgi Gerganov&#34; on my Linux and Windows installation folders for ollama, the copyright notices are nowhere to be found. This is a violation of the terms of the license which should be rectified.</p><p dir="auto">I expected the copyright notices of dependent projects to be at minimum present within the binary artifacts. Some people online are of the opinion that a mention of llama.cpp should be present in places like the README as well, although the license doesn&#39;t strictly require that.</p><div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="grep -iR &#39;Georgi Gerganov&#39; AppData/Local/Programs/Ollama/
