    <h1>The OG Social Network: Other People’s Websites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>“Organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”</p>
<p>That’s Google’s stated mission.</p>
<p>But what if the world&#39;s information becomes locked in disparate silos, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/the-missing-hit-and-the-open-web/">inaccessible to a search engine</a>? Is there a future where Google dies on the vine, not enough content to make their engine useful?</p>
<p>Walled social networks were always a problem for Google. </p>
<p>But now there’s Slack. Discord. Substack. Newsletters. Paywalls. All walled and inaccessible to Google — an existential problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps history will conclude killing Google reader killed Google, an overly-simplistic conclusion but poetically ironic nonetheless.</p>
<p>Google+ was Google trying to mimic the walled garden of Facebook — their “how” of extracting value from the people of the internet.</p>
<p>But they already had an answer for Facebook’s News Feed in front of them: Blogger / Google Reader, the read / write of the internet.</p>
<p>The mistake was killing Reader to make Plus a success. Google’s judo move would’ve been to embrace the open web as a social network. Not <em>their</em> network but <em>our</em> network.</p>
<p>They provide the tools – Reader, Blogger, Search — we provide the personal websites. The open, accessible, indexable web as The Next Great Social Network.</p>
<p>A dream? Alas.</p>
<p>Google has stood on top of the success of communities. Groups of people who write content and curate interestingness by linking to other things for humans. <a href="https://twitter.com/carribeiro/status/1477804467735117827?s=21">Could PageRank have been invented today?</a></p>
<p>So much online activity is less public now as companies strive to capture the value we create being online with each other — the value I’m creating right now by writing this and linking to other things, things not on Discord or Slack or Confluence but on other peoples’ websites.</p>
<p>Other people’s websites are the OG social network, and the optimist in me is going to riff on MLK’s quote: the social arc of the internet is long, but it bends towards individual websites.</p>
