Wing-in-ground effect refers to the airflow created by the vehicle’s wings and surface of the ocean, which allows seagliders to travel smoothly above the water. This means seagliders can fly low (within one wingspan) over the water on a cushion of air to take advantage of numerous aerodynamic and operational efficiencies.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b14c"><p>Are seagliders safe for passengers?</p></div><div><p>Seagliders fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard and will be regulated to the highest safety standards for passenger carrying vehicles. In addition, seagliders will be certified by Bureau Veritas, a global classification society that provides third-party technical assessments and approves new seagoing vessels such as seagliders. REGENT has already received an Approval in Principle from Bureau Veritas, paving the way for commercial operations for its 12-passenger seaglider, Viceroy.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b155"><p>How is the Hawaii Seaglider Initiative gathering input from the community?</p></div><div><p>REGENT and Pacific Current commissioned SMS Research, a leading market research firm based in Honolulu, to look at the economic, environmental, and community benefits and challenges associated with introducing seagliders to Hawai‘i. This initial survey  examined the socioeconomic and technical feasibility of establishing an inter-island and intra-island seaglider system.  </p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="1595ffad-0f0b-3e5a-d66b-ed0e0ee8dac5"><p>Will seaglider travel only be accessibly by wealthy residents and visitors?</p></div><div><p>Seagliders are much less expensive to operate relative to airplanes. This cost reduction means much lower ticket prices than what are currently offered by airline while simultaneously providing a quicker door-to-door travel time.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b171"><p>Are seagliders like the Hawai‘i Superferry?</p></div><div><p>No, seagliders use a different technology than the Hawai‘i Superferry. Seagliders float, foil and fly to travel from one point to another. The Superferry used waterjet propulsion, cruising over the surface of the ocean.  </p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b17a"><p>What are some concerns that have been expressed about the Hawai‘i seaglider system?</p></div><div><p>A preliminary survey of Hawai‘i residents showed they are concerned that seagliders will only be affordable to the affluent and may result in an increased tax burden on Hawai‘i’s residents. The survey also showed that residents are concerned that seagliders may produce some form of ecological damage either near shore or in the areas surrounding the harbors. Others expressed their concern about how seagliders can potentially impact communities through an increase in visitors. All of these concerns are important to the Hawai‘i Seaglider Initiative, and will be addressed as seagliders move forward in Hawai‘i. We believe seagliders should bring the community together, not divide us. The goal of the Hawai‘i Seaglider Initiative is to move forward with an open heart and mind as a unified community.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b183"><p>Who was included in the survey and when was it conducted?</p></div><div><p>SMS Research collected responses to questionnaires from mid-August 2022 until early October 2022 from government leaders, elected officials who would be direct decision-makers or appropriators for transportation services, maritime industry executives, and leaders from environmental and community organizations representing interests that would be directly impacted by the seaglider service.   </p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="2d5df2a5-cd04-7101-3358-486e78198020"><p>Will seagliders interfere with marine ecosystems and habitats?</p></div><div><p>We recognize the dangers of introducing a new mode of maritime transportation to Hawai’i’s environment. This is why seagliders are built to the highest regulatory and environmental standards. Seagliders contain a suite of early detection and avoidance systems to ensure that birds, whales, and other marine life is kept safe. Seagliders also offer a zero-emission mode of fast and affordable travel. With transportation making up the majority of Hawai’i’s energy emissions, seagliders represent a real and effective tool to help Hawai’i meet state sustainability goals which will further protect marine ecosystems.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><div><p><h2>What is a Seaglider? </h2></p><p>A seaglider is an all-electric, passenger-carrying, wing-in-ground-effect vehicle built to service coastal routes, building on real-world-proven tech. </p></div><div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201.webp" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 41vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-500.webp 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-800.webp 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-1080.webp 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-1600.webp 1600w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-2000.webp 2000w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-2600.webp 2600w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201.webp 3000w" alt=""/></p></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
