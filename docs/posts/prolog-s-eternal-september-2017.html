<p>I realized recently that the way I have been handling answers to Prolog questions on Stack Overflow contravenes the rules. I don’t mind ignoring rules if it serves a higher purpose, but I have also come to realize that it actually is counterproductive.</p>
<p>There is a constant flow of pre-beginner questions about Prolog on Stack Overflow. The questions I’m referring to typically sound like this:<span></span> <span>“</span>my professor said a few incoherent things about Prolog and here’s my assignment and I don’t know where to start.” The pre-beginners are not at Stack Overflow to look at existing solutions (which is what Stack Overflow wants you to do). They just want someone to do their homework for them.. They don’t come back later or develop a deeper appreciation for Prolog. Some of this is unavoidable, but the flow is very high.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to (and have tried to) take the opportunity to foster an interest in Prolog, their questions are actually a symptom of a totally different problem that simply cannot be addressed within <span>SO</span>. I think the underlying problem is that Prolog is part of a mandatory curriculum, but the professor doesn’t understand it. <em>How do you teach something you don’t understand?</em></p>
<p>I would like to live in a world where professors consider Prolog worth knowing and put in the effort. That probably isn’t realistic. If I can’t have that, I would at least like to live in a world where students’ first or only exposure to Prolog is something more constructive than<span></span> <span>“</span>Look how weird and confusing this thing is!”</p>
<p>I’m not in higher education, so I don’t know how to approach these problems. I would love to hear some ideas. But my first thought is a two-pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A smallish (less than 10) solution database, where each solution is somehow annotated so that you can figure out both really low-level things (variables are uppercase) and really high-level things (why an accumulator is used). The idea is that it should be possible to answer any question, no matter how obvious, by mousing over things in the solution database.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of slides for use by professors to teach Prolog without really knowing it. There would be a few different versions (one class session, three class sessions) and a moratorium on providing solutions on Stack Overflow, instead pointing people who ask to the solution database.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Have other ideas? Please send me an email, let’s talk.</p>
