            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We released Zulip Server 5.1 today! This is a bugfix release, containing a few  cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.0, primarily to address upgrading bugs.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a> in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes">Notable changes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed upgrade bug where preexisting animated emoji would still always animate in statuses.</li>
<li>Improved check that prevents servers from accidentally downgrading, to not block upgrading servers that originally installed Zulip Server prior to mid-2017.</li>
<li>Fixed email address de-duplication in Slack imports.</li>
<li>Prevented an extraneous scrollbar when a notification banner was present across the top.</li>
<li>Fixed installation in LXC containers, which failed due to <code>chrony</code> not being runnable there.</li>
<li>Prevented a &#34;push notifications not configured&#34; warning from appearing in the new user default settings panel even when push notifications were configured.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which, in uncommon configurations, would prevent Tornado from being restarted during upgrades; users would be able to log in, but would immediately be logged out.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
</ul>
