    <h1>Killing invasive species is now a competitive sport</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>A 2008 study in the Bahamas calculated that lionfish arriving at a new reef can eliminate more than eighty per cent of other species within five weeks. The researchers were amazed to see one lionfish eat twenty wrasses in half an hour. Other studies have revealed additional remarkable qualities. A lionfish can expand its mouth to accommodate prey more than half its own body size, and its stomach can expand up to thirty times its normal size, allowing it to gorge at length. But a lionfish can also exist on nothing for three months, by putting itself into a kind of hibernation. When lionfish occupy a reef, they vacuum up not just fish but also larvae, diminishing the variety of future generations. One of the lionfish’s favorite meals is young parrot fish; the species plays a key role in cleaning a reef of algae, and its absence can lead to reef damage or death.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>In 2017, she went to Destin to participate in the event now known as the Emerald Coast Open. She and the two other women on her team speared a thousand fish in two days, winning the tournament. Bowman was thrilled, but it bothered her that “a huge big deal was made not because we won it but because it was three girls.” (One online headline: “<em>cuties confront lionfish menace</em>.”)</p><p>During these years, Bowman was so competitive that she took risks she now sees as foolish—she’d dive for too long, or she’d go too deep for someone with her level of experience. Another diver remembers her using shoddy equipment. She grew out of many of these habits, but on a dive two years ago disaster still struck. She was diving with a friend who came up too quickly. “He had what we call a ‘hit,’ ” she told me. He couldn’t feel his fingers when he got on the boat, and couldn’t remember Bowman’s name. To treat decompression sickness, you are supposed to administer oxygen from extra tanks kept on the deck—but Bowman had forgotten to bring any. The friend was medevacked to a hospital in Miami, but he suffered lasting nerve damage to his spine. Bowman vowed to be more careful. She told me, “How can it not change you—how I dive, how I look at my divers?”</p><p>On the first day of the Emerald Coast Open, I went to a pier in a residential part of Destin to see off Bowman and her teammates: Holden Harris, the University of Florida researcher; a biologist named Kara Wall; and a young diver, Casey Brann, whose day job was at Amazon. It was five in the morning. Harris, his girlfriend, and Bowman had stayed at Alex Fogg’s house the previous night; I had stopped by, and rumpled beds, air mattresses, and a barking puppy gave it the feel of off-campus housing. At the house, Bowman had prepped some spaghetti and meatballs for the first evening of the tournament. Harris’s girlfriend, an astrophysicist who doesn’t dive, would heat it up before the team got home, late that night.</p><p>The team members felt that they were in a strong position to win. Their boat’s captain, Kyle Howard, was in control of what everyone saw as the most valuable item on board—a G.P.S.-equipped “fish-finder,” which uses sonar technology to identify objects deep beneath the waves. The key to winning the Open, Bowman told me, was not the diving. It wasn’t about who was the fastest diver or the best diver: “It’s about who has the spots—who has those G.P.S. numbers.” Howard was both a local and a beneficiary of Fogg’s unparalleled knowledge. As Howard backed out of the boat-launch pier, Bowman was putting on her wetsuit. She sniffed her booties. “They smell like fish,” she said. “That’s a good sign.” The sun began to peek above the horizon.</p><p>More than an hour away was the first stop: an artificial reef of prefabricated modules, almost a hundred and fifty feet below the surface. On the way, Howard opened a beer to celebrate. He put Cheez Doodles in his nose to keep the mood light. About twenty-five miles out, he idled the boat, and Bowman and Wall went into the water. When they came up, Howard moved the boat a quarter mile or so; then Harris and Brann went in. The sky was clear and the water visibility was excellent—you could see the bottom from eighty feet above. But each diver surfaced with only six fish. Howard consulted his fish-finder—he has thousands of reef sites logged—and motored west for another half a mile. The team dived again.</p><p>They repeated this all morning, without much success. Conditions improved in the afternoon: each team member was regularly getting about thirty lionfish per dive. Around 5 <em>p.m</em>., when Wall was on her ninth dive of the day, she saw something huge pass overhead. An experienced diver, she thought it was a great white shark. (Later, she demoted it to a fourteen-foot dusky.) They called off the last dive and headed home as it started to rain and lightning lit up the sky. They had speared five hundred and forty-two lionfish, which rested on ice in coolers belowdecks. On the way in, Bowman asked Howard to call around and see how they were doing against the competition. “Everyone’s cagey,” Bowman explained to me later. “You sniff around a little, but nobody’s giving out numbers.” She went on, “We felt like we had done good. But you don’t get too hyped up one way or another.”</p><p>Two days before the competition started, I went out on a dive boat with Alex Fogg, the event’s organizer, to try my luck as a lionfish hunter. I had expected to dive to the bottom of the Gulf, but, as an uncertified diver, I would be limited to a depth of fifty to sixty feet, and in Florida lionfish tend to be found in deeper waters. So we agreed that we would go about six miles offshore, where the depth was around eighty feet, and if Fogg dived and found any lionfish he’d deposit them at the surface. I would be snorkeling, armed and ready to deliver the coup de grâce.</p><p>We set off from the harbor and headed for a bridge that marked the entrance to the Gulf. There were dozens of boats in the bay, all of them devoted to fishing, to drinking, or to fishing and drinking. There were day cruisers, cabin cruisers, skiffs, banana boats, Jet Skis, octagonal tiki barges that floated along under thatched roofs, and yachts—with water slides and without.</p><p>Tourism has become one of the region’s largest businesses: the Destin area has more than fourteen thousand rooms for rent, the biggest charter-fishing fleet in the country, and a terrible traffic problem. The week of the tournament overlapped with the Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival, and in my hotel lobby at night T-shirts bearing the slogan “<em>LIONFISH PATROL</em>” clashed with tricornes.</p><p>Fogg, who is thirty-four, wants people to have fun at the Open—he likes the fact that lionfishing has become a sport, but a casual one. At the same time, he is also trying to educate the public. This year, he gave top Destin restaurants free lionfish, in return for their training servers to explain to customers why the species is an invasive pest (and how tasty one can be). Fogg had also set up an information booth on the waterfront. A veteran sea captain explained the lionfish problem to passersby on their way to dolphin tours or funnel cakes. It had taken a while for local officials to realize that ecology could be a tourism draw, Fogg said, but they were beginning to understand the potential.</p><p>The water off Destin was the most vivid shade of emerald I’d ever seen. The beaches looked like snow. It took us about half an hour to reach our intended spot in the Gulf. Coral cannot survive at such northern latitudes—the majority of dives off Northwest Florida are to wrecks or to artificial constructions. Out of sight below us were chicken coops that had been sunk more than a decade ago. Fogg put on a camo-patterned wetsuit and dived in while I put on fins and a snorkel. A few minutes later, he came up with a few small lionfish and a flounder. “Someone must have hit that reef,” he said, meaning that there had been spearing there shortly before. It takes several months for a lionfish population at a given structure to recover.</p><p>Figuring out how to use the pole spear took some work. It was shockingly fast once you released it, and by accident I shot one over the stern. When I asked for a longer pole, I was told it would cost me four hundred dollars if it followed the other, so I settled for a two-foot sticking pole. With some practice, I was able to control its release. It had three nasty prongs on the end—far scarier than a lionfish.</p><p>My prey was floating by the stern of the boat, stunned by the sudden change in water pressure. But the chop was strong, and I kept losing sight of the fish once I was in the water. I tried to kill it several times with my spear but kept missing. In the wavy sea, it was hard to align the shot, easy as it looked. Finally, I got close and released the spear. The lionfish twitched briefly and died. I brought it up on the end of my stick like a discarded party favor.</p><p>You could say that I’d just helped protect an ecosystem, but I didn’t exactly feel heroic. The artificiality of my spearing experience only underscored the artificiality of the entire reef ecosystem. The Destin reefs had been created by humans—and, if you got rid of them, you’d get rid of most of the lionfish. But, at another point in the day, as I stared down toward the submerged modules of a different fake reef, I could see all sorts of native life swirling around: grouper and snapper, tomtate and angelfish. If you wanted to keep all this around, maybe you had to treat the Florida coast like an aquarium. At least Fogg was making the cleanup fun. He knew his audience. He told me, “We added a beer festival this year—to lure people.”</p><p>The second day of the Emerald Open dawned with even better weather than the first. Bowman’s team put its boat in the water just before sunrise and was soon out at the reefs. This time, Howard took the group about twenty miles to the west of where they had started the day before. The tanks that Bowman had dived with on the first day had been too bulky for her—she is only five feet tall—and she had pulled her back out. On the way in that night, as soon as they were in cell-phone range of the shore, she had called a diver named Josh Livingston, perhaps the most storied lionfish hunter in the world. Livingston, who is thirty-seven, has killed more than a hundred thousand lionfish—“To be honest, it’s a hundred per cent commercial for me,” he told me, adding that he’d made a quarter of a million dollars from their sale—but he was sitting out the Open this year. It was physically too draining. Informally, though, he was advising the chief competition to Bowman’s team: the DeepWater Mafia. That team consisted of four divers from Mississippi: a plumber, a used-car wholesaler, and two contractors.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Bowman explained to him her problem with the heavy tanks, he got up from his dinner and went to fill some smaller tanks for her, then left them at Howard’s garage. “That’s what makes this community awesome,” Bowman told me. “We are competitive, but we will drop our shit and take care of another team in a heartbeat.”</p><p>For Bowman’s boat, the second day was more productive than the day before. On one dive, Harris nabbed sixty-two lionfish. His teammates cheered. Bowman topped out at thirty-one. The final dive of the day was her worst; she came up with only two fish. “In the end, it’s the luck of the draw,” she said. “We are relying on pinpoints on a map.” In total, Bowman’s team caught nearly thirteen hundred fish in two days—just under the winning total from 2021. When the tournament was over, the group headed in singing along to a rap track by Lil Jon, jumping up and down in their wetsuits.</p><p>They stopped to give a stranded boat a tow, and didn’t arrive at the pier until nine-thirty. They still had to get their boat out of the water and carry out the tanks and the coolers of fish. By then, the high had evaporated. Bowman was groaning, trying to stretch her back by folding herself across the pier. “The level of exhaustion, frustration, and fear you feel!” she said. “Did we do enough? Should we have done more? It’s now out of our hands.”</p><p>The next day, Fogg and his staff counted the fish. DeepWater Mafia, which had taken sixth place the previous year, won by nearly three hundred and fifty fish—a significant victory. It turned out that Bowman had been wrong: the fish-finder wasn’t what mattered most. This wasn’t the fishing equivalent of Moneyball. “There’s only so much G.P.S. can do for you,” Josh Livingston explained to me after the tally was finalized. He had advised the DeepWater Mafia to prioritize how many dives it got in. You had to be out at the reefs early, Livingston said, and get in and out of the water faster. The DeepWater Mafia ended up going out in two boats; as a result, each diver was able to average eighteen dives a day, compared with ten for Bowman’s team.</p><p>Diving that many times in a single day can be dangerous—you’re more likely to get an overload of nitrogen in your blood. Tim Shivers, who headed the DeepWater Mafia team, acknowledged to me, “A lot of people would call us foolish for diving that much in a day. We were pushing the limits.” Shivers told me that his team had made a profit of eighteen thousand dollars, after accounting for the price of two hundred and fifty gallons of fuel. The environmental cost of the gas did not matter to him. “I’m not a tree hugger,” he said, though he added that he cared about marine conservation.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
