<h3>GM Makes $1,500 OnStar Subscription Mandatory On Some Models</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9522"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017.jpg" alt="2022 Gmc Yukon Denali" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017.jpg 1600w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-GMC-Yukon-Denali-017-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9522">Photo credit: GMC</figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine seeing a new car advertised for a fair price and waltzing down to a dealer that doesn’t charge markup, only to find a $1,500 line item on the window sticker appears for a telematics subscription you can’t opt out of. Sounds like a nightmare, right? Well, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/gm-requires-buick-gmc-buyers-buy-1500-onstar-subscription">Automotive News</a> reports that this is the reality Buick, GMC, and Cadillac Escalade buyers face thanks to a new required OnStar subscription.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mandatory upcharge provides a three-year subscription to OnStar, GM’s long-standing in-vehicle safety, security and connectivity service. It’s included in the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of all Buicks and GMCs ordered starting June 2 and all Cadillac Escalades ordered starting July 18.</p>
<p>The $1,500 plan is listed on the window sticker as a separate line item along with other additions to the vehicle’s standard equipment, but there is no option to remove it or order the vehicle without it. Customers who decline to activate their OnStar service will not be given a price reduction, GM said.</p>
<p>“By including this plan as standard equipment on the vehicle, it helps to provide a more seamless onboarding experience and more customer value,” GM spokeswoman Kelly Cusinato told Automotive News in an email.</p></blockquote>
<p>While price hikes are nothing new, most price hikes are fairly transparent. Even on the Buick configurator, this mandatory OnStar subscription is definitely somewhat opaque. For instance, a base 2022 Buick Encore GX lists for $25,595 including a $1,195 freight charge on Buick’s website. Select that trim on the configurator and net price jumps to $27,095 with zero explanation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_16367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16367"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar.jpg" alt="Encore Gx Mandatory Onstar" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar.jpg 1920w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/encore-gx-mandatory-onstar-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16367">Screenshot: Buick</figcaption></figure>
<p>If an option is mandatory, it is therefore standard equipment and should be included in a vehicle’s MSRP. GM’s decision to conceal this price hike through a mandatory OnStar subscription listed as an option is deceptive, full-stop. A mandatory hidden charge doesn’t add “more customer value,” it drives customers away. Does GM really think that the person buying a base-model Buick Encore GX has an extra $1,500 laying around?</p>
<h3>Ford F-150 Lightning Gets Massive Price Hike</h3>
<figure id="attachment_16370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16370"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04.jpg" alt="2022 Ford F 150 Lightning Alaska Bft Testing 04" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04.jpg 1600w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2022-Ford-F-150-Lightning_Alaska-BFT-testing_04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16370">Photo credit: Ford</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck has proven to be a hot commodity, with many reservation holders missing out on first-round ordering due to excess demand. Well, order banks are open again, although you’ll need to splash out significant additional cash to get an F-150 Lightning this time around.</p>
<p>Ford hasn’t released freight charges for new F-150 Lightning orders, so expect to add somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 to each of these prices. The fleet-spec Lightning Pro now starts at $46,974, up $7,000. The XLT trim now starts at $59,474, an increase of $6,500. Add the extended range battery, and MSRP jumps to $80,974, up $8,500. Moving on to the Lariat trim, standard range models get a $7,000 price hike to $74,474, while extended range models see a price increase of $8,500 and an MSRP of $85,974. Want a top-trim Platinum model? You’re now looking at $96,874, an increase of $6,000.</p>
<p>Wow, those are some enormous price hikes. Is there any extra standard equipment to somewhat offset the new pricing? Hardly. Standard range models see range increased 10 miles to 240 miles, and that’s it for no-cost changes. Right, let’s hear Ford’s justification for the new pricing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ford is adjusting the MSRP on the F-150 Lightning for the first time since it was revealed in May 2021 and has honored MSRP for all customer orders to date. Due to significant material cost increases and other factors, Ford has adjusted MSRP starting with the opening of the next wave of F-150 Lightning orders.</p></blockquote>
<p>I shouldn’t be terribly surprised about the price hikes. Lithium is still quite expensive and with large battery packs of either 98 kWh or 131 kWh, a lot of resources go into manufacturing the F-150 Lightning. There is potentially some good news, though. Ford will be extending private offers to some customers who deferred their Lightning orders, although details on those offers aren’t exactly public knowledge. In the wake of these price hikes, I’m curious as to whether or not Chevrolet sticks to the expected $39,990 base price for its Silverado EV. If GM stays firm on expected pricing, the electric truck wars could get very heated indeed.</p>
<h3>Volkswagen Reportedly Looking To Cut Board Positions</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9305"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/volkswagen-golf-r-20-years.jpg" alt="Volkswagen Golf R 20 Years" width="1111" height="625" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/volkswagen-golf-r-20-years.jpg 1111w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/volkswagen-golf-r-20-years-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/volkswagen-golf-r-20-years-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/volkswagen-golf-r-20-years-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1111px) 100vw, 1111px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9305">Photo credit: Volkswagen</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another executive shakeup could occur at Volkswagen as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-volkswagens-new-ceo-plans-downsize-management-board-sources-2022-08-10/">Reuters</a> reports that incoming CEO Oliver Blume plans to shrink the management board down to eight or nine people from the current 12. As for who could be cut from the team, the report has some ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>The future of China board member Ralf Brandstaetter is unclear, one of them said, as is that of IT chief Hauke Stars.</p>
<p>The posts of purchasing manager Murat Aksel and sales manager Hildegard Wortmann, meanwhile, could be at risk.</p>
<p>“One could ask why the purchasing manager of the VW passenger car brand also has to be on the group board,” the second source said, adding that also applied to Wortmann, who heads the group’s sales department in addition to Audi.</p>
<p>Up for discussion is also the wide range of tasks of technology head Thomas Schmall, who is responsible among other things for the group’s automotive suppliers, the development of a global network of battery plants and technology platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what they say about having too many cooks? It seems like Volkswagen’s board has grown a bit too large, so shrinking the board should align nicely with the concept of lean management. Plus, Reuters claims that the majority-stake Porsche and Piech families are looking for calmer management, and a tighter board could help with that. Regardless of what happens, this will be an interesting saga to watch.</p>
<h3>Don’t Get Bonked By A Kia Optima</h3>
<figure id="attachment_16373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16373"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011.jpg" alt="2011 Kia Optima Sx 08 26 2011" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011.jpg 1600w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/2011_Kia_Optima_SX_-_08-26-2011-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16373">Photo credit: IFCAR</figcaption></figure>
<p>Safety recalls don’t normally verge on slapstick, but Kia’s found a way for Optimas to bonk occupants on the head. As it sits, 257,998 Kia Optimas made between Aug. 12, 2011 and Sept. 27, 2013 have been recalled for headliner plates that might detach. Let’s delve into the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2022/RCLRPT-22V560-1091.PDF">NHTSA recall report</a> and see what it says.</p>
<blockquote><p>The subject vehicles are equipped with headliner plates designed as part of the energy absorbing structure of the headliner. Under certain circumstances, the headliner plate(s) may detach from the headliner upon deployment of the side curtain airbag(s), increasing the risk of injury to an occupant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk about adding insult to injury, or should that be adding injury to injury? Kia reports one injury from falling headliner plates and head trauma is certainly something to take seriously. Thankfully, Kia has a plan to fix this issue and it seems incredibly low-tech.</p>
<blockquote><p>The headliner plates will have an industrial-grade adhesive tape applied to the plates to provide additional adhesion to the headliner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taping up headliner plates may sound janky, but who am I to question this repair should it prove effective? Said tape was applied to 2014 model year Optimas and they don’t seem to be having this issue. Owners of affected Optimas are slated to receive recall notices in the mail between Sept. 26 and Sept. 30, right as the fix becomes available. Getting injured in a crash by your own car doesn’t sound fun, so this should be a recall worth getting done ASAP.</p>
<h3>The Flush</h3>
<p>Whelp, time to drop the lid on today’s edition of The Morning Dump. It’s officially Wednesday, and I’m starting to pack for our <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/the-autopian-is-hosting-a-car-show-in-la-on-august-13-and-we-want-you-there/">car show</a> in Los Angeles on Saturday. Between shirts, jeans, camera gear, and contact lens solution, I’m starting to think about snacks for a five-hour flight. Where in a car or on a plane, I just can’t seem to beat beef jerky as a relatively low-mess bite to eat. Be it for a road trip or for a flight, I’d love to know what your favorite travel snacks are.</p>

					<p>First of all, OnStar calls the police and fire department when you get into an accident. Lots of legal and insurance problems ensue from what would normally be a “dent it and forget it” minor issue.</p>

					<p><b>“The mandatory upcharge provides a three-year subscription to OnStar, GM’s long-standing in-vehicle safety, security and connectivity service.”</b></p>
<p>I’m an unfortunate expert in OnStar, and I can tell you, this is <i>way beyond bullshit</i>. One, OnStar is basically nothing but permanently installed spyware in your car at this point. You get absolutely nothing of value from the subscription. It doesn’t include map updates. It doesn’t include in-vehicle data.  There is no more ‘concierge’ service.</p>
<p>They can fuck off with this bullshit.</p>
<p><b>“The XLT trim now starts at $59,474, an increase of $6,500. Add the extended range battery, and MSRP jumps to $80,974, up $8,500.”</b></p>
<p>Oh yes, this is totally sustainable. A truck that costs FAR more than the median annual salary in every single state, not even accounting for inflation and rising interest rates. This is all so perfectly normal and totally not going to blow up the entire economy.</p>
<p>And no, you did not read that with <i>nearly</i> enough sarcasm.</p>
<p><b>Talk about adding insult to injury, or should that be adding injury to injury? Kia reports one injury from falling headliner plates and head trauma is certainly something to take seriously. Thankfully, Kia has a plan to fix this issue and it seems incredibly low-tech.</b></p>
<p>This is something that just, you know, happens. Either over time or because it’s an easy miss in testing. Adhesives age and may become less effective over time. And as we already know from last week’s dumps, crash tests do not match the real world. Or even close to it.</p>
<p><b>Be it for a road trip or for a flight, I’d love to know what your favorite travel snacks are.</b></p>
<p>Eating in the Porsche is strictly verboten. Not even fries. It’s just too damn hard to get stains and smells out of the ventilated leather. Only water and coffee permitted. If today’s planned acquisition works out, I’ll have to see. But in cars I do eat in, I honestly mostly don’t. I’d rather take the opportunity to stretch my legs after 4+ hours.		</p>

					<p>I sure hope that my GM (with long-dead OnStar) is still telling GM what radio stations I listen to. Especially since I use an RF modulator to connect my phone, using a radio frequency that no station in my area exists on. Have fun selling that!		</p>

					<p>I remember when I bought by first new car, the dealer told me that the immobilizer security system was already installed and was, therefore, a mandatory option.  I told them that if they installed it, they could also uninstall it and I’d wait there to complete my paperwork until they finished.  They did.</p>
<p>As for travel snacks, I usually go with beef jerky, trail mix, and Larabars.  I like the Larabars because they are not crumbly like some others (Kind bars in particular shatter when you bite into them) and leave me less messy in my airline crypo pod.		</p>

					<p>My favorite travel snacks are some kind of mixed nuts or fresh fruit. If I’m going to be doing a hike or something similar when I arrive my go to is energy balls I make at home. Cheaper and healthier than whatever road snack I’d come across.		</p>

					<p>I pray for the day of reckoning coming for auto manufacturers (and dealers). They’re like pigs at a trough, and still making brazen attempts to soak the customer as much as possible. This flies in the face of the increasing costs to finance, an uncertain economy, and other costs of living straining household budgets. </p>
<p>Here’s my hot, possibly unpopular take. It’s not as fun to be a car person these days because the low bar of entry for “eff it” cars has risen so greatly, parts are of marginal average quality with equally poor availability, labor rates are up if you can’t or don’t want to swing wrench, etc. That said, I’m glad I found a vehicle I can live with before things really went belly up. I’m also fortunate to have enough knowledge, space, and tools to be able to do my own work and the dogged determination to source the correct parts at a reasonable cost. My heart truly goes out to everyone else caught up in the maelstrom of suck, though.		</p>

					<p>Seriously, the labor rates are out of control, parts availability and quality doesn’t exist period, and mechanics aren’t seeing a goddamn penny of it either. Which makes it just flat out egregious.</p>
<p>How bad is it? The average labor rate in my town is now over $125 per hour, and the average mechanic is taking home about $22/hr book. There are even tuner shops that are approaching <i>my</i> rates which were described as “high enough to make Ferrari owners instantly balk.” (And that’s on stuff I want to work on.)</p>
<p>And the parts, jesusfuck. The shop I use when I don’t want to do it myself now refuses to use anything but ODM parts for anything except wheels and tires. (Actual ODM, not strictly dealer. i.e. Bosch coils are still okay.) Absolutely no customer provided parts unless it’s from the dealer. Because they were literally eating so many defective part comebacks that they were outright losing money.		</p>

					<p>Yeah, I’m sure they were losing a good amount of money due to come backs and warrantied work. It’s possible that they’re padding some of that with the increased labor rates. Because, obviously, those labor rates are not trickling down to the technicians doing work by way of take home pay or retention bonuses…something else is trickling down on them from above, though.		</p>

					<p>Nah, the shop I use doesn’t do padding. They’re eating shit and dying from health insurance costs and getting fucked hard on book since shit started going sideways. People started approving the Full Monty on 12 year old rustbelt cars. Can’t make 2.5 hour book when you have to spend a full hour with the torch and Blast’r to get two bolts out. Remember that mechanics on book also usually have guarantee. If they book 20 hours for the week because it was nothing but seized and broken bolts non-stop, they’re still owed pay for 30 or 40 even though the shop only gets to charge for 20.</p>
<p>And when I say Full Monty, I mean they’re pretty much regularly doing high-four low-five digit orders (they don’t do bodywork) on 10 year old commuter Hondas and Subarus at this point. Anything to get another few years out of the rotted out shitbox because they sure as shit can’t afford a $60k+ replacement, if they could even get one.		</p>

					<p>On one hand, my thought is, “about time” in regard to not casting off cars with only one tire in the junkyard. On the other hand, I feel for folks who have to lay down four and five figure money to keep their tired DDs going. It’s funny, I thought I was crazy spending $1,300 about 20 months ago to get a 1993 ZJ (admittedly it was very nice) baselined with a bunch of suspension and steering work, and other stuff I didn’t want to do.		</p>

					<p>This is the rust belt. These are not cars with “one tire in the junkyard” they’re having to deal with. Those <i>were</i> their bread-and-butter; high mileage stuff that just needed some minor TLC. Bushings here, head gasket or junkyard motor there, transmission rebuild on occasion, and a lot of condemning cars due to catastrophic rot or repairs exceeding value.</p>
<p>Now it’s just gone completely bugfuck. They’ve done complete frame replacements on old trucks and vans that aren’t worth the cost of the job. $3000+ K-frame jobs on cars with so much rot that the rest of the unibody’s likely to split. Just no end of jobs that cost multiples of what the car is worth even in this fucked up market, and customers that won’t accept no.		</p>

					<p>Maybe it’s all relative, because I recall thinking something similarly after the aughts concluded, but I have no interest in most new, modern vehicles. It’s kind of like a kid in school coasting at the end of the semester because he’s found out with every permutation on his grades, he’s gonna pass. A lot of companies aren’t putting their full developmental might behind ICE as a powertrain, so you’re getting half-assed engineering that ticks all the boxes and satisfies federal mandates.</p>
<p>We’re seeing modern engines grenade after 1/4 or 1/3 of their useful life with 10,000 mile oil changes, low weight oils burning up past lightweight oil rings, basic reliability issues with brakes, electronic controls, and an overall (IMO) decline in reliability. I’m sure someone with enough time could prove to me that I’m wrong, but there’ve been massive recalls on engines that can’t go the distance (H/K, Toyota, Subaru, some FCA/Stellantis stuff, Ford, Chevrolet, etc…). </p>
<p>This is my roundabout way of saying that I agree with you, and that I prefer simpler, more robust technology (again, all relative there). I’ll do my own work and keep my existing vehicle working, even if the pills are bitter and hard to swallow.		</p>

<p> I know it’s not the same but this is the closest example I have, I work as a personal trainer and the gym I work at charges $60-90 for an hour session. I make $36 for that. I can’t believe that I make more than a mechanic. Most people can do without a personal trainer (don’t tell some of my clients!), most people can’t do without a mechanic.		</p>

					<p>Being a mechanic has got to be the worst trade to be in—it easily pays the worst, the work is mostly the worst, there’s more tech that you need to keep updated on, way more money to spend buying your own tools, minimal advancement opportunities, and people treat you like you’re extorting them when you tell them they need new brakes they “just had replaced 5 years ago” and can show them the shadows of the cooling vanes in the human hair-thin rotor surface. If someone is smart enough to be a GOOD mechanic today, they’ve likely already figured that out and moved to a better trade or never pursued it. Electrician, HVAC, plumbing can almost work whenever they want and charge whatever they feel and they’re so in demand that customers will put up with horrendous waits, terrible workmanship, and/or tolerating far less than professional behavior while paying out the ass, but that’s the consequence of telling students for decades that only losers go into the trades.		</p>

					<p>I like to have a couple different snacks. Gummies make a great sweet snack, so long as you don’t leave them on your dash in the sun. (Even then, you end up with one large formless gummy when it cools down.) Beef jerky or pepperoni sticks are my favorite salty/savory. I don’t want anything likely to cause a mess, so nothing likely to drop a lot of crumbs or the like, and I am nervous about things like nuts, where I am likely to drop one or two if I grab a handful. If I want something like that, I like the small packs of Planters salted peanuts where I can open the top corner and pour them into my mouth.		</p>

					<p>I left a bag of alphabet letter gummies used for supermarket compliance bribery in the door pocket. That’s how I discovered the green ones must use a different release agent, because they happily detached from the solid lump as I gnawed my way through.		</p>

					<p>So, for road trips, my go-to snack is Combos. Preferably the cheese and cracker variety or cheeseburger, if it’s available. You do have to be careful not to eat too many, because you will get hard gut syndrome.		</p>

					<p>GM’s move with OnStar <em>is</em> straight-up deceptive marketing, it’s a classic Bait &amp; Switch gambit. I wonder what the FTC will have to say.		</p>

					<p>I also love beef jerky, however it has to be the stuff from Love’s truck stops.  Very lightly rebranded version of Robertson’s Hams beef jerky, out of Marietta Ok.</p>
<p>I love it.		</p>

					<p>“I just can’t seem to beat beef jerky as a relatively low-mess bite to eat.” </p>
<p>Make it grass-fed if you haven’t already!		</p>

					<p>My go-to snack is a bag of almonds. On 1,000+ mile drives, I’d usually buy a 1 lb bag of almonds. By the end of the drive, it would usually be finished off completely. Don’t have to stop at restaurants along the way.		</p>
