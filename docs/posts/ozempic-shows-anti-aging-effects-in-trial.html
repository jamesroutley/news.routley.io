    <h1>Ozempic shows anti-aging effects in trial</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="detailed-analysis"><div><p><span>The diabetes drug Ozempic has demonstrated remarkable anti-aging effects in the first clinical trial to directly measure its impact on biological aging, with participants becoming an average of 3.1 years biologically younger after 32 weeks of treatment. The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide may offer benefits far beyond their established roles in diabetes management and weight loss.</span></p>
<h2>First Direct Clinical Evidence of Anti-Aging Effects</h2>
<p><span>Varun Dwaraka from diagnostics company TruDiagnostic in Lexington, Kentucky, led a randomized controlled trial involving 108 people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, a condition characterized by excess fat accumulation and accelerated cellular aging. Half the participants received weekly Ozempic injections for 32 weeks, while the other half received a placebo.</span></p>
<p><span>The researchers used epigenetic clocks to assess biological aging - sophisticated tools that identify patterns of DNA methylation, chemical tags that affect gene activity and shift predictably with age. These patterns can be accelerated or slowed by lifestyle factors, meaning biological age can differ significantly from chronological age.</span></p>
<p><span>&#34;Those on semaglutide became, on average, 3.1 years biologically younger by the end of the study,&#34; Dwaraka reported. The placebo group showed no significant change in biological age over the same period.</span></p>
<h2>Organ-Specific Anti-Aging Benefits</h2>
<p><span>The anti-aging effects weren&#39;t uniform across all body systems. The research team found that semaglutide slowed biological aging in several organs and systems, with the most dramatic improvements occurring in the inflammatory system and brain, where the drug appeared to delay biological aging by almost 5 years. Significant benefits were also observed in the heart and kidneys.</span></p>
<p><span>&#34;Semaglutide may not only slow the rate of ageing, but in some individuals partially reverse it,&#34; Dwaraka noted, highlighting the potential for the drug to actually turn back the biological clock rather than simply slowing its progression.</span></p>
<h2>Mechanisms Behind the Anti-Aging Effects</h2>
<p><span>The researchers believe semaglutide&#39;s anti-aging properties stem from its effects on fat distribution and metabolic health. Excess fat around organs triggers the release of pro-aging molecules that alter DNA methylation in key aging-related genes. By reducing this harmful fat accumulation and preventing low-grade inflammation - both major drivers of epigenetic aging - semaglutide appears to create a more youthful biological environment.</span></p>
<p><span>Randy Seeley from the University of Michigan Medical School expressed little surprise at the findings, explaining that the drugs &#34;reduce the metabolic burden on a wide range of cells and lower inflammation. Both are major drivers of ageing in many different types of cells.&#34; However, he believes much of the benefit stems not from semaglutide&#39;s direct cellular effects, but from broader improvements to overall health.</span></p>
<h2>Broader Implications and Future Directions</h2>
<p><span>While the study focused specifically on people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, the biological pathways affected by semaglutide aren&#39;t unique to this condition. &#34;Therefore, it is plausible that similar effects on epigenetic ageing could be observed in other populations,&#34; Dwaraka explained, suggesting the anti-aging benefits could extend to the general population.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the promising results, Dwaraka cautioned against rushing to prescribe semaglutide broadly as an anti-aging therapy. &#34;Prescribing it more broadly as an anti-ageing therapy is premature,&#34; he stated. However, he noted that the study adds momentum to ongoing efforts to repurpose existing drugs for age-related problems, which could speed approval processes and reduce the risk of unexpected side effects.</span></p>
<p><span>The research represents a significant milestone in understanding the full therapeutic potential of GLP-1 drugs, which have already gained prominence for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, and are being explored for cardiovascular disease, addiction, and dementia. &#34;Semaglutide may well emerge as one of the most promising candidates in this space,&#34; Dwaraka concluded.</span></p></div></article></div>
