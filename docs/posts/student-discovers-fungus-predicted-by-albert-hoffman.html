        <p>Making a discovery with the
potential for innovative applications in pharmaceutical development, a <a href="http://wvu.edu/">West Virginia University</a> microbiology
student has found a long sought-after fungus that produces effects similar to the
semisynthetic drug LSD, which is used to treat conditions like depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder and addiction.</p>
<p><span>Corinne Hazel, of Delaware,
Ohio, an environmental microbiology major and </span><a href="https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2025/04/22/three-wvu-students-named-goldwater-scholars">Goldwater
Scholar</a><span>, discovered the new species of fungus growing in morning
glory plants and named it Periglandula clandestina. </span></p>
<p><span>Hazel made the discovery
while working in the lab with </span><a href="https://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/daniel-panaccione">Daniel
Panaccione</a><span>, Davis-Michael Professor
of </span><a href="https://www.wvu.edu/academics/programs/environmental-soil-and-water-sciences-bs">Plant
and Soil Sciences</a><span> at the </span><a href="http://davis.wvu.edu/">WVU Davis College of Agriculture and
Natural Resources</a><span>. She
was studying how morning glories disperse protective chemicals called “ergot
alkaloids” through their roots when she saw evidence of a fungus.</span></p>
<p><span>“We had a ton of plants
lying around and they had these tiny little seed coats,” she said. “We noticed a
little bit of fuzz in the seed coat. That was our fungus.”</span></p>
<p><span>The researchers prepared a DNA sample
and sent it away for genome sequencing, funded by a </span><a href="https://www.davis.wvu.edu/current-students/student-enhancement-grants">WVU Davis
College Student Enhancement Grant</a><span> obtained by Hazel. The sequencing confirmed
the discovery of a new species and the sequence is now deposited in a gene bank
with her name on it.</span></p>
<p><span>“Sequencing a genome is a significant
thing,” Panaccione said. “It’s amazing for a student.”</span></p>
<p><span>Morning glory plants live
in symbiosis with fungi that produce the same ergot alkaloids the Swiss chemist
Albert Hofmann modified when he invented LSD in the late 1930s.</span></p>
<p><span>Hofmann hypothesized that
a fungus in morning glories produced alkaloids similar to those in LSD, but the
species remained a mystery until Hazel and Panaccione’s discovery. They published their findings in </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00275514.2025.2483634">Mycologia</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“Morning glories contain
high concentrations of similar lysergic acid derivatives that give them their
psychedelic activities,” Panaccione said. “This inspired Hofmann and others to
investigate morning glories for the presence of a hidden fungus related to the
ergot fungus that might be the source of these chemicals. They found very
similar chemicals, but they could never find the fungus itself.”</span></p>
<p><span>Ergot alkaloids are made
exclusively by fungi. In addition to morning glories, they’re often found
growing on grains like rye. They can be poisonous to humans and livestock and, when
used therapeutically, can have unwanted side effects. Still, some clinicians use
them to treat conditions like migraines, dementia, uterine hemorrhaging and
Parkinson’s disease.</span></p>
<p><span>Periglandula clandestina is highly
efficient at making ergot alkaloids in large quantities, a characteristic that may
play a role in future pharmaceuticals. The discovery of the fungus o</span><span>pens a host of potential research
avenues, Panaccione said.</span></p>
<p><span>“Many things are toxic. But if you
administer them in the right dosage or modify them, they can be useful
pharmaceuticals. By studying them, we may be able to figure out ways to bypass
the side effects. These are big issues for medicine and agriculture.”</span></p>
<p><span>The researchers dubbed the fungus “Periglandula
clandestina” for its ability to have eluded investigators for decades.</span></p>
<p><span>“I think that’s the perfect name,”
Panaccione said. “And I love that we did this project together. Corinne has a
ton of talent. It’s about students recognizing the opportunities, seizing them
and having the skill and the brain power to bring this work to fruition.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hazel is now studying the most
effective ways to culture the slow-growing fungus and is interested in whether other
morning glory species may also contain ergot alkaloids from a fungal symbiote
that has yet to be described.</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m lucky to have stumbled into this
opportunity,” she said. “People have been looking for this fungus for years,
and one day, I look in the right place, and there it is. I’m very proud of the
work that I’ve done at WVU.”</span></p>
