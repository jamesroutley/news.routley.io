<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Take your science skills into the kitchen. Turn ordinary chocolate into an edible optics demo that shows how diffraction works.</p>



<p><strong>Supplies:</strong> Stove, double boiler, heat proof spatula, candy thermometer, diffraction sheets, silicon molds (optional), chocolate bars or melting chocolate</p>



<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Diffraction is the bending of light. We do not need to look through a diffraction sheet to see the bending. Light can bounce off of fine grooved surfaces to show us how each wavelength of light refracts off of the surface.</p>



<hr/>



<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>If using molds, cut the diffraction sheets into pieces the size of the bottom of the molds. Place the diffraction pieces, diffraction side up, in the bottom of the mold</li>



<li>Divide your chocolate into thirds, 2/3 are for melting, 1/3 is for the tempering</li>



<li>Different chocolates have different tempering temperature, these temperatures are critical for proper tempering</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTi0tM4yQ8">video</a> (starting at minute 20 for chocolate) on how to temper chocolate and create the diffraction pieces</li>



<li>If using molds, chocolate can be poured into molds quite easily</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>How to run the demo:</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>Pass out the chocolate and explain what they see.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTi0tM4yQ8">video</a> (starting at minute 7:40) to make diffractive candy</p>

<p><strong>What’s Happening?</strong></p>



<p>White light can be separated into all seven major colors of the complete spectrum or rainbow by using a diffraction grating. The grating separates light into colors as the light passes through the many fine slits of the grating. Each color travels at a different speed and therefore has a different angle of refraction when it hits the grating. Chocolate makes a reflection gratings. Along with chocolate, a compact disc also makes a good reflection grating. When light passes through a grating it is called a transmission grating. A transmission grating is what is used to make the diffractive chocolate. Diffractive candy is a transmission grating.</p>
