    <h1>OpenAI is building a social network?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>OpenAI is working on its own X-like social network, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p><p>While the project is still in early stages, we’re told there’s an internal prototype focused on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/636529/images-chatgpt-openai-studio-ghibli-copyright">ChatGPT’s image generation</a> that has a social feed. CEO Sam Altman has been privately asking outsiders for feedback about the project, our sources say. It’s unclear if OpenAI’s plan is to release the social network as a separate app or integrate it into ChatGPT, which became the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/chatgpt-became-the-most-downloaded-app-globally-in-march/">most downloaded app</a> globally last month. An OpenAI spokesperson didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>Launching a social network in or around ChatGPT would likely increase Altman’s already-bitter rivalry with Elon Musk. In February, after Musk made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609685/elon-musk-openai-purchase-offer">an unsolicited offer to purchase</a> OpenAI for $97.4 billion, Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889059531625464090?lang=en">responded</a>: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”</p><p>Entering the social media market also puts OpenAI on more of a collision course with Meta, which we’re told is planning to add a social feed to its coming standalone app for its AI assistant. When reports of Meta building a rival to the ChatGPT app first surfaced a couple of months ago, Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1895230925753233763">shot back on X</a> again by saying, “ok fine maybe we’ll do a social app.”</p><p>A social app would also give OpenAI its own unique, real-time data that X and Meta already have to help train their AI models. Musk’s Grok surfaces content from X in its results (Musk recently went so far as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638933/elon-musk-x-xai-acquisition">to merge X and xAI</a> into the same company), while Meta trains Llama on its vast trove of user data.</p><p>One idea behind the OpenAI social prototype is to have AI help people share better content. “The Grok integration with X has made everyone jealous,” says someone working at another big AI lab. “Especially how people create viral tweets by getting it to say something stupid.”</p><p>OpenAI has a lot going on, of course, and it’s unclear if its early-stage social media project will ever see the light of day. But its existence inside OpenAI shows how the company is thinking about expansion at a time when expectations for its future growth are sky high.</p><div><div><p>I’d love to chat.
