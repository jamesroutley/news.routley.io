Unfortunately, most scientific research is false. It may have a mild therapeutic effect in some contexts, but the research on this is shaky. It is likely safe to inject in small quantities, but is almost certainly a waste of money for anyone looking to improve their cognitive function. </p></li></ul><ol><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/introduction" rel="">Introduction</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/the-long-history-of-cerebrolysin" rel="">The long history of Cerebrolysin</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/cerebrolysincom-is-full-of-scientific-errors" rel="">Cerebrolysin.com is full of scientific errors</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/the-evidence-base-for-cerebrolysin-contains-conflicts-of-interest-and-a-statistically-improbable-rate-of-success" rel="">The evidence base for Cerebrolysin contains conflicts of interest and a statistically improbable rate of success</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/so-wth-is-cerebrolysin" rel="">So WTH is Cerebrolysin?</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/we-only-found-one-study-giving-evidence-of-neurotrophic-factors-in-cerebrolysin-and-its-kinda-sus" rel="">We only found one study giving evidence of neurotrophic factors in Cerebrolysin, and it’s kinda sus</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/hplc-mass-spectroscopy-of-cerebrolysin-fails-to-show-any-neurotrophic-peptides" rel="">HPLC-mass spectroscopy of Cerebrolysin fails to show any neurotrophic peptides</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/storage-instructions-are-incongruent-with-peptides-and-there-is-no-immune-response" rel="">Storage instructions are incongruent with peptides and there is no immune response</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/the-putative-active-ingredients-are-unlikely-to-cross-the-blood-brain-barrier" rel="">The putative active ingredients are unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://moreisdifferent.blog/i/147288757/concluding-metascience-thoughts" rel="">Concluding metascience thoughts</a></strong></p></li></ol><p>One of us (Dan) was recently exposed to Cerebrolysin at the Manifest conference in Berkeley, where a speaker spoke very highly about it and even passed around ampoules of it for the audience to inspect. </p><p><span>Dan then searched for Cerebrolysin on X and found </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson/status/1793693564964323489" rel="">a video</a><span> by Bryan Johnson from May 23 that shows him injecting Cerebrolysin.

After Greg researched it, he felt a professional responsibility to write up his findings. He sent his writeup to Dan, who then extensively edited and expanded it.   </span></p><p>Our critique covers three major topics: (1) sketchy marketing practices, (2) shoddy evidence base, and (3) implausible biological claims. But first, it’s interesting to understand the history of this strange substance. </p><p>To our knowledge, the “secret history” of Cerebrolysin has not been illuminated anywhere to date. </p><p><span>Cerebrolysin was invented by the Austrian psychiatrist and neurologist Gerhart Harrer (1917 - 2011), who started using it in his practice around 1951. Between 1954 and 1990 </span><a href="https://www.gerhart-harrer.at/forscher/crebrolystin/" rel="">he published</a><span> at least ten articles on it. In a </span><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1115595" rel="">1954 article</a><span>, he describes Cerebrolysin as an “amino acid mixture containing all biologically important amino acids, including glutamic acid.” He describes how the aqueous injection used in his studies contains about 1 g worth of amino acids that are created by lysing pig brain tissue. </span><a href="https://www.gerhart-harrer.at/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/48_1959_Aminosaeuren.pdf" rel="">In a 1959 paper</a><span>, Harrer describes a paper chromatographic analysis he conducted, which showed the presence of 18 amino acids. He says that when dried, the substance is 57% amino acids by weight, with the rest being phosphates and inorganic salts. </span></p><p><span>It seems Harrer believed that pure amino acids have considerable therapeutic potential when given intravenously, but that the relative proportions of those amino acids should be tuned to treat different tissues. Thus, to heal brain tissue he decided to derive amino acids from pig brain tissue. Pigs were a fortuitous choice due to the fact that they are </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510857/#:~:text=Pigs%20were%20considered%20prion%20resistant,feedstuffs%20containing%20animal%20derived%20protein." rel="">especially resistant</a><span> to prion disease. </span></p><p>Today we know this reasoning is flawed. Your cells precisely regulate the uptake of amino acids by regulating amino acid transporters. So as long as sufficient quantities of each amino acid are ingested, cells are smart enough to take in the quantities they need.  </p><p><span>This picture of Cerebrolysin as an amino acid mixture is consistent with marketing materials from that time.

First, glucose oxidase is an intracellular protein that would never be in the bloodstream under normal circumstances. It is misleading to show Cerebrolysin as larger than glucose oxidase, since the putative peptides in Cerebrolysin are described as being around 10 kDa while glucose oxidase is 180 kDa. Closer inspection shows this is a 3D graphic where the Cerebrolysin molecule is meant to be closer to the viewer. As such, the relative size of each molecule is impossible to judge. This sort of 3D graphic is deliberately avoided in scientific papers. </p><p>Of course, many FDA-approved drugs also have deceptive marketing. There are examples of drug companies persuading doctors to prescribe off-label, drug commercials that exaggerate expected benefits, and drug companies manipulating the FDA approval process. Similarly, the FDA is sometimes too hesitant to authorize the sale of experimental drugs out of a misplaced concern about patients being exploited. Despite all these problems with our medical system in the US, the level of deception used by Ever Pharma in marketing Cerebrolysin is worse than anything we’ve seen for an FDA-approved drug.</p><p><span>The Cerebrolysin website should be contrasted with the website of any FDA-approved drug. As an example, let&#39;s look at the website for the recently approved Alzheimer&#39;s drug, </span><a href="https://www.aduhelm.com/" rel="">Aduhelm</a><span> (aducanumab). The process of navigating pertinent information is pretty straightforward. With three clicks one can navigate to the clinical trial results that led to the drug&#39;s approval. One can find preclinical results about BBB permeability, detailed rationales for the doses chosen for the final product, and a complete description of the aducanumab molecule and the other constituents of the drug. With a little extra searching, you can even find some details about the quality assurance that goes into ensuring that every batch of drug is uniform.</span></p><p><span>Medicine websites are always partly marketing, but we feel Cerebrolysin.com is </span><em>pure</em><span> marketing.

Nine of the top ten articles on the first page of results have authors who are affiliated with Ever Pharma (or its former name, EBEWE Pharma), and therefore have a financial stake in Cerebrolysin being shown to be effective.</span><span> </span></p><p>In one of these articles, we are provided with the following comment:</p><blockquote><p>Co-authors HM and ED are employees of EBEWE Pharma. Both have no ownership in the company, and their compensation is not linked to the outcome of research projects. (Alvarez et al, 2011)</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t very reassuring — working for the company that manufactures Cerebrolysin certainly seems to give them a stake in the outcome of any research project they might be involved in. </p><p>I (Greg) went through the next several pages of Google Scholar results in an attempt to find a single publication that tested Cerebrolysin that found a null result. There were none. This degree of uniform success is statistically implausible, especially given the comparatively small sample sizes used in all of those studies. If you look up clinical trials of Alzheimer&#39;s disease drugs like donepezil and galantamine, you will find some trials that failed to observe any benefit. Given random sampling and small effect sizes, the absence of any trials with null results is very suspicious.</p><p><span>Another concerning feature of the evidence base for Cerebrolysin is the absence of pre-registration. For those unfamiliar, when you do a federally-funded clinical trial in the US you are required to preregister on clinicaltrials.gov. You need to specify your methods, your method of recruiting patients, and other relevant information. The EU has a </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/" rel="">similar system</a><span> for pre-registering clinical trials. </span></p><p>Despite hundreds of papers on Cerebrolysin, a search for Cerebrolysin on the EU Clinical Trials Register returns only five results. </p><p><span>In most published clinical trials on Cerebrolysin, basic questions like &#34;what country were these trials conducted in?&#34; are not addressed. It </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9248-2" rel="">appears</a><span> that a large number were done at Russian State Medical University. In the Russian </span><a href="https://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/CIPermitionReg.aspx" rel="">clinical trial database</a><span> there are only two reported trials for Cerebrolysin — in 2013 (completed) and 2015 (suspended).</span></p><p><span>Another disturbing pattern we noticed is that most of the review articles about Cerebrolysin have the same set of authors, with their accompanying conflicts of interest. One of the most-cited reviews, </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11203320-000000000-00000" rel="">Plosker &amp; Gauthier (2009)</a><span> fails to disclose an important relationship between one of their authors and Ever Pharma. An article from </span><a href="https://karger.com/dem/article/39/5-6/332/98339/Cerebrolysin-in-Mild-to-Moderate-Alzheimer-s" rel="">the same year</a><span> makes clear that “Gauthier is a member of the EVER scientific advisory board.” </span></p><p><span>We could find only a few articles written on Cerebrolysin that are completely independent from Ever Phara. Three of those are Cochrane reviews, from </span><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD008900/DEMENTIA_cerebrolysin-vascular-dementia" rel="">2019</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007026.pub6/full" rel="">2020</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007026.pub7" rel="">2023</a><span>. Those reviews found there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Cerebrolysin is effective in treating either ischemic stroke or vascular dementia. Somewhat disturbingly, the 2020 review notes a higher rate of severe side effects among the patients given Cerebrolysin across several trials, although there was no difference when it came to mortality or mild side effects. </span></p><p>Greg had a lot of questions when looking at Ever Pharma’s materials. What species of pig are used? How old are those pigs? How are the pigs sourced? How are they killed? What parts of the brain do they grind up? What are the active ingredients in Cerebrolysin? What assays have been done to measure the concentration and bioactivity of the active ingredients? Is there batch-to-batch variation?  How were the recommended doses chosen for Cerebrolysin? Why is it recommended that Cerebrolysin is cycled for some diseases but not others? What ingredients penetrate the blood-brain barrier? </p><p>Across several sources, Cerebrolysin is said to be &#34;standardized&#34;. However we could not find any description of this “standardized” procedure. </p><p>Here’s what we could find: </p><p><a href="https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=2241257" rel="">One source</a><span> says that Cerebrolysin contains &#34;young pig brain&#34;. We could find no information on how the pig brain matter is obtained. The most economical option would be pigs slaughtered for meat. However, proteins begin deteriorating immediately upon death, so the freshness of the samples is an important issue. </span></p><p>The pig brain matter is ground up and hydrolyzed with enzymes. In biochemistry, hydrolysis is a type of reaction that cleaves organic molecules into smaller components. For instance, a protein is hydrolyzed into multiple, smaller polypeptide fragments. If you allow the hydrolysis to run long enough, those polypeptides will be hydrolyzed into individual amino acids. </p><p><span>The enzymes used are likely peptidases, because </span><a href="about:blank" rel="">Cerebrolysin&#39;s label</a><span> mentions sodium hydroxide among its inactive ingredients. The only reason sodium hydroxide would be in the drug is as a means of halting enzymatic degradation. Peptidases only function in acidic environments, so adding a strong base like sodium hydroxide is a common way to halt the degradation procedure.</span></p><p>After being hydrolyzed the resulting “lysate” is centrifuged to remove all insoluble components.</p><p>According to the marketing materials, Cerbrolysin contains “neurotrophic factors”. However, as we discussed earlier, between 1950 - ~1990 Cerebrolysin was described as a mixture of amino acids with some residual peptide fragments. It’s been described a bit differently over the years: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/135987" rel="">Trojanova et al. (1976)</a><span> describe Cerebrolysin as amino acids, “aligopeptides” [sic] and nucleotides.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2123433/" rel="">Kofler et al. (1990)</a><span> describe Cerebrolysin as a “hydrolysate containing free amino acids (about 85%) as well as low-molecular protein-free amino acid sequences (about 15%).&#34;</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11867795_Antiapoptotic_effects_of_the_peptidergic_drug_Cerebrolysin_on_primary_cultures_of_embryonic_chick_cortical_neurons" rel="">Hartbauer et al. (2001)</a><span> describe Cerebrolysin as “approximately 25% low molecular weight peptides (10 kDA) and a mixture of approximately 75% free amino acids, based on the total nitrogen content.”</span><span> </span></p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these descriptions indicate that the Cerebrolysin is ~75% amino acids, with the other ~25% being short polypeptide sequences that are the remnants of once-intact proteins that have been enzymatically degraded. Kofler et al. (1990) and Hartbauer et al. (2001) don’t provide any explanation for their ratios but their similarity and specificity are noteworthy. We suspect that these ratios were provided by Ever Pharma.</p><p>Based on our research, there seems to have been a transition in Cerebrolysin’s marketing from “amino acids” to “neurotrophic peptides” that occured in the 1980s.  Yet, we could find nothing to suggest that the company updated their tissue preparation procedures in that time period. </p><p><span>While an enzymatic degradation procedure is compatible with the goal of producing amino acids or small peptide fragments, it is incompatible with the goal of producing neurotrophic proteins. This is because any peptide fragments would not retain their neurotrophic properties.</span></p><p>Now, there are well-established techniques for measuring the concentration of neurotrophic factors in biological samples. There are even services that will perform the assays for you if you send them your samples. The fact there is no succinct summary of all the neurotrophic factors in Cerebrolysin and their concentrations is mind-bending.</p><p>It’s also worth taking a step back to ask if it’s reasonable to begin with that a lysate of pig brain tissue would contain an appreciable amount of neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic proteins account for a miniscule proportion of total brain proteins, and Cerebrolysin is further diluted in water. Nowhere is any enrichment step described, and no such enrichment techniques existed when Cerebrolysin was invented in the mid 1950s. </p><p>All of our skepticism about the constituents of Cerebrolysin could all be immediately resolved if the manufacturers just performed an ELISA assay on their product, and posted the result. </p><p><span>Let’s drill down on Hartbauer et al.’s claim that Cerebrolysin contains 25% “~10 kDa” peptides, because it widely cited, and is </span><a href="https://cerebrolysin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CEREBROLYSIN_ProductMonograph_2021_SCREEN.pdf" rel="">cited in</a><span> Ever Pharma’s marketing materials. Here are the sizes of several neurotrophic factors: NGF, 26.5 kDa; BDNF: 27.8 KDa; PDGF: 32 kDa. This would imply that whatever neurotrophic factors existed in the pig brain tissue have been reduced to fragments about half the size. In general, proteins do not retain their signaling potential after so much of their structure has been removed, although some have suggested this is the case with Cerebrolysin.</span></p><p><span>Now, we contend that there is no lysing method that would produce a solution of 75% amino acids and 25% ~10 kDa peptide fragments. Haurtbauer et al. likely meant to say “25% </span><strong>&lt;</strong><span> 10 kDa peptides” not “25%</span><strong> ~ </strong><span>10kDa peptides”.

The figure shows the outcome of an ELISA immunoreactivity assay for seven neurotrophic factors. We wonder why the authors did not include the two best-known neurotrophic factors, BDNF and NGF.  </p><p>The y-axis (OD 405) refers to the optical density at 405 nm, and it is a proxy for concentration. The x-axis shows different dilutions of Cerebrolysin (CL), from 0.1 to 1040 nmol/µL, where the authors say that “1040 corresponds to the undiluted drug.”</p><p>At the end of the day, all this assay shows is that something in Cerebrolysin has immunoreactivity with the antibodies in the assay.

Since Cerebrolysin is a mixture of many peptides, using molarity as a measurement is meaningless, unless you know the precise breakdown of the constituents.

In the figure caption, the authors write: &#34;[Cerebrolysin] was diluted from 1040 (undiluted) to 0.1 nmol peptides/50 µL.&#34; Neither of us can figure out where out where the number 1040 comes from. </p><p><span>We are giving </span><a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.1817" rel="">Gevaert et al.
