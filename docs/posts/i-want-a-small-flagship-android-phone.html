    <p>My name is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi">Eric Migicovsky</a> and I love small phones. It‚Äôs weird because I am 6‚Äô6‚Äù but I never enjoyed using a large phone. I loved the Sony Xperia Compact series. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/16/9549247/sony-xperia-z5-review-compact-android">RIP</a>...</p>
    <h3>I love small phones because they</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>fits nicely in pocket</li>
    <li>are much lighter</li>
    <li>are easy to use one-handed without dropping</li>
    <li>won&#39;t fall out of my pocket while bicycling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And of course, some people with smaller hands hate how big phones feel!</p>
    <p>The drawbacks of a small phone (smaller screen, smaller battery) are fundamentally less of an issue than the size, for me at least. These trade-offs are certainly not for everyone, so if you are a die-hard big phone person you might as well stop reading üòÇ</p>
    <h3>Why write this?</h3>
    <p>It&#39;s increasingly clear that a small premium phone is not on any OEM roadmap. So I‚Äôve decided to take matters into my own hands. My goal here is to rally other fans of small phones together and put pressure on Google/Samsung/anyone to consider making a small phone.</p>
    <p>If you want a small premium Android phone, this may be your last chance (ever?) to help bring back the phone category that we love.</p>

    <p>Optimizes for only 3 things:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sub 6&#34; display, matching size and design of iPhone 13 Mini</li>
    <li>Great cameras</li>
    <li>Stock Android OS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you can hit these three bullets, you&#39;ve built the perfect phone. Currently there are ZERO premium Android phones with &lt;6‚Äù displays. No amount of money can buy one right now.</p>
    <p>Focus on these three bullets, all other specs are flexible.</p>
    <p><strong>Price: $700-800</strong> (again, we have no alternatives so we should be willing to pay a bit more!)</p>
    <h2>Ideal specifications</h2>
    <p><em>Must have</em></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Follow Mini industrial design as close as possible<ul>
    <li>Consistent width bezels around the entire display</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>5.4‚Äù-ish 1080p OLED display (60hz ok)</li>
    <li>Cameras must be as good as Pixel 5<ul>
    <li>must have great low light performance</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Stock Android OS</li>
    <li>Snapdragon 8 (or other flagship processor equivalent)</li>
    <li>5G world phone</li>
    <li>Hole punch front camera</li>
    <li>2 rear cameras (regular and wide angle)</li>
    <li>8gb RAM</li>
    <li>128/256gb Storage</li>
    <li>4 hours Screen On Time (SOT)</li>
    <li>Unlockable bootloader</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Nice to have</em></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Rugged enough to not need a case</li>
    <li>IP 68 water resistance</li>
    <li>Fingerprint sensor on power button</li>
    <li>Hardware mute switch</li>
    <li>Wireless charging</li>
    <li>eSIM</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>This phone will never exist unless you (yes, I‚Äôm talking about you reading this page!) actually do something about it!</strong></p>
    <p>Since Sony discontinued the Xperia Compact line, NO OTHER Android phone maker has had the courage to make a small premium Android phone. It‚Äôs up to us to change that!</p>
    <p>My goal is to attract a lot interest to this page, sign up tons of interested buyers and convince a manufacturer to build us our dream phone. I have some experience building hardware myself (see: Pebble) and how these things work. We will need more than 50,000+ motivated buyers to make this happen, so please share this with your friends!</p>
    <p>If no one else makes one I guess I will be forced to make it myself, but I really really don‚Äôt want it to come to that! Send me a DM on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/ericmigi">Twitter</a> if you want to help with this quest.</p>
    <h2>The phone category we love is disappearing. Let&#39;s bring it back!</h2>
