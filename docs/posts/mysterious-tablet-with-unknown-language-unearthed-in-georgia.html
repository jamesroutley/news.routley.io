    <h1>Mysterious tablet with unknown language unearthed in Georgia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A basalt tablet inscribed with an enigmatic language has been unearthed near Lake Bashplemi in Georgia’s Dmanisi region. Measuring 24.1 x 20.1 cm and made from local vesicular basalt, the <a title="&lt;h3 class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-term-title&#34;&gt;Artifact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-content&#34;&gt;An artifact or artefact (British English) refers to any portable object or material that has been created, modified, or used by humans. It is the basic &#34;unit&#34; of archaeological analysis. Artifacts can vary widely in terms of size, material, and purpose. They can include tools, pottery, jewelry, weapons, clothing, and more. These diverse forms may at times be mistaken for ecofacts and features, with all three often coexisting within archaeological sites. Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the technological advancements,&lt;p class=&#34;wpg-read-more&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/&#34;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" href="https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/" target="_blank">artifact</a> features 60 characters, 39 of which are unique. These symbols, arranged in seven registers, have left researchers debating their meaning and purpose.</p><figure id="attachment_44104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44104"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijk2MSIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgOTYxIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1.jpg" alt="Mysterious tablet with unknown language unearthed in Georgia" width="1280" height="961" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-768x577.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-1-1140x856.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44104">Tablet with inscription in an unknown language, discovered in Georgia.

Archaeologists have speculated that the writing may have recorded military spoils, construction projects, or offerings to deities, though definitive interpretations remain elusive. “Generally, the Bashplemi inscription does not repeat any script known to us; however, most of the symbols used therein resemble ones found in the scripts of the Middle East, as well as those of geographically remote countries such as India, Egypt, and West Iberia,” noted researchers in the Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology.</p><p>Partial resemblances have been observed with the Proto-Kartvelian script from the 4th millennium BCE and seals from pre-Christian Georgia. Additionally, some symbols echo elements of early Caucasian scripts, such as Georgian Mrgvlovani and Albanian alphabets, as well as systems from the Near East, including Phoenician and Proto-Sinaitic. However, the Bashplemi inscription is not a direct replica of any known writing system, suggesting it may represent a unique or locally developed script.</p><p>The Dmanisi region, renowned for its wealth of archaeological finds, including some of the earliest Eurasian hominin remains, now adds this extraordinary artifact to its legacy. Though the exact age of the tablet is uncertain, researchers suggest it dates to the Late Bronze or Early Iron Ages, based on associated finds like pottery fragments and stone mortar.</p><figure id="attachment_44105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44105"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijk2MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgOTYwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2.jpg" alt="Mysterious tablet with unknown language unearthed in Georgia" width="1280" height="960" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/tablet-with-unknown-language-georgia-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44105">Graphic representation of Bashplemi inscription characters and their numbering.
