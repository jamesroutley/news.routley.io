    <h1>The end of Type 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="430801ff-4f1a-43a8-ae36-6f9e6de85587"><p data-block-key="bqjpj"><span>B</span>y the mid-’90s, software developers and users needed things Type 1 and TrueType didn’t have: Support for large character sets and the emerging Unicode character encoding standard (especially for complex languages like Japanese), cross-platform compatibility, and advanced layout features. For example, some early desktop typefaces were spread among multiple Type 1 fonts which held small caps, fractions, and other typographic niceties. They had to be stored in separate fonts because Type 1 was limited to 256 glyphs. OpenType was created to deliver much more typographic capability in a single, cross-platform file.</p><p data-block-key="10lsa">Ironically, even when a foundry attempted nothing more than to convert their Type 1 fonts to OpenType, minor differences were sometimes introduced not because functionality was lost, but because it was added. Combining a set of Type 1 fonts into a single OpenType font creates opportunities for new kerning between more letters, for example. Ligatures might appear automatically where they previously required manual intervention. Larger character sets might have more consistent spacing among accented glyphs. In other words, OpenType allows more typographic refinement by default, and introducing that into an older document might change it—for better or worse.</p></div><div id="238562c3-625b-4d18-9039-6d2189d2a944"><p data-block-key="bqjpj"><span>I</span>n theory, an OpenType font can be created from a Type 1 font by anyone with the right software, but there are many opportunities for such conversions to go wrong in minor or significant ways. (It might also violate your original software license agreement, so don’t attempt it unless you’ve checked that it’s allowed.) In the 2000s, most major foundries put a lot of effort into converting their font libraries and minimizing potential differences and incompatibilities, so it’s best to look for those “official replacements” first.</p><p data-block-key="d102s">But even in the best cases, you’ll also want to watch for potential problems when you make the switch. An old document might have used a basic font along with expert fonts containing special characters like ligatures and swashes. References to those separate fonts in an old document might get lost in a switch to an OpenType version that combines them.</p><p data-block-key="4a46c">Spacing changes can be trickier. If the width of one or more glyphs has changed—even by a very small amount—it can cause a line break to change, which can have a ripple effect through an entire document or layout. Changes to kerning (custom spacing between two glyphs) can have the same effect. You’ll want to look very carefully for these changes, because they can be hard to spot—especially if text overflows in a frame and simply disappears.</p><p data-block-key="7smlr">Lastly, there might be design changes. Some glyphs might have been redrawn when the newer OpenType version was created. For example, some Adobe Originals designs were expanded to encompass more styles, like optical sizes (caption and display sizes), and in a few rare cases, certain glyphs were redesigned completely.</p><p data-block-key="9rm1v">If you’ve ever opened a document with missing fonts, then you probably know what to expect when making replacements. You will be looking at a substitute, either deliberately chosen by you or automatically by your software. In the latter cases, those differences can be quite disruptive. When you substitute an old Type 1 font with the same typeface in OpenType format, presumably you have less risk of typographic chaos.</p><p data-block-key="3j1ep">Keep in mind that older PDFs created with Type 1 fonts are safe—as long as their font data was embedded in the PDF when it was made. PDF readers, whether from Adobe or elsewhere, will continue to render these documents as they always have. Now is a great time to save PDF versions of important documents, before you upgrade to any new Adobe applications that no longer support Type 1 fonts.</p></div></div>
