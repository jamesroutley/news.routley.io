    <h1>Motors for Makers: A Guide to Steppers, Servos, and Other Electrical Machines (2015)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<h2><p>
Makers can do amazing things with motors. Yes, they&#39;re more complicated than some other circuit elements, but with this book, you can completely master them. Once you do, incredible new projects become possible!
</p>

<p>
Unlike other books, Motors for Makers is 100% focused on what you can do. Not theory. <i>Making</i>.
</p>

<p>
First, Matthew Scarpino explains how electric motors work and what you need to know about each major type: stepper, servo, induction, and linear motors. Next, he presents detailed instructions and working code for interfacing with and controlling servomotors with Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black.
</p>

<p>
From start to finish, you&#39;ll learn through practical examples, crystal-clear explanations, and photos. If you&#39;ve ever salivated at what you could do with electric motors, stop salivating…and start making!
</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand why electric motors are so versatile and how they work</li>
<li>Choose the right motor for any project</li>
<li>Build the circuits needed to control each type of motor</li>
<li>Program motor control with Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, or BeagleBone Black</li>
<li>Use gearmotors to get the right amount of torque</li>
<li>Use linear motors to improve speed and precision</li>
<li>Design a fully functional electronic speed control (ESC) circuit</li>
<li>Design your own quadcopter</li>
<li>Discover how electric motors work in modern electric vehicles—with a fascinating inside look at Tesla&#39;s patents for motor design and control!</li>
</ul>
