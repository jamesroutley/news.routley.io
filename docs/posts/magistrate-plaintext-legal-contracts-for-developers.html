                    Yes, if you are in the United States. The Electronic
                    Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN)
                    together with the broad adoption of the Uniform Electronic
                    Transaction Act (UETA) by 47 states ensures the validity of
                    electronic signatures.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    If you are outside the United States, this product is not for
                    you (yet).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not be able to use electronic signatures for things
                    like wills, adoption paperwork, powers of attorney, and other
                    instruments that are specifically required to be wet signed or
                    notarized. Check with your lawyer.

              </div>
            
              <div x-data="{questionOpen: false}">
                
                <div x-show="questionOpen">
                <p>
                    You <code>POST</code> the body of the contract to an API
                    endpoint along with the names and emails of the parties to the
                    contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parties get an email with a unique link that they click to
                    view the contract. From there, they can sign the contract
                    electronically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the contract has been signed by all the parties, they all
                    are emailed a fully executed copy of the contract. If the
                    person who sent the contract initially is not a party to the
                    contract (e.g., a lawyer coordinating the execution), they
                    receive a copy as well.
                </p></div>
              </div>
            
              <div x-data="{questionOpen: false}">
                
                <div x-show="questionOpen">
                <p>
                    Magistrate generates signature blocks based on the parties
                    passed in API call and appends them to the body of the
                    contract. This means you should not include any signature
                    blocks in the body of the contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature blocks are formatted in the style recommended by
                    the <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/">
                    Manual of Style for Contract Drafting 4th Edition</a>. 
                    The signer clicks their signature block to sign the
                    contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&#39;ve always thought that the fake cursive signatures that most
                    electronic signature platforms make you use when e-signing a
                    contract are silly. Magistrate instead uses something called a
                    &#34;conformed signature.&#34; 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a person signs the contract, the
                    signature block will display something like
                    <code>/s/ Jane Smith</code>. This means the contract has been
                    signed by that person, and this conformed signature is the
                    valid representation of a person&#39;s signature.
                </p></div>
              </div>
            
              <div x-data="{questionOpen: false}">
                
                <p>
                    Yes. The API accepts entities like corporations as parties and
                    will generate the appropriate signature blocks. See
                    <a href="https://magistrate.khanna.law/docs/#post-contracts">
                    the docs</a> for more detail.

                    No. This is a software product and is not legal services.
                    Nothing on this website is legal advice. Consult with your own
                    attorney if you have questions about the law or your particular
                    circumstances.
                </p>
              </div>
            
              <div x-data="{questionOpen: false}">

                    If contracts were written in plain text files
                    and managed more like software, from version control to IDEs,
                    lawyers would work more quickly and intelligently for their
                    clients, saving them money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the entire practice of transactional law is stuck on
                    Microsoft Word. My clients are mostly technology companies
                    with an appetite for innovation. With their encouragement, I
                    am moving my own legal practice away from formats like
                    Microsoft Word and into plain text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electronic signatures of plain text contracts is the starting
                    point for that effort. The MVP is this developer API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the reception to this product is positive, I&#39;ll continue to
                    release the products that I build. In time, my hope is that
                    plain text will supplant Microsoft Word in the drafting,
                    negotiation and execution of contracts.
