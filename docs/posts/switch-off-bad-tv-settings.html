    <h1>Switch off bad TV settings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><nav></nav><p>Smart TVs have an abundance of weird settings designed to make Seinfeld look like it was directed by James Cameron.</p><p>At first this seems great. Why shouldn&#39;t 90s sitcoms seem like they were filmed in 4k at 60 frames per second? Then you start noticing things…</p><ul><li><p>Was Kramer&#39;s hair always surrounded by rectangles?</p></li><li><p>Were George&#39;s frenetic movements always trailed by a cartoonish blur?</p></li><li><p>Wouldn&#39;t I have remembered Elaine being a 9ft tall blue humanoid alien with a tail?</p></li></ul><p>Settings like <strong>motion interpolation</strong>, <strong>noise reduction</strong>, and <strong>dynamic contrast</strong> undo the work of the film makers, introduce unwanted artefacts to the image, and make new movies look like soap operas.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">1</a></sup></p><p>Watch movies as the makers intended, and save a small amount of electricity,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">2</a></sup> by <strong>switching off weird smart tv settings.</strong></p><h3>How to switch off weird smart tv settings</h3><p>The names of these settings differ between manufacturers, and so it&#39;s difficult to give a comprehensive guide — so below is an explanation of each feature with it&#39;s equivalent name for different brands. You&#39;ll need to navigate to your TVs settings and switch them off.</p><p>If you&#39;re lucky, your TV has <code>filmmaker mode</code>, a setting which will adjust your tv to align with the intentions of the filmmakers without you having to learn any terminology — brought to you by Tom Cruise complaining.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">3</a></sup></p><p>I won&#39;t list every setting for every TV here — there are too many — but most new smart TVs have these three settings, which you should switch off:</p><h3>Motion interpolation</h3><p>Motion interpolation<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">4</a></sup> or motion smoothing increases the frames per second from <code>24fps</code> to <code>60fps</code> by creating and inserting new frames not present in the original film.</p><p>Motion interpolation is also known as <code>motion smoothing</code>, <code>TruMotion</code>, <code>Motionflow</code>,<code>MotionSmoother</code>, <code>Clear Action</code>, <code>Intelligent Frame Creation</code>, <code>Action Smoothing</code>, <code>Auto Motion Plus</code> and variations on a theme.</p><h3>Dynamic contrast and brightness</h3><p>There are lots of settings that dynamically adjust the contrast and brightness of scenes.</p><p>Dynamic contrast<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-reference-5">5</a></sup> is designed to increase the contrast of dark scenes — present darker blacks. It can inadvertently cause overexposure in dark scenes with bright spots or show you more detail than the filmmakers intended.</p><p>Some TVs also dynamically dim the backlight in different areas of the screen.</p><p>These settings have an even wider variety of names including <code>Dynamic Contrast</code>, <code>Dynamic Range Remaster</code>, <code>Local Dimming</code>, <code>Local Dimming</code>, <code>Brightness Optimisation</code>, <code>Adaptive Backlight</code>.</p><h3>Noise reduction</h3><p>Noise reduction is supposed to reduce noise from terrestrial television, pixelation, and compression. It can inadvertently remove textures and result in a blurry picture — sometimes it&#39;s called <code>Smooth Gradation</code></p><h2>Learn more</h2><p>I&#39;m not an expert on picture quality.
