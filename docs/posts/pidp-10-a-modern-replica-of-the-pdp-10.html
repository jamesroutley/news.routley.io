										The MIT AI Lab, with a PDP-10 at its heart, was hugely important in computer history, with many &#39;firsts&#39; on its record. Over the past decade, a group of enthusiasts did a full reconstruction of the Lab&#39;s hardware and software as it stood in the 1970s. The PiDP-10 gives a physical shape to <a href="https://obsolescence.dev/its.html">this project</a>, we regard it as a &#39;computer history capsule&#39;. A self-contained, compact replica that gives an experience as close as possible to the real machine and the AI Lab. But now at home, perhaps even in the living room.

											<h3>Background Story</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											In 1968, the PDP-10, model KA10, brought DEC into the world of mainframe-class machines. The PDP-6 had already defined the architecture four years earlier: a 36 bits CPU with a rich, very complex instruction set that feels completely esoteric today. Alas, the PDP-6 was notoriously unreliable. It took the PDP-10 before DEC got it right.

											<p><i>The PDP-10 at the <a href="https://livingcomputers.org/Computer-Collection/Computer-Renovation.aspx">LCM</a> in Seattle, where we could verify our front panel&#39;s exact behaviour</i></p>

										<p>
											Famous from computer lore, the PDP-10 was also the breeding ground for the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture" target="_blank">Hacker Culture</a> at MIT, made famous by Levy’s book Hackers. At the 
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#History" target="_blank">Artifical Intelligence Lab</a>, the Ten was at the heart of a large collection of connected hardware, and its 
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System" target="_blank">ITS operating system</a>
											 became a playground for computer scientists and hackers alike. MacLisp, emacs, the earliest AI demos, they were born on ITS. An operating system so esoteric that the debugger doubled as the command line, and although massively multi-user, connected to the early internet, open for all to visit – it had no password or security. Anyone from anywhere could join for a game of multi-user Mazewar on it – or crash the whole system. Which nobody seemed to do as it was just too easy to be cool.

											</i></p>

										<p>
											Free software was born here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Harvard_University_and_MIT" target="_blank">Stallman</a> was one of the ITS hackers. But, funny enough, Microsoft as well: Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote <a href="https://livingcomputers.org/Blog/MS@45-The-PDP-10,-Macro-10,-and-Altair-8800-BASIC.aspx" target="_blank">Micro Soft Basic on a PDP-10</a> at Harvard, running their homebrew 8080 emulator. Allen’s love for the PDP-10 drove him to a full restoration of a KA10 in the 2010s. And in fact, when that restored machine came to life, it gave us the one and only opportunity to check our our replica against a live real machine. Sadly, Allen passed away just before the restoration was completed, and the future of <a href="https://wiki.livingcomputers.org/doku.php" target="_blank">The Last KA10</a> looks dim now. Making us even more grateful for that tiny time slot in which we could perfect the replica&#39;s behaviour.

											<h3>Technical Specs</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Ten was renowned for its refined 36-bit architecture (each word being 36 bits wide). The instruction set was huge, encompassing arithmetic, logical, and control operations with various addressing modes to enable fast data manipulation and control flow handling. The architecture relied on a microcoded control unit for instruction execution, featuring separate instruction and data spaces. With a 36-bit word size and addressing, it offered access to a then-astonishing 256 kilowords (over a megabyte in 8-bit bytes) memory address space. Its puny clock speed of around 0.6 MHz is misleading in today’s terms – the 36 bit instructions packed a lot of punch in a cycle. I/O subsystems included magnetic tape drives, disk drives, printers, card readers, and communication interfaces.

											<h3>Why you need one at home</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Paul Allen wanted one at home, so it must make sense. It is simply the only mainframe ever that became a playground for hackers. As a result, hundreds of applications, games, high-res graphics demos (on a repurposed radar tube) and AI projects are installed on the reconstructed ITS disk images. Controlling ITS is not all that hard, and mastery of it is rewarded by this huge playground of available software, much of it prototyping for the first time applications that we now take for granted.
