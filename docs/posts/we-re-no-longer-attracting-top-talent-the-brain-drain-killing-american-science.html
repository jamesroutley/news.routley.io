He is on the frontlines of that war against superbugs; the NIH lab in which he works is driving what he described as “high-risk, high-reward research”.</p><p>But over the past year, the battlefield has toughened. Under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link">Trump administration</a>, Morgan, 33, and thousands of other young American scientists like him have grappled with wave after wave of disruptions.</p><p>Billions of dollars have been wiped from research budgets, almost <a href="https://grant-witness.us/" data-link-name="in body link">8,000 grants</a> have been cancelled at NIH and the US National Science Foundation alone, and more than 1,000 NIH employees have been fired.</p><p>Morgan’s research has been rattled by multibillion-dollar cuts in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-under-orders-cancel-2-6-billion-contracts" data-link-name="in body link">NIH contracts</a> that make it impossible for labs to maintain their equipment.

His own future is now in doubt.</p><p>In the normal trajectory of a life in science, Morgan would be planning to set up his own laboratory conducting groundbreaking research designed to win the war on superbugs. But with an ongoing hiring freeze at NIH, his options are limited.</p><p>“Right now there’s no way even to apply to start your own lab at NIH, no matter how good you are, or how critical your work,” he says.</p><p>Morgan’s predicament has led him to step up as a steward at a <a href="https://uaw.org/tag/local-2750/" data-link-name="in body link">new union</a> for young NIH researchers formed under the umbrella of the UAW.

More than 10,000 post-doctoral experts in scientific and related fields were lost to the federal workforce last year, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office" data-link-name="in body link">according to Science</a>.</p><p>The magazine looked at 14 research agencies, including NIH, and found that the number of employees departing outstripped new hires by 11 to one.</p><p>The brain drain is prompting existential fears that American science, a powerhouse of the US economy and of global public health, is being deprived of its lifeblood.

It pushes at the frontier of new therapies geared to the genetic makeup of individual patients, and can claim numerous breakthroughs in cancer treatment, vaccinations and much more.</p><p>Without the NIH driving innovation at its core, the US would cease to have the largest biomedical ecosystem in the world.</p><h2 id="wiping-out-the-next-generation-of-scientists"><strong>‘Wiping out the next generation of scientists’</strong></h2><p>Emma Bay Dickinson, a 27-year-old postgrad researcher in infectious diseases, is a specialist in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html" data-link-name="in body link">zika</a>, the largely mosquito-born virus that can cause birth defects. Her longer-term ambition is to help find a way to protect the world against viruses that have the potential to evolve into the next pandemic, such as avian flu.</p><p>For now, though, the US will miss out on her skills. The Trump administration’s funding cuts began to hit last year just when, as a postgraduate research fellow at NIH in Washington DC, she was hunting for her next position.</p><p>“My classmates applying in the US were getting rejected, and were being told that the funding cuts meant there was too much uncertainty to offer them jobs.”</p><p>Dickinson, who is queer, was discouraged by Trump’s animus against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) which was used as a justification for many of the grant cuts. She was also dismayed by the blatant censorship imposed by the administration.</p><p>Applicants for federal research funding were forced to filter their proposals to remove a <a href="https://pen.org/banned-words-list/" data-link-name="in body link">banned list</a> of key words across DEI, climate, vaccines and other study areas deemed undesirable by Trump.</p><p>So Dickinson redirected her energies abroad. She began applying for posts in Spain and Germany, in the end landing a spot at a prestigious program at a Barcelona infectious disease research institution.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, she sees her future in Europe. “It’s important for me to feel I can be myself in my science, and that’s just not possible right now in the US,” she said.</p><p>She is not alone. A growing number of young American scientists are quitting the country for positions in Europe, Australia or Asia. Universities across Europe have been swift to exploit the opportunity, openly enticing young Americans to join <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/05/01/european-governments-back-universities-us-recruitment-drive" data-link-name="in body link">the exodus</a> and seek “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/europe-universities-us-researchers-trump-administration-science" data-link-name="in body link">scientific asylum</a>” with them.</p><p>The response has been overwhelming. Aix-Marseille University, which launched one of the first European programs to lure people from the US, was inundated by hundreds of applications from early-career researchers hoping to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/05/academics-leaving-us-scientific-asylum-france-trump" data-link-name="in body link">flee the US</a>.</p><p>The outflow of young scientists has been exacerbated by deep cuts to NIH training programs, which acts as a breeding ground of the US’s future top scientists. At least 50 training programs, targeted at undergraduates through early-career lab researchers, have been shut down under the Trump administration.</p><p>An NIH program officer spoke to the Guardian about the impact of the training cuts, but asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “Trainees are the most vulnerable people in science,” the officer said.</p><p>“They are the ones with new ideas, where a lot of our hope resides. Now they are losing their minds with worry about what comes next. They are desperate for advice on how to stay in science when there are no grants available.”</p><figure id="d764513e-8e01-47f6-ac11-0832f66daab4" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Students do research work in a lab" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Research students work in the lab at the Colorado University Anschutz cancer center in Aurora, Colorado, on 18 March 2025.</span> Photograph: Helen H Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The officer added: “If you delay and terminate training grants, it’s like a snowball effect.

She disputed the idea that the pipeline of young scientists was being reduced, calling such claims “baseless and intended to fearmonger”.</p><p>“NIH will continue to attract and recruit the best and brightest, strengthen the US biomedical workforce, and deliver cures and solutions for Americans,” she said.</p><p>But NIH staff continue to view the future with trepidation. Jenna Norton, a program director at NIH, said she had been surprised by how quickly the landscape had changed.</p><p>She was placed on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/nx-s1-5608969/federal-employees-shutdown-trump-leave" data-link-name="in body link">indefinite paid leave</a> from the agency in November, without being given any explanation. Earlier this month Norton filed a <a href="https://katzbanks.com/news/nih-scientist-files-whistleblower-complaint-alleging-retaliation-by-hhs-and-nih-for-speaking-out-against-politicization-of-science-and-unlawful-grant-terminations/" data-link-name="in body link">whistleblower complaint </a>alleging that the Trump administration had unlawfully retaliated against her for openly criticising Trump’s cuts to grants, funding and staffing at NIH.</p><p>Speaking in her personal capacity, Norton told the Guardian: “I was not expecting this administration to come at science as broadly and as quickly as they have.”</p><figure id="6576be0a-1181-4341-97fc-bd868224ba05" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:49,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Meet the OB-GYNs fighting back against Trump’s ‘guerrilla war on science’&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;6576be0a-1181-4341-97fc-bd868224ba05&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/23/ob-gyns-doctors-abortion-rights-science-trump&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:10,&#34;display&#34;:2,&#34;theme&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-49 | 49" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>In the long run, the damage done to the next generation of researchers threatens to harm not just scientific knowledge itself, but also the US economy.
