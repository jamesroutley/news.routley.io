    <h1>I&#39;m a fucking webmaster</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Back in 1993, you weren&#39;t a designer, developer, copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the bottom of every page.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about that. <strong>Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.</strong> The domain might have said <a href="http://tomstrucking.net">tomstrucking.net</a>, but it was built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a question, you emailed <a href="mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net">webmaster@tomstrucking.net</a>.</p>
<p>And that address got a lot of emails:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#34;Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site.&#34;<br/>
  </li>
  <li>&#34;Can you put a hit counter on my web page?&#34;<br/>
  </li>
  <li>&#34;I want my headline to be <span>blinking</span>.&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks treated webmasters like goddamned magicians. Just email us with your cyberspace dreams, and we&#39;ll make them a reality.</p>
<p><em>We couldn&#39;t draw, but we harnessed simple design patterns and made them work.</em></p>
<p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.</p>
<p>What did we love? The <span>VARIETY</span>.</p>
<p>People would come to us with a <strong>problem</strong>, and we would figure out a <strong>solution</strong>. We couldn&#39;t just search the web <strong>because the web was still being written</strong>. And you couldn&#39;t just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.</p>
<p>In the 90s, and webmasters came in all sorts of flavors. Some were IT people. Others came from the print world. Many worked in academia. There was a group that was more artsy fartsy (musicians, painters, writers). And there were <a href="http://nerdmullet.com/">snot-nosed kids</a> tying up their parents&#39; landlines with dial-up modems.</p>
<p>Despite our diversity, we had a shared skill: <strong>we knew how to make a website.</strong> This, as it turns out, is pretty fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>Sure, you could charge someone and build them a website. But even better, <strong>you could make your own website.</strong> You&#39;d publish whatever you were passionate about: <a href="https://www.spork.org/">sporks</a>, <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/">whiskey</a>, or your hatred of <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html">Internet Explorer</a>. Crazy enough: you put that stuff online, and you&#39;d meet other folks who liked the same damn thing. And all you really needed was a text editor (and maybe an FTP client). If webmasters were magicians than the web was our magic.</p>
<p>Our websites were pretty damned ugly. Instead of worrying about window dressing, we focused on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">words</a>, hierarchy, and structure. Each new page started in a text editor looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;What&#39;s this fucking page about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what this fucking page is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;go here, fucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Sure, it was simple, but it was focused. No distractions, just: what idea are you trying to express?</p>
<p>We&#39;ve seen lots of cool shit built on the web, but we&#39;ve also seen lots of bullshit too: barriers to entry, walled gardens, gatekeepers. Some things have been made unnecessarily complex. <strong>At its core a web page is simple.</strong> That&#39;s the beauty of it. And when you publish HTML to a server that you control; that&#39;s fucking powerful. Autonomy and independence are central to the web. We can&#39;t forget that.</p>
<p><strong>The world still needs some fucking webmasters.</strong> We might not all be making websites <em>professionally</em> anymore. But we should keep making websites. The passion, the freedom, the joy: we need to pass this on.</p>
<blockquote>
  Let&#39;s use the web to create neat new exciting things.</blockquote>
<p> Let&#39;s take Tim&#39;s words and inspire a new generation to love a simple HTML page the same way we do.<strong></strong></p>
