<p>Now that the Framework Laptop 13 has been through three refresh cycles—including one that swapped from Intel&#39;s CPUs to AMD&#39;s within the exact same body—the company is setting its sights on something bigger.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re taking an extended look at the first Framework Laptop 16, which wants to do for a workstation/gaming laptop what the Framework Laptop 13 did for thin-and-light ultraportables. In some ways, the people who use these kinds of systems need a Framework Laptop most of all; they&#39;re an even bigger investment than a thin-and-light laptop, and a single CPU, GPU, memory, or storage upgrade can extend the useful life of the system for years, just like upgrading a desktop.</p>
<p>The Laptop 16 melds ideas from the original Framework Laptop with some all-new mechanisms for customizing the device&#39;s keyboard, adding and upgrading a dedicated GPU, and installing other modules. The result is a relatively bulky and heavy laptop compared to many of its non-upgradeable alternatives. And you&#39;ll need to trust that Framework delivers on its upgradeability promises somewhere down the line since the current options for upgrading and expanding the laptop are fairly limited.</p>
<p>But the company has done a great job of building trust with the Framework Laptop 13—if you don&#39;t mind the design of the Laptop 16, there&#39;s a reasonably good chance you&#39;ll have appealing upgrades to grab. In a year or two.</p>
