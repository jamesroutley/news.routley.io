    <h1>BASIC is anything but dead</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>If you miss the simplicity of putting an app together with drag-and-drop in VB, there are some alternatives that might tickle your tastebuds.</p>
<p>Good old VB has been visited with some <a href="https://retool.com/visual-basic/" rel="nofollow">affection</a> recently, as <a href="https://devclass.com/2023/03/20/microsofts-visual-basic-why-it-won-and-why-it-had-to-die/">Reg sister site DevClass has discussed</a>. Way back in 2014, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/12/10/hey_dont_forget_visual_basic_says_microsoft_open_source_and_new_features_coming/">said it would go open source</a>, but all that emerged is the rather less interesting <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn" rel="nofollow">Roslyn</a>. For a long time, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/02/02/our_strategy_for_visual_basic_has_shifted_microsoft_to_focus_on_core_scenarios/">Microsoft has been focusing on .NET instead</a>.</p>
<p>The direct ancestory of VB, <em>Tripod</em>, was originally <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/my-one-phrase-resum%C3%A9-98776ef8a6fa" rel="nofollow">built</a> by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/09/19/software_guru_wants_new_accounting/">Alan Cooper, author of <em>The Inmates are Running the Asylum</em></a>. In this <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/geek-of-the-week/alan-cooper-geek-of-the-week/" rel="nofollow">interview</a> he explains that Tripod was originally intended as a construction kit to build a new shell for Windows 2. The Microsoft deal paid for a team of five to rewrite it as <em>Ruby</em>, then Microsoft combined it with its Embedded BASIC interpreter to turn it into <em>Thunder</em>, launched as Visual Basic 1.0 in 1991 – half way between Windows 3.0 and 3.1.</p>
<h3>Keeping it GUI</h3>
<p>Perhaps because VB started off as a one-man project, multiple people and small teams have sought to recreate it, or something like it. <em>The Reg</em> has covered one of these, <a href="https://www.radbasic.dev/" rel="nofollow">RAD Basic</a>, a couple of times: first when it attempted to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/06/visual_basic_6_returns/">crowdfund its development</a>, and later <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/06/rad_basic_alpha_3/">when it released its third alpha version</a>.</p>
<p>Closely comparable is <a href="https://twinbasic.com/" rel="nofollow">twinBASIC</a>, which publishes weekly updates so you can track its <a href="https://nolongerset.com/tag/twinbasic-weekly-update/" rel="nofollow">progress</a>. That&#39;s good, as there&#39;s as little to see on twinBASIC&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/twinbasic/twinbasic" rel="nofollow">Github</a> as there is on the <a href="https://github.com/radbasic" rel="nofollow">RAD Basic</a> one. We reckon that the two projects should talk: they might benefit from teaming up.</p>

    

<p>There have been many such projects over the years, but sadly, many seem to have gone dormant. In alphabetical order, some we found include <a href="http://www.glbasic.com/" rel="nofollow">GLBasic</a>, <a href="https://hbasic.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">HBasic</a>, <a href="https://kbasic.org/" rel="nofollow">KBasic</a> and its descendant <a href="https://www.q7basic.org/" rel="nofollow">Basic for Qt</a>, <a href="http://www.sdlbasic.altervista.org/main/" rel="nofollow">sdlBasic</a>, and Janus Software&#39;s <a href="http://www.biz-wise.nl/phoenix_features.html" rel="nofollow">Phoenix</a>. While <a href="http://bmatthew1.altervista.org/basic4gl/basic4gl.getting.started.htm" rel="nofollow">Basic4GL</a> has gone quiet, a port of it to the JVM, <a href="https://github.com/NateIsStalling/Basic4GLj" rel="nofollow">Basic4GLj</a> is in active development.</p>

</ul>
<p>Other projects just aim to create something with a similar feel, rather than a perfectly accurate and compatible replacement. <a href="https://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html#" rel="nofollow">Gambas</a> – short for <em><strong>G</strong>ambas <strong>A</strong>lmost <strong>M</strong>eans <strong>Bas</strong>ic</em>, although it also means <em>shrimps</em> in Spanish, runs on Linux and has got rather further: version 3.18.1 was released last month.</p>
<p>Anywhere Software&#39;s Java-based <a href="https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html" rel="nofollow">B4J</a> is proprietary but free, with a BASIC-like language and an IDE. It grew out of a PocketPC development tool called Basic4ppc, so its mobile support is strong. Sibling products are <a href="https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html" rel="nofollow">B4A</a> for Android and <a href="https://www.b4x.com/b4r.html" rel="nofollow">B4R</a> for Arduino, and the paid-for <a href="https://www.b4x.com/b4i.html" rel="nofollow">B4i</a> for iOS.</p>

        


        

<p>RealBasic started off as a shareware tool for classic MacOS. It <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2001/02/12/realbasic_brings_quick_appmaking/">added Mac OS X support way back in 2001</a>, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2002/10/03/real_cure_for_the_vileness/">went Windows native in 2002</a>, then a couple of years later <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/07/21/real_basic_to_target_linux/">added support for Linux as well</a>. Former vulture <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2005/09/13/review_realbasic_2005/">Tony Smith rather liked it</a>, giving it a positive verdict in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#39;s still around, only these days, it goes by the name of <a href="https://www.xojo.com/" rel="nofollow">Xojo</a>. The company put out a new <a href="https://documentation.xojo.com/resources/release_notes/2022r4.1.html" rel="nofollow">version</a> at the end of last year, and now <a href="https://xojo.com/company/press/2022r4.php" rel="nofollow">supports</a> Linux on Arm64. It&#39;s a free <a href="https://www.xojo.com/download/" rel="nofollow">download</a> for personal and educational use, but compiling or distributing apps <a href="https://xojo.com/store/" rel="nofollow">costs</a>.</p>

        

<p><a href="https://www.purebasic.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">PureBASIC</a> is more of a traditional, non-object-oriented BASIC, but it does have a graphical <a href="https://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/ide_form.html" rel="nofollow">form designer</a>. PureBasic <a href="http://aminet.net/package/dev/basic/PureBasic" rel="nofollow">started</a> out in 1998 as an Amiga app, but that version is historical now and developer Frédéric Laboureur <a href="https://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?t=24952" rel="nofollow">released</a> the source to version 4.0.</p>
<p>Brilor Sotware&#39;s <a href="http://www.brilorsoftware.com/fb/pages/home.html" rel="nofollow">FutureBasic</a> runs on the Mac and hooks into XCode. It&#39;s descended from Zedcor&#39;s classic ZBASIC, it&#39;s in active development and it&#39;s freeware, but not open source.</p>
<p>The FOSS <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbasic/" rel="nofollow">XBasic</a> project is still in around, with an active <a href="https://groups.io/g/MaxReasonsxBasic" rel="nofollow">community</a>, various flavours on <a href="https://github.com/xbwlteam" rel="nofollow">Github</a> as well as an actively-developed Windows version called <a href="https://xblite.com/" rel="nofollow">XBLite</a>.</p>
<h3>Less OO, more OG</h3>
<p>There are also tools for those who preferred the classic, less GUI-oriented forms of BASIC, such as VB&#39;s forerunner QuickBASIC. The standalone <a href="https://www.freebasic.net/" rel="nofollow">FreeBASIC</a> compiler is in active development and aims to be compatible with QuickBasic. So does <a href="https://qb64.com/" rel="nofollow">QB64</a>, although the dust has yet to completely settle over a <a href="https://lunduke.substack.com/p/the-wild-events-that-nearly-took" rel="nofollow">split</a> among its developers. A community called <a href="https://qb64phoenix.com/" rel="nofollow">QB64 Phoenix</a> is actively developing a new <a href="https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe" rel="nofollow">Phoenix Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Even more old-school, <a href="https://www.truebasic.com/" rel="nofollow">TrueBASIC</a>, originally created by BASIC&#39;s original developers John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, is still on sale. Remarkably, the free community edition of Atari ST classic <a href="http://gfabasic32.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">GFA-BASIC</a> for Windows is still getting occasional updates. Also Windows only is the commercial <a href="https://www.libertybasic.com/" rel="nofollow">Liberty BASIC</a>.</p>

        

<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk&#39;s personal favourite, the original <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html" rel="nofollow">BBC BASIC</a>, is still around and in active maintenance. There are now multiple editions, several of which are free to use. There&#39;s also a largely compatible multi-platform open source interpreter, <a href="https://jaguar.orpheusweb.co.uk/branpage.html" rel="nofollow">Brandy BASIC</a>, which has been forked and updated as <a href="http://brandy.matrixnetwork.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Matrix Brandy BASIC</a>. There are a number of much more limited FOSS BASICs indented for educational use, many of which are in the repositories of common Linux distros, such as <a href="https://basic256.org/" rel="nofollow">BASIC-256</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/" rel="nofollow">Bywater BASIC</a>, and <a href="http://2484.de/yabasic/" rel="nofollow">Yabasic</a>. There are also two separate FOSS languages with very similar names: <a href="http://smallbasic.com/" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Small Basic</a>, and the separate, independent <a href="http://smallbasic.github.io/" rel="nofollow">SmallBASIC</a>.</p>
<h3>Not so Basic after all</h3>
<p>If you liked the style of VB development – draw the form, then fill in code for the controls – but you&#39;re not wedded to BASIC itself, then there are other contenders that we feel we must mention.</p>
<p>One of the factors in the decline of the original Visual Basic was of course Borland&#39;s Delphi, the visual descendant of the company&#39;s Turbo Pascal. While <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi" rel="nofollow">Delphi</a> itself is still around, there&#39;s a very complete open source implementation of the language, <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/" rel="nofollow">Free Pascal</a>, complete with multiplatform graphical IDE <a href="https://www.lazarus-ide.org/" rel="nofollow">Lazarus</a>. The Ada language is also more lively than you might expect, possibly thanks to <a href="https://www.adacore.com/" rel="nofollow">AdaCore</a> and its <a href="https://www.adacore.com/sparkpro" rel="nofollow">SPARK</a> project. The GNU Ada compiler <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/" rel="nofollow">GNAT</a> has a visual development environment in active development, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnavi/" rel="nofollow">GNAVI ®</a>.</p>
