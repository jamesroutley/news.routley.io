 <li><p>ExxonMobil: profits of £15bn increased to £53bn</p></li>
 <li><p>Shell: £16bn up to £44bn</p></li>
 <li><p>Glencore: £1.9 bn up to £14.8bn</p></li>

Labour income is likely significantly lower, and economic dynamism is weaker – with poorer choice, worse product quality and fewer economic opportunities – than in a counterfactual world where big corporations were less dominant,” it added.</p><p>Some members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have acknowledged that prices rises have risen to boost profits.</p><p>Last year, Isabel Schnabel, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said that “on average, profits have recently been a key contributor to total domestic inflation, above their historical contribution”.</p><p>Jung and the Common Wealth economist Chris Hayes said a tax on the estimated $4tn of excess global profits was needed alongside moves to break up monopolistic practices that allowed firms to exploit their market power.</p><p>Jung said the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/03/ever-higher-interest-rates-wont-solve-the-problem-of-greedflation" data-link-name="in body link"> Bank of England</a> had fallen behind in the debate and needed to “catch up”.</p></div></div></div>
