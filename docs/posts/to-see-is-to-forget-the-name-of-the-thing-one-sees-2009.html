<p><span>“<strong>T</strong>o see is to forget the name of the thing one sees.” This is a quote frequently attributed to Paul Valéry, and the line has a quality that is at once both searching and poetic, making the attribution reasonable. I don’t know if Valéry actually said it (I can’t find the source of the quote), but I think of this line every once in a while: my mind returns to it as to an object of fascination, like an intellectual fetish. A good aphorism is perennially pregnant with meaning, and always repays further meditation. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>I</strong>f seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees, and <em>mutatis mutandis</em> for the aesthetic experiences that follow from the other senses — e.g., to taste is to forget the name of thing one tastes, and so forth — we may take the idea further and insist that it is the forgetting of not only the name but of all the linguistic (i.e., formal) accretions, all categorizations, and all predications, that enables us to experience the thing-in-itself (to employ a Kantian locution). What we are describing is the pursuit of <a href="https://geopolicraticus.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/i-dreamed-a-dream/" title="I dreamed a dream…"><strong>prepredicative experience</strong></a> after the fact (to employ a Husserlian locution). </span></p>
<p><span><strong>T</strong>his is nothing other than the familiar theme of seeking a pure aesthetic experience unmediated by the intellect, undistracted by conceptualization, unmarred by thought — seeing without thinking the seen. In view of this, can we take the further step, beyond the generalization of naming, extending the conceit to all linguistic formalizations, so that we arrive at a pure aesthesis of thought? Can we say that <em>to think is to forget the name of the thing one thinks</em>? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>T</strong>he pure <em>aesthesis</em> of thought, to <em>feel</em> a thought as one feels an experience of the senses, would be thought unmediated by the <em>conventions</em> of naming, categories, predication, and all the familiar machinery of the intellect, i.e., thought unmediated by the accretions of consciousness. It would be thought without all that we usually think of as being thought. Is such thought even <em>possible</em>? Is this, perhaps, unconscious thought? Is Freud the proper model for a pure <em>aesthesis</em> of thought? Possible or not, conscious or not, Freudian or not, the pursuit of such thought would constitute an effort of thought that must enlarge our intellectual imagination, and the enlargement of our imagination is ultimately the enlargement of our world. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>W</strong>ittgenstein famously wrote that <a href="https://geopolicraticus.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-limits-of-my-language-are-the-limits-of-my-world/" title="The limits of my language are the limits of my world."><strong><em>the limits of my language are the limits of my world</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.kfs.org/jonathan/witt/tlph.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em></strong></a>, 5.6 — this is another wonderful aphorism that always repays further meditation). But the limits of language can be extended; we can systematically seek to transcend the limits of our language and thus the limits of our world, or we can augment our language and thus augment our world. Russell, Wittgenstein’s mentor and one-time collaborator, rather than focusing on limits of the self, developed an ethic of impersonal self-enlargement, i.e., the transgression of limits. In the last chapter of his <em>The Problems of Philosophy</em> Russell wrote:</span></p>
<p><span>All acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the Self, but this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. It is obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by a study which does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that character, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its objects. This enlargement of Self is not obtained when, taking the Self as it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this Self that knowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien. The desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all self-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it desires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Self-assertion, in philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to its own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the Self sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on the contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the boundaries of Self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe the mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>T</strong>he obvious extension of this conception of impersonal self-enlargement to an ethics of thought enjoins the self-enlargement of the intellect, the transgression of the limits of the intellect. It is the exercise of imagination that enlarges the intellect, and a great many human failures that we put to failures of understanding and cognition are in fact failures of imagination. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>T</strong>he moral obligation of self-enlargement is a duty of intellectual self-transgression. As Nietzsche put it: “A very popular error: having the courage of one’s convictions; rather it is a matter of having the courage for an <em>attack</em> on one’s convictions!” </span></p>

His most influential contributions include his defense of logicism (the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic), his refining of the predicate calculus introduced by Gottlob Frege (which still forms the basis of most contemporary logic), his defense of neutral monism (the view that the world consists of just one type of substance that is neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical), and his theories of definite descriptions and logical atomism. Along with G.E. Moore, Russell is generally recognized as one of the founders of modern analytic philosophy. Along with Kurt Gödel, he is regularly credited with being one of the most important logicians of the twentieth century. (from SEP)&lt;/p&gt;
