    <h1>Sergey Brin&#39;s airship gets FAA clearance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666055530" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-airship-faa-clearance" data-authors="Mark Harris" data-headline="EXCLUSIVE: Google Founder’s Airship Gets FAA Clearance" data-page-title="EXCLUSIVE: Google Founder’s Airship Gets FAA Clearance - IEEE Spectrum"><div><p>Expect traffic on the 101 highway in Mountain View, California, to be even worse in the days or weeks ahead, as motorists slow down to watch <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> co-founder Sergey Brin’s 124-meter long airship <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pathfinder 1</a> launch into the air for the first time.</p><p><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em> has learned that <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/" target="_blank">LTA Research</a>, the company that Brin founded in 2015 to develop airships for humanitarian and cargo transport, received a special airworthiness certificate for the helium-filled airship in early September.</p><p>That piece of paper allows the largest aircraft since the ill-fated Hindenburg to begin flight tests at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield" target="_blank">Moffett Field</a>, a joint civil-military airport in Silicon Valley, with immediate effect.</p><p>The certificate permits LTA to fly Pathfinder 1 within the boundaries of Moffett Field and neighboring Palo Alto airport’s airspaces, at a height of up to 460 meters (1500 feet). That will let it venture out over the south San Francisco Bay, without interfering with planes flying into or out of San Jose and San Francisco International commercial airports. </p><p>In a letter supporting its application for the certificate, LTA wrote: “Pathfinder 1’s experimental flight test program is to demonstrate and establish the flight envelope for the airship…. LTA’s test plan is tailored to include substantial indoor and outdoor ground testing, using a build-up approach to gradually increase the flight envelope.”</p><p>The huge airship will initially be attached to a mobile mast for outdoor ground testing, before conducting about 25 low-level flights, for a total of 50 hours’ flight time. </p><p>Although its rigid design hearkens back to the gargantuan airships of the early 20th century, Pathfinder 1 is almost completely different from any large airship that has flown before. Crucially, its <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/technology" target="_blank">reported</a> 96 welded titanium hubs and 288 carbon fiber reinforced polymer tubes are light enough that it can use non-flammable helium instead of explosive hydrogen as a lifting gas. </p><p><img alt="Interior view of the airship&#39;s foundation during construction." data-rm-shortcode-id="38da14c974a020e52bfaaa29d4a6e3f4" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/interior-view-of-the-airship-s-foundation-during-construction.jpg?id=50295607&amp;width=980" height="1693" id="e5a30" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%203300%201693&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="3300"/><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-504252" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">LTA’s airship frames are made of lightweight titanium and carbon-fiber.  </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">LTA Research and Exploration</small></p><p>Twelve electric motors distributed on the sides and tail of the airship, and four fin rudders, allow for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/airship" target="_self">speeds of up to about 120 kilometers per hour</a>. A tough layer of <a href="https://www.dupont.com/brands/tedlar.html" target="_blank">laminated Tedlar material</a> contains 13 helium bags of ripstop nylon, which contain lidar systems to track the gas levels within. </p><p>Pathfinder 1 has a hybrid propulsion system, with two 150 kilowatt diesel generators working alongside 24 batteries to provide power for the electric motors, according to a <a href="https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/advanced-air-mobility/ltas-large-rigid-airship-gets-airborne" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent presentation</a> by LTA’s CEO, Alan Weston. He said that LTA has plans to use hydrogen in later versions of the airship, perhaps as fuel for future fuel cells or turbogenerators, and possibly even as a lifting gas. </p><p>LTA confirmed the airworthiness certificate had been granted but not provide any further details.</p><p>Although the Pathfinder 1 is designed for single pilot operation, it has dual controls and, according to LTA’s letter to the FAA, will have a second pilot on board “for initial flight testing until pilot workload can be assessed.” The gondola that LTA is using for the airship was designed by the famous Zeppelin company in Germany and can <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sergey-brins-revolutionary-20-airship" target="_self">accommodate up to 14 people</a>, although no superfluous passengers will be allowed during testing. </p><p>After extensive flight testing in California, the Pathfinder 1 will transit to the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear_Airdock" target="_blank">Goodyear Airdock</a> airship hangar in Akron, Ohio, which the company has acquired as its future manufacturing location. There, an even larger 180-meter long airship, the Pathfinder 3, is already under development. </p><p>Ultimately, LTA intends its aircraft to be used for humanitarian missions, deploying cargo and personnel to areas that are inaccessible by road. Brin runs a separate non-profit, called <a href="https://gsd.ngo/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Support and Development</a>, that has already carried out such missions by sea, in the Caribbean, Latin American and the South Pacific. It originally used Brin’s own superyacht to ferry medical personnel to the scene of hurricanes and other disasters, and recently launched a purpose built vessel capable of transporting dozens of medical staff and full-size shipping containers. The <a href="https://gsd.ngo/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-vessel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MV Dawn</a> also carries its own watercraft and vehicles, and is capable of producing and off-loading bulk supplies of fresh water, and could be a model for future humanitarian airships. </p><p>Pathfinder 1’s airworthiness certificate is valid for a full year although LTA told the FAA in its application letter that it expects the test program to be complete within 180 days. </p></div></div></div>
