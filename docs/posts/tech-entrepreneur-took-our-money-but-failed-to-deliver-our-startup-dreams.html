It&#39;s disgraceful,&#34; says Amy, who had funded the project by remortgaging her home and using credit cards.</p><p>Eventually, she requested a refund through her bank and complained to the UK&#39;s Financial Ombudsman Service. A senior investigator there has provisionally recommended that the bank return $39,000 (£30,000) to Amy, according to documents seen by the BBC. She is still waiting for her bank to agree to the recommendation.</p><p>As part of the process, two expert software developers reviewed the app developed by ConvrtX. According to the senior investigator, the evidence supported Amy&#39;s claim that the company had breached their contract by failing to provide the service she paid for.</p><p>&#34;I think it&#39;s fair to say ConvrtX failed to exercise reasonable care and skill when they were providing the service,&#34; the investigator said. &#34;It seems the work completed by ConvrtX cannot be salvaged and the entire process would need to be completed again if [Amy] wanted a working app to be developed.&#34;</p><p>In response, lawyers for Mr Adler say that the client had &#34;received a website, clickable prototype and a fully developed mobile app from ConvrtX&#34;.</p><p>Former senior staff say that Josh Adler - the son of Kerry Adler, a wealthy Canadian businessman - presided over a culture of instability, resulting in high turnover of staff and errors due to &#34;cutting corners&#34; and hiring and firing inexperienced contractors.</p><p>On his Facebook profile, Mr Adler described himself as #YoungAndReckless and #LivingTheDream. We spoke to a number of former employees who described him as immature and a poor leader.</p><p>In company meetings, they say he &#34;bragged&#34; about living at the Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Abu Dhabi, boasted about renting a villa in Bali, and showed off a newly purchased Porsche 911 and multiple speeding fines.</p><p>He cared about &#34;his rich kid, bling-bling lifestyle,&#34; says a former senior employee speaking on the condition of anonymity. &#34;When you have that many unhappy clients, it can&#39;t be a coincidence.&#34;</p><p>Mr Adler&#39;s lawyers describe him as &#34;highly ambitious&#34; and say he sought to build a world-leading business, but that not all staff lived up to his high standards and would be &#34;let go&#34; if they under-delivered. &#34;Young and Reckless&#34; is a clothing brand he likes, they add.</p><p>But several senior ex-staff told us they had concerns about how Mr Adler ran his company, saying he continued to take on new clients even after being warned that some business and app ideas were unviable or impossible to make. They say he requested payments from clients in advance, sometimes as much as $53,000 (£40,000), though the company had a no-refund policy.</p><p>Two senior ex-employees claim that when Mr Adler was informed that some apps were not working, he would subsequently tell customers - against the advice of the development team - that he could fix the problem if they paid more money, or their outstanding balance.</p><p>&#34;So don&#39;t tell the client that it cannot be done because we&#39;ll find [a contractor] that can do it when they&#39;ve paid,&#34; one ex-staff member recalls Mr Adler repeatedly telling them. &#34;He&#39;s a good talker, he&#39;s good at sales… but he gives a lot of false promises.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9c65/live/aa9bf630-1b8a-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="DeShawn Womack has braided hair and is wearing a red and black plaid suit jacket over a white shirt and black tie.

He says he paid more than $50,000 (£37,750) for a mobile app that would allow users to remotely access their phone and all its data from another device if it was lost, stolen or damaged.</p><p>He says he received a design prototype, but not a finished working app.</p><p>After making payments over two years, Mr Womack - a truck driver from the US state of Georgia - messaged a senior ConvrtX employee for clarity about whether his app would be able to sync missed calls and voicemails. He also asked if it would allow users to make phone calls from a different device using their same number - a specific feature he said Mr Adler had told him was possible and was referenced in his contract with ConvrtX.</p><p>&#34;This is impossible, your app was never ever possible in the first place,&#34; the employee responded in messages seen by the BBC. &#34;Did someone tell you this was possible?&#34;</p><p>Mr Womack replied: &#34;Yes, Josh [Adler] did and plus it&#39;s in my project sign-off.&#34; </p><p>The 40-year-old, who says he spent his life savings on the project, told the BBC he stopped making additional payments after he believed his app was not being properly worked on. </p><p>&#34;He [Josh Adler] sold me a dream and this is frustrating,&#34; he says.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr Adler say he denies telling customers that their ideas were viable when they were not.
