    <h1>Not paying with cash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I saw another article whiz by a few days ago from a journalist claiming that she only used cash again, and what a boon it had been for her. She’s hardly an isolated case; I’m especially seeing Zoomers in my circles go back to cash in a big way, for what are positive and heartening reasons.</p>
<p>You would think someone in my position would relate. I’m trying to reduce my smartphone dependence by offloading as much as I can from its black rectangular confides. I use a mirrorless camera, I read physical books, I make notes with a little pen. While I have Apple Pay set up as an emergency fallback, I don’t use it in my daily life.</p>
<p>I’m also wary of online tracking and digital surveillance, to which my years of blogging on the subjects here can attest. I always get a chuckle from people saying you shouldn’t use loyalty cards in grocery stores and the like… when they <em>pay with credit cards!</em> Our spending habits are ripe for data mining, selling, or worse; to say nothing about the potential financial pitfalls and predatory nature of credit card companies that can snare you. You either use credit cards, or credit cards use you, as my dear late friend Jim Kloss used to say.</p>
<p>Then there are the benefits cash confers. It’s (mostly) anonymous. It doesn’t come with hidden charges or card access fees that accumulate over time. It isn’t dependent on a merchant remembering to charge their EFTPOS terminal overnight, or having a reliable power source in the first place. It’s not affected by inevitable technical outages at a payment processor.</p>
<p>Most critically, cash can be more accessible. You don’t need a bank account, or a smartphone, or have undergone credit checks to use cash. This is why I’ve talked before about “cashless” societies being a worry, because as is frustratingly typical, we risk disenfranchising our most vulnerable and powerless neighbours without designing, testing, and implementing these systems carefully.</p>
<p>So why do I continue using cards? For the same reason you probably do: convenience. I can tap a card, and have paid for something. I don’t need to futz around in my wallet or scramble to count the exact change, lest my pockets swell with jingling, ever-increasing numbers of low denomination metal scraps (though self-serve supermarket checkouts are great for pouring in coins at the end of the week). Australian coins are massive, especially our 50 c piece which can double as a drain cover, discus, or dinner plate.</p>
<p>Cards are also <em>wildly</em> convenient for budgeting, perhaps most importantly to me. Clara and I reconcile down to the cent every week, and it’s an order of magnitude easier running down a list of transactions on a card than flipping through receipts that may have been crumbled, lost, or not given in the first place. I consider this such a vital feature that I consider card surcharges an acceptable trade-off. I’ve had to budget funds into the “Barrier” digital budget envelope when I’ve used cash to make the numbers reconcile. I’ve never had to with card transactions.</p>
<p>Cash is also—I regret to say—disgusting. I’ve been in enough public restrooms around the world to know roughly 100% of the population either aren’t bothered to wash their hands properly, or don’t know how (I would have hoped our global Covid adventure would have helped address this social shortcoming… nope). I’m also still scarred by a high school experiment where we left currency in Petri dishes, and came back on Monday to what could best be described as a <em>horrendous</em> sight. Coins give my hands that stale metal smell, and being handed grimy cash is not something I enjoy. Maybe this doesn’t bother you, which is great! I’m sure you’re perturbed by something else with which I’m fine. That’s how the world works.</p>
<p>The galaxy brain thought here is that cash is entirely a social construct we could do without; hence <a href="https://rubenerd.com/do-you-not-like-money/" title="Do you not like money?">why I don’t love it</a>. But it’s easier for me to use a card if I have to engage. Feel free to use money as you see fit.</p>
