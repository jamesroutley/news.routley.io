    <h1>GUIs and APIs Are Both Human Interfaces</h1>

<p>GUIs and APIs are both human interfaces. They both frame perspectives on data/operation service
offerings so that human beings can navigate and consume them. The human being in the case of APIs is
the application programmer, a subset of users. GUIs are applications, so it is natural to expect an
API’s capabilities to be a superset of a corresponding GUI’s — application programmers program the
GUI using the API.</p>
<p>Your resource service interface is not necessarily understandable – discoverable, crawl-able – by
machines. APIs are generally not machine-actionable interfaces.</p>
<p>Nor is it necessarily wise that a given API be made machine-actionable. This would result in a
two-audience problem. With two different target audiences, humans and machines, how could an API
serve both well?</p>
<p>I used to think that GUIs were for humans and APIs were for machines. I now have a SICP-esque
perspective on APIs: they “must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
execute.&#34;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
