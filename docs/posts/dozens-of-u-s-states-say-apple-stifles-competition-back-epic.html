On Thursday, professors, activist groups and the states weighed in through court filings that described legal arguments in support.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Apple&#39;s reply is expected in March. On Thursday, the company said it was optimistic that Epic&#39;s challenge would fail.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The states said in their filing that the lower court erred by failing to adequately balance the pros and cons of Apple&#39;s rules and also by deciding that a key antitrust law did not apply to non-negotiable contracts Apple makes developers sign.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">&#34;Paradoxically, firms with enough market power to unilaterally impose contracts would be protected from antitrust scrutiny â€” precisely the firms whose activities give the most cause for antitrust concern,&#34; they said.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Clarence Fernandez</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
