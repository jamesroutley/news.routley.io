    <h1>Ask HN: How might HN build a social network together?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have a concept for a social network that would eliminate many pain points. I&#39;m sure others do too.</p><p>How could we build a communal product for the public? Theoretically, this approach would result in a better product. Practically, it seems nearly impossible.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><p>Edit:</p><p>Let me give an example that I have been thinking about since 2009.</p><p>It requires a fundamental change from the reach model towards concentric social circles. The social network would allow users to arrange into small topical groups called social circles. These social circles would have a cap of 10 (arbitrary number) members. Each user could take part in many social circles. This inherently limits reach and therefore reduces the burden of misinformation, abuse, and moderation.</p><p>This model closely mirrors real social interactions and allows for both private and intimate communication. It also offers a profitable advertising opportunity. A social circle reflects its membersâ€™ interests and context.</p></div></div></div>
