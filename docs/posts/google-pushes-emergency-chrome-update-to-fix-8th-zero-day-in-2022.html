<p>Google has released an emergency security update for the desktop version of the Chrome web browser, addressing the eighth zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks this year.</p>
<p>The high-severity flaw is tracked as CVE-2022-4135 and is a heap buffer overflow in GPU, discovered by Clement Lecigne of Google&#39;s Threat Analysis Group on November 22, 2022.</p>
<p>&#34;Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-4135 exists in the wild,&#34; reads the update notice.</p>
<p>As users need time to apply the security update on their Chrome installations, Google has withheld details about the vulnerability to prevent expanding its malicious exploitation.</p>
<p>&#34;Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven&#39;t yet fixed.&#34; - <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_24.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google</a></p>
<p>In general, heap buffer overflow is a memory vulnerability resulting in data being written to forbidden (usually adjacent) locations without check.</p>
<p>Attackers may use heap buffer overflow to overwrite an application&#39;s memory to manipulate its execution path, resulting in unrestricted information access or arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>Chrome users are recommended to upgrade to version 107.0.5304.121/122 for Windows and 107.0.5304.122 for Mac and Linux, which addresses CVE-2022-4135.</p>
<p>To update Chrome, head to Settings → About Chrome → Wait for the download of the latest version to finish → Restart the program.</p>
