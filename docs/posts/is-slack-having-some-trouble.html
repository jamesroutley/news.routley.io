    <h1>Ask HN: Is Slack having some trouble?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was having some problems with Slack that you can send message but you do not get a confirmation (so the text message gets greyed out) but it is actually sent. This is confusing because you can&#39;t delete the pending message and can&#39;t delete the duplicated messages after restarting the Slack client either.</p></div></div>
