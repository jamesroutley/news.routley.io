    <h1>Hold on there: WPA3 connections fail after 11 hours</h1>
    
    
<p>
What a night.  I 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/01/24/wpa3/">hit upon</a>
something that got WPA3 working on some Raspberry Pi systems and 
excitedly put up a post to share the good news.  Then I went away for 
a while, and this morning found something new: the damn things won&#39;t 
stay connected for more than 11 hours.  All three of them failed in the 
same order that I changed them over.
</p>
<p>
The timeline is something like this:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">01:03:51 NetworkManager [...]: new IWD device state is connected
[...]
12:04:39 iwd[...]: Received Deauthentication event, reason: 0, from_ap: false
</pre>
<p>
Now that&#39;s something, considering none of the tunable aspects of the 
WPA3/SAE setup on my network are set to 11 hours.  But, what&#39;s this?  
You do a search for &#34;received deauthentication event&#34; and &#34;11 hours&#34; and 
what do you find but a 
<a href="https://community.infineon.com/t5/Wi-Fi-Combo/Wi-Fi-connection-to-wireless-LAN-AP-is-lost-after-11-hours-past-using-WPA3/td-p/291078">cursed Infineon developer community post</a>
on that very topic.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s from October 2021 (!) and it&#39;s from someone who&#39;s using the same 
sort of chipset (Broadcom/Cypress/Infineon CYW stuff) NOT on a Pi, and 
they get the same &#34;deauth&#34; thing when on a WPA3 network.  If then drop 
down to WPA2, it stops.  The thread runs for close to a year, and then 
just stops cold in August 2022 with no resolution.
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;ll it be?  WPA2 mode and not being able to get onto any 
networks that have gone to 6E or 7, or WPA3 mode and having it fall off 
the network every 11 hours?
</p>
<p>
Here, I&#39;ll make a prediction: someone will say &#34;it works most of the 
time, so that&#39;s fine, we won&#39;t be fixing this&#34;.  Considering the level 
of crap people put up with in their tech these days, that&#39;ll probably be 
the steady-state.
</p>
<p>
My conclusion: this entire ecosystem is deeply cursed.
