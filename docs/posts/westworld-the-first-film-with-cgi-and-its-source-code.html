Back in 2017, I started a YouTube channel based upon my Tumblr <a href="https://moviecode.tumblr.com/">Movie Code</a>. Movie Code shows real source code appearing in films and television and the YouTube channel went deeper into some of that source code to show how it works and where it came from.
</p><p>
I removed my channel from YouTube in 2022 and uploaded all the videos here.

Back in 1984 the Apple ][ was an exciting computer. So exciting that it played a key role in the Airwolf episode &#34;Moffett&#39;s Ghost&#34;. Unfortunately, the code, like Airwolf itself, is buggy. Luckily we can fix the bug... 30 years on.

Episode 1 of Season 3 of HBO&#39;s Silicon Valley contained a cool Easter Egg that was supposedly the Pied Piper compression library. This episode explains the Easter Egg and how it works.

In Jurassic Park, Dennis Nedry writes some code to cover his tracks. We see a glimpse of his code before it disappears from his screen when he sets his plan in action. But what was it? In this video, I track the code down.

The 1973 film Westworld was the first film to feature computer graphics. These were used to show how the robots saw the world. But Westworld also had something else... computer code. And it&#39;s computer code with a surprising source.

Blue Book isn&#39;t just the name of Nathan Bateman&#39;s company, it&#39;s also a double Easter Egg in Ex Machina. The hidden meaning is locked inside a program shown briefly on screen. In this video I&#39;ll show the true meaning of Blue Book and how it&#39;s clever Easter Egg by the director.

In the TV series Deutschland 83 some IBM BASIC code was shown. In this episode I run it and then try to determine precisely which version of IBM BASIC from the early 1980s was used. I do that by looking at the output of the random number generator.

&#34;The Return&#34; starring Jan-Michael Vincent and Cybill Shepherd is not a good movie. But it does have some 1980 code in it. Specifically, it&#39;s code for an Apple ][ and with a little work we can get it to run in an emulator.
