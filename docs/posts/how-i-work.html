            <p>Frequently, it behooves me to look in the mirror and remind myself that the people around me give good advice, I trust them, and that I should listen to them more often.</p><p>Writing in public has historically been one of my greatest fears - the slings and arrows of the public have been plenty of reason to just casually avoid it. I&#39;ve now had enough friends and peers tell me to just speak up, so here goes nothing.</p><p>I&#39;m not really planning to organize this well or in any particular order. This is the blank page and go method for me.</p><p>A snippet of how my brain operates:</p><ul><li>Discover some new thing, concept, framework, code, tool, widget, gizmo.</li><li>Learn how it works to a level that others refer to as &#34;obsessive, neurotic, academic, etc.&#34;</li><li>Use it to do something neat. Scale doesn&#39;t really matter - just use the tool to do something you thought would be fun. Don&#39;t focus on useful, just execute the process of building a thing that would be neat. It&#39;s not about the thing.</li><li>Once finished, take the time to evaluate your cool new thing. Then reflect on the process of how you made that thing.</li><li>Force yourself to explain the thing to someone who has no clue. At this stage technical expertise helps.</li><li>Work really hard at understanding your cool new thing and process well enough that you could inspire a person with limited to no understanding that they could also understand this thing.</li><li>When your explanations falter, work hard in that moment to communicate with your peer in the process - understand what is confusing, refine your words on the spot.</li><li>If it goes badly enough that you are unsuccessful, spend time reflecting on what went well and what went poorly. Make a list I guess? I don&#39;t do this but tons of folks seem really into pros/cons lists and writing stuff out. Figure out a way that works for you to do this reflection in a structured form.</li><li>Once you feel confident that you can get someone up to roughly your level of understanding and have spent a reasonable amount of time using your new whizbang thing; it&#39;s time to speak to someone way smarter than you about that thing. </li><li>Force yourself into situations where you&#39;re the dumbest person in the conversation. Ask stupid questions. Get things wrong, listen for corrections, but leave room to ask followups.</li><li>Present your ideas to larger audiences, welcome critique, get dunked on by someone who&#39;s got a stick up their ass, whatever it takes to harden those ideas. Always aim for progress, regardless of the setbacks.</li><li>Pause, take a breath.</li><li>Reflect again on how the process of building up the confidence to share something has forced you to truly understand it. Embrace the uncertainty - focus on the curiosity, and excitement that started you down this cycle.</li><li>Integrate these new lessons with all of your previous cycles. Each time you have built a new understanding of some kind, but it&#39;s not in a vacuum.</li><li>Notice similarities and differences with previous cycles.</li><li>Spend time and energy turning these connections over in your mind.</li><li>Eventually gain confidence in recall on demand and conceptual blending.</li><li>Reconcile with reality. Read prior art, post a wrong answer on reddit and let the internet dunk on you, find out most people don&#39;t actually care unless your cool new thing influences their daily lives. Talk to actual normal people about it and learn why it does or doesn&#39;t matter to them.</li><li>Learn that normal people mostly feel like they don&#39;t have time to do what I am describing here.</li><li>Figure out that the only way to share this lesson is to write out loud.</li><li>It&#39;s time to uncork that weird zone between your ears into the world without fear.</li></ul>
