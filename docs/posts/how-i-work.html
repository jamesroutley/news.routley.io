    <h1>How I work</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you go through life and your career many things change: your needs, your convictions, your boundaries, your communication style, your understanding of yourself and of other people.</p><p>At least that is the case with me. So many things changes in the past 15 years since I got my first job as a software engineer. And they continue changing. And I hope they will do that forever.</p><p>I’ll try to document some of my current beliefs about how I work and how I would like to work. This is only accurate as my understanding of myself circa Oct 2022.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-and-tactical-synchronization">Strategic and tactical synchronization</h3>
<p>This sounds too cheesy but what I really mean is simple. Synchronize on the direction - which is strategic. Direction can be written down as goals 3-4 months into the future. The goals can also change once discover some new information.</p><p>Synchronization on the tactical things (day to day and weekly work) in not important. You can write down whatever you did last week and brief plan for the next week. Other people can read it if they want. But there is no need to synchronize on those. Everyone knows the big goal and makes their own tactical decisions to achieve the goal.</p>
<h3 id="help">Help</h3>
<p>The most important form of communication is asking for help. Everyone works on their own thing. The only time you get involved into day to day issue of another person is when they ask you for help.</p><p>I don’t micromanagement and I don’t like pushing. There is no need for me to ask other person what is the state of their task. And I expect the same thing in return. If you need help - ask me for help. Don’t ask me for the state of my tasks. Don’t offer help with my tasks. If I need help - I’ll ask for it.</p>
<h3 id="inversion-of-responsibility">Inversion of responsibility</h3>
<p>If you are not getting something you want instead of finding the issue inside team mates - invert it. Ask yourself why is that that way? Why did I get that response? Search for the answers inside yourself first.</p><p>I you are not happy with your team, your treatment, your work, your family life - the first solution is always to look inside. Did I get something wrong? Am I not seeing something? </p><p>Once you inverted it and asked those question you can find the proper answers and hence solve the the problem.</p>
<h3 id="communication-overhead-inversion">Communication overhead inversion</h3>
<p>We live in the age of Twitter. We are showered with information every single day. We quickly learn that most information is not important. We can miss 90% of tweets just fine. This attitude creeps into our work life. We have hundreds of messages every day - most of them can be missed, we get hundreds of emails - most of them can be ignored, and we have too many meetings - most of them can be skipped.</p><p>I prefer the inverse. I want to have close to 0 meetings. And I want to have only few messages (the good ones - something good is happened or there is request for help - see above, or there is some new learning that happened).</p><p>Important side effete of this. Because there is no informational overhead - every message becomes important. If we have conversation one week ago or one months ago I expect it to remembered. </p>
<h3 id="resolutions">Resolutions</h3>
<p>Often you have situation when two people have different opinions. I usually have following heuristics that help resolve a tie and make resolution. </p>
<p>Often responsibility is nicely split. Eg some person is responsible for design, some for engineering, some of product, some for marketing, some for business development. The person who is responsible for the domain usually have the highest priority for her opinion. Because that person works on this thing.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions. Sometimes the proposed solution makes no sense. So the simplicity of the solution is the main criteria for the tie break.</p><p>Simplicity is the king. Eg if you cannot decide on the pricing model and have infinite arguments. Those arguments should be halted and simplest solution cane picked.        There are many reasons for this. Simple solutions are faster and cheaper to implement. And in most cases all the solutions can be improved iteratively. You can always add more complexity later to the pricing model if needed.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>Simplicity is the guiding star for me as mentioned above. It helps to save time, it helps to find resolutions to the questions with no consensus.        It has many more implications. Simplicity applies to everything. Eg how can I make product more simple for users and not more compact. How can I make my life more simple. So when people make your life more complex - it is a big red flag for me.</p><p>I’m ok when people have issue and they ask me for help. But it’s up to me to decide if I have capacity to help anyone today.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-uncertainty">Embrace uncertainty</h3>
<p>The world is complex. No-one understand the whole world anymore. It has been said that the last person to know everything was Goethe. And that was almost 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The complexity of the world increased so much that the same thing applies to the companies now. In any decently sized company there is not a single person who knows it all.</p><p>And this uncertainty should be embraced from the start. There is no need for everyone to know everything. Simplify the scope of responsibility for yourself. Become good at it. Show results. And once this is done, you can expand scope a bit. But at the beginning you want to simplify anything.</p>
<h3 id="opinionation">Opinionation</h3>
<p>Everyone has opinions. As I said above we live in the Twitter dominated worlds. Opinions are just opinions. People have opinions on every topic online. The same happens inside teams. People want to have an opinion on every single things - on writing style, on color scheme, on choose CSS library, on pricing model. Having opinion is totally fine. What is not fine is believing that your opinion needs to be communicated and as a result listened to.</p><p>By communicating your opinion you are polluting information broadband. See “Communication Overhead Inversion”. So you use both time of another person (expensive) and their cognitive capacity (extremely expensive). Because another person needs to understand you, think about it and then communicate it back. This process is extremely expensive.        Think about Elon Musk who famously proposed outrageous “peace plan“ for Ukraine. He destroyed so much productivity in the world using that one tweet. Because it was stupid and it caused many people to respond and distract them from their actual work. It caused so much emotional distress to other people because the “plan” was outrageously bad on so many levels.</p>
<p>Is he entitled having that opinion - yes. Would it be way better if he kept it for himself - 100%.</p><p>The question is always the same “is your opinion on this topic so important that it should be communicated now?” Will it block your team from achieving strategic goals. If it doesn’t block - try to keep it for yourself.</p>
<h3 id="levels-of-abstraction">Levels of abstraction</h3>
<p>I noticed that people tend to lack skills navigating different levels of abstraction. Eg in programming community it happens like this. You work on a complex project for the big system. You ask your peers for the feedback. And all the feedback they have is the use of code style or maybe CSS library for styling your components. And then discussion goes into this absolutely not important detail and you cannot get feedback of the whole project on the bigger level.</p><p>Another one common issue that many discussions evolve into meta discussions. Here again, you might cherry pick some aspect that you want to discuss(usually unimportant) and you would build complex straw man argument to make your point. You would even quote few philosophers and some studies from MIT.</p><p>Those things in my experience happen because of the several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>boredom. People find it entertaining to have discussion that they perceive deep one.</li>
<li>Ego plays. When you make good argument you sound smart. And it rubs your ego. So it feels good to do that.</li>
<li>Inability to see bigger picture and understand priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution to that is not have those discussions. If you have some nit picking meta discussion that you want to make - go on Twitter or Reddit and do it here. Don’t bring those things into the lives of other people unless they specifically want to play the same “game”.</p>
<h3 id="question-the-hype-and-fad">Question the hype and fad</h3>
<p>There is a lot of hype in the industry. Hype of the tools. Hype of the approaches. Eg at some point Agile was a thing. It became so hyped and it was the separate industry - people made money training coaches and selling books.</p><p>It’s important to filter though the hype. When picking tools, processes or even basic beliefs.</p><p>Eg people often talk about “collaboration” as something amazing. But to achieve positive effects of “collaboration” is really hard in reality. And it has negative side effects too. It’s not a thing that magically works.        I see it this way.</p>
<p>The productivity output for one person is 1.</p>
<p>We want to think that output for 2 people due to “synergy” and power of “collaboration” is 3. We have this romanticized dream that that is how it works.</p><p>When in reality usually output of work of two people is not even 2. Because Once you add people - you also need to do communication. And communication is separate job. So 1 plus 1 usually means 1.5. And in some cases it can even be below 1. Like 0.7. Basically there is higher chance that productivity will decrease after adding new person vs probability that it will magically skyrocket.</p>
<p>Getting 3 is an incredible thing and when you have it - enjoy. However, I don’t know of any defined and predictable way to get there. It is more like a lottery. What I really want is not end up with 0.7. So minimizing that risk is way important that optimizing and shooting for 3. And avoiding getting 0.7 is way easier and there are heuristics. Some of them are described above.</p><p>Single responsibility principle is important here. Eg when I need help with design for my project I don’t want to “collaborate” with designer. I want provide her as much information I have and then I want her to go and do her job and express her expertise and creativity and come back to me. I might provide a bit of feedback from my side - to self correct for insufficient input I gave at the beginning. But that would be it. I don’t need to provide my “valuable” opinion  to another person all the time. They do their job.</p>
<h3 id="anti-siege-and-the-power-of-no">Anti-siege and the power of no</h3>
<p>I saw many times in my life people would do this thing when they don’t like the answer they get. They would ask the question “why?” a lot. But not in the famous &#34;Five whys&#34; way from Toyota. But in an infinite way. Where each response to why leads to another meta discussion. This leads to being something similar to the siege, where you are bombarded with irrelevant questions and discussions until you exhaust your resource and give up.        This is the popular technique used on Twitter by people who don’t care about actual work and consensus.</p>
<p>No is a proper answer. If you asked someone for opinion and they told you you how would they do it tat should be usually enough. They probably give you few reasons already in their response. Go and think about it. Maybe you miss something.</p><p>Stop bombarding people.</p>
<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
<p>My contributions differ day to day and week to week and months per month. I have different states during the year. And it’s ok. What matters is incremental progress. If I can add one small thing this week - it’s still progress towards common goal. </p><p>The same way my contributions are not equal I don’t expect everyone on the team to contribute equal amount. Bring whatever you can. It all makes a difference.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As I said, my styles changes all the time. But I also think that with each year I have crisper and more clear vision of what I want.</p>
<p>My style is not for everyone. And this is completely fine. Important thing for me is to try to build my work around the style that works for me. And communicate to other people what is my style so they can decide if it works for them.        After writing this I realized that the big theme I care is the respect for other people time, boundaries, cognitive rand emotional resources.</p></article></div>
