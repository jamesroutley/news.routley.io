<h5>After 20 years, Google&#39;s Coding Competitions come to a close with a final round.</h5>

<p>
<em>By: The Coding Competitions Team</em>
</p>
<p>
Remember 2003? Before Chrome, Google Calendar, Android, and YouTube? When we carefully cleaned up our saved emails because GMail and its gigabyte of storage hadn&#39;t arrived? Two decades ago – Google launched a global coding competition called <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam" target="_blank">Code Jam</a>, which challenged programmers of all levels to test and hone their skills by racing to solve algorithmic problems.
</p>
<p>
From there, our coding competition lineup continued to grow. <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" target="_blank">Kick Start</a> began as a contest for recent graduates in China and quickly spread around the world. <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode" target="_blank">Hash Code</a>, Google&#39;s first team-based challenge, started in Europe. And a first-in-class Distributed Code Jam asked participants to build solutions that could scale when run on multiple machines.
</p>
<p>
Throughout our coding competitions&#39; 20-year history, you&#39;ve generated billions of lines of code across millions of submissions. You&#39;ve gone through hundreds of rounds for thousands of problems and put in millions of hours of code execution and testing. Over a million of you from almost every country worldwide have participated — from experienced programmers to students and everyone in between. And now, just as we invited you to our very first round in 2003, we&#39;re asking you to join us for one final event as the competitions come to an end.
</p>
<p>
Join us on <strong>Saturday, April 15, 2023 at 2 p.m. UTC </strong>as we host four simultaneous online rounds of competition at varying levels of difficulty. <strong><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/register" target="_blank">Register now</a></strong> to get in on the action.
</p>
<p>
And to those who&#39;ve taken part over the years: It&#39;s been an honor to learn, succeed, fail, and have fun coding with you. Through the <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000043580a/00000000006d1145" target="_blank">conceptual art</a>, <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000201bef/0000000000201d18" target="_blank">the slides</a>, <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/00000000000000cb/0000000000007a30" target="_blank">the gophers</a>, and <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000433515/0000000000433827" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000201bee/0000000000201d17" target="_blank">absurd</a> <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/00000000002017f7/0000000000201847" target="_blank">number</a> <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051707/00000000001591be" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019ffb9/00000000003384ea" target="_blank">pancakes</a>, we did it – and we did it together. Thanks for going on this journey with us.
