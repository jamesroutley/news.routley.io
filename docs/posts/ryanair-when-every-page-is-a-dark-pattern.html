                <p>Ryanair is a prime example of a company that employs various manipulative techniques, known as &#34;dark patterns,&#34; to increase its profits.</p><p>One such tactic is their default sign-up for promotional materials, which is considered a form of &#34;<a href="https://hallofshame.design/tag/privacy-zuckering/">privacy zuckering.</a>&#34;</p><figure><img src="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image.png" alt="Ryanair Contact Details Form" loading="lazy" width="1612" height="622" srcset="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image.png 600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image.png 1000w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image.png 1600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image.png 1612w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Throughout the booking process, the Ryanair website employs various &#34;misdirection&#34; dark patterns to upsell customers on additional services.</p><p>For example, they use prominent buttons to promote &#34;fast track&#34; options, which can be easily clicked on as they are located in the middle of the page, making it easy to accidentally select them while scrolling down to skip the offer.</p><figure><img src="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-1.png" alt="Ryanair Fast Track Dark Pattern" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1126" srcset="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-1.png 600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-1.png 1600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-1.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Even if a customer declines the upsell offer on the previous step, Ryanair will continue to use &#34;<a href="https://hallofshame.design/tag/misdirection/">misdirection</a>&#34; dark patterns by displaying another popup with a prominent button. </p><p>This time, they may even change the color of the button and the title to deceive customers further and make it appear as a different offer, tricking the customer&#39;s attention and making it less evident that it&#39;s the same page as before.</p><figure><img src="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-2.png" alt="Ryanair Fast Track Dark Pattern 2" loading="lazy" width="1384" height="1292" srcset="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-2.png 600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-2.png 1000w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-2.png 1384w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>The Ryanair website employs various &#34;dark patterns&#34; throughout its booking process to upsell customers on additional services and manipulate their attention. </p><p>One such example is using &#34;misdirection&#34; techniques, such as attempting to upsell customers on additional features and strategically placing primary buttons to encourage accidental clicks. This type of manipulative design is prevalent on nearly every website page.</p><figure><img src="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-3.png" alt="Choose your fare for the trip dark pattern" loading="lazy" width="1074" height="1218" srcset="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-3.png 600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-3.png 1000w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-3.png 1074w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Ryanair repeatedly presents customers with upsell offers for the same features, asking multiple times in case the customer changes their mind or falls for one of the manipulative &#34;dark patterns&#34; prevalent throughout the website. This persistent approach increases the likelihood of the customer making an impulse purchase or accidentally clicking on an offer.</p><figure><img src="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/2022/07/image-4.png" alt="Another example of the fare selection with dark patterns" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="744" srcset="https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-4.png 600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-4.png 1000w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-4.png 1600w, https://hallofshame.design/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/image-4.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Ryanair has integrated manipulative &#34;dark patterns&#34; into nearly every aspect of their booking process and it appears that they have no plans to stop using them. </p><p>It is important to be cautious and vigilant when using the Ryanair website, as these techniques are designed to deceive customers and increase profits for the company.</p>
