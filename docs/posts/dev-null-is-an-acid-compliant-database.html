    <h1>/dev/null is an ACID compliant database</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-hero"><p> <time datetime="2025-08-22T02:22:02.807Z"> August 22, 2025 at 2 a.m. </time> /  <!-- {remarkPluginFrontmatter.minutesRead} --> </p>  <p> /dev/null is web scale </p>  </div><div>   <article><h2>Atomicity</h2>
<p>Operations are &#34;all or nothing.&#34;</p>
<p>Anything you write to <code>/dev/null</code> disappears entirely. There&#39;s no partial write problem: it’s either written (and discarded) or not written at all. ✅</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>The system transitions from one valid state to another.</p>
<p><code>/dev/null</code> always stays in a consistent state (empty). No matter what you write, the invariant &#34;file contains nothing&#34; always holds. ✅</p>
<h2>Isolation</h2>
<p>Concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other.</p>
<p>Multiple processes can write to <code>/dev/null</code> at the same time, and their outputs never conflict, because nothing is ever stored. ✅</p>
<h2>Durability</h2>
<p>Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even after crashes.</p>
<p><code>/dev/null</code> &#34;durably&#34; commits your data into nothingness. After a crash or reboot, it still contains exactly what it always has: nothing. ✅</p>
<hr/>
<p>There is only 1 small problem though, it only comes with 0b of free storage. For more space, you will have to contact entreprise sales, which is actually just me!</p>
