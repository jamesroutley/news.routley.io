    <h1>The strange business of hole-in-one insurance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>On a warm day in September 2009, <strong>Jason Hargett</strong>, a 35-year-old restaurant manager and father of 4, stepped up to the tee at Red Ledges golf resort in Heber City, Utah.</p>



<p>It was the end of a charity tournament and a big prize was on the line: Anyone who sunk a hole-in-one would win <strong>$1m</strong>.</p>



<p>Hargett took a swing.</p>



<p>The ball careened 150 yards through the air, plopped onto the green, and slowly rolled back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBUk99SYkEA">into the hole</a>. Cheers erupted from the small crowd as Hargett sprinted down the fairway in disbelief.</p>



<p>But one entity wasn’t celebrating: the insurance firm that had been hired by the organizers.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>If you’ve ever watched a golf tournament or charity event, you’ve probably seen some kind of prize (a cash payout, a flashy car, a vacation package) for acing a specified hole.</p>



<p>The chances of this happening for an amateur golfer are minuscule (~1 in 12.5k). But most organizers can’t risk getting stuck with the bill.</p>



<p>Instead, they turn to <strong>hole-in-one insurance</strong> firms that assume the risk for a small fee.</p>



<h4 id="h-a-brief-history-of-unlucky-golfers"><strong>A brief history of ‘unlucky’ golfers</strong></h4>



<p>The hole-in-one insurance business dates back nearly 100 years — but it was originally intended for a different purpose.</p>

<p>In many golf circles, it was (and still is) customary for the lucky golfer to<strong> buy drinks</strong> for everyone in the clubhouse after landing a hole-in-one. This often resulted in prohibitively expensive bar tabs.</p>



<p>And an industry sprouted up to protect these golfers.</p>

<p><em>Tiger Woods serves drinks during the Johnnie Walker Classic in 2000 (David Cannon/ALLSPORT)</em></p>



<p>A newspaper archive analysis by <em>The Hustle</em> revealed that hole-in-one insurance firms sprouted up as early as 1933.</p>



<p>Under this model, golfers could pay a fee — say, <strong>$1.50</strong> (about $35 today) — to cover a<strong> $25</strong> (~$550) bar tab. And as one paper noted in 1937: “The way some of the boys have been bagging the dodos, it might not be a bad idea.”</p>



<p>Though the concept largely faded away in the US, it became a big business in Japan, where golfers who landed a hole-in-one were expected to throw <a href="https://soranews24.com/2016/06/14/heres-why-youll-never-want-to-hit-a-hole-in-one-in-japan/">parties</a> “comparable to a small wedding,” including live music, food, drinks, and commemorative tree plantings.</p>



<p>By the 1990s, the hole-in-one insurance industry had a total market value of <strong>$220m</strong>. An estimated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/1155db76b4b2f29ca80f9c1df62f86d2">30%</a> of all Japanese golfers shelled out $50-$70/year to insure themselves against up to $3.5k in expenses.</p>



<p>Around the same time, golf tournaments began offering increasingly large prizes for holes-in-one as a way to drum up press.</p>



<p>And hole-in-one insurance began to make a comeback in the US — not for individual golfers, but for the event organizers putting up the money.</p>



<h4 id="h-how-hole-in-one-insurance-works"><strong>How hole-in-one insurance works</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Mark Gilmartin</strong> runs <a href="https://www.holeinoneinternational.com/hole-in-one-insurance/">Hole In One International</a>, one of the oldest hole-in-one insurance companies in the US.</p>



<p>The idea first struck in 1991, when Gilmartin, then 29 and the proprietor of a golf club repair company, saw a burgeoning need for prize coverage at charity events.</p>



<p>Since 1991, his Reno-based firm has paid out <strong>~$56m</strong> in insurance claims — including Jason Hargett’s $1m prize.</p>

<p><em>Mark Gilmartin (photo illustration: The Hustle)</em></p>



<p>Today’s hole-in-one-insurance landscape, Gilmartin says, is ripe with competition: More than 2 dozen companies specialize in the niche field, vying for Google search keywords and golf tournament dollars.</p>



<p>The process generally works like so:</p>



<ol><li>A golf tournament decides to give away a prize — say, a $60k Mercedes — to anyone who gets a hole-in-one at the event.</li><li>They partner with a sponsor (in this example, a dealership) that offers the prize.</li><li>The sponsor pays Hole In One International a relatively small fee ($200 to $1k+); if someone gets a hole-in-one, Gilmartin covers the cost of the prize.</li></ol>



<p>Gilmartin says the cost to insure against a hole-in-one is dependent on 3 factors:</p>



<ol><li>The <strong>number of golfers</strong> in the tournament</li><li>The <strong>length</strong> (yardage) of the contest hole</li><li>The <strong>cash value</strong> of the hole-in-one prize</li></ol>



<p>Once a client provides this information, Gilmartin plugs it into an algorithm that computes the odds, factors in his risk and margins, and spits out a dollar amount per golfer.</p>



<p>A standard tournament with 100 golfers playing a 165-yard hole with a $10k prize sets an event back <strong>~$235</strong>.</p>

<p>Insurance firms operate on the premise that the odds of something happening are small enough to assume a repeated risk — and in Gilmartin’s case, this holds true.</p>



<p>The chances of someone getting a hole-in-one are fairly small:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1 in 12.5k</strong> for amateur golfers</li><li><strong>1 in 3k</strong> for pro golfers</li></ul>



<p>But <strong>~450m</strong> rounds of golf are played every year. And because of the scale and popularity of the sport, the feat happens on a daily basis.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://nationalholeinoneregistry.com/facts-feats/">National Hole-In-One Registry</a> — the preeminent record-keeper of aces — estimates that <strong>128k holes-in-one</strong> are achieved internationally every year by professionals and amateurs.</p>



<p>In other words, Gilmartin is no stranger to opening up his pockets.</p>



<h4 id="h-what-happens-when-someone-wins"><strong>What happens when someone wins?</strong></h4>



<p>Every year, Gilmartin says he insures <strong>~15k</strong> events and pays out “hundreds and hundreds” of holes-in-one.</p>



<p>Most of those prizes are under $100k in value. But sometimes, he gets dinged up pretty bad.</p>



<p>In November 2021, for instance, <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/su-oh-third-lpga-player-to-win-lamborghini-lease-for-hole-in-one">3 LPGA golfers</a> got a hole-in-one in the <em>same week</em>, each winning a 2-year lease on a Lamborghini Huracán. The tournament’s sponsor, Morgan Auto Group, purchased hole-in-one insurance from Gilmartin, and the winning shots set him back <strong>~$300k</strong>.</p>



<p>“Yeah, those women are pretty damn good,” he says. “That one still stings.”</p>



<p>Over the past 30 years, Gilmartin has also had to pay out at least 4 $1m prizes, which are typically awarded in annuities. Hargett, who landed that shot in Utah, got $25k/year for 40 years — a steep cost for Gilmartin, who charged a total of ~$1.1k to insure the 6 contestants at that event.</p>

<p>Before paying out a prize, Gilmartin requires a few proof-points:</p>



<ul><li>A sworn affidavit from an unbiased, non-participatory <strong>witness</strong> at the event.</li><li>A “<strong>gentle investigation</strong>” of the hole-in-one’s legitimacy (verifying the tee position wasn’t changed, that the yardage was consistent with the contract, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>Fraud does happen in the business.</p>



<p>In 1998, for instance, a man got a hole-in-one at an event and won a choice between a 1931 Cadillac or $40k in cash. But it turned out that the event organizer owed the winner a favor and had staged the whole thing. The organizer was <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1274805.html">convicted of fraud</a>, and the prize was nullified. </p>



<p>But Gilmartin says prizes are rarely denied — and despite forking over <strong>$2-$4m in claims</strong> in any given year, he always ends up in the black.</p>



<p>“You’re going to get hit in this business, but hopefully it all comes out in the wash at the end of the year,” he says.</p>



<h4 id="h-cow-poop-frisbee-tosses-and-half-court-shots"><strong>Cow poop, frisbee tosses, and half-court shots</strong></h4>



<p>Hole-in-one insurance is only one facet of a broader industry called <strong>prize indemnity insurance</strong> — the coverage of <em>any </em>promotional event in which a large prize is offered.</p>



<p>Gilmartin runs a second company, <a href="https://www.oddsonpromotions.com/"><strong>Odds On Promotions</strong></a>, that covers much weirder stuff than holes-in-one.</p>



<p>“If you can dream it, I’ll insure it,” he says.</p>



<p>Among the many events Gilmartin has insured prizes for:</p>



<ul><li>Half-court shots during halftime at basketball games</li><li>Guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar</li><li>Guessing the exact weight of a giant pumpkin</li><li>Throwing a frisbee through the sunroof of a car</li><li>Making a 7-10 split in bowling</li><li>Rubber duck races</li><li>Tossing a cookie into a bowl of milk</li><li>Guessing the Dow Jones average on a set day in the future</li><li>Tossing an olive into a martini glass from across a bar</li></ul>



<p>Among the weirder things he’s insured? Cow patty bingo (video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3_9yf5cDMI">here</a>).</p>



<p>“It’s big in the Midwest,” says Gilmartin. “You divide a big field into, say, 100 squares, give each one a number, then let a cow loose. If the cow poops on a preselected number, the person wins a prize.”</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>All of these things are insurable, he says, because they fall into one of 3 categories of risk:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Mathematical</strong> (like flipping a coin)</li><li><strong>Skill-based</strong> (a half-court shot)</li><li><strong>Odds-based</strong> (a sports team winning a game)</li></ol>



<p>In most cases, Gilmartin can calculate the rough chances of something happening and use the data to compute his premiums. </p>



<p>But sometimes, he has to insure things for which data doesn’t exist. And in those cases, he re-creates the scenario himself.</p>



<p>If a sponsor wants contestants to throw a ping-pong ball through a hole in a watermelon, he’ll go outside with his employees and re-create it himself, recording the results.</p>



<p>“It keeps things exciting,” he says. “By insurance standards, at least.”</p>
