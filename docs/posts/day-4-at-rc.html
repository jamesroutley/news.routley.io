    <h1>Day 4 at RC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>What a week! RC has been a huge mental (and emotional) shift for me. I still
feel anxious about making rapid progress; I hope as I settle on a more concrete direction
that I&#39;ll be able to manage some of those feelings a little bit better.
I feel like I&#39;m shifting more toward a relaxed &#34;let&#39;s just write some code&#34; mindset. That feels good.</p>
<h2 id="self-reflection">Self Reflection</h2>
<p>I think back to some of the early performance discussions that I had with my
managers as I was starting my career. At the time, I think I was reasonably
satisfied with my own work. I was solving interesting problems and had a good
dynamic with my teammates. It was satisfying to hear that others on the team
were also satisfied with the work that I was doing.</p>
<p>Over time, the expectations that I&#39;ve set for myself have grown. In some ways,
I think those expectations may have stunted my growth as an engineer. With each
new project or endeavor, it became more and more difficult to be satisfied with
my own work. I think this is something I&#39;ve struggled with since I was young.
The first few times that I solved a particular type of math problem were
satisfying. After that, I <em>expected</em> myself to be able to solve that kind of
problem. There was no joy to be had in demonstrating again that I could solve
that kind of problem. I would seek out progressively harder problems to solve
while procrastinating on the exercises that I already knew I <em>should</em> be able
to solve.</p>
<p>Software engineering is <em>mostly</em> working on things that you are already
familiar with in some capacity. Understanding how to structure a particular
abstraction or what kind of approach to take while solving a problem is mostly
a consequence of experience. With enough time in the saddle, you get to see
which decisions have the most significant consequences. When I feel like I am
struggling to make good decisions easily, I quickly get frustrated with
myself.</p>
<p>In that sense, being at RC feels great. I don&#39;t have to justify making a salary.
I can convince myself that there are no external expecations which helps me
to take it easy on myself.</p>

<h3 id="2048">2048</h3>
<p>The little 2048 project that I&#39;ve been pairing on is shaping up really well.
It&#39;s a lot of fun to see how different strategies compare with one another. It
reminds me a little bit of looking at some of the wordle solvers from the
beginning of 2022. I&#39;m excited to pair more on this on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="leetcode">LeetCode</h3>
<p>I paired on a LeetCode problem again. I think I did a really bad job of driving
and felt pretty bad in the moment. I was really impatient and didn&#39;t take the
time to make sure I was on the same page as my navigator. My partner handled the
situation really well and asked if we could take a step back to get on the same page.</p>
<p>I think this was a great experience for me. It was a chance to see how I can
improve the way that I collaborate, which was awesome. I feel badly that I maybe
didn&#39;t create the best experience for my partner, but I&#39;m glad that I am getting
better.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-interpreters">Crafting Interpreters</h3>
<p>I finally dusted off my in-progress C++ implementation of a Lox bytecode interpreter.
I think I&#39;m going to forge toward the end with the hopes of thinking more about
how to express some of the idioms in Rust.</p>
<p>One of the ideas I&#39;ve been mulling over:
I&#39;d like to write a two-pass Lox compiler in Rust and implement an
interactive debugger. If the debugger runtime is sufficiently modular, it
should be feasible to get something up and running in wasm with a
Rust-based front-end (maybe Leptos?). I think this would be a fun way
to build on top of what I&#39;ve learned while working through Crafting Interpreters
while getting a better understanding of the compile-to-wasm space (with some
web development thrown in there). We&#39;ll see how I&#39;m feeling as I wrap up my
C++ implementation.</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>I had a great coffee chat with an RC alum mostly discussing databases. I think
I definitely want to pursue something in this space. I think I&#39;m a bit anxious
about building a toy database but maybe it&#39;s worth just trying.</p>
<h3 id="presentations">Presentations</h3>
<p>The presentations were awesome. It&#39;s a lot of fun to see the sheer variety of
things that people are working on.</p>
<h2 id="that-s-all-for-now">That&#39;s all for now</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading. These posts will probably continue to lose structure over
time. It&#39;s a lot of fun to write about random thoughts that I&#39;ve been having
even if they&#39;re not quite fully baked.</p>
