    <h1>Inside a Ferroelectric RAM Chip</h1>

<p>Ferroelectric memory (FRAM) is an interesting storage technique that stores bits in a special &#34;ferroelectric&#34; material.
Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile like flash memory, able to hold its data for decades.
But, unlike flash, ferroelectric memory can write data rapidly.
Moreover, FRAM is much more durable than flash and can be be written trillions of times. 
With these advantages, you might wonder why FRAM isn&#39;t more popular.
The problem is that FRAM is much more expensive than flash, so it is only used in niche applications.</p>

<p>This post takes a look inside an FRAM chip from 1999, designed by a company called Ramtron.
The die photo above shows this 64-kilobit chip under a microscope; the four large dark stripes are the memory cells, containing tiny cubes
of ferroelectric material.
The horizontal greenish bands are the drivers to select a column of memory, while the vertical greenish band 
at the right holds the sense amplifiers that amplify the tiny signals from the memory cells.
The eight whitish squares around the border of the die are the bond pads, which are connected to the chip&#39;s eight pins.<span id="fnref:package"><a href="#fn:package">1</a></span>
The logic circuitry at the left and right of the die implements the serial (I<sup>2</sup>C) interface for communication
with the chip.<span id="fnref:block-diagram"><a href="#fn:block-diagram">2</a></span></p>
<p>The history of ferroelectric memory dates back to the early 1950s.<span id="fnref:ire"><a href="#fn:ire">3</a></span>
Many companies worked on FRAM from the 1950s to the 1970s, including Bell Labs,
IBM, RCA, and Ford.
The 1955 photo below shows a 256-bit ferroelectric memory built by Bell Labs.
Unfortunately, ferroelectric memory had many problems,<span id="fnref:litton"><a href="#fn:litton">4</a></span> limiting it to specialized applications, and development
was mostly abandoned by the 1970s.</p>

<p>Ferroelectric memory had a second chance, though.
A major proponent of ferroelectric memory was George Rohrer, who started working on ferroelectric memory in 1968.
He formed a memory company, Technovation, which was unsuccessful,
and then cofounded Ramtron in 1984.<span id="fnref:rohrer"><a href="#fn:rohrer">5</a></span>
Ramtron produced a tiny 
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/663665">256-bit memory chip</a> in 1988,
followed by much larger memories in the 1990s.</p>
<h2>How FRAM works</h2>
<p>Ferroelectric memory uses a special material with the property of ferroelectricity.
In a normal capacitor, applying an electric field causes the positive and negative charges to separate in the dielectric
material, making it polarized.
However, ferroelectric materials are special because they will retain this polarization even when the electric field is removed.
By polarizing a ferroelectric material positively or negatively, a bit of data can be stored.
(The name &#34;ferroelectric&#34; is in analogy to &#34;ferromagnetic&#34;, even though ferroelectric materials are not ferrous.)</p>
<p>This FRAM chip uses a ferroelectric material called lead zirconate titanate or PZT, containing
lead, zirconium, titanium, and oxygen.
The diagram below shows how an applied electric field causes the titanium or zirconium atom to physically move inside the crystal lattice,
causing the ferroelectric effect.
(Red atoms are lead, purple are oxygen, and yellow are
zirconium or titanium.)
Because the atoms physically change position, the polarization is stable for decades; in contrast, the capacitors in a
DRAM chip lose their data in milliseconds unless refreshed.
FRAM memory will eventually wear out, but it can be written trillions of times, much more than flash or EEPROM memory.</p>

<p>To store data, FRAM uses ferroelectric capacitors, capacitors with a ferroelectric material as the dielectric between the plates.
Applying a voltage to the capacitor will create an electric field, polarizing the ferroelectric material. A positive voltage
will store a 1, and a negative voltage will store a 0.</p>
<p>Reading a bit from memory is a bit tricky. A positive voltage is applied, forcing the material into the 1 state.
If the material was already in the 1 state, minimal current will flow. But if the material was in the 0 state, more
current will flow as the capacitor changes state.
This allows the 0 and 1 states to be distinguished.</p>
<p>Note that reading the bit destroys the stored value. Thus, after a read, the 0 or 1 value must be written back to
the capacitor to restore its previous state. (This is very similar to the magnetic core memory that was used in the 1960s.)<span id="fnref:core"><a href="#fn:core">6</a></span></p>
<p>The FRAM chip that I examined uses two capacitors per bit, storing opposite values.
This approach makes it easier to distinguish a 1 from a 0: a sense amplifier compares the two tiny signals
and generates a 1 or a 0 depending on which is larger.
The downside of this approach is that using two capacitors per bit reduces the memory capacity. Later FRAMs increased
the density by using one capacitor per bit, along with reference cells for comparison.<span id="fnref:reference"><a href="#fn:reference">7</a></span></p>
<h2>A closer look at the die</h2>
<p>The diagram below shows the main functional blocks of the chip.<span id="fnref:patent"><a href="#fn:patent">8</a></span> The memory itself is partitioned into four blocks.
The word line decoders select the appropriate column for the address and the drivers generate the pulses on the word
and plate lines.
The signals from that column go to the sense amplifiers on the right, where the signals are converted to bits and
written back to memory.
On the left, the precharge circuitry charges the bit lines to a fixed voltage at the start of the memory cycle, while
the decoders select the desired byte from the bit lines.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The die with the main functional blocks labeled." height="395" src="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/die-labeled-w600.jpg" title="The die with the main functional blocks labeled." width="600"/></a></p><p>The die with the main functional blocks labeled.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a closeup of the memory. I removed the top metal layer and many of the memory cells to reveal the
underlying structure.
The structure is very three-dimensional compared to regular chips; the gray squares in the image are cubes of PZT, sitting on top of the plate lines.
The brown rectangles labeled &#34;top plate connection&#34; are also three-dimensional; they are S-shaped brackets with the
low end attached to the silicon and the high end contacting the top of the PZT cube.
Thus, each PZT cube forms a capacitor with the plate line forming the bottom plate of the capacitor, the bracket forming the
top plate connection, and the PZT cube sandwiched in between, providing the ferroelectric dielectric.
(Some cubes have been knocked loose in this photo and are sitting at an angle; the cubes form a regular grid in the original chip.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/memory-closeup.jpg"><img alt="Structure of the memory. The image is focus-stacked for clarity." height="461" src="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/memory-closeup-w500.jpg" title="Structure of the memory. The image is focus-stacked for clarity." width="500"/></a></p><p>Structure of the memory. The image is focus-stacked for clarity.</p>
<p>The physical design of the chip is complicated and quite different from a typical planar integrated circuit.
Each capacitor requires a cube of PZT sandwiched between platinum electrodes, with the three-dimensional contact from
the top of the capacitor to the silicon.
Creating these structures requires numerous steps that aren&#39;t used in normal integrated circuit fabrication.
(See the footnote<span id="fnref:process-flow"><a href="#fn:process-flow">9</a></span> for details.)
Moreover, the metal ions in the PZT material can contaminate the silicon production facility unless great care is taken, such
as using a separate facility to apply the ferroelectric layer and all subsequent steps.<span id="fnref:science"><a href="#fn:science">10</a></span>
The additional fabrication steps and unusual materials significantly increase the cost of manufacturing FRAM.</p>
<p>Each top plate connection has an associated transistor, gated by a vertical word line.<span id="fnref:transistors"><a href="#fn:transistors">11</a></span> The transistors are connected to
horizontal bit lines, metal lines that were removed for this photo.
A memory cell, containing two capacitors, measures about 4.2 µm × 6.5 µm.
The PZT cubes are spaced about 2.1 µm apart.
The transistor gate length is roughly 700 nm. The <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/700_nm_lithography_process">700 nm node</a> was
introduced in 1993, while the die contains a 1999 copyright date, so the chip appears to be a few years behind the cutting
edge as far as node.</p>
<p>The memory is organized as 256 capacitors horizontally by 512 capacitors vertically, for a total of 64 kilobits
(since each bit requires two capacitors).  The memory is accessed as 8192 bytes.
Curiously, the columns are numbered on the die, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/top-numbers.jpg"><img alt="With the metal removed, the numbers are visible counting the columns." height="277" src="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/top-numbers-w500.jpg" title="With the metal removed, the numbers are visible counting the columns." width="500"/></a></p><p>With the metal removed, the numbers are visible counting the columns.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the sense amplifiers to the right of the memory, with some large transistors to boost the signal.
Each sense amplifier receives two signals from the pair of capacitors holding a bit.
The sense amplifier determines which signal is larger, deciding if the bit is a 0 or 1.
Because the signals are very small, the sense amplifier must be very sensitive.
The amplifier has two cross-connected transistors with each transistor trying to pull the other signal low.
The signal that starts off larger will &#34;win&#34;, creating a solid 0 or 1 signal. 
This value is rewritten to memory to restore the value, since reading the value erases the cells.
In the photo, a few of the ferroelectric capacitors are visible at the far left.
Part of the lower metal layer has come loose, causing the randomly strewn brown rectangles.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/sense-amps.jpg"><img alt="The sense amplifiers." height="164" src="https://static.righto.com/images/fm24c64/sense-amps-w500.jpg" title="The sense amplifiers." width="500"/></a></p><p>The sense amplifiers.</p>
<p>The photo below shows eight of the plate drivers, below the memory cells.
This circuit generates the pulse on the selected plate line.
The plate lines are the thick white lines at the top of the image; they are platinum so they appear brighter in the photo
than the other metal lines.
Most of the capacitors are still present on the plate lines, but some capacitors have come loose and are scattered
on the rest of the circuitry.
Each plate line is connected to a metal line (brown), which connects the plate line to the drive transistors in the middle and bottom
of the image.
These transistors pull the appropriate plate line high or low as necessary.
The columns of small black circles are connections between the metal line and the silicon of the transistor underneath.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Ferroelectric RAM is an example of a technology with many advantages that never achieved the hoped-for success.
Many companies worked on FRAM from the 1950s to the 1970s but gave up on it.
Ramtron tried again and produced products but they were not profitable.
Ramtron had <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/mannerisms/delusions/ramtron-bagged-up-by-cypress-2012-09/">hoped</a> that the density and cost of FRAM would be competitive with DRAM, but unfortunately that didn&#39;t pan out.
Ramtron was acquired by Cypress Semiconductor in 2012 and then Cypress was acquired by Infineon in 2019.
Infineon still <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/memories/f-ram-ferroelectric-ram/excelon-f-ram/">sells</a> FRAM, but it is a niche product, for instance satellites that need <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/1and2MbFRAM/">radiation hardness</a>.
Currently, FRAM costs roughly $3/megabit, almost three orders of magnitude more expensive than flash memory, which is
about $15/gigabit.
Nonetheless, FRAM is a fascinating technology and the structures inside the chip are very interesting.</p>
