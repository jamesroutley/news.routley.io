<p><em>Last Updated: October 2022</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript is the lifeblood of the modern web application</strong>.
You need it to do anything remotely complex on the web.</p>
<p>And these days, if you want a <em>modern</em>, <em>responsive</em>, <em>interactive</em> application—and who doesn&#39;t?—your 
front-end codebase may end up as large and complex as your back end.</p>
<p>In the last decade, an entire ecosystem of tooling and frameworks has sprung up to combat the complexities of big
JavaScript codebases.
Tools like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a>.
Frameworks like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, 
and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.
And changes to the language itself, including <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp">ES6</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>.</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
</code></pre>
<figcaption>Is this JavaScript? It is <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html" target="_blank">according to Facebook</a>...</figcaption>

<p>At the same time, a competing set of low- or no-JavaScript tools have emerged.
Lightweight frameworks like <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a> and <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> allow
you to leverage the power of JavaScript without having to write much of it yourself!</p>
<p>Sadly, for many <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> developers, <strong>the modern JavaScript ecosystem is intimidating.</strong>
The tools feel complex. 
There are often several ways to achieve the same goals.
It&#39;s hard to choose a framework—and then once you do, it&#39;s hard to know exactly <em>how</em> to integrate it into a Django project.</p>
<p>The result is confusion and frustration—and sometimes even a general grumpiness about JavaScript itself.
Python makes sense. Django makes sense.
JavaScript?
JavaScript is to be <em>tolerated</em>. Not enjoyed.</p>
<p>If this sounds like you, then you&#39;ve found the right place!
<strong>This guide aims to remove those barriers and provide a <em>clear, frustration-free way of doing modern JavaScript development with Django.</em></strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s the guide I wish I had when I first started bringing React—and later Vue, Sass, HTMX and other front-end technologies—into
my own Django projects.
It contains the knowledge I&#39;ve accrued from 10+ years of working on Django projects big and small. </p>
<p>People who will get the most value from this guide are people like me:
<em>Django developers getting up to speed on the latest in the JavaScript world.</em>
That said, any web developer looking to brush up on modern JavaScript should benefit from the early parts.</p>
<p>The guide is broad in scope and so it&#39;s broken into several parts.
Parts 1-4 are best read together, but Part 5 can be read on its own—and if you know you
don&#39;t want to use JavaScript you should start there!</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 covers our big-picture setup</strong>.
We&#39;ll discuss two common ways of organizing front-end code in a Django project—which we&#39;ll call <em>server-first</em>, and <em>client-first</em>.
Then we&#39;ll outline why neither of these are perfect, and learn how a <em>hybrid architecture</em> can help provide
us with the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>In Part 2 we&#39;ll shift gears to the fundamentals of modern JavaScript tooling</strong>.
The aim here is to demystify terms like &#34;yarn&#34;, &#34;webpack&#34; and &#34;babel&#34;.
We&#39;re not trying to present the entire JavaScript ecosystem—that would be impossible 
(not to mention out of date the moment it was published)—but instead provide enough practical knowledge
to make good choices and understand Parts 3 and 4.</p>

In case you hadn&#39;t noticed, things have gotten complicated in the JavaScript world in the decade since
Django 1.0 was released. 
</figcaption>

<p><strong>In Part 3 we&#39;ll start putting things together—setting up a JavaScript build pipeline inside a Django project.</strong>
We&#39;ll use the information we learned in Part 2 to start building out the hybrid architecture from Part 1,
and go through a few &#34;hello world&#34; examples in Django using React and Vue.</p>
<p><strong>In Part 4 we&#39;ll cover the real-world scenario of building hybrid React app in a Django project.</strong>
We&#39;ll discuss many of the common issues that come up and offer patterns and code that help address them.
<strong>And in Part 6,  dive deeper into working with APIs in your front end using modern standards
like OpenAPI,</strong> filling in some gaps left in Part 4.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, in Part 5, we throw everything out the window and talk about when you might not need JavaScript at all.</strong>
We&#39;ll cover two of the most popular low-JavaScript frameworks out there: Alpine.js and HTMX—and you&#39;ll learn
how you can use them to build modern websites in a Django project without writing JavaScript at all.</p>
