<p>The FBI has been unable to access a Washington Post reporter’s seized iPhone because it was in Lockdown Mode, a sometimes overlooked feature that makes iPhones broadly more secure, according to recently filed court records.</p><p>The court record shows what devices and data the FBI was able to ultimately access, and which devices it could not, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/fbi-raid-washington-post-hannah-natanson?ref=404media.co"><u>raiding the home of the reporter</u></a>, Hannah Natanson, in January as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about phone unlocking technology?
