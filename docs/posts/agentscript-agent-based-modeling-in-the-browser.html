      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>In Agentscript, you fill a world with three ingredients: turtles, patches, and links.</p>

      <p>Your program describes the behavior of each of these actors and how they interact with each other. Let&#39;s see an example.</p>
      
      <h2>Turtles</h2>

      <div>
        <p>Here&#39;s an empty world to start out with:</p>
        
        
      </div>
      
      <p>First things first, let&#39;s make a turtle:</p>
      <p>model.turtles.create(1)</p>
      
      <p>Click the &#34;run once&#34; button to execute that code once.</p>
      <p>You&#39;ll see a turtle appear in the center of the world. It has the shape of a chevron.</p>

      <p>This tutorial assumes you have a little familiarity with javascript. If you have never seen javascript before, or if you want a refresher, try out this interactive tutorial: <a href="https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/" target="_blank">Javascript in 14 Minutes</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Now that we have a turtle, we can ask it do something, like move forward:</p>
      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
})</p>

      <p>If you are familiar with javascript, it may help to know that <code>turtles.ask()</code> has the same meaning as <code>turtles.forEach()</code>.</p>

      <p>If you keep telling a turtle to move forward, it will eventually hit the edge of the world and wrap around to the other side!</p>

      <p>We can also ask turtles to rotate:</p>
      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.rotate(45)
})</p>

      <p>Or both — move forward and rotate:</p>
      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.rotate(25)
})</p>

      <p>Try changing one of the numbers in the above code so that the turtle makes smaller steps, or bigger turns.</p>

      <p>Instead of working one step at a time, things get really interesting when you run a behavior over and over again.</p>

      <p>I added a &#34;run forever&#34; button to the code snippet above. Try it out!</p>

      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.rotate(25)
})</p>

      <p>How about a little randomness? Here&#39;s the same code, as before, but this time using <code>util.randomInt()</code> to pick a random angle to turn to the right and to the left. The result is turtles that wander randomly around the world:</p>

      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.right(util.randomInt(25))
  turtle.left(util.randomInt(25))
})</p>

      <p>If you haven&#39;t already, try adding a bunch more turtles!</p>
      
      <p>model.turtles.create(10)</p>

      <h2>Patches</h2>

      <p>The world where the turtles live and move is divided up into a bunch of small squares called patches.</p>

      <p>A turtle always knows what patch it&#39;s on — this is stored in <code>turtle.patch</code>.</p>

      <p>Right now, all the patches are black, which is why the world behind the turtles looks like a big black square.</p>

      <p>Let&#39;s pretend like our turtles are ants, and they are dropping chemical pheromones everywhere they walk (this is in fact how ants communicate!)</p>

      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.right(util.randomInt(25))
  turtle.left(util.randomInt(25))
  turtle.patch.pheromone += 10
})
</p>

      <p>The landscape is now filling up with pheromones!</p>

      <p>I set up the patches ahead of time so that their color depends on how much pheromone they have. This is the color scale I&#39;m using:</p>

      <p>myColorMap = ColorMap.gradientColorMap(
  8, [&#39;black&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;]
)</p>

      <p>Try changing the number or names of the colors in the code block above.</p>

      <p>The size and number of patches that make up the world can also be configured — we&#39;ll look at how to edit that later.</p>

      <p>Now let&#39;s make the pheromone evaporate over time:</p>

      <p>model.turtles.ask(turtle =&gt; {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.right(util.randomInt(25))
  turtle.left(util.randomInt(25))
  turtle.patch.pheromone += 10
})

model.patches.ask(patch =&gt; {
  patch.pheromone *= 0.99
})
</p>

      <p>This is fun, but we&#39;re running out of room in these little code blocks. It&#39;s time for the real deal.</p>
