    <h1>Making things is deep magick</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>You know what rocks? </span><em>Making things</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>From a sort of “spiritual fulfilment” perspective, I think the </span><em>thing</em><span> is probably less important than the </span><em>making</em><span>. Making things converts the raw resources of life — time, energy, thus food, water, the heat of the Sun, fresh tears in your very muscle fibres — into a manifestation of your will. Heady stuff.</span></p><p>I’m at something of a career crossroads, having spent most of a decade being a data person, and having more recently realized that the work I find most fulfilling is creative. I like it so much, maybe I want to change career to do more making and less data-ing.</p><p><span>To that end, I recently spent three months making software as a participant in </span><strong><a href="http://recurse.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Recurse Center</a></strong><span>. I focussed mostly on front end, using the Svelte framework. Some things I made:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://standard.dev/emotinomicon" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">An app for internal navigation</a></strong><span>, which uses large language models, and a combobox that was tortuous to implement.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://standard.dev/binary-metrics" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A small tool for understanding binary classifier performance</a></strong><span>, which is a kind of exploration of a bigger idea I’m toying with.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://standard.dev/bars" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A bar chart maker</a></strong><span>, which I built for a workshop I gave on Svelte.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://standard.dev/life-with-ghosts" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A game of life, with ghosts</a></strong><span>, which was just a fun noodle.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In the course of spending a couple of months doing mostly front end, I learned that I definitely </span><em>do not</em><span> want to pivot my career into being the kind of developer whose work is a procession of tickets to turn someone else’s Figma file into a working site.</span></p><p><span>On the flip side, I </span><em>very much</em><span> affirmed my desire to make things humans can use. I created things, and put them on the internet, and now you can use them. That’s </span><strong>power</strong><span>, right there. A couple of people told me they actually used the </span><strong><a href="https://standard.dev/emotinomicon" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Emotinomicon</a></strong><span> — something I had conceived of as a fun toy — as a real tool. Extremely cool.</span></p><p><span>Making things is deep magick. There’s an evolutionary thread from my being to the collective primordial soul of humanity, and making things plucks at it.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
