    <h1>Ubuntu 25.10 Raises RISC-V Profile Requirements</h1>

<p><strong>Canonical is bullish in promoting Ubuntu for RISC-V devices, be it enthusiast-orientated hardware like<SPAN color="#333333"> </SPAN><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/08/dc-doma-pad-ii-risc-v-tablet-runs-ubuntu">DeepComputing’s RISC-V tablet</a>, single-board computers, or embedded equipment.</strong></p>






<p>But with a new long-term support (LTS) release looming, it’s rethinking the kind of RISC-V hardware it wants to support going forward.</p>



<p>A recent bug report filed against Ubuntu’s upgrading tool confirmed a major change with regards to the RISC-V requirements for the upcoming Ubuntu 25.10 release — most existing RISC-V devices will <span>not</span> be able to run Ubuntu 25.10.</p>



<p>How come?</p>



<h2>A New Baseline for RISC-V</h2>



<p>Ubuntu 25.10 plans to bumps its baseline RISC-V profile (RVA) from RVA20 to RVA23. It may sound like a small jump but it has a big impact since the bulk of RISC-V devices currently sold don’t support it.</p>



<p>An RVA (RISC-V Application) profile is a specification that outlines the vector processing capabilities a RISC-V system must have, so <em>“software can rely on the existence of a certain set of […] features in a particular generation of RISC-V implementations”.</em></p>



<p>That’s according to RISC-V International, the main collaborative group steering and overseeing development of this open source and royalty free processor architecture.</p>



<p><em>“RISC-V was designed to provide a highly modular and extensible instruction set (ISA) and includes a large and growing set of standard extensions, where each standard extension is a bundle of instruction-set features,”</em> RISC-V International explains.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/riscv-news/2024/10/risc-v-announces-ratification-of-the-rva23-profile-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RVA23 profile</a> makes a number of ‘extensions’ mandatory, notably <strong>Vector and Hypervisor extensions</strong> to power<em> “math-intensive workloads including AI/ML &amp; cryptography, and enterprise hardware, operating systems and software workloads</em>.”</p>



<p><a href="https://research.samsung.com/blog/RISC-V-and-Vectorization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Per Samsung</a>, the RISC-V ‘V’ Vector extension <em>“allows CPUs to perform many operations simultaneously, making them faster and more efficient”</em>. With RVA23 RISC-V reaches a clear feature parity level with ARMv9 and x86-64v4.</p>



<p>It is (naturally) more involved than that. Plenty of <a href="https://fprox.substack.com/p/risc-v-vector-extension-in-a-nutshell-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep-dives on RISC-V Vector extensions</a> are available online if you find yourself curious about the computational underpinnings and future opportunities they stand to provide.</p>



<h2>Impact on Existing Hardware</h2>



<p><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bug/2111715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to an open issue on Launchpad</a>, the <em>“ubuntu-release-upgrader should stop upgrades beyond Ubuntu 24.04 on hardware that does not support the RVA23U64 profile”</em>, noting that <em>“RVA23U64 is the profile relevant for user space”</em>.</p>



<p>Support for earlier versions of Ubuntu on existing RISC-V hadn’t isn’t impacted, but this change does mean that Ubuntu 25.10 (and later) will not run on <em>most</em> existing RISC-V hardware (like the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-RV2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange Pi RV2</a>) since they lack the extensions the RVA23 profile requires.</p>



<p>Will that really be an issue long-term? </p>



<p>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is supported until 2029 at the earliest and will continue to work on existing hardware, so that’s covered. RISC-V usage remains niche so the impact from Ubuntu ‘raising the bar’ on baseline  profile requirements won’t be huge.</p>



<p>What could be huge is the benefit to Ubuntu going forward.</p>



<p>Focusing future Ubuntu support to devices that have more capable RISC-V profile sets will further position the distro as the <em>de-facto</em> OS on the platform. As workload demands increase, and RISC-V hardware becomes more capable and affordable, the opportunities are obvious.</p>



<p>Admittedly there is one big rub: the range of RISC-V devices with RVA23 support is, at the time or writing this, near non-existent. That will change in the coming year, and by the release of Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, the distro will be primed to take full advantage.</p>
