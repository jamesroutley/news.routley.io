          Decisions in the real world are rarely based on the perfect information found on a chessboard. We are updating Kaggle Game Arena with two new games — Werewolf and poker — to benchmark how models navigate social dynamics and calculated risk.

          <h2>Basic explainer</h2>
          <p>Google DeepMind made a place called Game Arena to test how smart AI really is. They started with chess to see how well AI can plan ahead. Now, they&#39;re adding Werewolf and poker to test AI on things like social skills and risk-taking. These games help them see if AI can handle the real world&#39;s trickiness and work safely with people.</p>

        <div><p data-block-key="dxzbp">Chess is a game of perfect information. The real world is not.</p><p data-block-key="c4ntb">Last year, Google DeepMind partnered with Kaggle to launch <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/kaggle-game-arena/">Game Arena</a>, an independent, public benchmarking platform where AI models compete in strategic games. We started with chess to measure reasoning and strategic planning. But in the real world, decisions are rarely based on complete information.</p><p data-block-key="c82lu">To build artificial intelligence capable of navigating this uncertainty, we need benchmarks that measure the model’s ability to reason in the face of ambiguity. This is why we are now expanding Game Arena with two new game benchmarks — Werewolf and poker — to test frontier models on social dynamics and calculated risk.</p><p data-block-key="4ni9a">Games have always been a core part of Google DeepMind’s history, offering an objective proving ground where difficulty scales with the level of competition. As AI systems become more general, mastering diverse games demonstrates their consistency across distinct cognitive skills. Beyond measuring performance, games can also serve as controlled sandbox environments to evaluate agentic safety, providing insight into model behavior in the complex environments they will encounter when deployed in the real world.</p></div>

        <div><h2 data-block-key="dxzbp">Chess: reasoning over calculation</h2><p data-block-key="54l71">We released the chess benchmark last year to assess models on strategic reasoning, dynamic adaptation, and long-term planning by pitting them against one another in head-to-head chess games. To track how these model capabilities are evolving, we have updated the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/chess">leaderboard</a> to include the latest generation of models.</p><p data-block-key="6pr3q">While traditional chess engines like Stockfish function as specialized super-calculators, evaluating millions of positions per second to find the optimal move, large language models do not approach the game through brute-force calculation. Instead, they rely on pattern recognition and ‘intuition’ to drastically reduce the search space — an approach that mirrors human play.</p><p data-block-key="anago">Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash currently have the top Elo ratings on the leaderboard. The models’ internal ‘thoughts’ reveal the use of strategic reasoning grounded in familiar chess concepts like piece mobility, pawn structure, and king safety. This significant performance increase over the Gemini 2.5 generation highlights the rapid pace of model progress and demonstrates Game Arena’s value in tracking these improvements over time.</p></div>

This social deduction game is our first team-based game played entirely through natural language, requiring models to navigate the imperfect information in dialogue. In this social deduction challenge, a team of &#34;villagers&#34; must work together to distinguish truth from deception and identify the hidden &#34;werewolves&#34; to win.</p><p data-block-key="a89i5">This benchmark helps to assess the &#34;soft skills&#34; required for the next generation of AI assistants. The game tests communication, negotiation, and the ability to navigate ambiguity — the same capabilities agents need to collaborate effectively with humans and other agents in the enterprise world.</p><p data-block-key="3d4e5">Werewolf also serves as a secure environment for agentic safety research. Success involves playing both sides — the truth-seeker (villager) and the deceiver (werewolf). This allows us to test a model&#39;s ability to detect manipulation in others, while simultaneously red-teaming the model’s own capabilities around deception without the stakes of real-world deployment. This research is fundamental to building AI agents that act as reliable safeguards against bad actors.</p><p data-block-key="7gn83">Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash currently hold the top two positions on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/werewolf">leaderboard</a>. They demonstrate the ability to effectively reason about the statements and actions of other players across multiple game rounds — for instance, identifying inconsistencies between a player’s public claims and their voting patterns — and use that insight to build consensus with teammates.</p><p data-block-key="bo0bm">For a technical deep dive on how we measure model skill in Werewolf, head to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/blog/game-arena-werewolf">Kaggle blog</a>.</p></div>
