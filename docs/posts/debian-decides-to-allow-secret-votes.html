The Debian project has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/886403/">voting on a general
resolution</a> that would allow secret voting on future issues.  The <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-vote/E1nYGKI-0002U2-1v@vento.debian.org/">results have

Developers casting a particular vote and allow verification&#34;.  One might
think that closes the discussion, but Debian project leader candidate Felix
Lechner is <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-vote/874k3jcnen.fsf@lechner-desktop.us-core.com/">questioning
the election</a> and calling for it to be redone â€” something that the
Debian constitution lacks provisions for.</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->
