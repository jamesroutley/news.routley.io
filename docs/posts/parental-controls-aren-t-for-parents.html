    <p>
      A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old 
      son on his &#34;kid-safe&#34; Gabb phone. The man got my son&#39;s number through a 
      children&#39;s book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I 
      discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but 
      still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our 
      family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting 
      my son: &#34;What did you get? Send pictures.&#34;
    </p>

    <p>
      How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait . . . hadn&#39;t we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the 
      &#34;kid-safe&#34; phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/app-guide/">Gabb &#34;approved apps&#34; list</a>, which, 
      as I understand it, offers &#34;no social media or high-risk options.&#34; We 
      did the safe things, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe not. Turns out Gabb&#39;s own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/blog/dangerous-chat-features/">seven apps with 
        dangerous chat features</a>, describing it as an app that &#34;opens the 
        door to potential dangers.&#34; We were apparently supposed to find that 
        warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb&#39;s 572 blog posts:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE &#39;https://gabb\.com/blog/[^&lt;]+&#39; \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo &#34;{} blog posts as of $(date &#39;+%B %d, %Y&#39;)&#34;

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      But if GroupMe &#34;opens the door&#34; to danger, why did Gabb put it on their &#34;approved 
      apps&#34; list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath 
      GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with 
      my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: &#34;Allows contact and communication with 
      people the child may not know.&#34;
    </p>

    <p>
      So it allows communication with strangers, but it&#39;s not &#34;high-risk?&#34; The 
      approved list isn&#39;t looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a 
      catalog of risks I&#39;m supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps 
      and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s &#34;https://gabb.com/app-guide/&#34; \
    | grep -o &#34;${cat} = \[.*\]&#34; \
    | head -1 \
    | sed &#34;s/${cat} = \[//&#34; \
    | sed &#34;s/\]//&#34; \
    | tr &#39;,&#39; &#39;\n&#39; \
    | sed &#34;s/&#39;//g&#34; \
    | sed &#39;s/^ *//&#39; \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d &#39; &#39;)
  echo &#34;$count $cat&#34;
done &amp;&amp; echo &#34;...as of $(date &#39;+%B %d, %Y&#39;)&#34;

60 unapproved_apps

    <p>
      Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don&#39;t feel in control.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Gabb isn&#39;t alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies 
      selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver 
      complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.
    </p>


    <p>
      Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To 
      set it up, I had to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Connect the console to the internet</li>
      <li>Download the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app to my phone</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for myself</li>
      <li>Link my credit card and be charged $0.50 to verify parental consent</li>
      <li>Set up parental controls from the app on my phone</li>
      <li>Sync the parental controls app to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Set up a security PIN on the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for my son</li>
      <li>Sync my son&#39;s Nintendo Account to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Discover that half the controls live in the phone app and the other 
        half live on Nintendo&#39;s website, because of course they do</li>
      <li>Log into Nintendo&#39;s website to finish the job . . . </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Only to discover that there&#39;s no clear option to block internet access, 
      no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy 
      way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a 
      kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that&#39;s just nostalgia talking. 
      Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler 
      on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:
    </p>

    <ol start="12">
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for myself</li>
      <li>Create an email address for my son</li>
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for my son</li>
      <li>Set up a gamertag for my son on account.xbox.com</li>
      <li>Configure parental controls in Microsoft Family Safety</li>
      <li>Configure more parental controls on xbox.com</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone
      includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, 
      friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I finally—<em>finally</em>—tried to test online play, Minecraft 
      told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say 
      which) <em>and</em> create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a 
      <em>membership</em>) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to 
      the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit 
      to zero, sure. But I can&#39;t block free downloads. So to let my son play 
      online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content 
      I can&#39;t possibly evaluate. That&#39;s the deal. Take it or leave it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a 
      conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and 
      cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a &#34;customer 
      journey.&#34; And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You&#39;re 
      supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just 
      cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental 
      controls you don&#39;t really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. 
      You become the ideal customer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I didn&#39;t cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, 
      I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite 
      vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down
      over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED
      display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering
      across the floor. My son&#39;s face. My wife&#39;s face. The stunned silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not break the Switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I did was announce, in a voice louder than 
      necessary, that <em>nobody</em> was to ask me about anything 
      Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My 
      son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, 
      developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn&#39;t appear to 
      involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here&#39;s what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says &#34;this 
      child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or 
      download anything without my explicit permission.&#34; Instead I get a 
      maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I&#39;m at fault for a
      tooltip I didn&#39;t hover over, a blog post I didn&#39;t read, a submenu I didn&#39;t 
      find. Maybe that&#39;s by design. Maybe it&#39;s neglect. I don&#39;t know.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his
      friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those 
      two things, I&#39;m supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental 
      control schemes of Gabb, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Xbox, while a stranger&#39;s 
      Christmas morning texts sit in my son&#39;s phone history.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Parental controls shouldn&#39;t be this hard.
