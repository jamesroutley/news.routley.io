		      <p>May 01, 2022</p><p>Nine years ago I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">&#34;If I made another Monkey Island&#34;</a> and it feels like there are some things I need to say.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember the exact incident, but the day I wrote that I was feeling down about never being able to make another Monkey Island.  I wrote it in a single afternoon, and it was not much more than a stream of thoughts. In the movie version, tears would have been pouring down my cheeks, but it wasn&#39;t the movie version so I was probably sipping coffee and eating a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
<p>My point is these were not commandments handed down and etched in stone on a giant tablet. They were just random thoughts about a (then very unlikely) new Monkey Island game. </p>
<p>None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody.</p>
<p>People talk a lot about Monkey Island 3a as if it was the game I would have made after Monkey Island 2 had I stayed at Lucasfilm.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the deal.</p>
<p>The totality of that idea was &#34;Guybrush chases the demon pirate LeChuck to hell and Stan is there.&#34;  That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all it was. </p>
<p>Games, movies, and books don&#39;t come out fully formed.  They start as a morsel of an idea and then all the hard work begins.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert had a great quote that I am constantly reminding myself of: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The muse visits during the act of creation, not before.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had I stayed at Lucasfilm I might have started with that idea, but by the time the game was done it would have been something completely different and better.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what Return to Monkey Island is.  </p>
<p>When Dave and I first got together to talk about Return to Monkey Island we had a nearly blank slate. We talked over ideas we&#39;d had over the years including one of mine where Guybrush wakes up 3000 years in the future on a snowball Earth.</p>
<p>We talked about my original &#34;hell&#34; idea but other Monkey Island games had already done much of that (by pure coincidence) and there was little point in rehashing it.</p>
<p>The one thing I wanted to do was start the new game right where LeChuck&#39;s Revenge ended, and that became the one unmovable stone.</p>
<p>I have made one pixel art game in my entire career and that was Thimbleweed Park.  Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&#39;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-the-art tech and art. Monkey Island 1 was 16 color EGA and we jumped at the chance to upgrade it to 256 colors.  Monkey Island 2 featured the magical wizardry of scanned art by Peter Chan and Steve Purcell and we lusted to keep pushing everything forward.  </p>
<p>If I had stayed and done Monkey Island 3 it wouldn&#39;t have looked like Monkey Island 2. We would have kept pushing forward, and Day of the Tentacle is a good example of that.</p>
<p>I never liked the art in DotT.  Technically and artistically it was fantastic, but I never liked the wacky Chuck Jones style.  But that was Dave and Tim&#39;s game, not mine. They can do what they want and I completely supported that.</p>
<p>Curse of Monkey Island also took a leap forward. It introduced us to a fully voiced and taller, lankier Guybrush with painted backgrounds that were all the rage in the late 90s.  It was very much a game of its time.</p>
<p>When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn&#39;t feel right. We didn&#39;t want to make a retro game. You can&#39;t read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a &#34;throwback game&#34;.  I didn&#39;t want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it&#39;s interesting, fun, and exciting. It&#39;s what the Monkey Island games have always done.</p>
<p>I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting.  Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it&#39;s beautiful to see, play, and listen to.</p>
<p>The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing.  It&#39;s not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.</p>
<p>Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&#39;s the art style I wanted.</p>
<p>When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn&#39;t let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.</p>
<p>It&#39;s ironic that the people who don&#39;t want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.</p>
<p>Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster.  Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it&#39;s not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.</p>
<p>I hope you&#39;ll jump on with the rest of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">*Seventeen</a> - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don&#39;t want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine. I&#39;d show stuff that excited me or amused me. If you let me do those things, you will love the game. That, I promise.</p></div>
