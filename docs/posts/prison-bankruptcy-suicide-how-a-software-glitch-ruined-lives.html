      After a piece of software incorrectly showed that money had gone missing, a trusted, centuries-old British government corporation used its financial and legal might to convict and bankrupt hundreds of people who ran its branches. Some family members say their loved-ones were left so distressed they took their own lives.

      This could be the plot of a dystopian novel, but it describes the real-life ordeal that scores of the so-called sub-postmasters of the UK Post Office went through between 1999 and 2015. The government — which owns the Post Office — has described the scandal as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history.

      Over two decades, livelihoods and reputations were destroyed, families shattered, and savings lost. Out of thousands of affected sub-postmasters who ran small businesses in communities across Britain, 700 were convicted of criminal offences. Some spent time in prison.

      Jo Hamilton was running a post office in a small village in southern England in 2003 when her Horizon computer started to show a shortfall of £2,000 ($2,500). When she ran the numbers again, she told CNN, that amount “doubled in front of (her) eyes.”

      In the end, Hamilton re-financed her home to pay the non-existent shortfall that — by the time the Post Office had taken her to court in 2007, charging her with theft and false accounting — had ballooned to £36,000 ($45,800).

The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the government will introduce a new law to &#34;swiftly exonerate and compensate victims&#34; of wrongful prosecution of Post Office workers over a 16-year period starting just before the new millennium. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers received criminal convictions, and some were sent to prison, when the faulty Horizon IT system made it appear that money was missing from their sites. To date, 93 of these convictions have been overturned, leaving many others still fighting their convictions or to receive compensation. A recent television docudrama has thrust the issue back in the spotlight.

      “The Horizon system was a piece of machinery and software that wasn’t working correctly,” she said. “(But) it was people that pushed our prosecutions through. It was people that didn’t investigate things. It was people that put us into prison, into our graves, and into illness — for probably the rest of our lives.”

      Ashraf spent the first few weeks of his nine-month sentence in a high-security prison, locked up for 23 hours a day, before being transferred to a lower-security prison. He was released after four months, but spent the next five wearing an electronic tag around his ankle so authorities could monitor his whereabouts.
