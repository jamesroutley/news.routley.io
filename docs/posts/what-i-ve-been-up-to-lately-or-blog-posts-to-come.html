    <h1>What I&#39;ve Been Up To Lately (or, blog posts to come)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of different things in the past few months, and have a
growing pile of not-quite-publishable draft posts about them.</p>
<p>This post is a list of those things, and a promise to myself to write some of
them up! I&#39;ll add links to this post as I publish more.
The list is too long - that&#39;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Topics include:</p>

<p>I did <a href="https://course.fast.ai/" rel="nofollow">this</a> with some folks at the Recurse Center from february to april 2025.
Fascinating stuff, and writing about it would be a great excuse to revisit and
review.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Doing actual ML training and inference is much more approachable than we
have been led to believe. You don&#39;t need an advanced math background, and
there&#39;s a ton you can do without relying on the big commercial models.</p>

<p>I worked through <a href="https://arena-chapter3-llm-evals.streamlit.app/" rel="nofollow">ARENA chapter 3</a>
with some folks at the Recurse Center in May 2025.
We did it as an intensive 4-day project.
(Spoiler: 4 days is not enough, but we did a lot.)</p>
<p>This was my first real stab at learning something practical about
the fascinating and crucial (and much broader) field of AI Safety.
I&#39;d love to do more.</p>
<p>&#34;What are LLM evaluations?&#34; Broadly, a process for measuring the performance and &#34;behavior&#34; of
big AI models. There are lots of kinds of evals, but the focus here was on
evaluating model safety and alignment (ie, do they do things we might consider harmful?).</p>

<p>One or more posts about each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cursor (been using this a lot). It is both great and frustrating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aider. TL;DR: promising, had some UX issues, too easy to spend $$$$$ doing
  basic stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copilot in Emacs: getting it running and quick impressions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People tell me I should try Claude code; haven&#39;t yet.</p>

<p>Updates to my DIY pedal projects as I make progress.</p>
<p>I started to learn the basics of circuit design
and simulation using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" rel="nofollow">KiCad</a>.</p>
<p>Steep learning curve but looks like it does everything I might want.
Including PCB design, which I&#39;ve never tried!</p>

<p>One or more posts about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Biggest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_shaving" rel="nofollow">Yak Shave</a> I&#39;ve ever done:
  my job search automation tools. This is largely an excuse to get good at
  leveraging AI in 3 ways: code using assistive tools; use LLMs to generate
  content and do research; and maybe use a few techniques from the Practical Deep
  Learning course (vast overkill but fun).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job Searching While ADHD.  Notes on how I stay
  organized; probably mostly about my giant interview prep checklist.
  Thoughts on what&#39;s worked for me and what hasn&#39;t.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Revolution revisited: Prince&#39;s first famous band was not just Prince.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Who&#39;s the best little kitty cat?&#34; A very simple song I tossed off. I&#39;ll post it
  when the recording is ready.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hypnotherapy. Thoughts on my experiences so far. I haven&#39;t posted much really
  personal on this blog, I tend to keep it light; unsure how public I want to
  make this.</li>
