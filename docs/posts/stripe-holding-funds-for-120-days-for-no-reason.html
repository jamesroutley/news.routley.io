    <h1>Ask HN: Stripe holding funds for 120 days for no reason</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi Guys--</p><p>I started a Stripe account (even incorporated through them) for a basic graphic design and web design service business.</p><p>I process a few charges and even though I didn&#39;t get a single chargeback or dispute, Stripe decided to deactivate my account and said they would refund all the charges that were processed.</p><p>Which would have been fine with me. They said they would refund on Oct 17, but that date came and past. So I kept emailing.</p><p>Now they&#39;re saying they&#39;re holding all the funds for 120 days because of &#34;elevated risk&#34;.</p><p>Which is insane because they have already withdrawn all the funds, meaning their risk would be zero if they refunded everyone.</p><p>I am beyond hurt and confused as I did need this money for my daughter. These decisions have real impacts on real families.</p><p>What do you do in this scenario? I have tried contacting support at Stripe but seems to be of no help.</p></div></div></div>
