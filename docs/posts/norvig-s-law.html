We all know about Moore&#39;s and Gilder&#39;s laws, that CPU power and
bandwidth will double every 18 and 6 months, respectively. Less
familiar are the more pessimistic laws, such as <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/law.htm">Proebsting&#39;s
law</a>, which states that compiler research has led to a doubling in
computing power every 18 years. 

<p>In July 1999, there was a news article
stating that PC usage had doubled yet again, reaching penetration of
50% of homes.  People were hailing this as yet another sign of the
inevitable climb of technology, but I saw it as a warning sign that
the glass was half empty, and coined the following:

</p><center><div><center></center>

<i>Any technology that surpasses 50% penetration
</i>
</center>
</div></center><p>

To be clear, it all depends on what you count. If you&#39;re counting
units sold, you can double your count by selling everyone 1 unit, then
2, then 4, etc.  (In Finland I understand that cell phone usage is
above 1 per capita, but still growing.)  If you&#39;re counting the total
number of households that own the product, you can double your count
by doubling the population, or by convincing everyone to divorce and
become two households.  But if you&#39;re counting percentage of
people (or households), there&#39;s just no more doubling after you pass 50%.

So the next time you hear about the doubling of another
technology, remember you heard it here first.
