    <h1>Ask HN: Share your AI prompt that stumps every model</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I had an idea for creating a crowdsourced database of AI prompts that no AI model could yet crack (wanted to use some of them as we&#39;re adding new models to Kilo Code).</p><p>I&#39;ve seen a bunch of those prompts scattered across HN, so thought to open a thread here so we can maybe have a centralied location for this.</p><p>Share your prompt that stumps every AI model here.</p></div></div></div>
