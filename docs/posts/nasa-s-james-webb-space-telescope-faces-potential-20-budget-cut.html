<p>The scientists behind NASA&#39;s largest and most powerful space telescope ever built are bracing for potentially crippling budget cuts, and the observatory is only halfway through its primary mission.</p><p>The team overseeing NASA&#39;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/21925-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/21925-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst.html"><u>James Webb Space Telescope</u></a> (JWST) has been directed to prepare for up to 20% in budget cuts that would touch on every aspect of the flagship observatory&#39;s operations, which are managed by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Maryland. The potential cut comes even as the space observatory is more in demand than ever before, with astronomers requesting the equivalent of nine years&#39; worth of Webb observing time in one operational year.</p><p>&#34;NASA is having budget constraints across the entire board, so the institute is being asked to consider a significant — about 20% — cut to our operational budget for the mission starting later this year,&#34; Tom Brown, who leads the Webb mission office at STScI, told a crowd of scientists last month at the 245th American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. &#34;So the impacts of that, if it comes to pass, pretty much cut across the entire mission.&#34;</p><p>NASA&#39;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/nasa-white-house-2025-budget-request" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/nasa-white-house-2025-budget-request"><u>$25.4 billion budget request for 2025</u></a> set aside $317 million to fund the Webb space telescope, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/15892-hubble-space-telescope.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/15892-hubble-space-telescope.html"><u>Hubble Space Telescope</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/18669-chandra-x-ray-observatory.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/18669-chandra-x-ray-observatory.html"><u>Chandra X-ray Observatory</u></a> that together comprise NASA&#39;s currently operational &#34;Great Observatories.&#34; The Hubble Telescope program is facing a potential 20% budget cut of its own, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://spacenews.com/hubble-budget-cuts-could-impact-science-and-mission-operations/" data-url="https://spacenews.com/hubble-budget-cuts-could-impact-science-and-mission-operations/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>according to SpaceNews</u></a>.

It could last at least 20 years or more, NASA officials have said. The mission is an international partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.</p><p>&#34;Frankly, this mission works far better than, really, most folks expected it to, you know,&#34; Brown said during the Webb town hall event on Jan. 15 at the AAS conference. &#34;It&#39;s extremely worrisome that, while we&#39;re in the middle of the prime mission, we&#39;re also maybe looking at significant budget cuts.&#34;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-320-80.png" alt="The galaxy GN-z11 as seen by Hubble (inset) an illustration of a feeding black hole" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQQra7dvnHyLzW64uprJSg.png"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>The James Webb Space Telescope has made mind-boggling discoveriesin its first four years, like this one of the galaxy GN-z11 with the oldest and farthest black hole ever seen. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NMASA, ESA, P.

Its infrared optics have looked deep into the universe&#39;s past, observed distant galaxies and exoplanets, and even peered at our own local solar system planets closer to home.</p><p>&#34;In a nutshell, it is truly fulfilling its promise,&#34; Macarena Garcia Marin, STScI&#39;s Webb project scientist, said during the same town hall event. &#34;Across every field, JWST is truly delivering cutting-edge science.&#34;</p><p>Some of Webb&#39;s budget challenges stem from its operational costs, which were set &#34;idealistically low&#34; in 2011 when the observatory was saved from cancellation. Those costs, coupled with inflation rates that were much higher than expected and less flexibility in NASA&#39;s budget, have also contributed, Brown said.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/news-events/events/2025/_documents/0125-jwst-townhall-mission-status-brown.pdf" data-url="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/news-events/events/2025/_documents/0125-jwst-townhall-mission-status-brown.pdf" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>presentation by Brown</u></a>, a 20% cut to Webb&#39;s operational budget would definitely affect how much science the telescope could perform. The impacts would be felt across teams that review proposals for observing targets, data analysis, observatory efficiencies, and anomaly resolution when something goes wrong, not to mention the need to engage with the scientific community and public on Webb&#39;s science results.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a huge cut. That&#39;s not like kind of trying to nibble away at the edges,&#34; Brown told Space.com. &#34;That impacts everything across the board, all the way up to how many modes we&#39;re offering to the observers.&#34;</p><p>Those impacts, Brown said, would likely be felt for the first time in October, when the next fiscal year begins.</p><p>Brown&#39;s comments at the Webb observatory town hall at AAS came just before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars"><u>inauguration of President Donald Trump</u></a>, who in subsequent weeks created the Department of Government Efficiency headed by SpaceX CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html"><u>Elon Musk</u></a> to reduce government spending.
