    <h1>CM0 – a new Raspberry Pi you can&#39;t buy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-6e56f4f9-98fe-42ea-8923-73f9c82f4a65" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;6e56f4f9-98fe-42ea-8923-73f9c82f4a65&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi CM0"/></p>

<p>This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t get one. Well, not unless you buy the <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>

<p>This little guy doesn&#39;t have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It&#39;s a special version of the &#39;Compute Module&#39; line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi &#39;System on Modules&#39; (SoMs), they&#39;re called.</p>

<p>Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you &#39;plug in&#39; to another board, to give it life.</p>

<p>Compute modules are everywhere, in kiosks, signage, <a href="https://groupsynergy.com/synergy-group-insights/formlabs-raspberry-pi-cm4">3D printers</a>, and even the new <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/move/">Ableton Move</a>. If you just need a little bit of Linux for networking and remote control, these are perfect for that.</p>

<p>And the CM0 is now the smallest version, a little bigger than a postage stamp.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0-back-castellated-edges.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-73b2241d-2728-43ae-9298-c8af8e1767eb" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;73b2241d-2728-43ae-9298-c8af8e1767eb&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi CM0 back - castellated edges"/></p>

<p>But unlike all the other Compute Modules, the CM0 has castellated edges like a Pico. That way, a company integrating this into their product can just pick and place it and solder it onto their main PCB, instead of working with more delicate board-to-board connectors.</p>

<p>But why is this only in China? I&#39;ll get to that, but first I wanted to thank EDAtec for sending a CM0 and their CM0NANO dev board for testing. Without them, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever be able to show these Pis to you.</p>

<h2>ED-CM0NANO</h2>

<p>EDAtec&#39;s CM0NANO seems to be the official IO board for the CM0. It breaks out every feature on the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/processors.html#rp3a0">RP3A0 chip</a> at the heart of the Pi Zero 2 and CM0.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0-edatec-cm0nano.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d1f10f4d-d5e3-4b50-b76d-66f6d620778d" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;d1f10f4d-d5e3-4b50-b76d-66f6d620778d&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="EDAtec CM0NANO with Pi CM0"/></p>

<p>There&#39;s 10/100 Ethernet through a little USB to Ethernet chip (<a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C521278.html">CoreChips SR9900A</a>), two USB 2.0 ports, full-size HDMI, and USB-C for power and flashing the eMMC. Then there are display and camera connectors, GPIO, and a few more headers.</p>

<p>To flash the onboard eMMC, I had to switch the <code>RPI_BOOT_SW</code> switch towards the RTC battery slot, then use <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot">rpiboot</a> to mount it on my Mac. Then I used Raspberry Pi Imager to flash Pi OS 13 on it.</p>

<p>The eMMC on here is <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/98"><em>very</em> slow</a> compared to what I&#39;m used to with the Pi 5 generation, like on the CM5. Its top speed seems to be around 19-20 MB/sec.</p>

<p>Once it&#39;s flashed, it&#39;s a full Linux computer, complete with Raspberry Pi&#39;s desktop environment.</p>

<p>EDAtec has a <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/um/5-installing-os/#_5-3-installing-firmware-package">firmware support package</a> you can install from their package repository, and once that&#39;s done, I did what nobody should do on this small of a computer: fired up Chromium.</p>

<p>Browsing the web on here is almost completely out of the question, since it only has 512 Megs of RAM—which is so little it pops a warning saying Chromium should only be used with 1 GB of more of RAM!</p>

<p>I did try browsing this website, and it took something like a minute to just quit the browser, after I was clicking the X to close the tab over and over again!</p>

<p>But with WiFi, Ethernet, USB, HDMI, and everything else the Pi ecosystem has to offer, some products that just want to slap a well-supported Linux environment on top of their product (and not integrate an SoC, memory, storage, and wireless chip) now have this.</p>

<h2>Global distribution possibilities</h2>

<p>Do I think companies and makers here in the US and over in other parts of the world would also benefit from the CM0? Yes. Do I think it&#39;ll happen? Doubtful.</p>

<p>The Zero 2 W and CM0 share something in common, besides their entire architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Zero 2 W was introduced at the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020–2023_global_chip_shortage">COVID-induced chip shortages</a>.</li>
<li>The CM0 was introduced right before the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/ram-shortage-comes-us-all">great RAM shortages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/raspberry-pi-unveils-the-18-compute-module-0-but-only-for-chinese-customers-for-now-913bf59ab6cc">Hackster asked Eben Upton about global availability</a>, he was noncommittal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No plans to make it available outside China at the moment, but we&#39;ll see how we get on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was back <em>before</em> the RAM shortages got bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm0-zero-2w.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-f3e6d039-4948-49c4-8b9e-81ea19feffcd" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;f3e6d039-4948-49c4-8b9e-81ea19feffcd&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Pi Zero 2 W and CM0"/></p>

<p>I followed up asking a Pi engineer about it, and it sounds like one big problem is the RP3A0 chip that integrates an LPDDR2 RAM chip stacked on top of the Pi&#39;s SoC.</p>

<p>He said the CM0 would compete with Pi Zero 2 for LPDDR2 memory, which is in shorter supply these days (it&#39;s not being produced anymore, so stocks will only become more limited over time), and they want to make sure the popular Zero 2 W can stay in stock for makers and education.</p>

<p>The CM0 is targeted squarely at the lower end market, integrated into products built on assembly lines. So because of that, it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess if the CM0 will ever make it out of China.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doing a full review of the board <em>here</em>, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#39;s practically the same as the Pi Zero 2 W, which <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/look-inside-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-and-rp3a0-au">I already reviewed</a>.</li>
<li>It&#39;s not like you can get one (standalone, at least) anyway, at least not for the foreseeable future.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think there was a chance, before the DRAM manufacturers went all-in on an AI cash grab, but for now, stick to the Pi Zero 2&#39;s that you&#39;re used to.</p>

<p>You can find a little more detail and benchmark results on my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/98">sbc-reviews issue for the CM0</a>.</p></div></div>
