        <p>
          At METR, I&#39;m trying to reduce existential risk from artificial
          intelligence by helping to measure the autonomous capabilities of
          language model agents. For the past two months, I&#39;ve helped METR
          develop a standard for tasks that evaluate these agents: the
          <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard">METR Task Standard</a>. The standard formalizes METR&#39;s internal task format, now available
          for other people and organizations to use. Writing good tasks is
          expensive and time-consuming. The standard makes it easy to share
          tasks, avoiding duplicated work tasks and
          <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/evaluating-ai-systems">the headache of porting tasks from one organization&#39;s evaluations
            system to another</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Task Standard, tasks are defined using between two and seven
          Python functions. Based on these functions, the standard specifies a
          process for constructing a <em>task environment</em>: a container or
          virtual machine with which a language model agent interacts to solve
          the task. The standard and its GitHub repo has a bunch of useful
          features for task authors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ability to install packages, create files and folders, and start
            long-running processes in the task environment
          </li>
          <li>
            For tasks that can&#39;t be run in a container, a way to add an
            auxiliary virtual machine to the task environment
          </li>
          <li>
            Control over the textual task instructions that the agent receives
          </li>
          <li>
            Specifying whether the agent should have internet access or not
          </li>
          <li>
            Exposing secrets and other bits of configuration to the task Python
            code and, optionally, to the agent
          </li>
          <li>Defining a process for automated task scoring</li>
          <li>Automated tests for tasks</li>
          <li>
            A
            <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/tree/main/workbench">workbench</a>
            for task development, allowing task authors to construct task
            environments and run task tests
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I&#39;m proud of my work on the standard. My colleague
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-suzman-62a1241">Ted Suzman</a>
          and I are the main contributors so far. We extracted code from METR&#39;s
          internal evaluations platform into a TypeScript
          <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/Driver.ts">Driver interface</a>
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/DriverImpl.ts">implementation</a>. Our platform and the Task Standard workbench share this code. As
          the standard changes, it&#39;ll be easy to keep both codebases in sync.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&#39;re using the standard, I&#39;m eager to talk to you! Please email
