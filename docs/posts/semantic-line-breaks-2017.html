                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>When writing text with a compatible markup language,
                  add a line break after each substantial unit of thought.</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><em>Semantic Line Breaks</em> describe a set of conventions
                  for using insensitive vertical whitespace
                  to structure prose along semantic boundaries.</p>
                <p>Many lightweight markup languages,
                  including
                  <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
                  <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, and
                  <a href="http://asciidoc.org">AsciiDoc</a>,
                  join consecutive lines with a space.
                  Conventional markup languages like HTML and XML
                  exhibit a similar behavior in particular contexts.
                  This behavior allows line breaks to be used as semantic delimiters,
                  making prose easier to author, edit, and read in source —
                  without affecting the rendered output.</p>
                <p>To understand the benefit of semantic line breaks,
                  consider the following paragraph from the
                  <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/"><em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em></a>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Without any line breaks at all,
                  this paragraph appears in source as a long, continuous line of text
                  (which may be automatically wrapped at a fixed column length,
                  depending on your editor settings):</p>
                <pre>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
</pre>
                <p>Adding a line break after each sentence
                  makes it easier to understand the shape and structure of the source text:</p>
                <pre>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
</pre>
                <p>We can further clarify the source text by adding a line break
                  after the clause “with reason and conscience”.
                  This helps to distinguish between
                  the “and” used as a coordinating conjunction between “reason and conscience” and
                  the “and” used as a subordinating conjunction with the clause
                  “and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood”:</p>
                <pre>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience
and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
</pre>
                <p>Despite these changes made to the source,
                  the final rendered output remains the same:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
                    They are endowed with reason and conscience
                    and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>By inserting line breaks at semantic boundaries,
                  writers, editors, and other collaborators
                  can make source text easier to work with,
                  without affecting how it’s seen by readers.</p>

                <h2>Why Use Semantic Line Breaks?</h2>
                <p>For a <strong>writer</strong>,
                  semantic line breaks allow the physical structure of text
                  to reflect the logical structure of the thoughts that produce them.</p>
                <p>For an <strong>editor</strong>,
                  semantic line breaks make it easier to identify grammatical mistakes
                  and find opportunities to simplify and clarify without altering original intent.</p>
                <p>For a <strong>reader</strong>,
                  semantic line breaks are entirely invisible —
                  no changes to the source text appear in the final rendered output.</p>

                  <dt>How do I know when to add semantic line breaks?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Try reading the text out loud,
                      as if you were speaking to an audience.
                      Anywhere that you pause for emphasis
                      or to take a breath
                      is usually a good candidate for a semantic line break.</p>

                  <dt>How do I migrate existing prose to use semantic line breaks?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>There is no need to rewrite or reformat an entire document all at once.
                      The recommended migration path for an existing document
                      is to use semantic line breaks for any new or revised text.
                      This is often a great opportunity to make an editorial pass over content
                      since the distinctive appearance of text with semantic line breaks
                      allows you to quickly identify content that has not been updated.</p>

                  <dt>How do I use semantic line breaks with Git?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>The default Git diff options emphasize line changes
                      in a way that may obscure certain revisions to text with semantic line breaks.
                      You can pass the <code>--word-diff</code> option to the <code>git diff</code> command
                      for better results:</p>
                    <pre><code>$ git diff --word-diff
</code></pre>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>How do I force a line break?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>You can add a hard line break with the <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> element.
                      Although CommonMark and other lightweight markup languages
                      allow trailing spaces to indicate breaks between consecutive lines,
                      this syntax is incompatible with
                      editors that automatically strip trailing whitespace.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Semantic Line Breaks specification is authored by <a href="https://mat.tt">Mattt</a>.</p>
                <p>This specification is an attempt to encapsulate
                  best practices that I’ve encountered
                  while working on technical writing teams at several different companies.
                  It follows the general structure of the
                  <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning specification</a> by Tom Preston-Werner.</p>
                <p>In the process of developing this document,
                  I came across
                  <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/">this excellent blog post</a> by Brandon Rhodes
                  that includes extensive research about the origin of this technique.</p>
