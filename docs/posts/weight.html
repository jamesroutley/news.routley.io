<p>Description: We are experiencing an issue with Google Compute Engine beginning at Tuesday, 2022-07-19 08:10 US/Pacific.</p>
<p>Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>There has been a cooling related failure in one of our buildings that hosts zone europe-west2-a for region europe-west2. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to VM terminations and a loss of machines for a small set of our customers. We’re working hard to get the cooling back on-line and create capacity in that zone. We do not anticipate further impact in zone europe-west2-a and currently running VMs should not be impacted. A small percentage of replicated Persistent Disk devices are running in single redundant mode.</p>
<p>In order to prevent damage to machines and an extended outage, we have powered down part of the zone and are limiting GCE preemptible launches. We are working to restore redundancy for any remaining impacted replicated Persistent Disk devices.</p>
<p>We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-07-19 15:00 US/Pacific with current details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Customers impacted by this issue would have seen abnormal VM terminations for a small set of their VMs. We’re working on identifying and communicating with all affected customers.</p>
<p>Workaround: For customers who have experienced a VM failure in europe-west2-a, we recommend launching new instances in europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c. Customers who currently have running instances in europe-west2-a can continue to use Auto Scaling in europe-west2-a. Regional Auto Scaling continues to work.</p>
