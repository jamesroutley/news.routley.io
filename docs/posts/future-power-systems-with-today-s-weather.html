	  <h2>Introduction</h2>

	  <p>This website simulates how a future fully-renewable power system
	    would behave with today&#39;s demand and weather. Here is the actual wind and solar generation from the past 10 days in Germany:</p>
	  <p><img src="https://model.energy/future/myopic/today/DE-days-2024-01-14-2024-01-23-today.png"/></p>
	  <p>In the scenarios below the wind and solar generation is scaled up to
            projected capacities for a fully renewable system.</p>
          <p>The feed-in of wind, solar, existing hydroelectricity, batteries and
hydrogen storage is optimised to meet demand.  <b>The model can only see 24 hours ahead.</b> The long-term hydrogen
	    storage is dispatched assuming a constant hydrogen value (e.g. 80 â‚¬/MWh<sub>LHV</sub>).</p>
	  <p><b>Warning:</b> This website is a thought-experiment for educational purposes, not a forecast. Please see <a href="#warnings">all other warnings</a>.</p>
	  <p>Currently the website only works for Germany as an island system with today&#39;s demand. <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/nowcast/issues">Additional features</a> will follow soon!</p>

	  <h2>What can we learn?</h2>
	  <p>Despite the <a href="#warnings">many limitations</a> of these simulations, here are a few things we can learn (not an exhaustive list - also note that the model results depend strongly on input assumptions):</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Systems dominated by wind and solar can meet demand in all hours if there is sufficient short- and long-term storage.</li>
	    <li>Wind is very helpful in high latitudes to get through the winter periods when the sun shines less.
	    </li>
	    <li>There are multi-day periods with low wind and solar output. To bridge these, batteries, pumped hydroelectricity and short-term demand-side management are too expensive. Longer-term storage (in this example: hydrogen) can help despite the high losses, since it is used infrequently.</li>
	    <li>Foresight of 24 hours is sufficient to dispatch the system. Long-term storage can be dispatched using heuristics for the value of hydrogen. This is similar to how water values are used to dispatch hydroelectricity-dominated systems today.</li>
	    <li>Prices are often set by the value of hydrogen, both when hydrogen turbines are price-setting as supply and when hydrogen electrolysers are price-setting as demand.</li>
	    <li>Prices drop to zero in rare situations when wind and solar supply exceeds all flexible demand.</li>
	    <li>Market prices are more volatile than prices today on a day-to-day basis, but also don&#39;t behave radically differently. Prices in this systems do not depend on world markets for fossil fuels.</li>
	    <li>While the whole system can recover most of its costs from the market prices, it is hard for the peaking hydrogen turbines to recover their costs without some load shedding or a generator of last resort (e.g. based on imported fuel). This is the same situation as in conventional power systems.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Technical details</h2>
	  <p>The model is updated once a day to take account of the latest day&#39;s data.</p>
	  <p>The model has been run one day at a time from 2015 up until the present day to preserve the limited 24-hour-ahead foresight.</p>
	  <p>The demand time series are based on the network load (Netzlast) from <a href="https://www.smard.de/home">SMARD</a>. This time series is then corrected upwards based on yearly data from <a href="https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/daten-und-fakten/zusatzinformationen/">AG Energiebilanzen e.V.</a> so that it equals the sum of net generation and imports minus exports.</p>
	  <p>For the solar PV, wind onshore, wind offshore and hydroelectric generation, the generation time series are taken from <a href="https://www.smard.de/home">SMARD</a>. Since they don&#39;t reflect all generators (particularly for hydroelectricity, but also for solar PV), they are corrected by yearly correction factors based on the net generation statistics from <a href="https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/daten-und-fakten/zusatzinformationen/">AG Energiebilanzen e.V.</a>. For the current year, the previous year&#39;s correction factor is used. You can check out the <a href="https://model.energy/future/correction_factors.csv">correction factors</a>.</p>
	  <p>This correction scheme for load and generation follows the <a href="https://www.agora-energiewende.org/fileadmin/Projekte/Agorameter/2023-10-01_Hintergrunddokumentation_Agorameter_v13_EN.pdf">Agorameter</a>.</p>
	  <p>The time series are then scaled down to per unit time series using the historical capacities reported by <a href="https://www.energy-charts.info/">energy-charts</a>, before being scaled back up to their projected capacities.</p>
	  <p>Planned additional features are listed on the <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/nowcast/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>

	  <h2>Warnings</h2>
	  <p>Currently the website has many limitations. It is only a prototype; it will improve over time (see <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/nowcast/issues">planned features</a>). Important limitations and their effects include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Germany is currently treated as an island; no exchanges of electricity or hydrogen are allowed with other countries. Relaxing this condition would lower costs by 10-25%.</li>
	    <li>Network constraints and redispatch costs inside Germany are ignored. Including network bottlenecks would raise costs.</li>
	    <li>Power storage using hydrogen is not yet implemented at scale anywhere, although MW-scale electrolysers and GWh-scale hydrogen underground storage exist. <a href="https://netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/publication/A-Literature-Review-of-Hydrogen-and-Natural-Gas-Turbines-081222.pdf">Research is still ongoing</a> to develop 100+-MW-scale pure hydrogen turbines that have both good efficiency and low NOx emissions. Alternative storage mediums such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.10.001">methanol storage with carbon cycling</a> could also be attractive.</li>
	    <li>In reality the value of hydrogen could change seasonally, like natural gas does, and also be affected by other hydrogen demands (e.g. in industry) and hydrogen trade.</li>
	    <li>Demand flexibility for conventional electricity demand is limited to demand elasticity in some scenarios. Electrolysers and batteries charge based on market signals.</li>
	    <li>Potential new demands like heat pumps, electric vehicles and hydrogen for industry are not yet implemented.</li>
	    <li>Existing biomass electricity generation is not included, because biomass should be restricted to sustainable sources and prioritised for sectors like industrial feedstocks and long-distance aviation rather than electricity.</li>
	    <li>The future effects of climate change on weather are not considered.</li>
	    <li>Short-term forecasting errors, balancing costs and other ancilliary services are ignored.</li>
	    <li>Other generation technologies, such as geothermal, nuclear, fossil fuels with CCS, wave, solar in space, etc., are not included.</li>
	    <li>Other storage technologies, such as iron-air batteries, etc., could lower costs.</li>
	    <li>Scaling up existing wind profiles will underestimate yields, because new turbines achieve higher capacity factors than the average existing turbine (e.g. because of higher hub heights).</li>
	    <li>On the other hand, locations for additional wind and solar turbines may have lower wind speeds and insolation than the sites used today.</li>
	    <li>Increasing wake effects for offshore wind with rising capacity are ignored.</li>
	  </ul>
