    <h1>Right to Repair Groups and Farmers Unions File FTC Complaint Against John Deere</h1>

Even where purchasers of Deere equipment are aware that Deere requires important repairs to be performed only by Deere-authorized technicians, Deere’s market dominance leaves these purchasers little to no choice but to submit to Deere’s terms.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The complaint is asking for formal acknowledgment of what many farmers have been arguing for years: that Deere has cornered the repair market using a mix of digital rights management and its increasingly consolidated dealer network, where most repairs must be done. According to a recent U.S. Public Research Interest Group <a href="https://uspirgedfund.org/feature/usf/deere-headlights-ii" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a>—the same group that filed the FTC complaint—more than four out of every five Deere dealers is part of a chain of dealers of seven or more locations. This “mass consolidation,” as USPIRG put it, means that there is one dealership chain for every 12,018 farms and every 5.3 million acres of American farmland. The result is that many farmers have no real choice about where to get their tractors repaired, since all the repair centers near them that can do the repairs are increasingly owned by the same company, which are ultimately part of Deere&#39;s larger network.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The complaint is the latest effort by farmers and right to repair advocates to make Deere products repairable. It’s an issue that impacts most farmers, as Deere constitutes more than 50 percent of tractor sales in the U.S. according to the complaint. For years, Deere customers have resorted to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware"><span>hacking</span></a> their tractors and other black market methods to avoid the exorbitant fees for diagnosing and repairing products they already own. In January, a farming corporation in North Dakota <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdazj/john-deere-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-for-alleged-tractor-repair-monopoly"><span>filed a class action lawsuit against Deere</span></a>, alleging many of the same claims as the FTC complaint. The Biden administration issued <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epn5mk/biden-to-sign-executive-order-granting-farmers-right-to-repair-protections"><span>an executive order</span></a> last year attempting to make it easier for people to fix their own stuff. He also <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78xbn/ftc-formally-adopts-right-to-repair-platform"><span>directed</span></a> the FTC to make right-to-repair a part of its mandate.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The complaint further alleges that Deere has engaged in “unfair and deceptive trade practices” by claiming it would change these practices but then never actually doing so. In 2018, an industry group representing tractor manufacturers including John Deere said that by January 1, 2021 the companies would make repair tools, software, and diagnostics available to the masses. But <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m8mx/john-deere-promised-farmers-it-would-make-tractors-easy-to-repair-it-lied"><span>that never happened</span></a>. When shareholders questioned Deere about that, the company <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyp7xk/john-deere-blows-off-shareholders-asking-about-right-to-repair"><span>blew them off</span></a>.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Deere did not immediately respond to a Motherboard request for comment on the complaint.</p></span></p><div><div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
