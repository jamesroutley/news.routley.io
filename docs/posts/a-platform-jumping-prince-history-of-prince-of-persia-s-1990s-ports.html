				<p>&#34;Which is your favorite/definitive version of the original <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> game?&#34;</p>

				<p>I get this question surprisingly often, considering it&#39;s been 35 years. I figured it deserves a blog post.</p>

				<h4>Apple II</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/apple2-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The Apple II version was the original. It&#39;s the only version I programmed myself; <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s gameplay, graphics, animation and music were all created on the Apple II. I spent three years sweating over every byte (from 1986 to 1989), so it&#39;s close to my heart in a way no other version can be. That said...</p>

				<h4>DOS/Windows</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/dos-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The 1990 PC version, developed in parallel with the Apple II and shipped a few months later, took advantage of the PC&#39;s improved graphics and sound capabilities to deliver the <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> most players remember (in CGA, EGA, or VGA). My dad, Francis Mechner, re-orchestrated his music (previously limited by the Apple II&#39;s tinny built-in speaker) for MIDI synthesizers. The Broderbund in-house team, led by programmer Lance Groody, with Leila Joslyn on art, Tom Rettig on sound, and me as director, stayed faithful to the Apple game while upping the quality in every dimension. The digitized spike and slicer sound effects that traumatized many an elementary-school gamer originated with the PC version. If someone asked me the best way to play old-school PoP online today, I&#39;d likely recommend the <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Prince_of_Persia_1990">DOS version</a>.</p>

				<p>In 1990, C-family programming languages were the future, 6502 machine language the past. For good reasons, nearly all subsequent ports of PoP took the PC version as their starting point, rather than the Apple II.</p>

				<h4>Amiga</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/amiga-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The Amiga port was developed by Dan Gorlin (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter">Choplifter</a> fame), in parallel with the PC version, using the graphics and sound assets developed by the Broderbund team.</p>

				<p>Danny was one of my game-author heroes. Playing Choplifter, as a 17-year-old college freshman in 1982, blew me away and set me on the creative path that would lead to <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/karateka/">Karateka</a>. I was star-struck that he agreed to port PoP to Amiga. He did an impeccable job, working alone at home, using the state-of-the-art development system he&#39;d built for his games Airheart and Typhoon Thompson.</p>

				<p>In a detail perhaps mainly interesting to lawyers, Amiga was one of three PoP versions (Apple II and Macintosh were the others) that I was contractually responsible for delivering to Broderbund, rather than their doing the development. This meant me driving to Danny&#39;s house for meetings instead of to Broderbund, and that I was on the hook in case the project fell behind schedule or something went wrong. Fortunately, with Danny, all was smooth sailing.</p>

				<h4>Commodore 64</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/c64-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>One port that didn&#39;t get greenlit was the Commodore 64. Like the Apple II, the C64 had its heyday in the mid-1980s. By 1990, Broderbund (and most U.S. retailers) considered the C64 and Apple II outdated platforms; sales numbers were dwindling by the month. Broderbund couldn&#39;t escape publishing PoP on Apple, since it was the lead platform I created the game on, but they had little interest in a C64 version. It would have been a tough port in any case. To fit PoP into 64K of memory, with the Commodore&#39;s technical limitations, needed an ace 6502 programmer.</p>

				<p>In a twist I&#39;d never have predicted, an unofficial, fan-made C64 port was finally done in 2011, over 20 years later, and a <a href="https://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Prince_of_Persia">Commodore Plus/4 port</a> just last year. I hope my Apple II source code was helpful.</p>

				<h4>Macintosh</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/mac-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>In 1984, Apple unveiled the Macintosh computer (with a now-legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA">Super Bowl ad</a>). Still in college, and flush with <cite>Karateka</cite> royalties, I took advantage of the student discount to purchase a 128K Mac — keeping my Apple IIe for games. (A computer with no lowercase, and enough RAM to hold four pages of text, isn&#39;t ideal for writing term papers.) I loved my Mac, and faithfully upgraded my system every time they did: Mac Plus, SE, II, IIci, LC. By 1990, I was proudly Mac-only.</p>

				<p>But the games market was overwhelmingly PC. Broderbund estimated Mac&#39;s games market share as 5% of DOS/Windows. Since I believed in the Mac more than they did, it made sense for me to take on the port, as I&#39;d done with Amiga. I subcontracted it to Presage Software, a group of ex-Broderbund programmers I&#39;d known since <cite>Karateka</cite> days.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p><b>Fun fact:</b> the previous occupant of Presage&#39;s San Rafael office was George Lucas&#39;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</p>
				</blockquote>
	
			</div>
			<div>

				<p>Presage had an excellent, seasoned lead Mac programmer in Scott Shumway; but whereas Danny met his Amiga milestones promptly, Scott&#39;s Mac milestones receded like the horizon as they approached. With each new Mac model release — black-and-white, then color, then a different-sized screen — Presage had to redo the bit-mapped PoP graphics for the new configuration. While <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s Apple, Amiga and PC versions languished on store shelves (the game wasn&#39;t a hit in its first two years), the Mac release date slipped from 1990 to 1991, then to 1992.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p><b>Fun fact #2:</b> the young graphic artist who up-rezzed the Mac sprites, Mike Kennedy, went on to found the comics imprint Magnetic Press. We met again in 2024, when Magnetic published my graphic novel <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/monte-cristo/">Monte Cristo</a>.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Ironically, the Mac delays turned out to be a blessing in disguise. By the time the port was finally finished, almost two years late, Broderbund marketing had noticed that despite PoP&#39;s lackluster U.S. sales, its overseas and console versions were doing surprisingly well. Maybe the game had untapped potential?</p>

				<p>Broderbund took the gamble of combining PoP&#39;s Mac release with a PC re-release in a bigger, hourglass-shaped &#34;candy box&#34; designed by the San Francisco firm Wong &amp; Yeo. The dual Mac-PC release in the new box turned the prince&#39;s fortunes around. PoP not only became the #1-selling Mac game, it went from ice-cold to hot on PC as well. To 1992 Mac owners who&#39;d been using their machines mainly for work, a game like PoP was a welcome diversion.</p>

				<p>The Mac port was terrific. A sign of its quality is that we adopted its revamped prince (sporting a vest, turban and shoes) for the sequel, <cite>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and The Flame</cite>.</p>

				<p>But I still think the original Apple and PC graphics play best. The CRT blur and fat pixels smoothed over animated glitches, enhancing the illusion of life. Higher resolution leaves less to the imagination. (The same can be said of photography and cinema.)</p>

				<h4>Other ports</h4>

				<figure>
					<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/large/pop-ports.jpg"><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/pop-ports.jpg" alt=""/></a>
				</figure>

				<p>Between 1990 and 1993, more computer and console ports of PoP than I can list — Nintendo NES, Game Boy, SEGA Game Gear, Genesis, Master System, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, NEC PC-9801, FM Towns, Sam Coupé — were developed by teams in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere. Usually, by the time someone handed me a controller to playtest a build, it was too late for my feedback to matter, so I rarely played beyond the first level or two. I don&#39;t remember enough specifics of those versions to compare them; I&#39;ll leave that to players who know them better.</p>

				<p>There is one unforgettable exception.</p>

				<h4>Super Nintendo</h4>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/pop/snes-pop.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>In March 1992, I moved to Paris for a year (to learn French and 16mm filmmaking). Soon after my arrival, a colleague at Activision invited me to visit their office. They showed me the Super Nintendo version of PoP, developed by Arsys and published by NCS in Japan. Activision was lobbying Broderbund for the rights to publish it in Europe and the U.S. It wasn&#39;t my call, but they hoped I&#39;d put in a word.</p>

				<p>I wrote in <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/journals/">my journal</a> that day:</p>

				<p>&#34;Wow! It was like a brand new game. For the first time I felt what it&#39;s really like to play <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>, when you&#39;re not the author and don&#39;t already know by rote what&#39;s lurking around every corner.&#34;</p>

				<p>Arsys had done more than a straight port; they&#39;d expanded the game from 12 levels to 20, adding new enemies, traps, setpieces, and new music. I didn&#39;t play all the way through — a half-hour in Activision&#39;s office only scratched the surface — but I&#39;ll never forget the delighted thrill of being surprised playing my own game. You can see and play it in your browser <a href="https://online.oldgames.sk/play/snes/prince-of-persia/9108">here</a>.</p>

				<p>Elaborate production values and doubled playtime helped make SNES PoP a huge hit. I especially loved the fantastic box artwork by Katsuya Terada.</p>

				<p>A recent feature article in <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/like-a-completely-new-game-the-untold-story-behind-prince-of-persias-impressive-snes-port">Time Extension</a> revealed behind-the-scenes details about the SNES development that I hadn&#39;t known — including that game producer Keiichi Onogi traveled to the U.S. to visit Broderbund in 1991, hoping to get my feedback. (I missed his visit.) The article is a fascinating time capsule and testament to how special that port was.</p>

				<h4>...And onwards</h4>

				<p>The SNES, so different from the original Apple/DOS version, gave me my first taste of a feeling I would grow used to in decades to come: playing and enjoying new Prince of Persia games that were made by others. With the exception of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/the-sands-of-time/">The Sands of Time</a> (2003), where I was part of a Ubisoft Montreal team, the more recent modern PoP games don&#39;t have my fingerprints on them.</p>

				<p>I suspect that for many reading this post, your answer to &#34;Which is your favorite PoP?&#34; will be the same as mine: Whichever version we played, for hours on end, at a formative age when playing and finishing a game mattered intensely. The real value is in the ingenuity and imagination you brought to the effort, and in your own memories tied to that time.</p>

				<p>Thanks for reading this post. If you&#39;d like a deeper dive into the story behind <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s creation, I&#39;ve published two books on the subject: my old journals (1985-1993), and my new graphic novel <cite>Replay</cite>. You can check them out <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/">here</a>. Archival materials about PoP (including the Apple II source code) can be found in this website&#39;s <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/#pop">Library</a>.</p>

I post a new batch of entries every Wednesday. Today&#39;s installment reminds me that 30 years ago in September 1995, our San Francisco team was desperately crunching to meet <cite>The Last Express</cite> target date (hint: we wouldn&#39;t), while I postponed my nervous breakdown by mixing the game&#39;s cinematics soundtracks, like this one:</p>

				<p>A prince who started his career by climbing a garden wall for unauthorized trysts with a princess must be a bit of a rogue, so it makes sense that Evil Empire (developer of <cite>Dead Cells</cite>) stealth-dropped <cite>The Rogue Prince of Persia</cite> on August 20 without alerting the palace guards.</p>
				<p>The game is out now for PC, Xbox and PlayStation, and getting good reviews (<a href="https://www.player2.net.au/2025/08/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-a-rogue-like-expedition-worth-taking/">here&#39;s one</a>). You can check out the Rogue Prince on <a href="https://princeofpersia.com/">Ubisoft&#39;s PoP page</a>, where he coexists alongside the very different, award-winning 2D Metroidvania <cite>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</cite> (<a href="https://www.gameshedge.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-dominates-the-2025-pegases-awards/">4 Pegasus awards</a> including Best Game of the Year!)</p>

				<p>For those already up to speed, I&#39;ll cut to the chase: <cite>Liberty!</cite> Book 3 lands in French comic bookstores tomorrow, August 27. And if you haven&#39;t yet discovered my newest graphic novel trilogy—read on! I hope fans of my previous adventures (books, video games, or both) will enjoy this one.</p>
				<p>As an American who lives in France, I cherish the special bond between our two countries. It&#39;s a love affair that goes back 250 years, to when the USA was fighting for its survival as a brand-new nation. Outnumbered, outgunned, about to be crushed by an English imperial armada, the American rebels sent a Connecticut businessman named Silas Deane on a secret mission to ask France for support.</p>
				<p>King Louis XVI refused, but Parisian playwright Pierre Caron de Beaumarchais (best known as the author of <cite>The Marriage of Figaro</cite>, less well known as an entrepreneur with a zest for real-life intrigue) was listening. The result was an unlikely odd-couple friendship and an extraordinary covert operation that would change history.</p>
				<p>When I began researching and writing <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/liberty/">LIBERTY!</a>, in collaboration with the wonderful French illustrators Etienne Le Roux, Loic Chevallier, and colorist Elvire DeCock, we didn&#39;t foresee how powerfully our graphic novel would resonate with current events. We were at work on Book Two when Russia&#39;s army invaded Ukraine in 2022. Our 18th-century characters became agonizingly relatable as we saw their struggles echoed in today&#39;s news headlines.</p>

				<p>From 1775 to 1778, American citizens lived in a limbo of war and occupation. The English king&#39;s refusal to recognize their nation&#39;s existence, and scorched-earth military retaliation against people he considered his disloyal subjects, put the rebels in a win-or-die situation. Desperately short of ammunition, the American army had no hope of resisting without aid from Europe. But the French ministers hesitated—constrained by politics, by fear of provoking England, by the whims of their king. If this sounds familiar, it goes to show: History might not repeat itself, but it rhymes.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/liberty/panels12.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>I wrote this graphic novel because Beaumarchais and Deane deserve to be remembered. Their story holds inspiration and experience that the world needs now as much as ever. As an entertaining adventure of fascinating personalities in tumultuous times, I hope readers of all ages and nationalities will enjoy and identify with it today. Etienne, Loic and Elvire&#39;s artwork brings the world of 18th-century France and the American Revolution to life with spectacular cinematic scope and historical fidelity.</p>

				<p><cite>Liberty!</cite> is a complete story in three volumes. The full trilogy, Book 1 - <cite>The Insurgents</cite>, Book 2 - <cite>The Traffickers</cite>, and Book 3 - <cite>The Ambassadors</cite> (all three subtitles describe the same protagonists) can now be purchased in French comic bookstores or online.</p>

				<p>Last spring, I received an unexpected invitation. Jules Maeght, a printer and gallerist in Paris, had seen my sketchbooks online, and wondered if I&#39;d ever tried copperplate etching?</p>
				<p>I hadn&#39;t. For my 60th birthday, I blocked off four days in the calendar, and took up Jules&#39; kind offer to experiment in his family&#39;s <a href="https://www.maeght.com/imprimerie-maeght/" target="_blank">printing shop</a> on the Left Bank, at 13 rue Daguerre. Looking up the metro route to get there, I thought the address sounded familiar— but from where?</p>
				<p>As readers of my graphic novel <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a> know, my grandfather Papi (a doctor) left a voluminous family memoir. His sister, Else Mechner, had been a painter in Paris in the 1920s. I checked the manuscript. Else had lived at 11 rue Daguerre, literally next door to the print shop I was now headed for.</p>
				<p>Over our first coffee at Imprimerie ARTE, Jules and his crew showed me the view from their upstairs window. Across the courtyard (shared with a boulangerie, on a street bustling with food markets) stood the building from whose windows my great-aunt Else must have looked out at theirs a century earlier.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>That morning, I sat in the courtyard and drew my view of Else&#39;s atelier, with a stylus directly on a copper plate. In the afternoon, we added two shades of aquatint (a process in which the printer turns a hand crank in a wooden box, letting a cloud of powder settle onto the varnished plate). The result was my first etching, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/11-rue-daguerre/">11 rue Daguerre</a>.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Jules&#39; instinct had been right. I was hooked.</p>

				<p>For my second print, I chose a panel from <cite>Replay</cite> depicting Else as a schoolgirl, surreptitiously sketching passengers on the streetcar in her hometown of Czernowitz. (The sketching habit runs in the family; my daughter Jane and I both inherited it.) My cartoon is based on a <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/replay-annex/chapter4/#page-112-streetcar">more famous one</a> by the great French caricaturist Daumier (1808-1879). A laser-engraving machine transferred a JPEG scan of my line art to a copper plate, hopping from 19th- to 21st-century technology and back again. I titled this homage to Else and Daumier <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/streetcar-1910/">Streetcar 1910</a>.</p>

				</figure>

			</div>
			<div>

				<p>My third artwork depicts a young woman walking down an Orient Express train corridor, in the Belle Epoque period when Else was an art student in Vienna. Players of my 1997 game <cite>The Last Express</cite> will know why I titled this print <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/anna-wolff/">Anna Wolff</a>. The grid layout of rectangular panels evokes the rotoscoping process our team used to create the animation thirty years ago, as well as the French comics and Art Nouveau lithographs that inspired us. The ARTE workshop, where craftsmen hand-ink copper plates and roll them through iron printing presses, was a perfect place to bring the game&#39;s mix of old and new technology full circle, back to ink on paper.</p>
				<p>Print number four is inspired by another video game moment. In <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/shadow/">Shadow</a>, I&#39;ve pictured a climactic confrontation between <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s young hero and his mysterious nemesis. The computer memory limitations that led to Shadowman&#39;s birth in 1988 (as described in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ozxnrs0BP4" target="_blank">ArsTechnica video</a>, and in <cite>Replay</cite>) are now history, but the insight that technical constraints can spark creative breakthroughs stayed with me. This copperplate etching with aquatint is adapted from a watercolor I did last year. (The original hangs on the wall of game developer Neil Druckmann, who co-created <cite>The Last of Us</cite>.)</p>

				</figure>

				<p><a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/dome-house/">Chappaqua — Dome House</a> (drawn directly on copperplate) shows my childhood home, where I played and programmed my first computer games on a 1970s Apple II, in the woods north of New York City. It&#39;s where <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> (and many of my other projects) began.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>These five prints will be shown at <a href="https://www.maeght.com/galerie-maeght/" target="_blank">Galerie Maeght</a> (42 rue du Bac) in Paris next Thursday evening, 6 February 2025, along with my sketchbooks and other recent work. I&#39;ll be there from 5-8 p.m. to chat (and sign books) in a very pleasant setting, with French wine on hand. If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, please stop by and say hello.</p>
				<p>For those unable to come on Thursday, the artworks can be seen (and purchased) online at Galerie Maeght, and <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/#etchings">at my website</a>. The limited editions of 35 or 40 are split between the two sites; if you find a print sold out at one, try the other. Both ship internationally.</p>
				<p>Else Mechner&#39;s artistic career was cut short when she returned to Czernowitz in 1931, leaving her paintings behind. Hitler, Stalin and World War II ensued; she never saw Paris again. Thirty years later, after Else&#39;s death, Papi tracked down her former landlord at rue Daguerre, who agreed to ship the canvases to New York in exchange for the unpaid rent.</p>
				<p>One of her paintings, entitled &#34;<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/replay-annex/chapter1/#page-24-else-mechner-s-paintings">The Prince</a>,&#34; impressed me particularly as a child; Papi often showed it to me when I visited. His love and pride in his sister&#39;s work was evident. I think he&#39;d have been happy about the unexpected chain of events that led his grandson back to her Paris atelier and inspired new artworks in her honor. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be there in spirit next Thursday.</p>

				<h3>Prince of Persia turns 35</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2024-09-26">⌛ September 26, 2024</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>Next week marks the 35th anniversary of <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s release in 1989. PoP players have a lot to celebrate this year: two brand-new games released (<cite>The Lost Crown</cite> and <cite>The Rogue Prince of Persia</cite>), <cite>The Sands of Time</cite> remake confirmed and announced for 2026, and a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/prince-of-persia/the-lost-crown">new DLC for <cite>The Lost Crown</cite></a> that dropped last week.</p>
				<p>Today, I have something personal to share with old-school PoP fans. 35 years ago, artist Robert Florczak painted a lovely oil illustration for <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>&#39;s original &#34;red box.&#34; My fondness for that first box art inspired me to draw this tribute in my own style.</p>

				<figure>

				<p>&#34;Red Box&#34; is the 8th in a series of limited-edition artworks I&#39;ve created as a companion to <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic novel memoir REPLAY</a> (published earlier this year by First Second Books), in which I recount my game-development adventures and family story. <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/redbox/">Signed prints are available</a> exclusively from my website.</p>

				<p>Happy 35th birthday to the prince — and happy 54th to my brother David, who modeled the game&#39;s rotoscoped animation at age 15, and is celebrating his birthday today!</p>

				<p>I was 25 when PoP shipped on Apple II. I couldn&#39;t have imagined then that such an incredible, enduring community of players and teams would share the adventure for decades to come. My heartfelt thanks to all Prince of Persia fans for keeping the flame alive. Your dedication and skill has saved the kingdom, time after time. I&#39;m deeply grateful.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m excited to announce that my graphic novel <cite>MONTE CRISTO</cite> — a modern update of Alexandre Dumas&#39; classic novel transposed to post-9/11 America, brilliantly illustrated by Mario Alberti — will be published in English by Magnetic Press later this year.</p>
				<p><strong>Our Kickstarter begins today</strong> and will run through April 12. You can preorder the English edition (hardcover or digital, 224 pages), comprising the complete trilogy originally published by Glénat in French, along with various signed, limited-edition add-ons and bundles, from the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neurobellum/418331324?ref=1s8b6x&amp;token=c19c37fc">Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
				<p>The French website Les Sentiers de l&#39;Imaginaire, in its review, wrote: &#34;Mario Alberti&#39;s work is remarkable in every way... Resolutely modern... Romantic, captivating and truly original. Jordan Mechner appropriates this masterpiece by Alexandre Dumas to create an intelligent and daring adaptation.&#34;</p>
				<p>Last week, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic novel memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a> was published in English by First Second Books. I&#39;m delighted to now be able to share <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/monte-cristo/">Monte Cristo</a>, as well, with English-speaking fans who&#39;ve enjoyed my video games like <cite>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</cite> and <cite>The Last Express</cite>.

				<h4>Memoir of a family</h4>

				<p>Since <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s release last year in France (where it&#39;s received awards including the 2023 &#34;Chateau de Cheverny&#34; graphic novel prize), I&#39;ve been eagerly counting down the months — now weeks — until I can share it with my friends, family and readers in English.</p>
				<p><cite>Replay</cite> interweaves the story of my life as a game developer (making <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>, <cite>Karateka</cite> and <cite>The Last Express</cite>) with my dad&#39;s flight from Vienna as a child refugee in 1938-41 through Nazi-occupied France, and my grandfather&#39;s back story as an Austrian teenage soldier in World War I. It&#39;s a very special, personal work for me, my first graphic novel as writer-artist. You can read more about it, reviews and excerpts, on my website&#39;s <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a> page.</p>
				<p>The U.S. edition is essentially identical to the French one, but in hardcover. (It&#39;s not a translation; I wrote and drew it first in English.)</p>

				<p>For those who&#39;d like to get a signed copy, but can&#39;t make it to an in-person event in San Francisco, New York or L.A. next month, you can still early-order a signed copy of <cite>Replay</cite> through March 1. After that, signed copies will be available from bookstores where I do in-person signings, but no longer from the website.</p>

				<h4>Share the journey</h4>

				<p>If you&#39;re excited about checking out <cite>Replay</cite>, I&#39;d like to ask you a favor. Pre-orders are a critical part of a book&#39;s success, and it really does matter when you</p>

			<div>

				<p>Today, I&#39;m releasing a new artwork, &#34;Saturday 1979,&#34; depicting the living room of my childhood home and a very special computer — the Apple II, where my earliest gaming memories were created. This is the machine on which I learned to program in BASIC, then went on to develop my first games, <cite>Karateka</cite> and <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>I drew this scene remembering the endless weekends and after-school hours I spent playing games like <cite>Breakout</cite>, <cite>Star Trek</cite>, and <cite>Space Invaders</cite>, and trying to unlock the fascinating new machine&#39;s powers. Readers of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic novel memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a> will recognize the kid sitting next to me as my brother David, whom I drafted into service to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbbX_Mq-gdg">model the <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> animation six years later</a>, in 1985.</p>

				<p>&#34;Saturday 1979&#34; is available as a high-quality giclée print in a signed, numbered and hand-stamped limited edition of 20, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/saturday-1979/">exclusively here</a>. As with previous prints, once the edition is sold out, it will not be reprinted; this protects its value for collectors.</p>

				<h4>Four weeks to <cite>Replay</cite></h4>

				<p>My video-game inspired <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/">artwork series</a> is a companion project to my new graphic novel memoir <cite>Replay</cite>, which interweaves my four decades in the game industry with three generations of my family&#39;s story. The nostalgic retro-gaming moment of &#34;Saturday 1979&#34; is also evoked in the book (pages 5 and 26).</p>

				<p>The English edition of <cite>Replay</cite> will be released by First Second Books on March 19, 2024 (in four weeks). You can pre-order it now, read reviews, or early-order a signed edition, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">on the <cite>Replay</cite> book page</a>.</p>

				<p>At last, it&#39;s here! <a href="https://www.princeofpersia.com/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> releases this Thursday, January 18 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.</p>
				<p>I started playing the early-access Deluxe edition when it dropped 48 hours ago, and I&#39;m already hooked and irrevocably immersed. I&#39;ve been eagerly looking forward to this adventure for many reasons:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It&#39;s a long-awaited new beginning for a franchise that&#39;s been close to my heart for almost four decades. (It <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/prince-of-persia/">started in 1985</a> with me videotaping my 15-year-old brother <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbbX_Mq-gdg">running and jumping in his pajamas</a> in our high school parking lot.)</li>
					<li><cite>The Lost Crown</cite> is made by a wonderful, talented team of friends and colleagues in Montpellier, France, where I live. I&#39;ve worked with several of them on previous POP projects, and know their passion and dedication to POP first-hand.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Usually when I hear reviewers remark that a game is &#34;deep&#34; and &#34;challenging,&#34; I experience a slight bit of terror. As much as I delight in conceiving devious puzzles for others, my own gamer skills are far from hardcore. (Ask anyone who&#39;s ever been on a development team with me.) But within the first hour of taking controller in hand as young warrior Sargon, I found myself enthralled by this team&#39;s fresh vision of ancient Persia, and determined to fulfill my epic mission to save a prince. Challenge accepted! The glowing reviews are justified:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>IGN:</strong> &#34;It&#39;s such a great fit that I&#39;m scratching my head wondering how this franchise and genre never got together before... A surprisingly deep, no-nonsense Metroidvania that looks set to get our gaming year of 2024 off to a good start.&#34;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>WellPlayed.com:</strong> &#34;In a beautiful melding of Prince of Persia&#39;s competing gameplay identities, <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> invokes the Metroidvania genre, allowing it to craft a challenging 2.5D platformer and compelling combat experience all at once... It was endlessly fun, something unlocking in the back of my mind that finally allowed me to understand the innate appeal of this genre.&#34;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>EuroGamer:</strong> &#34;It might just be my favorite thing the publisher has released in the last ten years... <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> begins a new chapter in the storied history of Prince of Persia — and for Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the game.&#34;</p>
				</blockquote>

			</div>
			<div>

				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>DigitalTrends:</strong> &#34;It&#39;s just so pleasurable to actually play... The platforming is a smooth callback to Prince of Persia&#39;s 2D roots while peppering in more complex movements... It nails everything that a good Metroidvania needs to succeed and goes even further with more story and gameplay systems. All of this gives <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> the ingredients it needs to be a genre classic.&#34;</p>

				<p>I&#39;m especially glad that <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> has such an authentically Persian flavor — from the stylish visuals and music to the mythological underpinnings. (I&#39;m playing it in Persian, of course, with subtitles.) Timeless elements of Persian culture like Simurgh, Mount Qaf, and Athra that I&#39;ve long wished to see in a Prince of Persia game are woven into the universe within a coherent gameplay and story framework. I can&#39;t wait to discover everything the team has put into it.</p>
				<p>And for well-informed POP fans and readers who may be wondering: No, <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> is not the 2D Prince of Persia game whose development I recount in my graphic novel memoir <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a>. That was a different, ultimately cancelled project, also based in Montpellier. <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> rose from its ashes, as befits a Persian phoenix.</p>
				<p>For those curious about the full story — and back story — of my personal involvement with Prince of Persia through its 35 years and many iterations, <cite>Replay</cite> will be released in English on March 19, 2024. You can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">pre-order it here</a> (including a limited signed edition). For French readers, <cite>Replay</cite> is already in bookstores!</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Now it&#39;s time for me to sign off, pick up the controller and continue developing my skills to see Sargon through the adventures that await. See you on Mount Qaf!</p>

				<p>A huge thanks to everyone who has followed my creative projects and supported me in 2023. It&#39;s been a rare delight and privilege to share so many new releases in a single year.</p>
				<p>As an author and game developer, I&#39;m used to spending most of my working life behind the scenes on not-yet-announced projects. When the time comes to unveil the results, and meet and talk with the people I make things for, it&#39;s an occasion to celebrate. I&#39;ve been especially touched by the heartfelt sentiments shared by readers of <cite>Replay</cite> and fans of <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> this year, sometimes including personal childhood memories that remind me how far our actions can ripple into the future.</p>
				<p>I hope the coming year will let you be together with the people you love, and share things that bring you happiness. I wish you the best for 2024, including the chance to pursue your own creative work, to enjoy the games, films, books and art that inspire you, and to spend time with your friends and family.</p>

				<p>This year&#39;s French release of my graphic novel memoir <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a> — my first book as both writer and visual artist, and the most personal project I&#39;ve done — led to memorable encounters at book signings, talks and festivals throughout France. I&#39;ve been moved by the overwhelming warm response, including the great honor of the 2023 &#34;Chateau de Cheverny&#34; history graphic novel prize awarded to <cite>Replay</cite>, and a second printing of the book. <cite>Replay</cite> is especially meaningful to me because it tells the story of three generations of my family (including my father&#39;s odyssey as a child refugee in World War II Europe), interwoven with my own story making video games like <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> and <cite>The Last Express</cite>. I can&#39;t wait to start sharing it with readers worldwide this spring, when First Second/Macmillan will publish the English edition (on March 19, 2024).</p>
				<p>In 2023, I also had the pleasure of signing my two new French graphic-novel action-adventure trilogies, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/monte-cristo/">Monte Cristo</a> and <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/liberty/">Liberty! The Insurgents</a>, alongside my wonderful artist collaborators. Books 1 and 2 of <cite>Monte Cristo</cite> (with Mario Alberti) and Book 1 of <cite>Liberty</cite> (with Etienne Le Roux and Loic Chevallier) are now available; the next volumes will be released in spring. (English editions to be announced in 2024.)</p>
				<p>Exciting news for Prince of Persia fans: this year brought the announcement of a brand-new title, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/the-sands-of-time/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (coming in January 2024), along with the 30th anniversary celebration of <cite>The Shadow and the Flame</cite>, and the 20th anniversary of <cite>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</cite>. In parallel, the Ubisoft Montreal team working on the <cite>Sands of Time</cite> remake announced that the development has passed its latest internal milestone and is proceeding full steam ahead.</p>

			</div>
			<div>

				<p>Prince of Persia has been very much present in my creative focus this year: it&#39;s central to my graphic novel <cite>Replay</cite>, and is featured in a new series of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/">original artworks</a> I&#39;ve drawn paying tribute to the games. The artworks are available as signed, limited-edition physical art prints and as free downloadable <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/#replay">desktop and mobile backgrounds</a>.</p>

				<p>As if this weren&#39;t enough to fill one year, in August, Digital Eclipse released <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/karateka/">The Making of Karateka</a> for consoles and PC, an in-depth playable, interactive documentary about the Apple II game I made before <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>. <cite>The Making of Karateka</cite> is earning acclaim as a new template for game history preservation, and has become one of 2023&#39;s best-reviewed titles. Considering their raw material was work I did more than 40 years ago, that&#39;s a real accomplishment.</p>
				<p>For fans of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/the-last-express/">The Last Express</a> and those interested in behind-the-scenes, I&#39;ve launched a new ongoing feature on my website: <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/1993-journals/">My game development journal</a> &#34;30 years ago this week&#34; continues from January 1993, where the book <cite>The Making of Prince of Persia</cite> ends. As of this week in 1993, <cite>Prince of Persia 2</cite> is on shelves for Christmas, Smoking Car Productions has moved into new San Francisco offices, and <cite>The Last Express</cite> production is getting under way.</p>
				<p>If my end-of-year greeting card (above) brings good feelings, you can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/happyholidays-fullres.jpg">download it here</a>. And if you&#39;re looking for a gift for someone in your life who appreciates graphic novels, books about making video games, real-life 20th-century history, or a multigenerational family epic, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a> is an engrossing, hefty 320-page combination of all of the above.

				<h3>Cliffhanger</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-09-12">⌛ September 12, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>Earlier this year, as a companion project to <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a>, I started creating &#34;author&#39;s tribute&#34; artworks inspired by my past video games. (You can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/#replay">download them as wallpapers</a> from the Library, or see the original series of art prints <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/#artworks">on the Artworks page</a>.)</p>
				<p>I&#39;ve been blown away by the enthusiastic response both to the artworks, and to <cite>Replay</cite> (now in French bookstores; English edition will be released in March 2024). The outpouring of love for these games so many decades after their release is amazing to me.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/cliffhanger.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>Today, I&#39;m releasing a new print: &#34;Cliffhanger&#34; — which is where <cite>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</cite> ended in 1993. For those who remember the game, here&#39;s a short refresher video of the ending. (If you didn&#39;t finish it: Spoiler alert!)</p>

				<figure>
					<iframe width="100%" height="300" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ct20XCOU414?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
				</figure>

				<p>Fans and colleagues have been asking me for the past 30 years: Why not do a third game to complete the 2D Prince of Persia trilogy? And who is that mysterious sorceress, anyway?</p>

				<h4>Prince of Persia 3</h4>

				<p>My graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite> addresses the first question. In parallel to my grandfather&#39;s experience as a young soldier in World War I, and my father&#39;s as a child refugee during World War II, the book tells my own story of how <cite>Prince of Persia 3</cite> got green-lit, then cancelled — twice: first in 1993, then in 2019.</p>

				<figure>
					<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/cliffhanger-en.gif"><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/cliffhanger-en.gif" alt=""/></a>
				</figure>

				<h4>The Sorceress</h4>

				<p>As to the second question, my intention was always to reveal the sorceress&#39;s identity and back story through game play, not in a blog post. Short of making the game, the best answer I can give now is this artwork. Images can suggest things in ways words can&#39;t.</p>

			</div>
			<div>

				<p>I composed &#34;Cliffhanger&#34; to evoke the final image of <cite>POP2</cite>, and to depart from it. The prince, princess, and sorceress in my drawing don&#39;t exactly match the characters in the 1993 PC game, nor do they literally represent the 2019 team&#39;s work-in-progress at the point development was cancelled. My goal was to create an artwork that embraces both my evolving vision of <cite>POP3</cite>, and fans&#39; enduring curiosity for the past 30 years about this mysterious sorceress and the game that never was.</p>
				<p>In the book <cite>Replay</cite>, I use a yellow two-color palette for the present-day story, blue for my 1980s and 90s game-development days. &#34;Cliffhanger&#34; combines both palettes. The tower glimpsed in the crystal ball behind the prince and princess&#39;s flying horse is not a Persian palace, but the medieval Gothic cathedral of Montpellier, where the 2019 game development was based.</p>
				<p>It was a disappointment to me and the team when <cite>POP3</cite> got cancelled four years ago, but I&#39;m grateful for the silver lining. It gave me time and space to create my recent graphic novels <cite>Monte Cristo</cite>, <cite>Replay</cite>, and <cite>Liberty</cite>, and other team members the opportunity to bring their top-notch talents to exciting new projects — notably <cite>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</cite>, a fresh 2D Metroidvania take on the POP universe, slated for January 2024 release.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/cliffhanger-closeup.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>In the meantime, here&#39;s &#34;Cliffhanger&#34; — my personal tribute to the POP teams, the great work they&#39;ve done for three decades and counting, and to the fans who&#39;ve kept the <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> flame alive in our collective imaginations.</p>

				<h4>Time-Limited Edition</h4>

				<p>My first two <cite>POP</cite> art prints sold out their editions of 40 within hours of announcement, leaving some people wishing they&#39;d been able to get one. So rather than try to guess the right number in advance for &#34;Cliffhanger,&#34; I&#39;m doing a time-limited release. (The concept feels appropriate for <cite>POP</cite>.) Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
				<p>For the first 48 hours following this announcement (ending at 9 a.m. Thursday, 14 September), everyone who orders can get a print (in either the 30x40 or 40x60 size; take your pick). The editions will then be sized based on the number of orders received in that 48-hour window. Whether the edition ends up being 10, 40, or more, we&#39;ll produce and I&#39;ll individually hand-number and sign that many. Once the sale closes, no more prints of this artwork will be made — that&#39;s the nature of a limited edition, and protects its value for collectors. If you&#39;d like one, you can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/cliffhanger/">place your order here</a>.</p>
				<p>And for those who read French, I urge you to get to a bookstore and check out <cite>Replay</cite>. It provides insight into the personal and creative roots of my games, including <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>, that I can only communicate in a graphic novel. For readers curious about the connections between the book and real-life events, I&#39;ve also posted an online <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/replay-annex/">Replay Annex</a> with chapter-by-chapter commentary and resources.</p>
				<p>The English edition of <cite>Replay</cite> will be released by First Second Books in March 2024. You can pre-order it, or early-order a signed edition, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">on the Replay page</a>.</p>

				<h3>Liberty!</h3>

			<div>

				<p>I&#39;m thrilled to announce the launch of my new graphic novel trilogy LIBERTY — an epic historical adventure, spectacularly drawn by Étienne LeRoux and Loïc Chevallier. It&#39;s the true story of an unlikely friendship that changed history in 1776, when a Parisian playwright teamed up with a Yankee merchant from Connecticut to smuggle desperately-needed arms to the American rebel army. From the moment I learned about this 18th-century &#34;black ops&#34; — a little-known and fascinating chapter of the American revolution and of Pierre Caron de Beaumarchais&#39; colorful life, powerfully relevant to today&#39;s world — I knew I had to write it.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/liberty/poster.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>If you&#39;ve read my previous graphic novels <cite>Templar</cite> or <cite>Monte Cristo</cite> (or played <cite>The Last Express</cite>), you know I love stories of adventure and intrigue set against a backdrop of real historical events. (Those three take place in the 14th, 21st, and early 20th centuries, respectively.) I connected with this one immediately.</p>
				<p>In school, I was always bored by American history. Benjamin Franklin, George Washington... yawn. But the odd-couple pairing of bon vivant Beaumarchais (the author of <cite>The Marriage of Figaro</cite>, whom Voltaire called the wittiest writer in France) and straitlaced Silas Deane (an American secret agent sent to Paris in a classic fish-out-of-water setup) grabbed my imagination. Deane and Beaumarchais are unsung heroes. They have no statues or streets named in their honor (and when you read LIBERTY, you&#39;ll understand why). Yet their contribution was critical.</p>
				<p>I felt personal empathy with both characters. As an American expat in France myself (see <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a>), I identified with Silas Deane&#39;s sense of being an outsider in Paris, &#34;lost in translation&#34; far from home. It must have been daunting for a guy from a small East Coast town to plunge into Parisian politics and dealmaking at the glittering pinnacle of an older, sophisticated European society. And although video game development has little in common with gun running, I could vividly relate to Silas&#39;s partner, Pierre Caron de Beaumarchais. He earned fame and fortune by writing a hit play (<cite>The Barber of Seville</cite>), staked it all on a startup with an idealistic premise but questionable business model, ran through his funding too fast, and wound up at the mercy of his backers and creditors. To be sure, I gambled my <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> royalties in 1993 on a much less important venture; but it helped me imagine the predicament of a playwright-turned-entrepreneur facing bankruptcy in 1776.</p>
				<p>The purpose that brought Deane and Beaumarchais together — an underdog struggle by a new nation against a vastly more powerful and better-equipped empire, who sends a huge army to crush resistance and lay waste to their homes and towns rather than accept their right to self-government — resonated with me on multiple levels. As an American who grew up with democracy as an enshrined ideal; as a child of refugees who fled Europe to escape dictatorship in the 20th century; and as a European citizen today. A true story about a people fighting back more resolutely and effectively than anyone expected, enduring horrific losses and reprisals, urban warfare and occupation, while sympathetic but self-interested great powers dispassionately calibrate the degree and timing of support to offer, feels worth telling in 2023.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Lafayette, and other well-known historical characters appear in this story, too, but even they turned out to be full of surprises. Seeing those great figures through Beaumarchais&#39; and Deane&#39;s eyes made them human and brought them to life for me in ways I&#39;d missed at school. Researching episodes like the battle for New York City in 1776, I was able for the first time to vividly picture the devastation once inflicted on my home town.</p>
				<p>With its cast of compelling characters, sweeping scope that blends the personal and epic, and international action spanning two continents and an ocean, I couldn&#39;t have created LIBERTY in any other medium than a graphic novel. I wrote it on a grand scale, knowing that to find an artist capable of doing justice to the project, and willing to dedicate the years it would take, was a tall order. In Etienne, Loïc, and colorist Elvire De Cock, I found LIBERTY&#39;s dream team.</p>
				<p>Four years ago, I met Etienne and Loïc in Tours, discussed Silas Deane, Beaumarchais and their world, and sealed our partnership over a bottle of Bordeaux. A new Franco-American collaboration was born. Tomorrow, August 23, 2023, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/liberty/">LIBERTY Book 1: The Insurgents</a> arrives in French bookstores.</p>

				<p>LIBERTY is a complete story in three volumes. <cite>Book 2: The Traffickers</cite> will be released in January 2024; <cite>Book 3: The Ambassadors</cite> in September. I&#39;ll post as soon as I know release dates for English and other language editions.

				<p>In a quirk of timing, <cite>Liberty</cite>&#39;s release makes my fifth major project announcement within six months — along with my autobiographical graphic novel <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/latest-news/#announcing-replay">REPLAY</a> (also from Delcourt), Book 2 of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/latest-news/#meet-victor-sirin">Monte Cristo</a> (from Glénat), and back-to-back video-game announcements (a <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/latest-news/#prince-of-persia-takes-a-mighty-new-leap">new Prince of Persia</a> from Ubisoft and a <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/latest-news/#karateka-climbs-again">Karateka retrospective</a> from Digital Eclipse). It might seem like I&#39;ve been doing some insane multitasking, but in reality, all of these have been in development for years. The announcements and releases landing so clustered together is just an oddity of 2023.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m very proud of the work we&#39;ve done on <cite>Liberty</cite>. If you read French or enjoy graphic novels, I hope you&#39;ll check it out — and <cite>Replay</cite>, and <cite>Monte Cristo</cite>. <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/">All three titles are now in French bookstores</a>.</p>

				<h3>Replay Signed Edition</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-08-15">⌛ August 15, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>For everyone who&#39;s asked if it will be possible to order a signed copy of REPLAY in English: I have good news, and thank you for the idea! It took a bit of organizing, but we&#39;ve solved the logistics. Starting now, you can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">order signed books from the Replay page</a>, via the &#34;Signed Edition&#34; button.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/replay-us-cover.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The signed edition package will include the Macmillan hardcover English edition of <cite>Replay: Memoir of an Uprooted Family</cite>, signed by me, and a set of two collector&#39;s postcards (French readers may have seen these at my in-person book signings). Books will be signed and shipped worldwide from the U.S. in March 2024, when they&#39;ll arrive in the Macmillan warehouse. I&#39;ll make a special day trip to sign them all, and they&#39;ll go out to you along with the postcards, well-protected in premium packaging (bubble wrap and cardboard box).</p>

				<figure>
					<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/large/replay-postcards-templar.jpg"><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/replay-postcards-templar.jpg" alt=""/></a>
				</figure>

				<p>I took this photo of the <cite>Replay</cite> postcards alongside the French edition (which is softcover, with different cover art), and my previous First Second graphic novel, TEMPLAR, to help imagine how the soon-to-be-printed hardcover edition of REPLAY will look and feel. I&#39;ve just signed off on the 320-page interior mechanical. I&#39;m counting down the months until I can hold a physical copy in my hands.</p>
				<p><a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">The Replay page</a> also has a button to pre-order regular unsigned books from Macmillan, Amazon, or your favorite bookseller. I hope as many of you as possible will do that, as well. Publishers and booksellers watch pre-order numbers as an indicator of a book&#39;s potential, and make their own ordering and marketing decisions accordingly. So even though <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s March 2024 release is months away, your pre-orders already help support the launch, and increase the chance that more people will discover the book.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
					<p>I&#39;ll cut off orders on the day we need to tell the warehouse how many books to ship, or if the number of books reaches the limit of what I can comfortably sign. (This would be a great problem to have.) At that point, we&#39;ll remove the &#34;Signed Edition&#34; button from the website. As long as the button is there, you&#39;ll know orders are open.</p>
				</blockquote>

			</div>
			<div>

				<h4>If you&#39;re in France...</h4>

				<p>The signed English books will ship worldwide, including to France. The French edition is in bookstores now (you can also <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">order it online</a> from the <cite>Replay</cite> page). If you come to any of my upcoming book signings or talks, I&#39;ll be delighted to sign your book and say hello. My September/October schedule is below.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re in France but our schedules don&#39;t line up, you can also order from most bookstores before the event. The bookseller will gladly set your book aside for me to sign, and ship it to you.</p>

				<h3>Karateka Climbs Again</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-07-11">⌛ July 11, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>When the <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com">Digital Eclipse</a> team told me they wanted to give my early game <cite>Karateka</cite> &#34;the Criterion treatment&#34; and re-release it in a deluxe remastered edition, I couldn&#39;t quite picture exactly what they had in mind. Their enthusiasm and evident passion for video game history inspired confidence, so I said yes. I never in my wildest dreams imagined how far they&#39;d take it.</p>
				<p>Fast-forward to April 2023: I&#39;m sitting with my dad and family in New York. Our jaws drop as we watch Chris Kohler demo an almost-final build of &#34;The Making of Karateka&#34; (announced today for digital release on Xbox, PlayStation, PC and Nintendo Switch). What they&#39;ve built around my 1984 kicking-punching debut is so much more than a game remaster, I&#39;m still trying to wrap my mind around it.</p>

				<figure>

					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/karateka/screenshot1.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The photo above captures my dad&#39;s reaction as (age 92) he watches himself climbing up onto the hood of our family car forty years earlier. He&#39;s wearing a karate gi at my request, in a Super 8 film I shot at age 18 to create rotoscoped animation for <cite>Karateka</cite>. (This was three years before I pressed my 15-year-old brother into service as the model for my next game, <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>.)</p>
				<p>Digital Eclipse has reconstructed my Super 8 rotoscoping process — from film to pencil tracings to pixelated game character — in their interactive, hands-on &#34;Rotoscope Theater.&#34; And that&#39;s just one element of &#34;The Making of Karateka.&#34; It&#39;s packed with audio and video interviews with me, my dad, and game-industry luminaries; a podcast about <cite>Karateka</cite>&#39;s music (which my dad composed); rare original design documents; excerpts from my journals; and 14 playable games — including not only the final Apple II, Commodore, and Atari versions of <cite>Karateka</cite>, but also work-in-progress builds I submitted to Broderbund along the way, tracking its development from prototype to gold master. All the games are playable on a choose-your-own nostalgic menu of period monitors and TVs, with optional audio commentary and a &#34;watch/play&#34; mode that the Dagger of Time would envy.</p>

				</figure>

			</div>
			<div>

				<p>As a bonus, they&#39;ve salvaged and resurrected my never-before-published arcade shoot-em-up <cite>Deathbounce</cite> (the game I made before <cite>Karateka</cite>, which teenage me hoped would be my ticket to software success in 1982)… and the one I did before <em>that</em>, an unauthorized Apple II clone of the arcade hit <cite>Asteroids</cite>. Incredibly, they&#39;ve not only remastered <cite>Karateka</cite>, but also remade <cite>Deathbounce</cite>, using today&#39;s technology to reimagine my 1982 prototype as a jazzy twin-stick shooter. All these are included and playable in &#34;The Making of Karateka.&#34;</p>
				<p>I&#39;m mind-boggled that the Digital Eclipse team has poured so much hard work, love and fidelity into reconstructing my journey as a fledgling game developer. From a shoebox of 5.25&#34; floppy disks I stashed in my closet 40 years ago — each disk a step along the 7-year path that led me from high-school BASIC to <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> — they&#39;ve excavated work I never expected to see again, brought it to life, and placed it in historical context.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/karateka/screenshot2.jpg" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>If &#34;The Making of Karateka&#34; were an interactive exhibition in the Strong Museum of Play (from whose collection many of the archival materials came), it would require several rooms and a full afternoon to explore. Now, when they release the full package (date TBA later this summer), you&#39;ll be able to download, play and discover it at your leisure.</p>
				<p>As of today, you can wishlist it on Steam. Details and links are on the <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/karateka">Digital Eclipse game page</a>.</p>
				<p>With this release, Digital Eclipse has set a new bar for game-development history preservation. I&#39;m touched and honored that they chose <cite>Karateka</cite> as the first title in their planned <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/media/goldmasterseries">Gold Master series</a>. I can&#39;t wait to see what comes next.</p>

				<h3>Prince of Persia Takes a Mighty New Leap</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-06-08">⌛ June 8, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>I&#39;ve been eagerly awaiting this moment for so long, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s here at last. The first trailer for Ubisoft&#39;s new <cite>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</cite> was unveiled today at Summer Game Fest. After over a decade since the last major game release, Prince of Persia fans once again have a wondrous universe to discover and embark on an exciting new adventure.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/poptlc/releasetrailer-leap.jpg" alt=""/>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/poptlc/releasetrailer.jpg" alt=""/>

				<figure>
					<iframe width="100%" height="251" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmX7a_e65uU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
				</figure>

				<p>For anyone wondering: <cite>The Lost Crown</cite> is not a continuation of either the <cite>Sands of Time</cite> or the retro-2D storyline, it&#39;s a fresh beginning. I didn&#39;t write or have a direct role in this one — which means I&#39;ll get to enjoy its surprises as a gamer. I know the talented POP team at Ubisoft Montpellier well, I&#39;ve watched them pour their hearts and passion into this project over three years from pre-conception to full beta, and I couldn&#39;t be more excited. This is the Prince of Persia game I&#39;ve been wishing for.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;ve read <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a> (released in France last month; English edition coming in March 2024), you might wonder whether there&#39;s a link between the unannounced, cancelled Prince of Persia project that brought me to Montpellier in 2017 (as told in <cite>Replay</cite>) and <cite>The Lost Crown</cite>. Is it really a coincidence that both projects were launched in the same small city in the south of France?</p>

			</div>
			<div>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/makinggames-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The link is the talent. Ubisoft&#39;s storied Montpellier studio and &#34;French touch&#34; were a big part of what drew me in 2001, when we first joined forces <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/the-sands-of-time/">to reboot Prince of Persia (<cite>The Sands of Time</cite>)</a>, and again in 2017. A number of Montpellier hands have also worked in Montreal, including some of the best talent I&#39;ve had the privilege to work with anywhere. I&#39;ve seen their dedication and love for POP at close range; we&#39;ve immersed ourselves together in Persian mythology and gameplay on past projects. It&#39;s no coincidence that this group of people is the one to finally crack the challenge of reinventing POP for a new generation of gamers. I&#39;d call it destiny. I&#39;m thrilled and delighted to see their hard work come to fruition — and I can&#39;t wait to play it.</p>
				<p><cite>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</cite> will be released in January 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and PC. Ubisoft will share more details in coming days; you can find up-to-date info on <a href="https://www.princeofpersia.com/">the official Prince of Persia game page</a>.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re curious about the back story of Prince of Persia&#39;s original creation, its 35-year legacy, and the multiple (sometimes uncanny) echoes through time that intertwine the prince&#39;s adventures with my own family story, check out <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite></a>. It will add new dimensions to your appreciation of past POP games, and of why it&#39;s fitting that Montpellier — home to so much video game creativity — is the place where the prince&#39;s Lost Crown was finally found.</p>
				<p>Now to start counting down the months till January…</p>

				<h3>A New Departure</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-05-16">⌛ May 16, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>A big thank you to everyone who purchased limited-edition prints of my first three <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>-inspired game tribute artworks, &#34;A Faithful Friend,&#34; &#34;Bones,&#34; and &#34;Dagger.&#34; Today, I&#39;m releasing a fourth: &#34;Departure.&#34; As the title hints, this one isn&#39;t <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/departure.jpg"/>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/departure-closeup.jpg"/>

			</figure>

			<p>Players of a certain 1997 point-and-click adventure game may recognize the characters (and even the time on the station clock). It depicts a moment on the Gare de l&#39;Est platform just before <cite>The Last Express</cite> begins and the train leaves the station. I&#39;d often imagined seeing our characters boarding the train; now at last I get to draw them!</p>
			<p>If you&#39;ve read my graphic novel <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay</a> (released last week in France) you&#39;ll understand that this series of artworks isn&#39;t only about the games, but also about my personal journey making them. <cite>The Last Express</cite>, in particular, has echoes of my own family&#39;s story of 20th century Europe. While writing and drawing <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s chapter 7 and 8, whose dual timelines recount my struggle to complete the game&#39;s production in 1993-97 in parallel with my dad and his young aunt&#39;s flight from Nazi-occupied France in 1940-41, I almost felt as if I was drawing scenes from a sequel to the game.</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/train-en.gif"/>
			</figure>

			<p>It&#39;s probably no coincidence that, out of all my games, <cite>The Last Express</cite> is the one that feels closest to a graphic novel. As an American, I&#39;d been unfamiliar with the incredible legacy of European comics until my French friends Patrick and Sandrine introduced me to them in the 1990s. To discover, in my twenties, masters like Pratt, Bilal, and Tardi was a revelation and a formative influence in creating <cite>Last Express</cite>. (That&#39;s Patrick below, helping me with train research in 1993. He appears as a character in both <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s blue and yellow timelines.)</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/1993-en.gif"/>
			</figure>

			<p>&#34;Departure&#34; is my homage to Smoking Car Productions; to the European comics authors and filmmakers whose work inspired us; and to the fans who embraced <cite>The Last Express</cite> and have kept its world and characters alive for 25 years. It&#39;s also an homage to my grandfather, my father and his aunt Lisa, whose real-life adventures reverberate both in <cite>Replay</cite> and in <cite>The Last Express</cite>&#39;s fictional story.</p>
			<p>Along with &#34;Departure&#34;, I&#39;m releasing a second Replay-linked print today. &#34;Promenade des Anglais&#34; depicts the storied boardwalk in Nice, France, where my dad spent a year of his childhood as a refugee in 1940. Readers of <cite>Replay</cite> (chapters 7 and 8 especially) will understand the personal resonance this setting has for my family, and why I chose it to pair with <cite>The Last Express</cite>.</p>

			<p>&#34;<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/departure/">Departure</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/promenade-des-anglais/">Promenade des Anglais</a>&#34; are available exclusively here in signed and numbered limited editions of 40. By popular demand, I&#39;m also releasing &#34;Departure&#34; as a limited edition of 10 in a larger format, as I did last month with &#34;Dagger.&#34; Details and links to purchase are on the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/artworks/">Artworks</a> page.</p>
			<p>My graphic memoir <cite>Replay</cite> is now available in French bookstores, and from the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay book page</a> (where you can pre-order the English edition). And if you&#39;d like to play <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/games-movies/the-last-express/">The Last Express</a>, it&#39;s available on Steam and mobile from Dotemu.</p>

				<p>30 years ago today in 1993, <cite>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</cite> went gold master.</p>

				<p>My journal reminds me that the Broderbund team and I celebrated the completion of two years of work at Pasha&#39;s, our Persian restaurant in San Francisco (and I suffered the aftereffects of my overindulgence the next morning, on a long flight to Paris).</p>
				<p>Thirty years later almost to the day, I find myself once again in Paris, fresh off a plane — this time from New York, where I celebrated the release of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my newly published graphic novel Replay</a>, and gave my dad a copy for his 92nd birthday. The book tells the story of his childhood, and of our family. The tales of the creation of <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> 1 and 2 (and my other games) are nested inside it, like &#34;1001 Nights&#34; episodes.</p>

			</div>
			<div>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/tleresearch-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>The reason I went to Paris in May 1993 was to do research for my next game, <cite>The Last Express</cite>. I visited train stations, train yards and archives, including the Gare de l&#39;Est basement meeting depicted in the <cite>Replay</cite> panel above (which I recorded in my journal). I hungrily collected comics by European masters like Pratt, Bilal, Tardi, and Giardino — at that time difficult to find in the U.S. — that would inspire the game&#39;s story line and visuals.</p>
				<p>Arriving in France today in May 2023, I&#39;m not visiting, but returning home. (I moved here from Los Angeles in 2016.) In 1993, I was discovering comics as a fan; this week, I became a French comics author. (REPLAY is the first book I&#39;ve both drawn and scripted.) Reading this week&#39;s batch of journal entries makes me feel that in many ways, I&#39;ve come full circle, and closed a 30-year loop.</p>
				<p>You can follow the making of <cite>Prince of Persia 2</cite> and <cite>The Last Express</cite> on <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/library/1993-journals/">my website&#39;s new 1993 journals page</a> (continuing where my published journal <cite>The Making of Prince of Persia</cite> leaves off, in January 1993).</p>
				<p>The bigger story (including the 100-year loop of how my family&#39;s 20th-century survival story relates to the creation of <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>, <cite>Prince 2</cite>, and <cite>The Last Express</cite>) is told in <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">my book REPLAY</a>.

				<h3>Replay in English!</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-05-02">⌛ May 2, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<p>I&#39;m happy to share the newly-completed artwork for the English cover of my new graphic novel memoir <cite>Replay</cite> — slated for release by First Second Books/Macmillan on March 19, 2024. You can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">pre-order it now</a> from your favorite bookseller (links are on the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/"><cite>Replay</cite> book page</a>).</p>

				<p>The English edition has a different cover design from the French edition (released by Delcourt last week, April 26), and will be in hardcover rather than paperback, but inside, they&#39;re the same book. I wrote and drew chapters first in English (my native language), worked closely with my editor Lewis Trondheim on the French translation, and brought the art to final for both editions nearly simultaneously. So both are &#34;the original&#34; edition.</p>

				<figure>

					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/expat-fr.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>Why such a long gap between the French and English releases (almost eleven months)? The short answer is that U.S. and French publishers work differently. In the U.S., longer lead times for printing, marketing, and distribution mean that publishers usually schedule a graphic novel release 12-18 months after an author delivers final art. In France (where books are printed locally), it&#39;s more like 3 months.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re bilingual and wondering which edition to get, my answer is: you can&#39;t go wrong! Whichever version of <cite>Replay</cite> you pick up, you&#39;ll be getting a beautifully designed, printed and bound edition that I&#39;m deeply proud of. I love the way the softcover French book feels in my hands — it&#39;s just the right size, thickness and flexibility. And the First Second hardcover edition will be a different and equally gorgeous tactile pleasure, worth the wait.</p>
				<p>Details and links to purchase both editions are on the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay book page</a>. If you&#39;re in France, or read French, there&#39;s no need to wait; <cite>Replay</cite> is in bookstores now!</p>

				<h3>Announcing Replay</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-04-25">⌛ April 25, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
			<div>

				<p>I&#39;m excited to finally share the project I&#39;ve been deeply immersed in for the past two years. It&#39;s an adventure that will have special meaning for game fans who&#39;ve enjoyed <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> or <cite>The Last Express</cite>, yet it&#39;s very different from anything I&#39;ve done before. It unites in a new way three crafts and lifelong passions that have animated my work: storytelling, visual art, and history.</p>
				<p><cite>Replay</cite> is a graphic novel memoir of three generations. It interweaves my father&#39;s childhood odyssey as a Jewish refugee in Nazi-occupied France; my grandfather&#39;s experience as a teenage soldier on the Russian front in World War I; and my own youth as a videogame-obsessed American kid, from a 1978 Apple II through four decades in the fast-evolving game industry. The games, books, and films I&#39;ve spent my career making were born out of those formative events.</p>
				<p>Some readers may already know that my dad composed the music for <cite>Karateka</cite> and <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> and that my younger brother David was the rotoscoped animation model. That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg of all the ways my family&#39;s story underlies my past and present creative efforts. In <cite>Replay</cite>, I share the larger human and personal context of those games&#39; creation.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/cover-fr.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p><cite>Replay</cite> is my first graphic novel as a &#34;complete author&#34; — meaning I&#39;ve drawn as well as written it. It&#39;s 320 pages in color, so you can understand why I&#39;ve been somewhat quiet through 2021-22. Making 1,500 drawings takes time. (If you&#39;ve seen my recent game tribute artworks, from &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; to &#34;Dagger&#34;, you&#39;ll appreciate their kinship with <cite>Replay</cite>.)</p>
				<p>The French edition of <cite>Replay</cite> will be in bookstores tomorrow, April 26. It&#39;s published by Delcourt.

				<h4>Rivers of Time</h4>
				<p>To make it easy for readers to follow <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s intersecting storylines, I&#39;ve used three distinct palettes.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/suitcases.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p><cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s &#34;blue&#34; timeline covers my career in game development, from programming my first Apple II arcade games as a teenager, through the 1990s and 2000s with ever-bigger teams, budgets, and stakes on <cite>The Last Express</cite> and <cite>The Sands of Time</cite>. If you&#39;ve read my published game-dev journals or viewed the ArsTechnica video, you&#39;ll appreciate the destiny-altering moment in 1988 when my then-girlfriend Tomi persuaded me that <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> would be more fun if it had sword-fighting.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/blue-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p><cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s second, &#34;sepia&#34; timeline depicts my dad&#39;s childhood flight through occupied France from 1938-41, as he and his young aunt Lisa tried to outrun the rapidly expanding Nazi regime to reunite with their family across the Atlantic. I grew up hearing their stories. Like many second-generation immigrants, I&#39;ve often felt that the challenges of my own life were undramatic compared to the last generation&#39;s heroic survival. Forty years before little Franzi composed the music for his son&#39;s Apple II games, he had bigger things to worry about.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/ww2-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>This sepia timeline also holds the back story of my dad&#39;s odyssey of family separation and reunion. A quarter-century earlier, in 1914, my grandfather saw his own idyllic childhood shattered by World War I. (His hometown of Czernowitz, now in Ukraine, was a thriving Jewish capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) He was conscripted and sent to the Russian and Italian fronts, where he spent three years in the trenches on the losing side.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/ww1-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>Linking both timelines is <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s third, &#34;yellow&#34; present-day frame, recounting my move to France for a video game project in 2016, as an American with two teenage kids. It&#39;s a story of today&#39;s game industry, when multimillion-dollar productions involving hundreds of people can be greenlit, morph, change direction, and get cancelled.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/replay/yellow-en.gif" alt=""/>
				</figure>

				<p>(By serendipity, <cite>Replay</cite>&#39;s release coincides with the 30th anniversary of <cite>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</cite> signing out of QA in 1993. For fans who&#39;ve wondered why the 2D <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> trilogy never got its third game, you&#39;ll find part of the answer in <cite>Replay</cite>.)</p>
				<p>I chose the title <cite>Replay</cite> because it resonates with both the video-game and historical threads of this book. I&#39;ve often had the sensation that in my life, I&#39;m unintentionally or unconsciously echoing past events. Like my grandfather, I uprooted and resettled my family across the Atlantic — but in the opposite direction, under significantly more favorable circumstances. &#34;Replay&#34; also evokes my mental habit of rehashing past decisions, as if by doing that I might somehow magically undo the past and obtain a better outcome. Which, of course, is only possible in a video game.</p>

				<p>The French edition of <cite>Replay</cite> will be in bookstores tomorrow, April 26. It&#39;s published by Delcourt. You can purchase it online (and read a free 25-page preview) at the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">Replay book page</a>.</p>
				<p><cite>Replay</cite> will be published in English by First Second Books in early 2024. (French readers are getting it ten months sooner.) I&#39;ll share more details about the English release in my next post. As of today, you can already <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/en/books/replay/">pre-order it</a>.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re a fan of graphic novels, video games, or are interested in twentieth-century history — or all three — I hope <cite>Replay</cite> will speak to you and resonate on multiple levels. It&#39;s the great origin story I&#39;ve spent my life preparing to tell. I can&#39;t wait for you to discover it.</p>

				<h3>Dagger of Time</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-04-04">⌛ April 4, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>Today, I&#39;m releasing the third in a series of Prince of Persia tribute artworks — my homage to the fans and teams that shaped the prince&#39;s destiny (and mine). This one is dedicated to the incredibly talented Ubisoft team I had the privilege to work with to make The Sands of Time, and to the fans whose loyalty has kept the flame alive these past 20 years.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/dagger.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>In 2003, the Montreal team and I had no way of knowing whether Prince of Persia would appeal to a new generation of console gamers. The original 2D game series had fizzled out a decade earlier, when my planned third game of the trilogy was cancelled. A 1999 3D reboot from Red Orb had flopped. We felt sure we had something special with Sands of Time, but no one was counting on it to be a hit. The enthusiasm and warm embrace with which you greeted the new Prince of Persia, Farah, and the Sands of Time universe surpassed our dreams.</p>
			<p>Like my two preceding artworks, &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; and &#34;Bones,&#34; &#34;Dagger&#34; is a personal expression as a visual artist and graphic novelist of what Sands of Time has meant to me, looking back over two decades of memorable experiences and adventures since that game&#39;s release.</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<p>&#34;Dagger&#34; is available as a limited edition of 40 signed and numbered giclée prints, exclusively <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/art-prints/dagger/">here</a>. This time, I&#39;ve also created a limited edition of 5 prints in a larger format (60 x 40 cm).</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/dagger-sizes.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>My 30-years-ago journal reminds me that this week in April, 1993, I was in San Francisco with a Broderbund team in the final weeks of playtesting and debugging POP 2: The Shadow and the Flame. Retro-gaming fans and time-travelers can follow the journal <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/library/#1993journals">in the Library</a>. Time is an ocean in a storm...</p>
			<p>In my next post, I&#39;ll have something very special to announce. It&#39;s the main project that&#39;s consumed most of my working hours and creative passion for the past two and a half years. I feel confident in saying that it&#39;s not anything you&#39;ve been expecting. It&#39;s not a game, but I believe it will be of great interest to game fans — and not only to game fans. It will be released in France on April 26, only three weeks from now. I can&#39;t wait to share it with you.</p>
			<p>Until then, I hope you&#39;ll discover and enjoy my last few weeks&#39; releases: the 1993 journals, the exciting new adventure of <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/monte-cristo/">Monte-Cristo</a> (Books 1 and 2 now in French comic book stores), and Dagger!</p>

				<h3>Meet Victor Sirin</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-03-21">⌛ March 21, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>I&#39;m excited to announce that the second volume of my new graphic-novel trilogy <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/monte-cristo/">Monte-Cristo</a> arrives in bookstores tomorrow (March 22) in France. It&#39;s the story of Sam Castillo, an innocent young man unjustly accused and imprisoned for 17 years, who returns as mysterious mega-billionaire Victor Sirin to take his revenge on the three men who stole his youth.</p>
			<p>In 2005, post-9/11 America (Book One), 24-year-old <strong>SAM CASTILLO</strong> has every reason to be happy—promoted to foreman of his company&#39;s Iraq reconstruction project, engaged to his high-school sweetheart <strong>ABBY</strong>—until he&#39;s framed as a terrorist and rendered to a &#34;black site&#34; prison an ocean away.</p>
			<p>Three men put him there: Sam&#39;s supervisor <strong>EDDIE DALGLEISH</strong>, who&#39;s been skimming money in a boondoggle Sam&#39;s promotion threatens to expose; FBI agent <strong>WALTER FARRELL</strong>, who makes a devil&#39;s bargain to conceal his Army general father-in-law&#39;s corrupt dealings with military contractor Greendale; and Abby&#39;s best friend <strong>ANDREW McCLANE</strong>, who betrays Sam to clear the way for his own courtship of Abby.</p>
			<p>Over the next 15 years, cut off from the world, Sam forms a deep friendship with fellow detainee <strong>FARHAD</strong>—a brilliant, multi-lingual master of intrigue, who bequeaths to Sam the bank codes of his late Russian-oligarch employer&#39;s hidden fortune... and by his own death enables Sam&#39;s escape.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/mc/victor.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>In Book Two (our present day), Sam arrives in the U.S. with a new identity as mysterious mega-billionaire emigré <strong>VICTOR SIRIN</strong>, owner of the offshore shell <strong>MONTE-CRISTO CORPORATION</strong>. The three men who separated him from Abby and shattered his life have risen in the world. Dalgleish is a hedge fund billionaire, McClane is a Congressman running for governor, and Farrell is U.S. Deputy Attorney General. Abby, now a public defender, is married to McClane with two children. They have no idea what&#39;s coming.</p>

				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/mc/danica.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>Victor skillfully plays on his enemies&#39; greed and ambition, using his wealth to insinuate himself into their world of power and privilege while he methodically lays the groundwork of an elaborate plot that he hopes will destroy them. Only young FBI agent <strong>DANICA JORJEVIC</strong> suspects him. Convinced that Victor&#39;s elegant international façade masks a criminal identity, she lobbies her boss to investigate him. Victor appreciates Danica&#39;s integrity and determination, even as he frustrates her attempts to learn the truth. Their ensuing battle of wits will test Danica&#39;s trust in the legal justice system she&#39;s sworn to uphold... and reawaken Victor&#39;s frozen heart.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/mc/fireworks.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>My collaborator, the supremely talented Italian illustrator Mario Alberti, has done incredible work bringing Sam, Victor, Abby, Danica, and their rich universe to life. I love these characters, and hope you will too. You can check out the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/monte-cristo/">first 10 pages of both volumes</a> online here, and in French comic book stores starting tomorrow.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, my 30-years-ago journal continues this week on this website&#39;s <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/library/#1993journals">Library</a> page. On 22 March 1993, I was a 28-year-old American in Paris, discovering the world of European comics for the first time. Hugo Pratt, Jacques Tardi, and Enki Bilal (along with Alexandre Dumas) became key inspirations as I researched and developed the story for my next game, <cite>The Last Express</cite>. <cite>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</cite> was in its final weeks of playtesting and debugging.</p>
			<p>I couldn&#39;t have dreamt then that 30 years later, I&#39;d be back in France and once again immersed in comics, this time not just as a reader, but as an author. I hope fans of <cite>Prince of Persia</cite>, <cite>The Last Express</cite> and my other games will join me in rooting for Sam Castillo and Danica Jorjevic as they fight for justice, each in their way, against enemies so powerful that they seem untouchable. <cite>Monte-Cristo</cite> is my first adventure story set not in a historical or fantastic past, but in our own world of today. I can&#39;t wait for you to discover it.</p>

				<h3>The 1993 Journals: POP2 and The Last Express</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-03-16">⌛ March 16, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>When I launched this website in 2008, I began transcribing and posting daily entries from my old handwritten journals as a &#34;blog from the past,&#34; documenting my game-development odyssey making the first version of Prince of Persia in 1985-1993. Later, I released the collected journals as a book, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/journals/">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>, followed by a prequel, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/the-making-of-karateka/">The Making of Karateka</a> (my even older journals from 1982-1985, when I was in college trying to break into the game industry with my first Apple II games). The response was more enthusiastic than I imagined. <cite>The Making of POP</cite> has since been re-published twice, in a beautiful illustrated hardcover edition from Stripe Press (and in French, from Third Editions).</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/journals/makjournals.jpg"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p><cite>The Making of POP</cite> ends in January 1993, at Las Vegas CES, a few months before the release of POP 2: The Shadow and the Flame. I stopped there because, as I wrote in the afterword: &#34;After that, my attention (and what I wrote in my journal) focused more and more on Smoking Car Productions and making The Last Express. Nearly a decade would go by before I&#39;d be hands-on again in the creation of a Prince of Persia title [Sands of Time in 2003].&#34;</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/journals/lastexpress-onset.jpg"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>I&#39;m sometimes asked by people who enjoyed those journals whether I plan to publish a third volume about The Last Express. I&#39;ve always answered no. The Last Express development was too complex and involved too many people. My journal tells only a small part of the story. There are gaps where I went weeks or even months without writing (I barely found time to sleep). Although it&#39;s a fascinating read for me personally, I don&#39;t think my 1993-1997 journal in itself would be enough for a stand-alone book entitled <cite>The Making of The Last Express</cite>.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div>

			<p>That said, there is a lot in the journal that I think retro-gaming fans and developers would find interesting. When I set out to make The Last Express in 1993 at age 28, I was in a rare and fortunate position, thanks to the success of Karateka and Prince of Persia. Few creative artists ever get an opportunity to write their own ticket in the ways that were offered to me then. How I navigated those choices — my ongoing struggle to reconcile values of art, business, and life; mistakes I made, things I was blind to, things that miraculously went right — makes for a valuable post-mortem.</p>
			<p>Rereading my journal, seeing my steps and missteps exposed in merciless real-time day by day, I know this is the kind of story I would have loved to read at that juncture in my life. (Hungry to learn from others&#39; hard-won experience, I devoured Steven Soderbergh&#39;s and Eleanor Coppola&#39;s production diaries of <cite>Sex, lies and videotape</cite> and <cite>Apocalypse Now</cite>.) Non-fiction first-person narratives featuring protagonists with grandiose artistic ambitions who are mature in some ways, painfully immature in others, and spoiled for choice are not so numerous.</p>

			<p>On February 1, 2023, I posted my first batch of &#34;30 years ago this week&#34; journal entries on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Mastodon. Since this year marks the 30th anniversary of POP2&#39;s release and Last Express&#39;s beginning (and the cancellation of POP3, featuring the mysterious sorceress glimpsed at the end of POP2), I thought it would be a good moment to continue the &#34;making of&#34; narrative. Even if my 1993-96 journals don&#39;t make a book, they deserve at least a dedicated page in this website&#39;s <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/library/">Library</a> section. So here it is: <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/library/1993-journals/">The 1993 Journals: Prince of Persia 2 and The Last Express</a>.</p>
			<p>I&#39;ll do my best to keep up the weekly Wednesday posts, staying exactly 30 years ahead. That&#39;s a pace I think I can confidently handle on top of my other workload. It took the team four years to finish <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/games-movies/the-last-express/">The Last Express</a>; I&#39;ve got enough journal to take us through 2026.</p>
			<p>You can follow my weekly old-journal postings on social media (links are at the bottom of this page; take your pick). Or via this site&#39;s RSS feed and/or my monthly e-mail newsletter, which are ad-free and cookie-free.</p>
			<p>See you back in 1993!</p>

				<h3>Prince of Packaging</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-02-28">⌛ February 28, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>
			
			<p>So many video games, films, and music albums I &#34;own&#34; now live in the cloud, and I&#39;m nostalgic for the days when they existed as physical objects on a bookshelf. The tactile quality, size and shape, and cover art of every game box was linked to memories of how I&#39;d acquired it—new, second-hand, or as a gift?—and of hours spent playing.</p>
			<p>For a game developer, a shrink-wrapped box that holds the thing we&#39;ve been working on for years brings home the reality that our game is truly done. In the pre-internet 1980s and early 90s, before downloadable updates and patches, shipped meant shipped.</p>
			<p>Last month, the sale at auction of American painter Robert Florczak&#39;s original artwork for my game Prince of Persia (the Broderbund &#34;red box&#34; edition) triggered memories of the in-house drama surrounding its creation.</p>
			<p>That summer of 1989, I was in the throes of trying to finish and ship Prince of Persia on Apple II, its first platform. I didn&#39;t know if it would be a hit or a flop. Thanks to the journal I kept then (a habit since age 17), I can now recall dates and details I&#39;d have otherwise forgotten—like these pencil sketches I did at the end of April to show Broderbund&#39;s art director my ideas for the package:</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcoversketch1.gif"/>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcoversketch2.gif"/>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcoversketch3.gif"/>
			</figure>
		
			<p>As a rule, a game programmer can expect marketing to receive creative suggestions about package design with about as much delight as a surgeon getting advice from a patient on how to operate. My pitch to do a painting in the spirit of old-school Hollywood swashbuckling film posters like Robin Hood (1938) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) earned a &#34;meh.&#34; But I had a staunch ally in my product manager Brian Eheler. He made sure I was invited to the marketing meeting. Nine color comps were considered; this one won.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcoverrough.gif"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>Florczak, our first-choice artist, developed the idea into a detailed sketch (which he sent by fax—this was before e-mail).</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcoverlineart.gif"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>Things went smoothly until the head of marketing balked at the $5500 price to execute it. My June 7 <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/journals/">journal entry</a> records my angst: &#34;After making the rounds and lobbying everyone, I think they&#39;ll OK it, but the whole thing was a really disturbing vote of no confidence in POP.&#34;</p>
			<p>While I crunched to ship the game I&#39;d been working on for three years, the general feeling at Broderbund was that it wouldn&#39;t sell. Foolishly, I&#39;d built Prince of Persia on the Apple II, a decade-old machine that even Apple had stopped supporting. My game had fans at the top and bottom of the company but not in the middle, where the actual marketing got done. Apart from Brian, the QA testers who were playing Prince of Persia daily, and Broderbund&#39;s CEO-founder Doug Carlston, few people believed in it.</p>
			<p>In the next four weeks, while Florczak painted (his friend Kevin Nealon, an actor and Saturday Night Live comedian, posed for the vizier Jaffar), I fixed bugs, added features, and spent four days in New York with my dad, adding his newly-composed music to the game.</p>
			<p>In July, Florczak delivered a lovely painting in 1980s movie-poster style—exactly what Brian and I had hoped for.</p>
		
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcovercolor.jpg"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>But seeing the finished work, marketing thought it was too pulp-sexy. Broderbund had started as a game publisher; by 1989, its emphasis had shifted to educational and productivity software like The Print Shop and Carmen Sandiego. Prince of Persia was out of sync with the company&#39;s new family-friendly direction.</p>
			<p>Marketing sent the painting back to Florczak for revision. I can imagine with what enthusiasm he duly added a green Persian sports bra to the princess&#39;s decolletage. Personally, I preferred the original; but as I wrote in my <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/journals/">journal</a> on July 25: &#34;There are battles you win and battles you lose, and in the big picture, this one is pretty meaningless.&#34;</p>
			<p>Then the whole thing nearly crashed at the final hurdle. The box was shown at a company-wide meeting. A group of employees wrote to the CEO, saying the package condoned violence against women and requesting that it be scrapped. Doug gave a balanced two-page reply, acknowledging their valid concerns (&#34;We don&#39;t want Broderbund ever to be seen in such a light&#34;), but defending Jaffar&#39;s threatening gesture as nonetheless appropriate for a villain in a game whose hero could be &#34;impaled, sliced in two, squashed and otherwise discomforted for relatively minor lapses in behavior.&#34; After a tense week of debate, the box was approved.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popbox.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>The rest is history... sort of. Prince of Persia shipped on Apple II in September 1989, PC in April 1990, then Amiga. It got rave reviews on all three platforms. And it was a flop.</p>
			<p>By July 1990—ten months after launch, three months after the much-anticipated (by me) PC release—fewer than 10,000 red boxes had found their way into gamers&#39; homes. I recorded in my journal: &#34;POP sold 500 units last month on PC, 48 on Apple. That&#39;s about as dead as can be.&#34; In August, the major chain Electronics Boutique de-listed Prince of Persia due to lack of sales. Chilled, I visited the local mall where my game could no longer be found and was told by a saleswoman: &#34;It&#39;s a great game, but the box was horrible.&#34;</p>
			<p>Over the next two years, in a miraculous turnaround that would scarcely be possible today, Prince of Persia was gradually, then suddenly, saved by a confluence of events. First, foreign and console versions, which Broderbund had sublicensed in a dozen different countries on platforms like Nintendo NES, Sega Master System, and NEC 9800, began to ship. There was no coordination; it was the Wild West. Each sublicensee did its own packaging, marketing launch, PR, and distribution, not overseen by Broderbund. The U.S. release flopped, but some of those overseas and console ports became hits.</p>
		
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popcovers.jpg"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>Some licensees used the red-box artwork, others created their own. For the most part, I didn&#39;t see packages until they shipped. Domark&#39;s box art for the UK Sega version made me wince; I still find it offensive, even by that epoch&#39;s standards. It was too late for them to redo the package, but Brian made them promise never to use it outside the UK. (They promised, but forgot.) At the opposite extreme, I loved Katsuya Terada&#39;s gorgeous illustration for the Japanese Nintendo Super FamiCom version. It&#39;s a fan favorite as well; French book publisher Third Editions used Terada&#39;s artwork for the cover of their <a href="https://www.thirdeditions.com/81_jordan-mechner" target="_blank">deluxe collectors&#39; edition</a> of my old journals.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/popboxart/popterada.jpg"/>
			</figure>
			
			<p>The second unanticipated factor that saved Prince of Persia was that the Mac port—which I&#39;d subcontracted to friends at Presage Software—ran two years over schedule. Between 1989 and 1992, Apple released a series of new Mac models: black-and-white and color, with different-sized screens. The Presage team, wanting to take advantage of the latest capabilities, went back to the drawing board and redid the graphics sprites three times. (Each time, I tore my hair out.)</p>
			<p>By the time the Mac version was finally ready, Prince of Persia&#39;s overseas successes had given Brian and me ammunition to persuade Broderbund marketing that the game had untapped potential. Doug okayed our proposal to combine the Mac release with a PC re-release in a bigger, solidly constructed 1990s-style &#34;candy box,&#34; which we hoped retailers and customers would perceive as denoting a higher-quality product than the flip-top, flimsy-cardboard red box (even though the .exe file on the PC disks hadn&#39;t changed).</p>
			<p>San Francisco designer Hock Yeo, of Wong &amp; Yeo, designed a two-piece candy box with an unusual shape reminiscent of an hourglass. If you&#39;re a PC or Mac gamer who played Prince of Persia in the U.S. in the 1990s, this is the box you most likely remember.</p>

			</figure>
		
			<p>The dual Mac-PC release in the oddly-shaped box turned the prince&#39;s fortunes around. A previously untapped cohort of gamers—among them, journalists and editors who used Macs for desktop publishing—were excited to have a game they could play on their new color screens. Prince of Persia became the #1-selling Mac game at a time when most game publishers considered the Mac market too small to bother with. Prince of Persia went from ice-cold to hot on PC as well. Two years after its failed first PC launch, Prince of Persia became a hit.</p>
			<p>I was reminded of all this when Florczak&#39;s artwork popped up on an auction website in December. (Doom co-creator John Romero, an Apple II aficionado, spotted it and sent me the link.) The last time I&#39;d seen the full painting unobscured by a title, logo and stickers, it was propped on a desk in Broderbund&#39;s marketing office. It hung for 33 years on Kevin Nealon&#39;s wall, a thank-you from the artist for modeling the Vizier.</p>
			<p>Seeing it again, now that its role in the drama of that summer of 1989 is ancient history, I can appreciate the painting as an artwork in its own right. The green stripe still bugs me. But a flaw in a Persian carpet only makes the whole more beautiful. And if there&#39;s one thing video games have taught us, it&#39;s that timing is everything. (The collector whose $63,000 bid won last week&#39;s auction would surely agree.) Florczak&#39;s painting joins the ever-expanding collection of diverse physical objects, of all sizes and shapes, that form the tangible record of a video game character&#39;s intangible digital existence.</p>

				<h3>A Prisoner Escapes</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-02-21">⌛ February 21, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>A huge thank you to everyone who bought a print of &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; last month! I was really touched by the warm response from Prince of Persia players who remembered the princess&#39;s brave little companion. I hoped my drawing would evoke fond memories; I didn&#39;t expect the entire edition of 40 prints to sell out in less than 24 hours.</p>
			<p>A number of people wrote to say they wished they&#39;d heard about the release sooner. I cannot print more of &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; (that&#39;s the nature of a limited edition), but I&#39;ve gone ahead and drawn a second author&#39;s tribute artwork, inspired by a gameplay moment in the Prince of Persia dungeon. I&#39;m calling this one &#34;Bones.&#34; If you&#39;ve played level 3, I&#39;m sure you can guess the reason.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed creating these artworks. In the past, when I&#39;ve put pen on paper to draw the world of Prince of Persia, the purpose was to clarify an idea in my head or communicate it to the team during development. To revisit that universe now as a visual artist, seeing the games through the lens of decades of personal memories, is a wonderfully pleasant experience for me.</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<p>&#34;Bones&#34; is available as a giclée print in a signed and numbered limited edition of 40, exclusively <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/art-prints/bones/">here</a>.</p>
			<p>I&#39;m excited to make a second announcement especially for French readers. Book Two of Monte-Cristo, my new graphic novel trilogy with the wonderful illustrator Mario Alberti, will be in bookstores in France on March 22. It&#39;s a tale of thwarted love, unjust imprisonment, and a daring escape — a modern update of the Alexandre Dumas classic transposed to post-9/11 America.</p>
			<p>In 2005, Sam Castillo is a happy young man—promoted to contractor, engaged to his sweetheart Abby—until three enemies conspire to frame him as a terrorist. Rendered to a black-site prison an ocean away, Sam befriends a brilliant, multi-lingual fellow detainee who educates him in the ways of the world... and bestows on him the key to a secret fortune. 17 years later, Sam resurfaces with a new identity as enigmatic billionaire Victor Sirin, and a plan to take revenge against the three men who stole his life.</p>
			<p>Monte Cristo T2: The Island will be released in France by Editions Glénat on March 22. You can read about it, preview it live, and pre-order it online <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/monte-cristo/">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>A Faithful Friend</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2023-01-24">⌛ January 24, 2023</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>Happy New Year! 2023 will be an exciting year, with new releases and announcements lined up.</p>
			<p>To start off January, I want to share a nostalgic artwork that I was recently inspired to create. It&#39;s a tribute to a delightful moment Prince of Persia fans may remember from the original 2D game. I&#39;ve titled it &#34;A Faithful Friend.&#34;</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/a-faithful-friend.jpg"/>
			</figure>

			<p>The following video clip (from Level 8) shows why the little white mouse — sent by the princess to help the prince in a dark dungeon moment — is one of my favorite characters. I added the mouse to the game in August 1989, when Prince of Persia was already well into beta testing. Today, no publisher would let a developer slip in a feature like that at the last minute.</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<figure>
				<iframe width="100%" height="300" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ag_yDAPsFD4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
			</figure>

			<p>I drew &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; as an author&#39;s tribute, not just to a memorable moment in a game that&#39;s meant so much to me, but to the teams, collaborators, and fans who have supported and kept its legacy vibrant for 33 years. Without you, there&#39;d be no Prince of Persia.</p>
			<p>If you&#39;d like to own a hand-signed limited edition giclée print of this original artwork, &#34;A Faithful Friend&#34; is <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/art-prints/a-faithful-friend/">available here</a>. Tomoe, my local fine-art printer in Montpellier, printed 40 in total. I&#39;ve stamped, signed and numbered them. Once they&#39;re sold out, the edition won&#39;t be reprinted; this protects its value for collectors.</p>
			<p>Having spent most of the past four decades creating digitally, I appreciate more and more the tactile qualities of handmade physical objects. My ink line these days is finer than was possible on a 280 x 192 computer, but I&#39;ve respected the restricted Apple II color palette. As for the 8-bit hand stamp (my personal logo), I expect old-school gamers will quickly recognize its source.</p>
			<p>I&#39;ll share next month&#39;s announcements here in this space, and in my monthly newsletter. As subscribers already know, I&#39;ve also recently joined Mastodon, and will be tooting there as well. Thanks for following!</p>

				<h3>On Graphic Novel Writing</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2022-07-05">⌛ July 5, 2022</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>Thanks to all the early adopters who showed up for the French launch of Monte Cristo, Book One! Our May festival and bookstore signings were a great occasion for illustrator Mario Alberti and me to see each other in person. (Mario lives and works in Trieste, I&#39;m in Montpellier.)</p>
			<p>Here&#39;s a sneak peek at our work-in-progress on Book Two of the trilogy: &#34;The Island,&#34; on track for early 2023 release. Mario has drawn the first 19 pages (only 51 to go!), working in B&amp;W grayscale, with color to be added at the end. He began by storyboarding the full 70-page book, working from my script; we thrashed out details via Slack and Zoom.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/mc/mct2-bw-ex.gif"/>
			</figure>

			<p>For those curious about the graphic-novel collaborative process, here are the script and rough storyboard excerpts for the panels above:</p>

			<figure>

			</figure>

		</div>

				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/mc/mct2-sb-ex.gif"/>
			</figure>

			<p>Every project, and writer-artist pairing, is unique. Sometimes writers dictate page layouts and panel compositions in detail. For me to do that with an artist of Mario&#39;s caliber would feel like telling a film D.P. what lens to use. I &#34;see&#34; panels in my mind&#39;s eye as I write, but that doesn&#39;t mean Mario needs to draw them exactly that way. A comics artist&#39;s job is like a film director, D.P., set designer, cast and crew rolled into one. In writing, whether for a graphic novel or film/TV, I try to suggest my ideas for panels and shots (and casting, and actors&#39; performances...) indirectly through word choice and phrasing, rather than &#34;do it this way.&#34; I want the script to be specific enough to make scenes and moments come alive in the reader&#39;s (director&#39;s, illustrator&#39;s, actor&#39;s) imagination — then leave them enough room to create those moments anew as only they can.</p>
			<p>That said, to fit a dense, complex story into 70 large-format pages is a writer&#39;s, not an illustrator&#39;s, job. In my script for Monte-Cristo, I do specify page breaks. (I knew the panels above would be near the bottom of page 2, and that it would be a left-hand page.) But again, every project is different. For an in-depth look at the creative process on another graphic novel — Templar, with illustrators LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland — check out this <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/templar/#free-downloads">free 86-page e-book</a>.</p>
			<p>Now, back to work — Mario on pages 20-21, and me (since I&#39;ve already written the scripts for the three books) on projects not yet announced. Monte Cristo T1: &#34;The Prisoner&#34; is in French comic book stores now. You can read about it (and read reviews, and download color PDF excerpts) <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/books/monte-cristo/">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>A Last Express Milestone</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2022-04-19">⌛ April 19, 2022</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>The Last Express left the station 25 years ago this month, on 3 CD-ROMs — shipping on PC and Mac in April 1997 after an intense 4-year development. It&#39;s a game that will always be close to my heart. In honor of the anniversary, Dotemu is <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/projects/the-last-express/">offering the game at 75% discount</a> on iOS and Steam from April 19-May 3 (on Android until April 26).</p>
			<p>To mark the occasion, I&#39;m adding two new items to the Last Express section on this site&#39;s <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/library/">library page</a>: The original 1993 game script that Tomi Pierce and I wrote for the game production, and the movie adaptation I wrote for director Paul Verhoeven in 2010 (three years after his Black Book, which I loved). We never got to make the movie, so you&#39;ll have to judge for yourself whether it would have worked on screen.</p>

			<p>I&#39;ve had my French driver&#39;s license and mobile phone for two years now, but it took me a little longer to get this website switched over. As of today, <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/">jordanmechner.com</a> is bilingual. (To change languages, click on the icon in the upper right.)</p>
			<p>Now, I get to make my first announcement in French and English: In May 2022, Glénat/Comixburo will release Volume 1 of my new graphic novel trilogy, Monte Cristo. It&#39;s a modern update of Alexandre Dumas&#39; timeless tale of betrayed love, revenge, and redemption, transposed to post-9/11 America and today&#39;s globalized world. The illustrator is the wonderful Mario Alberti (The Wall).</p>
			<p>Monte Cristo will be published first in France as three 72-page hardcover volumes. Volume 1, &#34;The Prisoner,&#34; will be in bookstores in early May; it&#39;s now available for pre-order. Volumes 2 and 3, &#34;The Island&#34; and &#34;The Storm&#34;, will be released next year. If you&#39;d like to be notified when an English version is announced, you can subscribe to my monthly e-mail newsletter <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/">here</a>.</p>

		</div>

			<p>My last two book launches (Samak the Ayyar and The Making of Prince of Persia) were virtual, for 2020-21 reasons. I&#39;m happy to say that for Monte Cristo, Mario Alberti and I will be doing in-person book signings in Paris, Montpellier, and a few other cities. I hope to see some of you there. I can&#39;t wait for readers to discover this new adventure.</p>

				<h3>Summer Reading</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2021-07-26">⌛ July 26, 2021</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>This week, I&#39;m excited to share two new book releases.</p>
			<p>
				<cite>Samak the Ayyar</cite> is a wonderful, thousand-year-old Persian adventure saga that I&#39;ve had the honor to adapt in its first English-language translation. It&#39;s the source material my Prince of Persia games (and movie) always wanted but never had. You can <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/projects/samak/">read about the project&#39;s origins (and download a free sample chapter) here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>You can order <cite>Samak</cite> on Amazon, or direct from Columbia University Press, via the <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/store/samak-the-ayyar">store</a>. If you order from the publisher, enter the code CUP20 for a 20% discount.</p>
			<p>My other July book release is the third in a trilogy: <cite>Year 3 in France</cite>, 166 pages of my sketchbook journal from 2018-19, the third year after I moved to France from L.A. for a video game project. Like the first two volumes, it&#39;s a small, high-quality print run from local publisher Tomoe.</p>
			<p>I&#39;ve signed a stack of books, so the first 30 people to order Year 3 from the online <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/store/sketch-journal-year-3-in-france">store</a> will receive signed copies.</p>
			<p><cite>Year 2</cite> has sold out its print run, but you can get signed copies of all three books at <a href="https://www.chicagogamespace.com/exhibitions/sketchjournalofjordanmechner" target="_blank">Chicago Gamespace</a>, where my sketch art is on exhibit thru August 23. It&#39;s a unique space dedicated to video game culture and art, well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the Chicago area.</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<p>The Chicago show also includes a new print from <cite>Year 3</cite>: &#34;Les Beatnik Modernes&#34;, in a <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/store/beatnik-modernes">signed and numbered limited edition of 10</a>. It&#39;s a sketch I did in May 2019 at a café just up the street. I&#39;ve missed sketching in cafés, and can&#39;t wait to rekindle the habit.</p>

				<h3>A Tale of Ancient Persia</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2021-02-16">⌛ February 16, 2021</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>I&#39;m excited to share a very special project. It&#39;s been my honor to adapt a wonderful, thousand-year-old Persian adventure saga in its first English-language edition — <cite>Samak the Ayyar</cite>.</p>
			<p>Despite having spent a certain number of the past 30 years delving into Persian culture and lore for video game and film development-related purposes, I&#39;d never heard of Samak (or ayyars) until the day my translator and collaborator Freydoon Rassouli took down a dusty out-of-print volume from his shelf and said: &#34;This is what you&#39;ve been looking for.&#34;</p>
			<p>As he began reading to me from its pages, translating on the fly from archaic Persian, shivers ran down my spine. Here was a fantastic adventure set in ninth-century Persia, featuring a treacherous vizier, a star-crossed romance between a noble prince and princess, kings, warriors, and an agile trickster hero who scales walls and sneaks into palaces. It was the source material my Prince of Persia games (and movie) had always wanted but never had. But since I don&#39;t read Persian (and even most Persians don&#39;t read 900-year-old manuscripts), I couldn&#39;t read it.</p>
			<p>I really, really needed to read that book. So... we wrote it. <cite>Samak the Ayyar</cite> will be released in paperback this August from Columbia University Press.</p>
			<p>What are ayyars? A concept as specific to Persia as ronin and samurai are to Japan, and as universal. Samak is a hero and bandit, a man of the people with the skills of a ninja and the ideals of a knight. You could call him a Persian Robin Hood, but he and his band of male and female ayyars have a unique and compelling spirit all their own. Armed with a dagger, a lasso, and his wits, he accomplishes things even kings can&#39;t.</p>

			<p>If you appreciate the <cite>1001 Nights</cite>, or classic tales of world folklore, I hope you&#39;ll be as enchanted by Samak&#39;s adventures as I am. You can read more about the book (and pre-order it, once it becomes available in your territory) <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/store/samak-the-ayyar">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Why I Keep a Journal</h3>
				<p><time datetime="2020-08-25">⌛ August 25, 2020</time>
			</p></div>
			
		
		<div>

			<p>
				I&#39;ve always been fascinated by other people&#39;s stories. In my twenties — dreaming of making video games, books, movies — I devoured memoirs and interviews with my role models, hungering for insight on how they&#39;d done it. Published journals were most rare and valuable of all, because they were a raw record of experience: written in the heat of the moment, not shaped and burnished into a smooth narrative with hindsight.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was 17 when I started keeping my own journal. I kept up the habit, filling dozens of spiral-bound notebooks over the years. I thought I&#39;d never show them to anybody.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cumulative power of daily practice is well known but still amazes me. Ten years ago, my brother David picked up a ukulele and started strumming. Now he&#39;s a ukulele player. A behavior becomes a routine, a habit, and finally a trait. The things we do every day shape us, literally: We become a guitarist, a smoker, a programmer or athlete or stoner, by doing something for the first time, then keeping it up.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&#39;m a journal-keeper. With over a hundred notebooks filled since 1982, it&#39;s become part of who I am. I couldn&#39;t have expected or anticipated all the ways my new habit would enrich my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if we never reread what we write in our journals, the act of writing changes us. It shapes our perceptions and memory. Over time, opening the notebook and picking up the pen becomes like resuming a long-running conversation with a friend. We develop a voice, even though there&#39;s no one on the other end to hear it — or rather, our self is listening.
			</p>
			<p>
				I decided to publish my own 1980s journals — begun as a Yale college freshman, while I was making my first video games, Karateka and Prince of Persia — when enough years had passed that their value as a time capsule outweighed my embarrassment. I still cringe rereading certain entries, but I&#39;m glad the journals exist. They contain hard-won experience I wish I could have had the benefit of when I was 20.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keeping a journal has special value for anyone engaged in a creative project. Reading pages written a year ago, or five, or twenty, can help reveal the big arc of our lives, and illuminate the present. Past journal entries remind us of intentions, resolves, lessons forgotten. They bring home how much of our worries, schemes and plans are transient, even quaint in retrospect.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/images/news/artworks/why-journal.jpg"/>
			</figure>

		</div>
		<div>

			<p>In the four years it took me to make the first Prince of Persia game on the Apple II, my journal did more than record my creative process: it was part of it. I used my notebook as a sounding board — wrestling with design challenges, discarding ideas and sparking new ones in the act of writing. In dark moments I poured out my angst, questioned whether I was on the right path, if the game was even worth finishing. More than once, my journal brought me back from the brink and helped me find the clarity and confidence to continue. Some entries capture the exact moment of illumination when I hit upon a solution I&#39;d been groping toward in the dark. For all the digital and technological advancement of the past half-century, pen and paper may still be the tool that comes closest to being able to record thought.</p>
			<p>
				For every entry that makes me feel smart, there&#39;s a youthful wise reflection like this one: &#34;The games business is drying up. There&#39;s no guarantee there will even be a computer games market a couple of years from now.&#34; (July 1985) Or: &#34;I&#39;ve grown middle-aged these last few years. Roland is 23 but he&#39;s still young at heart.&#34; (Written when I was 22.) Rereading such passages is a joy that only journal-keepers know.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final PC version of Prince of Persia that shipped thirty years ago, in April 1990, is so familiar now it feels inevitable. It&#39;s easy to forget that it was once a fragile thing in flux. My journal reminds me of roads not taken, of how easily things could have turned out differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				These days, I keep my journal in a Hobonichi Techo — a compact format that reinforces the practice of one page a day, neatly fitting a year into the palm of my hand, a decade in a shoebox. I&#39;ve found poignant solace in this month of confinement, April 2020, flipping back a few dozen pages to see how many of my concerns and decisions of February have been rendered irrelevant, while a few mattered more than I knew.
			</p>
			<p>
				A journal keeps us honest and tethers us to truth. In George Orwell&#39;s 1984, the protagonist&#39;s first act of resistance to brainwashing is to start secretly keeping a diary — a crime not explicitly forbidden, but punishable by death, because it threatens a totalitarian state&#39;s power to retroactively rewrite history.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like a yardstick calibrated in millimeters, a journal holds both the detail and the scope of life. Our human condition is to live one moment at a time; we&#39;re never given more than that. Of all the gifts journaling gives us, maybe that&#39;s the greatest: The simple practice of making daily marks on paper, like mental push-ups, can strengthen the part of us that tries to rise above the timeline, to see a pattern and bigger picture — and, paradoxically, also strengthen the part of us that can learn to treasure the present moment.
