          <p>Let’s make a gzipped file and see what’s in it. We’ll keep it simple: just write 8 ‘a’s to a file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ echo &#34;aaaaaaaa&#34; &gt; test.out
$ xxd test.out
00000000: 6161 6161 6161 6161 0a     aaaaaaaa.
</code></pre><p>As we can see, our file is 9 bytes long. We have 8 ‘a’ bytes written, plus a Line Feed (LF) character written at the end.</p>
<p>Let’s make the gzip file now. We’ll do <code>gzip -1</code>, since that will use the fastest compression mode and give us more things to talk about.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ gzip -1 test.out
$ xxd test.out.gz
00000000: 1f8b 0808 bf35 6a61 0403 7465 7374 2e6f  .....5ja..test.o
00000010: 7574 004b 4c84 002e 00b6 66d7 ad09 0000  ut.KL.....f.....
00000020: 00
</code></pre><p><em>Disclaimer: I made this post as a learning exercise, and any mistakes I make here are my own. I enjoy low level programming but do web dev at Teams as my day job.</em></p>
<h2 id="gzip-specific-info">gzip specific info</h2>
<p>The first few bytes are quite straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>1f8b</code> - “magic”, hardcoded gzip header</li>
<li><code>08</code> - Signifies DEFLATE compression method</li>
<li><code>08(00001000)</code> - bit 3 is set, so there will be a filename</li>
<li><code>bf35 6a61</code> - timestamp of UTC Saturday, October 16, 2021 2:15:27 AM</li>
<li><code>04</code> - compressor used fastest algo (that’s what the -1 was for)</li>
<li><code>03</code> - Unix operating system (useful for LF/CLRF)</li>
</ol>
<p>The next few bytes are the filename:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>74 65 73 74 2e 6f 75 74 00
t  e  s  t  .  o  u  t  NUL
</code></pre><h2 id="the-deflated-data">The deflated data</h2>
<p>The data starts from byte 0x13, with 4b. To decode, we’ll need to see the individual bits since DEFLATE packs the information in bits that can cross the byte boundary. It’s not uncommon to have codes that are 5 bits or 9 bits.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ xxd -s 19 -b test.out.gz
00000013: 01001011 01001100 10000100 00000000 00101110 00000000  KL....

0000001f: 00000000 00000000
</code></pre><p>Let’s break it down. Unfortunately, xxd prints out the bytes one by one, from MSB to LSB. But in gzip, the bytes are packed LSB to MSB. So we have to reverse the strings byte by byte. Let’s also define some convenience functions to help us compute numbers</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>8bitswise: 11010010   00110010 00100001 00000000 01110100 00000000

</code></pre><p>1 - final block</p>
<p>01 - compressed with fixed huffman codes (don’t forget that although the bitstream says “10”, it is read as 01 because the data literals are to be interpreted in little endian format)</p>
<p>Next we have to decode the huffman codes. If you haven’t read <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1951#page-12">the official DEFLATE spec</a>, the gist of fixed (aka static) huffman codes is that they are a bunch of agreed upon huffman codes that range from 7-9 bits long. As with all huffman codes, each code is prefix free, which means that as you read the bitstream bit by bit, there’s never any ambiguitity about when each code ends.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure, read section 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 (fixed huffman codes) of the DEFLATE spec before continuing on or it won’t make much sense. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code">The Wikipedia page for canonical Huffman codes is also a good read.</a></p>
<p>I’ve included the huffman table from the spec below:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Lit Value    Bits        Codes
---------    ----        -----
  0 - 143     8          00110000 through
                         10111111
144 - 255     9          110010000 through
                         111111111
256 - 279     7          0000000 through
                         0010111
280 - 287     8          11000000 through
                         11000111
</code></pre><p>To decode the huffman codes, we have to (possibly) read up to the next 9 bits. We’ll start by reading the bitstream bit by bit, until we identify a prefix that uniquely identifies which character it is. You can conceptually think of this as walking down the edges of the huffman tree.</p>
<p>Side note: Huffman decoders will usually just read 9 bits straight away, look them up in a table, and then “put back” whatever bits it didn’t need, instead of wasting precious CPU cycles reading bit by bit.</p>
<p>Our next 9 bits is <code>100100011</code> - this has the prefix 100, which tells us that is a literal between 0-143. So it is only 8 bits (1001 0001).</p>
<p><em>Don’t forget that the huffman codes are packed LSB to MSB, but are to be interpreted as an integer in big endian format. Why this insanity?</em> ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ …</p>
<p>Decoding, we get: val = (10010001 subtract 00110000) = 145 - 48 = 97</p>
<p>97 is the ASCII for ‘a’. Perfect!</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the bits, we get:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1 10 10010001 10010001 0000100  00000       00111010    0000000    00
     97       97         260     0            58          256      -
     &#39;a&#39;      &#39;a&#39;    repeat 6x  1 behind    0x10 (LF)    HALT     &lt;padding&gt;
     LIT      LIT       LEN     DIST        LIT         
</code></pre><p>Those are our 8 ‘a’s! two literals followed by a repeat of 6 ‘a’s, then a LF.</p>
<p>The “repeat 6x, 1 behind” is a length+distance (LEN,DIST) code, and it tells the decoder that the character to be repeated is the previous one that it just decoded. Which is ‘a’, in this case.</p>
<p>Not too shabby, we’ve encoded our 8 ‘a’s and LF (originally 72 bits) into 46 bits with 2 padding bits.</p>
<p>But I feel that gzip could have done better, though. It could have simply encoded a single <code>a</code> followed by 261, which is the code to repeat 7 times. I thought this was because I ran <code>gzip -1</code>, but running regular gzip seems to repro this. I don’t understand why this is the case and I hope someone can explain this.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-off---checksum-and-size">Finishing off - checksum and size</h2>
<p>Let’s finish off the gzip file. Next we’re supposed to see a CRC32. Going to an <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc32.html">online crc32 tool</a>, we see that the uncompressed 8 ‘a’s with a line feed will generate: <code>ad d7 66 b6</code>.
Indeed, if we look at the hex stream again:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ xxd test.out.gz
00000000: 1f8b 0808 bf35 6a61 0403 7465 7374 2e6f  .....5ja..test.o
00000010: 7574 004b 4c84 002e 00b6 66d7 ad09 0000  ut.KL.....f.....
00000020: 00                    ^^^^^^^^^^
                                  Here!
</code></pre><p>We can clearly see <code>b6 66 d7 ad</code>, in little endian byte order. This is the crc checksum.</p>
<p>The next 4 bytes <code>09 00 00 00</code> is little endian byte order for 9 bytes. Indeed, we decoded 9 bytes, and there are 9 bytes in our input file.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So this is the file breakdown:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>gzip info: 1f8b 0808 bf35 6a61 0403 
filename: 7465 7374 2e6f 7574 00 
DEFLATE data: 4b 4c 84 00 2e 00
crc32: b6 66 d7 ad 
size: 09 00 00 00                
</code></pre><p>Of course, this barely scratches the surface - the real meat of the gzip algorithm is the dynamic huffman codes. In the future, I want to write a part 2 covering this but it will probably be less <em>by hand</em>-ish, and more of an explanatory algorithm to inflate the huffman tables. I tried doing dynamic codes by hand and I quickly ran out of patience after an hour.</p>
