    <h1>Show HN: C3 â€“ A C alternative that looks like C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Compiler link: <a href="https://github.com/c3lang/c3c" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/c3lang/c3c</a><p>Docs: <a href="http://www.c3-lang.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.c3-lang.org</a></p><p>This is my follow-up &#34;Show HN&#34; from roughly a year ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27876570" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27876570</a>). Since then the language design has evolved and the compiler has gotten much more solid.</p><p>Assorted extra info:</p><p>- The C3 name is a homage to the C2 language project (<a href="http://c2lang.org" rel="nofollow">http://c2lang.org</a>) which it was originally inspired by.</p><p>- Although C3 mostly conforms to C syntax, the most obvious change is requiring `fn` in front of the functions. This is to simplify searching for definitions in editors.</p><p>- There is a comparison with some other languages here: <a href="http://www.c3-lang.org/compare/" rel="nofollow">http://www.c3-lang.org/compare/</a></p><p>- The parts in C3 which breaks C semantics or syntax: <a href="http://www.c3-lang.org/changesfromc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.c3-lang.org/changesfromc/</a></p><p>- Aside from the very C-like syntax, one the biggest difference between C3 and other &#34;C competitors&#34; is that C3 prioritizes C ABI compatibility, so that all C3 special types (such as slices and optionals) can be used from C without any effort. C and C3 can coexist nicely in a code base.</p><p>- Currently the standard library is not even alpha quality, it&#39;s actively being built, but there is a `libc` module which allows accessing all of libc. Raylib is available to use from C3 with MacOS and Windows, see: <a href="https://github.com/c3lang/vendor" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/c3lang/vendor</a></p><p>- There is a blog with assorted articles I&#39;ve written during the development: <a href="https://c3.handmade.network/blog" rel="nofollow">https://c3.handmade.network/blog</a></p></div></div>
