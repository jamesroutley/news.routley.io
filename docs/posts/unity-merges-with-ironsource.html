    <h1>Unity merges with IronSource</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Unity announced today that it has entered into an agreement to merge with ironSource, harnessing the company&#39;s tools, platform, technology, and talent to form an end-to-end platform that enables creators to more easily create, publish, run, monetize, and grow live games and RT3D content seamlessly.</p>

<p>We continue to believe that the world is a better place with more creators in it. Over the past year, we’ve been making sure we have the right tools and focus that are delivering the most value to our user community, particularly as the industry evolves. Today, games don’t launch - they live. Players want connection - they want to play with each other, and be social. And we see that these trends are extending beyond gaming.</p>

<p>As a result, we have focused on fine-tuning our platform of tools, solutions, and services that deliver and accelerate value to creators - regardless of what engine they choose to build on. From the general availability of <a href="https://blog.unity.com/games/build-your-live-game-in-a-single-modular-platform-with-unity-gaming-services" target="_blank">Unity Gaming Services</a> to our recent acquisitions of <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/parsec-is-now-part-of-unity" target="_blank">Parsec</a>, <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-syncsketch" target="_blank">SyncSketch</a>,  <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital" target="_blank">Wētā Digital</a>, and <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-ziva-dynamics" target="_blank">Ziva Dynamics</a>, to the work we continue to deliver in the core Unity tools and in Operate, we are focused on delivering outsized value for creators. </p>

<p>Our vision is to provide creators with a powerful, flexible engine that they can realize their visions through - quickly and beautifully - while introducing the tools that help them learn and better understand their audiences, helping them to more quickly iterate and improve to build a robust and scalable business from. As we move closer to this vision today, we couldn’t be more excited about bringing ironSource into the Unity family.</p>

<p>If you don’t know ironSource, they bring a proven record of helping creators focus on what creators do best – bringing great apps and user experiences to life – while enabling business expansion in the app economy. ironSource’s suite of tools and solutions provides the majority of the world’s top games and many of the leading non-gaming apps with the monetization, marketing, analytics, and discovery capabilities they need to build and run scalable app-based businesses. The combination of both companies will accelerate Unity’s growth as a software company powering the creator economy end-to-end. For our community, it will drive tighter integration between Operate and Create solutions and deliver the best potential combination of value to creators, publishers, and advertisers - in games and beyond.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>We believe that ironSource’s enhancements for Unity’s Operate Solutions will instantaneously yield immediate benefit to creators. Operate’s mission is to enable the success of our creators to deliver the best player experiences and <strong><em>build robust businesses</em></strong>. An important tool for this is Unity Ads - our monetization solution for mobile games that enables game developers to monetize their entire player base. Advertising has long been and we believe will continue to be <em>the</em> economic engine for mobile games, driving players into their games and driving revenue at scale.  Although advertising is facing some temporary challenges right now due to macroeconomic factors, this is a business that has proven itself resilient despite the many ups and downs of economic cycles and regulatory changes. By joining forces with ironSource, the right opportunity presented itself for Unity to go bold and further our mission to be the economic engine/driver for our creators&#39; success so creators can continue their craft of making games. It also reinforces our strong conviction in the long-term strength and growth of the in-game advertising business. Unity and ironSource’s complementary data and product capabilities will give creators access to better funding for user acquisition (UA) and monetization to successfully scale their games and accelerate their economic performance. </p>

<p>ironSource will also help creators expand cross-channel discovery, UA, and monetization channels for creators through Aura, and yield new creative and analytics capabilities through Luna. Moreover, the combined reach of Unity &amp; ironSource’s 3B+ monthly active users (MAUs) provides scale and data benefits that will deliver better performance for customers, including improved return on ad spend (ROAS) for ad buyers and monetization for publishers.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>With ironSource, Unity will take the linear process of making games and RT3D content and experiences and make it an interconnected and interactive one - creating the opportunity to innovate and improve at every step of the cycle. </p>

<p>What if that process was no longer &#34;first create; then monetize?”  What if creators had an engine for live games that by default enabled them to gain early indicators of success for their games through user acquisition of their prototype, and gave them a feedback loop to improve their games based on real player interactions as early in the process as possible? Unity and ironSource’s combined offerings will uniquely position the combined company as the only game creation and growth platform for creators.</p>

<p>This tighter integration between Unity’s Create and Operate means a more powerful flywheel and data feedback loop that further supports creators’ success and understanding of what’s working between gameplay, design and their monetization efforts. With the addition of SuperSonic, ironSource’s publishing solution, the combined company will also break down the barriers to publishing directly through the engine.</p>

<p>Unity provides the engine that takes ideas from inception to being viable businesses. This is an engine that negates the need for developers and the industry at large to reinvent the wheel each time a game is created. The gears of this include the tools to create, publish, run, monetize, and grow. It is this integration with ironSource, and the resulting interactivity and interoperability across the game lifecycle, that makes Unity + ironSource unique. It is our combined knowledge and passion for game developers that keeps us innovating to meet their needs today and in the future. </p>

<p>We succeed only if creators succeed and with ironSource joining the Unity family, we will make it easier for them to do so in one centralized, integrated platform. </p>
