    <h1>Recoverable and Irrecoverable Decisions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When you need to make an anxiety-inducing decision, ask yourself: What is the worst realistic outcome? Will you be able to recover from it?</p>



<p>Let’s say you want to make a product and sell it, and you need to invest in inventory. The manufacturer needs you to order $1,000 worth to meet their minimum. The worst outcome: you only sell to a few friends. Can you recover from spending nearly $1,000? If not, how do you put yourself in a position to recover from it? In other words, how can you make this decision more recoverable? </p>



<p>Or, can you make an irrecoverable outcome less likely or drastic (by taking pre-orders, earning extra with a part-time job or freelancing, or selling some old devices or clothes you don’t use—amongst many other ideas)? </p>



<p>Keep in mind: when you’re in a good position, <a href="https://herbertlui.net/five-lessons-ive-learned-about-life-from-playing-board-games/">you can win in all sorts of ways</a>. </p>



<p>Here’s a day-to-day example: A haircut is recoverable because it grows back. Yes, a bad haircut can feel mortifying, but it won’t be permanent. It’s still a decision—and for some, anxiety-inducing—but it’s one you will recover from.</p>



<p>Conventional leadership advice suggests looking at decisions as <a href="https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/">reversible or non-reversible</a>. Many important, non-reversible, decisions are recoverable, though. The more recoverable a decision is, the more useful it is to <a href="https://herbertlui.net/a-bias-for-action-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-on-how-to-stop-overthinking/">bias for action</a>.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurship involves the skill of making more decisions recoverable.</p>
