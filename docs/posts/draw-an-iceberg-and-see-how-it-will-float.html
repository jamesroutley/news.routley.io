    <p>Icebergs are less dense than water, so they always float with about 10% of their mass above the water. But which way up? An iceberg wouldn’t float <i>exactly</i> like on this page in reality. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.</p>

I went to the trouble of painting a stable iceberg with my watercolors, so plz hear me out.</p>— Megan Thompson-Munson (@GlacialMeg) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlacialMeg/status/1362557149147058178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></blockquote>
