    <h1>Tell HN: 3G sunsetting is remotely killing every Subaru Outback battery</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Subaru partnered with a service called STARLINK which shares your location in the event of collisions, among other things.</p><p>STARLINK intermittently tries to phone home by hitting 3G towers.</p><p>Now that 3G is shutting down, the digital communications module (DCM) gets stuck in an infinite loop of</p><p>1. Phone home, expending battery charge
2. Fail, because 3G doesn&#39;t work anymore
3. Go back to step 1</p><p>This effectively remotely drains the battery of every Subaru Outback  built between 2015 and 2020.</p><p>Even if you drive your car every day, its battery will die and you won&#39;t be able to start it.</p><p>Other models are probably affected, too.</p><p>There was a class action lawsuit. But this is a pretty egregious engineering oversight, given they were still producing defective cars in 2020, hardly two years before 3G flipped off.</p><p>Will a brand ever produce a reliable, mechanical car? Why should 3G towers have anything to do with my car being able to start?</p></div></div></div>
