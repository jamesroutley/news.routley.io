    <h1>Brazil justice orders ban of video platform Rumble</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered video sharing platform Rumble to be taken offline in the Latin American country within 24 hours. </p>

<p>In his decision, Moraes said Rumble has not complied with court orders, such as appointing a legal representative for <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/brazil/t-19068233">Brazil</a>. Moraes also said the video platform must pay pending legal fines. </p>

<h2>Moraes: Rumble must take down platform of Allan Dos Santos</h2>

<p>Rumble has &#34;repeatedly, consciously and willingly not complied, and is trying not to submit to Brazil&#39;s legal order and judiciary,&#34; Moraes asserted. </p>

<p>Moraes also said Rumble refused to comply with a court order that mandated the platform take down the channel of Brazilian conservative journalist Allan dos Santos.  </p><figure><img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="69964452" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/69964452_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes in Brasilia, Brazil on August 14, 2024"/><figcaption>Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes is loathed by the far-right and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro [FILE: August 14, 2024]<small>Image: Eraldo Peres/AP/picture alliance </small></figcaption></figure>

<p>Dos Santos, who is based in the southern US state of Florida, is a staunch supporter of former <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/jair-bolsonaro/t-48797570">Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro</a>. He is a fugitive in Brazil for his role in spreading disinformation, with Moraes seeking the extradition of Dos Santos. </p><h2>Rumble accuses Moraes of &#39;unprecedented censorship&#39;</h2>

<p>In response, Rumble said the platform is experiencing &#34;unprecedented censorship in Brazil.&#34; The company, which has headquarters in both Canada and Florida, said Morae&#39;s orders are &#34;in response to our refusal to censor political dissidents residing in the United States.&#34;</p>

<p>Rumble is responsible for the back-services for <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump/t-19434433">US President Donald Trump&#39;s</a> Truth Social media site. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Rumble and the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group sued Moraes, accusing him of infringing on the free speech protections of the First Amendment of the US constitution. The lawsuit referenced Dos Santos as Political Dissident A.</p>

<p>&#34;Allowing Justice Moraes to muzzle a vocal user on an American digital outlet would jeopardize our country&#39;s bedrock commitment to open and robust debate,&#34; that lawsuit said. &#34;Neither extraterritorial dictates nor judicial overreach from abroad can override the freedoms protected by the US Constitution and law.&#34;</p>

<p>A venture capital company co-founded by current Vice President JD Vance invested in Rumble in 2021. JD Vance has expressed concerns about free speech in countries <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/vance-criticizes-germanys-free-speech-laws-at-cpac-summit/a-71706133">outside of the US such as Germany</a>, and said these concerns would drive foreign policy under the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/trump-administration-sparks-fears-of-censorship-to-us-arts-scene/a-71675389">Trump administration</a>. </p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Governments vs X: What does it mean for us?

<p>The crackdown on Rumble in Brazil comes after Moraes ordered the suspension of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/x-formerly-twitter/t-38240794">X</a>, also for failing to appoint a legal representative in the country.  Although Musk was angered by the order, the company eventually complied with Moraes&#39; demands around a month later, with X being brought back online in Brazil. </p>

<p>Moraes is a powerful figure in Brazilian politics. Supporters believe his rulings are necessary to protect Brazil&#39;s relatively young democracy, whereas detractors believe he is engaged in judicial overreach. </p>
