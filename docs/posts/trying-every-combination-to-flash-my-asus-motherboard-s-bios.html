    <h1>Trying every combination to flash my Asus motherboard&#39;s BIOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Use an <a href="https://amzn.to/3E4IAwc">old-fashioned USB 2.0 flash drive</a>, format it FAT32, download the firmware, make sure it&#39;s named correctly, and use the motherboard&#39;s &#39;BIOS Flashback&#39; option after powering off the computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This past week, I devoted far too much time to the task of updating my brand new motherboard&#39;s BIOS.</p>

<p>It started with a combo deal from Micro Center: a <a href="https://amzn.to/3lrwLti">ASUS ROG Strix B650E-F Gaming WiFi motherboard</a>, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3YMsNKg">Ryzen 9 7900x</a> CPU, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3YDkr8g">G.Skill Flare X5 Series 32GB DDR5-6000 memory kit</a>, all for $599. Quite a beefy upgrade for the main PC I use to compile code and do random Linux-y tasks.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/4090-amd-7900x-motherboard-build-on-desk-open-benchtable-bc1.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-c0955013-df3d-4412-a95f-eb70a79c11f8" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;c0955013-df3d-4412-a95f-eb70a79c11f8&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Nvidia RTX 4090 on AMD 7900x platform"/></p>

<p>So I popped everything together, made sure it benchmarked as expected, tested an Intel Arc A750 in preparation for testing on a Raspberry Pi, and then decided the 7900x&#39;s egregious power consumption wasn&#39;t to my liking—the thing <strong>idled over 90W</strong>, and would eat up over 285W while compiling Linux!</p>

<p>I wanted to enable <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/ryzen-7000-series-processors-let-s-talk-about-power-temperature/ba-p/554629">AMD&#39;s &#39;Eco&#39; mode</a>, which limits the TDP from the stock 170W to either 105W or 65W. And in my own benchmarking (which happened later on, but I&#39;m including the data here because it&#39;s kinda insane), <strong>the CPU got about 96% of its 170W performance when I limited it to 105W</strong>. And at that level, it idled at 45W and maxed out at 206W. Much better.</p>

<h2>Updating the BIOS - Not so EZ</h2>

<p>Knowing from past experience how BIOS Flashback can be flaky, I decided to try ASUS&#39; &#39;EZ Flash&#39; UI.</p>

<p>First I downloaded the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b650e-f-gaming-wifi-model/helpdesk_bios/">latest BIOS file for the B650E-F</a> from ASUS&#39; website, and expanded the zip file.</p>

<p>Then I ran the included file renamer tool, and copied the renamed BIOS file over to my flash drive.</p>

<p>I then rebooted the PC, entered the BIOS settings, went to Advanced settings, went to the Tools, and entered ASUS&#39;s EZ Flash 3 menu.</p>

<p>From there, I could see the BIOS and select it, but when I did, the screen would go to &#39;Processing&#39;, a status bar would start filling, then every time, the PC would just shut down, then try rebooting, and when it did, after the orange DRAM LED lit for a bit, the red CPU LED would light up and stay lit until I removed power from the motherboard.</p>

<p>I tried this with three different flash drives (two SanDisk USB 3.0 models, and one generic <a href="https://amzn.to/3YJ7VUo">Alihelan USB 2.0 drive</a>), and none of them worked with EZ Flash—all had the same weird &#39;immediate shutdown&#39; issue.</p>

<p>So next I tried each one with BIOS Flashback, where you make sure the USB drive is attached to a specific port on the motherboard, shut down the computer, and press and hold a &#39;BIOS Flashback&#39; button nearby until the process begins.</p>

<p>Well, with the two USB 3.0 drives I was testing (both formatted as FAT32), I got three blinks, then the LED stayed lit—an indication the process did not succeed.</p>

<p>So I finally tried again with the USB 2.0 drive, and lo and behold, the thing finally worked—and now in BIOS I have options for setting the AMD Eco modes for lower TDP/energy consumption at basically the same performance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how motherboard BIOS updates are still so flaky after all these years, but I guess it&#39;s better than requiring a USB-to-TTL device and some terminal hacking to flash it like you do on many ARM SBCs!</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m finally confident I can upgrade my Ryzen 5 5600x system to this new Ryzen 7 7900x, and I won&#39;t have to take out a second mortgage just to afford my electric bill.</p></div></div>
