    <h1>Bootstrapping a side project into a profitable seven-figure business</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bootstrapping a side project into a profitable seven-figure business in four years.</p><div><p>We really did it! We bootstrapped ProjectionLab to $1,000,000 in annual recurring revenue.</p><p>And I‚Äôm still processing that this is real. ü•π</p><p>Back in 2021, I was inspired by the financial independence movement and wanted a better way to plan my own life. I couldn‚Äôt find the right tool, so I started building.</p><p>I had no idea that side project would one day help over 100,000 households plan for their financial future too.</p><h2>How we got here</h2><p>If this is your first time hearing about ProjectionLab, here‚Äôs a quick recap:</p><p>When you look beyond the recurring revenue chart, this journey had ups, downs, and moments I wanted to quit.</p><h2>The emotions behind the numbers</h2><p>Want to know what building in public from zero to a million dollars a year really felt like? NOT like serenely progressing up-and-to-the-right‚Ä¶</p><p>More like riding a dopamine rollercoaster while getting attacked by a bear.</p><p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/static/annotated-revenue-chart.d0f5ad59.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video></p><p>The flat months in the early years? The dips in earnings? The times I woke up to a dozen canceled subscriptions?</p><p>Each one had me questioning everything, wondering if I should just focus on the corporate ladder, or maybe try to get into big tech instead.</p><p>The financial independence movement is what set me on this path. So on top of worrying about normal business risks, I was primed to think in terms of my time and opportunity cost, and how failure would hurt my own timeline to FI.</p><p>But gradually, I learned that emotional peaks and valleys are always a part of entrepreneurship. And that ‚Äúnot giving up‚Äù is actually a superpower.</p><h2>Not giving up</h2><p>There are loads of people out there smarter than me.</p><p>But luckily, success indexes less on IQ and more on consistency. The willingness to doggedly show up every single day can take you to some really suprising and amazing places.</p><p>And you know what makes it easier and more rewarding to be that persistent?</p><p>Working alongside people you like.</p><h2>From solo dev to real team</h2><p>For the first two years, I burned the candle at both ends working solo. 4-6 hours every night after work, entire weekends, holidays, you name it.</p><p><em>404 Day Off Not Found.</em></p><p>That was the only way I could build something this complex in a crowded market as a risk-averse engineer with a day job. And I was fortunate enough to attempt this at a stage in life when I had lots of energy and few family responsibilities.</p><p>Plus my trusty sidekick, BB the bird:</p><p><img src="https://projectionlab.com/assets/static/kyles-workstation.b4c85d5b.jpg" alt="Working at my desk with BB the pet cockatiel on my shoulder"/></p><p>But long-term, I knew there would be a choice to face:</p><ol><li>Keep doing everything myself and watch growth plateau, or‚Ä¶</li><li>Find someone with a complementary skillset and start building a team.</li></ol><p>I was just an ordinary engineer with zero marketing experience. So I figured I should try to team up with someone good at growth &amp; marketing.</p><h2>Finding a growth &amp; marketing partner</h2><p>During the first few years, I was approached by dozens of potential ‚Äúpartners.‚Äù Several wanted an outsize equity stake to essentially just make suggestions. Others had the wrong skillset or didn‚Äôt feel like a complete fit.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathankuipers/">Jon Kuipers</a> jumped right into the trenches and worked to prove himself before asking for anything. He spent a year contributing real value, and when the time came to bring on a growth partner full-time, I didn‚Äôt look anywhere else.</p><p>Now I stay focused on building, while he handles growth, marketing, partnerships, and some ops stuff.</p><p><img src="https://projectionlab.com/assets/static/mrr-jon-starts-cropped.beb8146b.png" alt="MRR over time"/></p><h2>Building a team</h2><p>We‚Äôve also added a few contractors to the team.</p><p>And these guys are legends. üí™</p><p>They come straight from the ProjectionLab user community, and they are doing a great job fielding the arcane finance questions our customers love to ask. Plus hosting 1-on-1 sessions, creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@projectionlab">tutorial videos</a>, and more.</p><p>Could we have offshored customer success for pennies on the dollar instead? You bet. But having a happy and engaged user community of product evangelists means a lot to us, and I want them all to have the best experience possible.</p><p>For multiple years, I was up at all hours answering support questions myself. It interrupted my dev work (and my sleep) constantly. I love the PL community ‚Äì it‚Äôs a big part of what motivated me to keep going back then.</p><p>And it blows my mind that the empty discord server I created a few years ago now has over <a href="https://discord.gg/dZQ5DDEmT7">8,500 fellow personal finance enthusiasts</a>.</p><p><img src="https://projectionlab.com/assets/static/testimonials.8bef151e.png" alt="Testimonials from our users"/></p><p>But at this point, I serve the community best by focusing on the area where my contributions have the greatest marginal value: building.</p><p>And with our team now enabling that, <a href="https://projectionlab.com/changelog">what we‚Äôve shipped this year</a> speaks for itself.</p><h2>What‚Äôs next?</h2><p>Hitting $1M ARR is just the beginning.</p><p>And that only counts recurring revenue. With non-recurring income sources like Lifetime subscriptions and 1-on-1 training sessions, monthly revenue has consistently been 20 to 50 percent higher.</p><p>With that momentum, we‚Äôre doubling down on what got us here:</p><ul><li>Making a good product that people actually like to use (including us)</li><li>Staying lean, bootstrapped, and aligned with the interests of our customers</li><li>Building thoughtfully and sustainably, not chasing AI hype or growth-at-all-costs</li></ul><h2>If you‚Äôre building something yourself‚Ä¶</h2><p>Here‚Äôs one small piece of advice:</p><p>Once you‚Äôve validated your idea, keep showing up to make it a little better every day. Even when there are distractions. Even when growth is flat. Even when it feels pointless.</p><p>And even when that voice in your head says you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúreal entrepreneur.‚Äù</p><p>It said that to me too. A lot.</p><p>So you know what? Do what most people can‚Äôt: actually show up every day. And prove it wrong.</p><p>You never know which day will be the one that changes everything.</p><p>Whether you‚Äôre building a business, just getting started with investing, or working toward financial independence, it‚Äôs often the small, consistent actions that compound over time. Just like dollar-cost averaging into index funds, showing up consistently to improve your craft can produce surprisingly powerful results on your path toward a better future.</p><hr/><p><em>Thanks to everyone who‚Äôs supported ProjectionLab over the years. You‚Äôve literally changed my life, and I wake up every day excited to keep building for you ‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p><p>‚ÄìKyle</p></div></div>
