    <h1>My User Experience Porting Off Setup.py</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  <p>In the past week I went to add Python 3.12 support to my
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">zstandard</a> Python package.
A few hours into the unexpected yak shave / rat hole, I decided to start
chronicling my experience so that I may share it with the broader Python
community. My hope is that by sharing my (unfortunately painful) end-user
experience that I can draw attention to aspects of Python packaging that
are confusing so that better informed and empowered people can improve
matters and help make future Python packaging decisions to help scenarios
like what I&#39;m about to describe.</p>
<p>This blog post is purposefully verbose and contains a very lightly edited
stream of my mental thoughts. Think of it as a self-assessed user experience
study of Python packaging.</p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>I&#39;m no stranger to the Python ecosystem or Python packaging. I&#39;ve been
programming Python for 10+ years. I&#39;ve even authored a Python application
packaging tool, <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/pyoxidizer/main/">PyOxidizer</a>.</p>
<p>When programming, I strive to understand how things work. I try to not blindly
copy-paste or cargo cult patterns unless I understand how they work. This
means I often scope bloat myself and slow down velocity in the short term.
But I justify this practice because I find it often pays dividends in the long
term because I actually understand how things work.</p>
<p>I also have a passion for security and supply chain robustness. After you&#39;ve
helped maintain complex CI systems for multiple companies, you learn the hard
way that it is important to do things like transitively pin dependencies and
reduce surface area for failures so that build automation breaks in reaction
to code changes in your version control, not spooky-action-at-a-distance when
state on a third party server changes (e.g. a new package version is uploaded).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been aware of the emergence of <code>pyproject.toml</code>. But I&#39;ve largely sat on
the sidelines and held off adopting them, mainly for <em>if it isn&#39;t broken, don&#39;t
fix it</em> reasons. Plus, my perception has been that the tooling still hasn&#39;t
stabilized: I&#39;m not going to incur work now if it is going to invite avoidable
churn that could be avoided by sitting on my hands a little longer.</p>
<p>Now, on to my user experience of adding Python 3.12 to python-zstandard and
the epic packaging yak shave that entailed.</p>
<h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
<p>When I attempted to run CI against Python 3.12 on GitHub Actions, running
<code>python setup.py</code>complained that <code>setuptools</code> couldn&#39;t be imported.</p>
<p>Huh? I thought <code>setuptools</code> was installed in pretty much every Python
distribution by default? It was certainly installed in all previous Python
versions by the <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">actions/setup-python</a>
GitHub Action. I was aware <code>distutils</code> was removed from the Python 3.12
standard library. But setuptools and distutils are not the same! Why did
<code>setuptools</code> disappear?</p>
<p>I look at the CI logs for the passing Python 3.11 job and notice a message:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>********************************************************************************
Please avoid running ``setup.py`` directly.
Instead, use pypa/build, pypa/installer or other
standards-based tools.

See https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html for details.
********************************************************************************
</pre></div>

<p>I had several immediate reactions:</p>
<ol>
<li>OK, maybe this is a sign I should be modernizing to <code>pyproject.toml</code> and
   moving away from <code>python setup.py</code>. Maybe the missing <code>setuptools</code> in the
   3.12 CI environment is a side-effect of this <em>policy</em> shift?</li>
<li>What are <code>pypa/build</code> and <code>pypa/installer</code>? I&#39;ve never heard of them. I know
   <code>pypa</code> is the Python Packaging Authority (I suspect most Python developers
   don&#39;t know this). Are these GitHub <em>org/repo</em> identifiers?</li>
<li>What exactly is a <em>standards-based tool</em>? Is pip not a <em>standards-based tool</em>?</li>
<li>Speaking of pip, why isn&#39;t it mentioned? I thought pip was the de facto
   packaging tool and had been for a while!</li>
<li>It&#39;s linking a URL for more info. But why is this a link to what looks like
   an individual&#39;s blog and not to some more official site, like the setuptools
   or pip docs? Or anything under python.org?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning That I Shouldn&#39;t Invoke <code>python setup.py</code></h2>
<p>I open <a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html">https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html</a>
in my browser and see a 4,000+ word blog post. Oof. Do I really want/need to read
this? Fortunately, the author included a tl;dr and linked to a
<a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html#summary">summary</a>
section telling me a lot of useful information! It informs me (my commentary in
parentheses):</p>
<ol>
<li><em>The setuptools project has stopped maintaining all direct invocations of setup.py
   years ago</em>. (What?!)</li>
<li><em>There are undoubtedly many ways that your setup.py-based system is broken today,
   even if it&#39;s not failing loudly or obviously.</em>. (What?! Surely this can&#39;t be
   true. I didn&#39;t see any warnings from tooling until recently. How was I supposed
   to know this?)</li>
<li><em>PEP 517, 518 and other standards-based packaging are the future of the Python
   ecosystem</em>. (A ha - a definition of <em>standards-based</em> tooling. I guess I have
   to look at PEP 517 and PEP 518 in more detail. I&#39;m pretty sure these are
   the PEPs that define <code>pyproject.toml</code>.)</li>
<li><em>At this point you may be expecting me to give you a canonical list of the right
   way to do everything that setup.py used to do, and unfortunately the answer here
   is that it&#39;s complicated.</em> (You are telling me that we had a working
   <code>python setup.py</code> solution for 10+ years, this workflow is now quasi deprecated,
   and the recommended replacement is <em>it&#39;s complicated</em>?! I&#39;m just trying to get my
   package modernized. Why does that need to be <em>complicated</em>?)</li>
<li><em>That said, I can give you some simple &#34;works for most people&#34; recommendations for
   some of the common commands.</em> (Great, this is exactly what I was looking for!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I look at the table mapping old ways to new ways. In the <em>new</em> column, it
references the following tools: <a href="https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">build</a>,
pytest, <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/">tox</a>, <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/">nox</a>,
pip, and <a href="https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">twine</a>. That&#39;s quite the
tooling salad! (And that <code>build</code> tool must be the <em>pypa/build</em> referenced in the
setuptools warning message. One mystery solved!)</p>
<p>I scroll back to the top of the article and notice the date: October 2021. Two
years old. The summary section also mentioned that there&#39;s been a lot of
activity around packaging tooling occurring. So now I&#39;m wondering if this blog
post is outdated. Either way, it is clear I have to perform some additional
research to figure out how to migrate off <code>python setup.py</code> so I can be
compliant with the new world order.</p>
<h2>Learning About <code>pyproject.toml</code> and Build Systems</h2>
<p>I had pre-existing knowledge of <code>pyproject.toml</code> as the modern way to define
build system metadata. So I decide to start my research by Googling
<code>pyproject.toml</code>. The first results are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for</a></li>
<li><a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/">https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html">https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-setuptools-and-pyproject-toml/">https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-setuptools-and-pyproject-toml/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/pyproject-python-9df8cc092f61">https://towardsdatascience.com/pyproject-python-9df8cc092f61</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I click pip&#39;s documentation first because pip is known to me and it seems a
canonical source. Pip&#39;s documentation proceeds to link to
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/">PEP-518</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP-517</a>,
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP-621</a>, and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/">PEP-660</a>
before telling me how projects with <code>pyproject.toml</code> are built, without giving
me - a package maintainer - much useful advice for what to do or how to port from
<code>setup.py</code>. This seems like a dead end.</p>
<p>Then I look at the Stack Overflow link. Again, telling me a lot of what I don&#39;t
really care about. (I&#39;ve somewhat lost faith in Stack Overflow and only really
skimmed this page: I would much prefer to get an answer from a first party
source.)</p>
<p>I click on the <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/">Poetry</a> link. It
documents TOML fields. But only for the <code>[tool.poetry]</code> section. While I&#39;ve
heard about Poetry, I know that I probably don&#39;t want to scope bloat myself
to learn how Poetry works so I can use it. (No offence meant to the Poetry
project here but I don&#39;t perceive my project as needing whatever features
Poetry provides: I&#39;m <em>just</em> trying to publish a simple library package.) I
go back to the search results.</p>
<p>I click on the <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html">setuptools</a>
link. I&#39;m using setuptools via <code>setup.py</code> so this content looks promising! It gives
me a nice example TOML of how to configure a <code>[build-system]</code> and <code>[project]</code>
metadata. It links to PyPA&#39;s <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/">Declaring project metadata</a>
content, which I open in a new tab, as the content seems useful. I continue
reading setuptools documentation. I land on its
<a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html">Quickstart</a>
documentation, which seems useful. I start reading it and it links to the
<a href="https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">build</a> tool documentation.
That&#39;s the second link to the <code>build</code> tool. So I open that in a new tab.</p>
<p>At this point, I think I have all the documentation on <code>pyproject.toml</code>. But
I&#39;m still trying to figure out what to replace <code>python setup.py</code> with. The
<code>build</code> tool certainly seems like a contender since I&#39;ve seen multiple
references to it. But I&#39;m still looking for <em>modern</em>, actively maintained
documentation pointing me in a blessed direction.</p>
<p>The next Google link is <a href="https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-setuptools-and-pyproject-toml/">A Practical Guide to Setuptools and Pyproject.toml</a>.
I start reading that. I&#39;m immediately confused because it is recommending I
put setuptools metadata in <code>setup.cfg</code> files. But I just read all about defining
this metadata in <code>pyproject.toml</code> files in setuptools&#39; own documentation! Is
this blog post out of date? March 12, 2022. Seems pretty modern. I look at the
setuptools documentation again and see the <code>pyproject.toml</code> metadata pieces are
in version 61.0.0 and newer. I go to
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/releases/tag/v61.0.0">https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/releases/tag/v61.0.0</a>
and see version 61.0.0 was released on March 25, 2022. So the fifth Google link
was seemingly obsoleted 13 days after it was published. Good times. I pretend I
never read this content because it seems out of date.</p>
<p>The next Google link is
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/pyproject-python-9df8cc092f61">https://towardsdatascience.com/pyproject-python-9df8cc092f61</a>.
I click through. But Medium wants me to log in to read it all and it is unclear
it is going to tell me anything important, so I back out.</p>
<h2>Learning About the <code>build</code> Tool</h2>
<p>I give up on Google for the moment and start reading up on the <code>build</code> tool
from its docs.</p>
<p>The only usage documentation for the <code>build</code> tool is on its
<a href="https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">root documentation page</a>.
And that documentation basically prints what <code>python -m build --help</code> would
print: says what the tool does but doesn&#39;t give any guidance or where I should
be using it or how to replace existing tools (like <code>python setup.py</code> invocations).
Yes, I can piece the parts together and figure out that <code>python -m build</code> can be
used as a replacement for <code>python setup.py sdist</code> and <code>python setup.py bdist_wheel</code>
(and maybe <code>pip wheel</code>?). But <em>should</em> it be the replacement I choose? I make
use of <code>python setup.py develop</code> and the aforementioned blog post recommended
replacing that with <code>python -m pip install -e</code>. Perhaps I can use <code>pip</code> as the
singular replacement for building source distributions and binary wheels so I
have N-1 packaging tools? I keep researching.</p>
<h2>Exploring the Python Packaging User Guide</h2>
<p>I had previously opened <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/">https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/</a>
in a browser tab without really looking at it. On second glance, I see it is part
of a broader <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
Oh, this looks promising! A guide on how to do what I&#39;m seeking maintained by the
Python Packaging Authority (PyPA), the group who I know to be the, well, authorities
on Python packaging. It is is published under the canonical <code>python.org</code> domain.
Surely the answer will be here.</p>
<p>I immediately click on the link to
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Packaging Python Projects</a>
to hopefully see what the PyPA folks are recommending.</p>
<h3>Is Hatch the Answer?</h3>
<p>I skim through. I see recommendations to use a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with a
<code>[build-system]</code> to define the build backend. This matches my expectations.
But they are using <em>Hatchling</em> as their build backend. Another tool I don&#39;t
really know about. I click through some inline links and eventually arrive
at <a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch">https://github.com/pypa/hatch</a>. (I&#39;m kind of
confused why the PyPA tutorial said <em>Hatchling</em> when the project and tool is
apparently named <em>Hatch</em>. But whatever.)</p>
<p>I skim Hatch&#39;s GitHub README. It looks like a unified packaging tool. Build
system. Package uploading/publishing. Environment management (sounds like a
virtualenv alternative?). This tool actually seems quite nice! I start skimming
the docs. Like Poetry, it seems like this is yet another new tool that I&#39;d need
to learn and would require me to blow up my existing <code>setup.py</code> in order to
adopt. Do I really want to put in that effort? I&#39;m just trying to get
python-zstandard back on the paved road and avoid seemingly deprecated workflows:
I&#39;m not looking to adopt new tooling stacks.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also further confused by the existence of Hatch under the
<a href="https://github.com/pypa">PyPA GitHub Organization</a>. That&#39;s the same
GitHub organization hosting the Python packaging tools that are known to
me, namely
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/build">build</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip">pip</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools">setuptools</a>. Those three projects
are pinned repositories. (The other three pinned repositories are
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/wheel">wheel</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/twine">twine</a>.) Hatch is seemingly a replacement
for pip, setuptools, virtualenv, twine, and possibly other tools. But it isn&#39;t
a pinned repository. Yet it is the default tool used in the PyPA maintained
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Packaging Python Projects</a>
guide. (That guide also suggests using other tools like setuptools,
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/flit">flit</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/.">pdm</a>. But the default is Hatch and that has me asking questions. Also,
I didn&#39;t initially notice that
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-pyproject-toml">Creating pyproject.toml</a>
has multiple tabs for different backends.)</p>
<p>While Hatch looks interesting, I&#39;m just not getting a strong signal that Hatch
is sufficiently stable or warrants my time investment to switch to. So I go
back to reading the
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>The PyPA User Guide Search Continues</h3>
<p>As I click around the User Guide, it is clear the PyPA folks really want me
to use <code>pyproject.toml</code> for packaging. I suppose that&#39;s the future and that&#39;s
a fair ask. But I&#39;m still confused how I should migrate my <code>setup.py</code> to it.
What are the risks with replacing my <code>setup.py</code> with <code>pyproject.toml</code>? Could
I break someone installing my package on an old Linux distribution or old
virtualenv using an older version of setuptools or pip? Will my adoption of
build, hatch, poetry, whatever constitute a one way door where I lock out
users in older environments? My package is downloaded over one million times
per month and if I break packaging <em>someone</em> is likely to complain.</p>
<p>I&#39;m desperately looking for guidance from the PyPA at
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/">https://packaging.python.org/</a> on how to
manage this migration. But I just... can&#39;t find it.
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/">Guides</a> surprisingly has
nothing on the topic.</p>
<h3>Outdated Tool Recommendations from the PyPA</h3>
<p>Finally I find <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/">Tool recommendations</a>
in the PyPA User Guide. Under
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/#packaging-tool-recommendations">Packaging tool recommendations</a>
it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Use setuptools to define projects.</em></li>
<li><em>Use build to create Source Distributions and wheels.</em></li>
<li><em>If you have binary extensions and want to distribute wheels for multiple
  platforms, use cibuildwheel as part of your CI setup to build distributable
  wheels.</em></li>
<li><em>Use twine for uploading distributions to PyPI.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some canonical documentation from the PyPA that comes out and
suggests what to use!</p>
<p>But my relief immediately turns to questioning whether this tooling
recommendations documentation is up to date:</p>
<ol>
<li>If setuptools is recommended, why does the
   <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Packaging Python Projects</a>
   tutorial use Hatch?</li>
<li>How exactly should I be using setuptools to define projects? Is this
   referring to setuptools as a <code>[build-system]</code> backend? The existence of
   <em>define</em> seemingly implies using <code>setup.py</code> or <code>setup.cfg</code> to define metadata.
   But I thought these distutils/setuptools specific mechanisms were deprecated
   in favor of the more generic <code>pyproject.toml</code>?</li>
<li>Why aren&#39;t other tools like Hatch, pip, poetry, flit, and pdm mentioned on
   this page? Where&#39;s the guidance on when to use these alternative tools?</li>
<li>There are footnotes referencing <code>distutils</code> as if it is still a modern
   practice. No mention that it was removed from the standard library in
   Python 3.12.</li>
<li>But the <code>build</code> tool is referenced and that tool is relatively new. So the
   docs have to be somewhat up-to-date, right?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, I reach the conclusion that this
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/">Tool recommendations</a>
documentation is inconsistent with newer documentation and can&#39;t be trusted.
But it did mention the <code>build</code> tool and we now have multiple independent
sources steering me in the direction of the <code>build</code> tool (at least for source
distribution and wheel building), so it seems like we have a winner on our
hands.</p>
<h2>Initial Failures Running <code>build</code></h2>
<p>So let&#39;s use the <code>build</code> tool. I remember docs saying to invoke it with
<code>python -m build</code>, so I try that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python3.12 -m build --help
No module named build.__main__; &#39;build&#39; is a package and cannot be directly executed
</pre></div>

<p>So the <code>build</code> package exists but it doesn&#39;t have a <code>__main__</code>. Ummm.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python3.12R
Python 3.12.0 (main, Oct 23 2023, 19:58:35) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)] on darwin
Type &#34;help&#34;, &#34;copyright&#34;, &#34;credits&#34; or &#34;license&#34; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import build
&gt;&gt;&gt; build.__spec__
ModuleSpec(name=&#39;build&#39;, loader=&lt;_frozen_importlib_external.NamespaceLoader object at 0x10d403bc0&gt;, submodule_search_locations=_NamespacePath([&#39;/Users/gps/src/python-zstandard/build&#39;]))
</pre></div>

<p>Oh, it picked up the <code>build</code> directory from my source checkout because
<code>sys.path</code> has the current directory by default. Good times.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ (cd ~ &amp;&amp; python3.12 -m build)
/Users/gps/.pyenv/versions/3.12.0/bin/python3.12: No module named build
</pre></div>

<p>I guess <code>build</code> isn&#39;t installed in my Python distribution / environment.
You used to be able to build packages using just the Python standard library.
I guess this battery is no longer included in the stdlib. I shrug and continue.</p>
<h2>Installing <code>build</code></h2>
<p>I go to the <a href="https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">Build installation docs</a>.
It says to <code>pip install build</code>. (I thought I read years ago that one should
use <code>python3 -m pip</code> to invoke pip. Strange that a PyPA maintained tool is
telling me to invoke <code>pip</code> directly since I&#39;m pretty sure a lot of the reasons
to use <code>python -m</code> to invoke tools are still valid. But I digress.)</p>
<p>I follow the instructions, installing it to the global <code>site-packages</code>
because I figure I&#39;ll use this tool a lot and I&#39;m not a virtual environment
purist:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python3.12 -m pip install build

</pre></div>

<p>That downloads and installs wheels for <code>build</code>, <code>packaging</code>, and
<code>pyproject_hooks</code>.</p>
<p>At this point the security aware part of my brain is screaming because we
didn&#39;t pin versions or SHA-256 digests of any of these packages
anywhere. So if a malicious version of any of these packages is somehow
uploaded to PyPI that&#39;s going to be a nightmare software supply chain
vulnerability having similar industry impact as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell">log4shell</a>. Nowhere in build&#39;s
documentation does it mention this or say how to securely install build.
I suppose you have to just know about the supply chain gotchas with
<code>pip install</code> in order to mitigate this risk for yourself.</p>
<h2>Initial Results With <code>build</code> Are Promising</h2>
<p>After getting <code>build</code> installed, <code>python3.12 -m build --help</code> works now
and I can build a wheel:</p>

Successfully built zstandard-0.22.0.dev0-cp312-cp312-macosx_14_0_x86_64.whl
</pre></div>

<p>That looks promising! It seems to have invoked my <code>setup.py</code> without me
having to define a <code>[build-system]</code> in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>! Yay for backwards
compatibility.</p>
<h2>The Mystery of the Missing <code>cffi</code> Package</h2>
<p>But I notice something.</p>
<p>My <code>setup.py</code> script conditionally builds a <code>zstandard._cffi</code> extension
module if <code>import cffi</code> succeeds. Building with <code>build</code> isn&#39;t building this
extension module.</p>
<p>Before using <code>build</code>, I had to run <code>setup.py</code> using a <code>python</code> having the
<code>cffi</code> package installed, usually a project-local virtualenv. So let&#39;s try
that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install build cffi
...
$ venv/bin/python -m build --wheel .
...
</pre></div>

<p>And I get the same behavior: no CFFI extension module.</p>
<p>Staring at the output, I see what looks like a smoking gun:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>* Creating venv isolated environment...
* Installing packages in isolated environment... (setuptools &gt;= 40.8.0, wheel)
* Getting build dependencies for wheel...
...
* Installing packages in isolated environment... (wheel)
</pre></div>

<p>OK. So it looks like <code>build</code> is creating its own isolated environment
(disregarding the invoked Python environment having <code>cffi</code> installed),
installing <code>setuptools &gt;= 40.8.0</code> and <code>wheel</code> into it, and then executing
the build from that environment.</p>
<p>So <code>build</code> sandboxes builds in an ephemeral build environment. This actually
seems like a useful feature to help with deterministic and reproducible
builds: I like it! But at this moment it stands in the way of progress. So
I run <code>python -m build --help</code>, spot a <code>--no-isolation</code> argument and do the
obvious:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m build --wheel --no-isolation .
...
building &#39;zstandard._cffi&#39; extension
...
</pre></div>

<p>Success!</p>
<p>And I don&#39;t see any deprecation warnings either. So I <em>think</em> I&#39;m all good.</p>
<p>But obviously I&#39;ve ventured off the paved road here, as we had to violate
the default constraints of <code>build</code> to get things to work. I&#39;ll get back to that
later.</p>
<h2>Reproducing Working Wheel Builds With <code>pip</code></h2>
<p>Just for good measure, let&#39;s see if we can use <code>pip wheel</code> to produce wheels,
as I&#39;ve seen references that this is a supported mechanism for building wheels.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip wheel .

<p>That output is a bit terse, since the setuptools build logs are getting swallowed.
That&#39;s fine. Rather than run with <code>-v</code> to get those logs, I manually inspect
the built wheel:</p>

<p>(Python wheels are just zip files with certain well-defined paths having special
meanings. I know this because I wrote Rust code for <em>parsing</em> wheels as part of
developing PyOxidizer.)</p>
<p>Looks like the <code>zstandard/_cffi.cpython-312-darwin.so</code> extension module is missing.
Well, at least <code>pip</code> is consistent with <code>build</code>! Although somewhat confusingly I don&#39;t
see any reference to a separate build environment in the pip output. But I suspect
it is there because <code>cffi</code> is installed in the virtual environment I invoke pip from!</p>
<p>Reading pip help output, I find the relevant argument to not spawn a new
environment and try again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip wheel --no-build-isolation .
&lt;same exact output except the wheel size and digest changes&gt;

<p>(I&#39;m happy to see <code>build</code> and <code>pip</code> agreeing on the <em>no isolation</em> terminology.)</p>
<p>OK, so I got <code>build</code> and <code>pip</code> to behave nearly identically. I feel like I
finally understand this!</p>
<p>I also run <code>pip -v wheel</code> and <code>pip -vv wheel</code> to peek under the covers and see
what it&#39;s doing. Interestingly, I don&#39;t see any hint of a virtual environment
or temporary directory until I go to <code>-vv</code>. I find it interesting that <code>build</code>
presents details about this by default but you have to put <code>pip</code> in very verbose
mode to get it. I&#39;m glad I used <code>build</code> first because the ephemeral build
environment was the source of my missing dependency and <code>pip</code> buried this
important detail behind a ton of other output in <code>-vv</code>, making it much harder
to discover!</p>
<h2>Understanding How <code>setuptools</code> Gets Installed</h2>
<p>When looking at pip&#39;s verbose output, I also see references to installing the
<code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code> packages:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Processing /Users/gps/src/python-zstandard
  Running command pip subprocess to install build dependencies
  Collecting setuptools&gt;=40.8.0
    Using cached setuptools-68.2.2-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (6.3 kB)

  Installing collected packages: wheel, setuptools
  Successfully installed setuptools-68.2.2 wheel-0.41.2
  Installing build dependencies ... done
</pre></div>

<p>There&#39;s that <code>setuptools&gt;=40.8.0</code> constraint again. (We also saw it in <code>build</code>.)
I <code>rg 40.8.0</code> my source checkout (note: the <code>.</code> in there are wildcard characters
since <code>40.8.0</code> is a regexp so this could over match) and come up with nothing.
If it&#39;s not coming from my code, where is it coming from?</p>
<p>In the pip documentation, <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#fallback-behaviour">Fallback behaviour</a>
says that a missing <code>[build-system]</code> from <code>pyproject.toml</code> is implicitly
translated to the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[build-system]</span>
<span>requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>[&#34;setuptools&gt;=40.8.0&#34;, &#34;wheel&#34;]</span>
<span>build-backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__&#34;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>For <code>build</code>, I go to the source code and discover that
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/build/commit/7504e2a7a8ac956b8f2991ae28aa45d8d73b9740">similar functionality</a>
was added in May 2020.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this default behavior is specified in a PEP or what. But
<code>build</code> and <code>pip</code> seem to be agreeing on the behavior of adding
<code>setuptools&gt;=40.8.0</code> and <code>wheel</code> to their ephemeral build environments and
invoking <code>setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__</code> as the build backend as
implicit defaults if your <code>pyproject.toml</code> lacks a <code>[build-system]</code>. OK.</p>
<h2>Being Explicit About The Build System</h2>
<p>Perhaps I should consider defining <code>[build-system]</code> and being explicit
about things? After all, the tools aren&#39;t printing anything indicating they
are assuming implicit defaults and for all I know the defaults could change
in a backwards incompatible manner in any release and break my build. (Although
I would hope to see a deprecation warning before that occurs.)</p>
<p>So I modify my <code>pyproject.toml</code> accordingly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[build-system]</span>
<span>requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>&#34;cffi==1.16.0&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&#34;setuptools==68.2.2&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&#34;wheel==0.41.2&#34;</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
<span>build-backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__&#34;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>I pinned all the dependencies to specific versions because I like determinism
and reproducibility. I really don&#39;t like when the upload of a new package version
breaks my builds!</p>
<h2>Software Supply Chain Weaknesses in <code>pyproject.toml</code></h2>
<p>When I pinned dependencies in <code>[build-system]</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the
security part of my brain is screaming over the lack of SHA-256
digest pinning.</p>
<p>How am I sure that we&#39;re using well-known, trusted versions of
these dependencies? Are all the transitive dependencies even pinned?</p>
<p>Before <code>pyproject.toml</code>, I used <code>pip-compile</code> from
<a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools">pip-tools</a> to generate a <code>requirements.txt</code>
containing SHA-256 digests for all transitive dependencies. I would use
<code>python3 -m venv</code> to create a virtualenv,
<code>venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to materialize a (highly
deterministic) set of packages, then run <code>venv/bin/python setup.py</code> to invoke
a build in this stable and securely created environment. (Some) software supply chain
risks averted! But, uh, how do I do that with <code>pyproject.toml</code>
<code>build-system.requires</code>? Does it even support pinning SHA-256 digests?</p>
<p>I skim the PEPs related to <code>pyproject.toml</code> and don&#39;t see anything. Surely
I&#39;m missing something.</p>
<p>In desperation I check the pip-tools project and sure enough they
<a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#requirements-from-pyprojecttoml">document pyproject.toml integration</a>.
However, they tell you how to feed <code>requirements.txt</code> files into the dynamic
dependencies consumed by the build backend: there&#39;s nothing on how to securely
install the build backend itself.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell <code>pyproject.toml</code> has no facilities for securely
installing (read: pinning content digests for all transitive dependencies)
the build backend itself. This is left as an exercise to the reader. But,
um, the build frontend (which I was also instructed to download insecurely
via <code>python -m pip install</code>) is the thing installing the build backend. How am
I supposed to subvert the build frontend to securely install the build backend?
Am I supposed to disable default behavior of using an ephemeral environment
in order to get secure backend installs? Doesn&#39;t the ephemeral environment
give me additional, desired protections for build determinism and
reproducibility? That seems <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>It kind of looks like <code>pyproject.toml</code> wasn&#39;t designed with software supply
chain risk mitigation as a criteria. This is extremely surprising for a build
system abstraction designed in the past few years. I shrug my shoulders and
move on.</p>
<h2>Porting <code>python setup.py develop</code> Invocations</h2>
<p>Now that I figure I have a working <code>pyproject.toml</code>, I move onto removing
<code>python setup.py</code> invocations.</p>
<p>First up is a <code>python setup.py develop --rust-backend</code> invocation.</p>
<p>My <code>setup.py</code> performs <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard/blob/f17569c645618a786ad11a3d51c3baa0b49a311c/setup.py#L65">very crude scanning</a>
of <code>sys.argv</code> looking for command arguments like <code>--system-zstd</code> and
<code>--rust-backend</code> as a way to influence the build. We just sniff these special
arguments and remove them from <code>sys.argv</code> so they don&#39;t confuse the setuptools
options parser. (I don&#39;t believe this is a blessed way of doing custom options
handling in distutils/setuptools. But it is simple and has worked since I
introduced the pattern in 2016.)</p>
<h2>Is <code>--global-option</code> the Answer?</h2>
<p>With <code>python setup.py</code> invocations going away and a build frontend invoking
<code>setup.py</code>, I need to find an alternative mechanism to pass settings into my
<code>setup.py</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html#summary">Why you shouldn&#39;t invoke setup.py directly</a>
tells me I should use <code>pip install -e</code>. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s a way to instruct
<code>pip install</code> to pass arguments to <code>setup.py</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --help
...
  -C, --config-settings &lt;settings&gt;
                              Configuration settings to be passed to the PEP 517 build backend. Settings take the form KEY=VALUE. Use multiple --config-settings options to pass multiple keys to the backend.
  --global-option &lt;options&gt;   Extra global options to be supplied to the setup.py call before the install or bdist_wheel command.
...
</pre></div>

<p>Hmmm. Not really sure which of these to use. But<code>--global-option</code> mentions
<code>setup.py</code> and I&#39;m using <code>setup.py</code>. So I try that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --global-option --rust-backend -e .
Usage:

  /Users/gps/src/python-zstandard/venv/bin/python -m pip install [options] &lt;archive url/path&gt; ...

no such option: --rust-backend
</pre></div>

<p>Oh, duh, <code>--rust-backend</code> looks like an argument and makes pip&#39;s own argument
parsing ambiguous as to how to handle it. Let&#39;s try that again with
<code>--global-option=--rust-backend</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --global-option=--rust-backend -e .

<p>Yikes. It looks like <code>--global-option</code> is deprecated and will be removed in pip 24.0.
And, later it says <code>--global-option</code> was ignored. Is that true?!</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ls -al zstandard/*cpython-312*.so

</pre></div>

<p>Not seeing a <code>backend_rust</code> library like I was expecting. So, yes, it does look
like <code>--global-option</code> was ignored.</p>
<p>This behavior is actually pretty concerning to me. It certainly
seems like at one time <code>--global-option</code> (and a <code>--build-option</code> which doesn&#39;t
exist on the <code>pip install</code> command I guess) did get threaded through to <code>setup.py</code>.
However, it no longer does.</p>
<p>I find an entry in the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v23-1">pip 23.1 changelog</a>:
<code>Deprecate --build-option and --global-option. Users are invited to switch
to --config-settings. (#11859)</code>. <em>Deprecate</em>. What is pip&#39;s definition of
<em>deprecate</em>? I click the link to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/11859">#11859</a>.
An open issue with a lot of comments. I scan the issue history to find
referenced PRs and click on <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/11861">#11861</a>.
OK, it is just an advertisement. Maybe <code>--global-option</code> never got threaded
through to <code>setup.py</code>? But its help usage text clearly says it is related to
<code>setup.py</code>! Maybe the presence of <code>[build-system]</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> is
somehow engaging different semantics that result in <code>--global-option</code> not
being passed to <code>setup.py</code>? The warning message did say
<code>Ignoring --global-option when building zstandard using PEP 517</code>.</p>
<p>I try commenting out the <code>[build-system]</code> section in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>
and trying again. Same result. Huh? Reading the <code>pip install --help</code> output,
I see <code>--no-use-pep517</code> and try it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --global-option=--rust-backend --no-use-pep517 -e .
...

</pre></div>

<p>Ahh, so pip&#39;s default PEP-517 build mode is causing <code>--global-option</code> to get
ignored. So I guess older versions of pip honored <code>--global-option</code> and when
pip switched to PEP-517 build mode by default <code>--global-option</code> just stopped
working and emitted a warning instead. That&#39;s quite the backwards incompatible
behavior break! I really wish tools would fail fast when making these kinds of
breaks or at least offer a <code>--warnings-as-errors</code> mode so I can opt into fatal
errors when these kinds of breaks / deprecations are introduced. I would 100%
opt into this since these warnings are often the figurative needle in a haystack
of CI logs and easy to miss. Especially if the build environment is
non-deterministic and new versions of tools like pip get installed <em>randomly</em>
without a version control commit.</p>
<p>Pip&#39;s allowing me to specify <code>--global-option</code> but then only issuing a
warning when it is ignored doesn&#39;t sit well with me. But what can I do?</p>
<p>It is obvious <code>--global-option</code> is a non-starter here.</p>
<h2>Attempts at Using <code>--config-setting</code></h2>
<p>Fortunately, pip&#39;s deprecation message suggests a path forward:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>A possible replacement is to use --config-settings. Discussion can be found
at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859
</pre></div>

<p>First, kudos for actionable warning messages. However, the wording says
<em>possible replacement</em>. Are there other alternatives I didn&#39;t see in the
<code>pip install --help</code> output?</p>
<p>Anyway, I decide to go with that <code>--config-settings</code> suggestion.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --config-settings=--rust-backend -e .

<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip -v install --config-settings=--rust-backend= -e .
</pre></div>

<p>I don&#39;t see <code>--rust-backend</code> anywhere in that log output. I try with
more verbosity:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip -vvvvv install --config-settings=--rust-backend= -e .
</pre></div>

<p>Still nothing!</p>
<p>Maybe That <code>--</code> prefix is wrong?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip -vvvvv install --config-settings=rust-backend= -e .
</pre></div>

<p>Still nothing!</p>
<p>I have no clue how <code>--config-settings=</code> is getting passed
to <code>setup.py</code> nor where it is seemingly getting dropped on the floor.</p>
<h2>How Does setuptools Handle <code>--config-settings</code>?</h2>
<p>This must be documented in the setuptools project. So I open those docs in
my web browser and do a <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/search.html?q=settings&amp;check_keywords=yes&amp;area=default">search for settings</a>.
I open the first three results in separate tabs:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/commands.html?highlight=settings">Running setuptools commands</a></li>
<li><a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/commands.html?highlight=settings#configuration-file-options">Configuration File Options</a></li>
<li><a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/commands.html?highlight=settings#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode">develop - Deploy the project source in &#34;Development Mode&#34;</a></li>
</ol>
<p>That first link has docs on the deprecated setuptools commands and how to
invoke <code>python setup.py</code> directly. (Note: there is a warning box here saying
that <code>python setup.py</code> is deprecated. I guess I somehow missed this document
when looking at setuptools documentation earlier! In hindsight, it appears to
be buried at the figurative bottom of the docs tree as the last item under
a <code>Backward compatibility &amp; deprecated practice section</code>. Talk about burying
the lede!) These docs aren&#39;t useful.</p>
<p>The second link also takes me to deprecated documentation related to direct
<code>python setup.py</code> command invocations.</p>
<p>The third link is also useless.</p>
<p>I continue opening search results in new tabs. Surely the answer is in here.</p>
<p>I find an <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/extension.html#adding-arguments">Adding Arguments</a>
section telling me that <code>Adding arguments to setup is discouraged as such
arguments are only supported through imperative execution and not supported
through declarative config.</code>. I <em>think</em> that&#39;s an obtuse of saying that
<code>sys.argv</code> arguments are only supported via <code>python setup.py</code> invocations
and not via <code>setup.cfg</code> or <code>pyproject.toml</code>? But the example only shows me
how to use <code>setup.cfg</code> and doesn&#39;t have any mention of <code>pyproject.toml</code>. So
is this documentation even relevant to <code>pyproject.toml</code>?</p>
<p>Eventually I stumble across
<a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html">Build System Support</a>.
In the <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html#dynamic-build-dependencies-and-other-build-meta-tweaks">Dynamic build dependencies and other build_meta tweaks</a>
section, I notice the following example code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>setuptools</span> <span>import</span> <span>build_meta</span> <span>as</span> <span>_orig</span>
<span>from</span> <span>setuptools.build_meta</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_requires_for_build_wheel</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>_orig</span><span>.</span><span>get_requires_for_build_wheel</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span>


<span>def</span> <span>get_requires_for_build_sdist</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>_orig</span><span>.</span><span>get_requires_for_build_sdist</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

<p><code>config_settings=None</code>. OK, this might be the <code>--config-settings</code>
values passed to the build frontend getting fed into the build backend.
I Google <code>get_requires_for_build_wheel</code>. One of the top results is
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP-517</a>, which I click on.</p>
<p>I see that the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/#build-backend-interface">Build backend interface</a>
consists of a handful of functions that are invoked by the build frontend.
These functions all seem to take a <code>config_settings=None</code> argument. Great,
now I know the interface between build frontends and backends at the Python
API level. Where was I in this yak shave?</p>
<p>I remember from <code>pyproject.toml</code> that one of the lines is
<code>build-backend = &#34;setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__&#34;</code>. That
<code>setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__</code> bit looks like a Python symbol reference.
Since the setuptools documentation didn&#39;t answer my question on how to
thread <code>--config-settings</code> into <code>setup.py</code> invocations, I
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/2384d915088b960999ca74fb81ce70bffd17b082/setuptools/build_meta.py">open the build_meta.py source code</a>.
(Aside: experience has taught me that when in doubt on how something works,
consult the source code: code doesn&#39;t lie.)</p>
<p>I search for <code>config_settings</code>. I immediately see
<code>class _ConfigSettingsTranslator:</code> whose purported job is
<code>Translate config_settings into distutils-style command arguments.
Only a limited number of options is currently supported.</code> Oh, this looks
relevant. But there&#39;s a fair bit of code in here. Do I really need to grok
it all? I keep scanning the source.</p>
<p>In a <code>def _build_with_temp_dir()</code> I spot the following code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>*</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>argv</span><span>[:</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_global_args</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>),</span>

    <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_arbitrary_args</span><span>(</span><span>config_settings</span><span>),</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Ahh, cool. It looks to be calling <code>self._global_args()</code> and
<code>self._arbitrary_args()</code> and adding the arguments those functions return
to <code>sys.argv</code> before evaluating <code>setup.py</code> in the current interpreter.</p>
<p>I look at the definition of <code>_arbitrary_args()</code> and I&#39;m onto something:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>_arbitrary_args</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>config_settings</span><span>:</span> <span>_ConfigSettings</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>

</pre></div>

<p>It looks to peek inside <code>config_settings</code> and handle <code>--global-option</code>
and <code>--build-option</code> specially. But we clearly see <code>--global-option</code> is
deprecated in favor of <code>--build-option</code>.</p>
<p>So is the <code>--config-settings</code> key name <code>--build-option</code> and its value
the <code>setup.py</code> argument we want to insert?</p>
<p>I try that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ venv/bin/python -m pip install --config-settings=--build-option=--rust-backend -e .
...
$ ls -al zstandard/*cpython-312*.so

</pre></div>

<p>It worked!</p>
<h2>Disbelief Over <code>--config-settings=--build-option=</code></h2>
<p>But, um, <code>--config-settings=--build-option=--rust-backend</code>. We&#39;ve triple encoded
command arguments here. This feels exceptionally weird. Is that really the
supported/preferred interface? Surely there&#39;s something simpler.</p>
<p><code>def _arbitrary_args()</code>&#39;s docstring mentioned <em>escape hatch</em> in the context
of PEP-517. I open PEP-517 and search for that term, finding
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/#config-settings">Config settings</a>. Sure
enough, it is describing the mechanism I just saw the source code to. And its
pip example is using <code>pip install</code>&#39;s <code>--global-option</code> and <code>--build-option</code>
arguments. So this all seems to check out. (Although these pip arguments are
deprecated in favor of <code>-C/--config-settings</code>.)</p>
<p>Thinking I missed some obvious documentation, I search the setuptools
documentation for <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/search.html?q=%22--build-option%22&amp;check_keywords=yes&amp;area=default#">--build-option</a>.
The only hits are in the <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v64-0-0">v64.0.0 changelog entry</a>.
So you are telling me this feature of passing arbitrary config settings into
<code>setup.py</code> via PEP-517 build frontends is only documented in the <em>changelog</em>?!</p>
<p>Ok, I know my <code>setup.py</code> is abusing <code>sys.argv</code>. I&#39;m off the paved road for
passing settings into <code>setup.py</code>. What is the preferred <code>pyproject.toml</code>
era mechanism for passing settings into <code>setup.py</code>? These settings can&#39;t
be file based because they are dynamic. There must be a <code>config_settings</code>
mechanism to thread dynamic settings into <code>setup.py</code> that doesn&#39;t rely on
these magical <code>--build-option</code> and <code>--global-option</code> settings keys.</p>
<p>I stare and stare at the
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/2384d915088b960999ca74fb81ce70bffd17b082/setuptools/build_meta.py">build_meta.py source code</a>
looking for find an answer. But all I see is the <code>def _build_with_temp_dir()</code>
calling into <code>self._global_args()</code> and <code>self._arbitrary_args()</code> to append
arguments to <code>sys.argv</code>. Huh? Surely this isn&#39;t the only solution. Surely
there&#39;s a simpler way. The setuptools documentation said <em>Adding arguments
to setup is discouraged</em>, seemingly implying a better way of doing it. And
yet the only code I&#39;m seeing in <code>build_meta.py</code> for passing custom
<code>config_settings</code> values in is literally via additional <code>setup.py</code> process
arguments. This can&#39;t be right.</p>
<p>I start unwinding my mental stack and browser tabs trying to come across
something I missed.</p>
<p>I again look at
<a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html#dynamic-build-dependencies-and-other-build-meta-tweaks">Dynamic build dependencies and other build_meta tweaks</a>
and see its code is defining a custom <code>[build-system]</code> backend that
does a <code>from setuptools.build_meta import *</code> and defines some custom
build backend interface APIs (which receive <code>config_settings</code>) and then
proxy into the original implementations. While the example is related to
build metadata, I&#39;m thinking <em>do I need to implement my own setuptools
wrapping build backend that implements a custom
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/#build-wheel">def build_wheel()</a> to
intercept <code>config_settings</code></em>? Surely this is avoidable complexity.</p>
<h2>Pip&#39;s Eager Deprecations</h2>
<p>I keep unwinding context and again notice pip&#39;s warning message telling
me <em>A possible replacement is to use <code>--config-settings</code>. Discussion can
be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859</em>.</p>
<p>I open <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859">pip issue #11859</a>.
Oh, that&#39;s the same issue tracking the <code>--global-option</code> deprecation I
encountered earlier. I again scan the issue timeline. It is mostly
references from other GitHub projects. Telltale sign that this
deprecation is creating waves.</p>
<p>The issue is surprisingly light on comments for how many references it
has.</p>
<p>The comment with
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859#issuecomment-1664649395">the most emoji reactions</a>
says:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Is there an example showing how to use --config-settings with setup.py
and/or newer alternatives? The setuptools documentation is awful and the
top search results are years/decades out-of-date and wildly contradictory.`
</pre></div>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you are, @alexchandel, but we&#39;re on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Then the next comment says:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Something like this seems to work to pass global options to setuptools.

pip -vv install   --config-setting=&#34;--global-option=--verbose&#34;  .

Passing --build-option in the same way does not work, as setuptools
attempts to pass these to the egg_info command where they are not supported.
</pre></div>

<p>So there it seemingly is, confirmation that my independently derived
solution of <code>--config-settings=--build-option=-...</code> is in fact the way to
go. But this commenter says to use <code>--global-option</code>, which appears to
be deprecated in modern setuptools. Oof.</p>
<p>The next comment links to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3896">pypa/setuptools#3896</a>
where apparently there&#39;s been an ongoing conversation since April about how
setuptools should <em>design and document a stable mechanism to pass <code>config_settings</code>
to PEP517 backend</em>.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m interpreting this correctly, it looks like distutils/setuptools - the
primary way to define Python packages for the better part of twenty years -
doesn&#39;t have a stable mechanism for passing configuration settings from
modern <code>pyproject.toml</code> <code>[build-system]</code> frontends. Meanwhile pip is deprecating
long-working mechanisms to pass options to <code>setup.py</code> and forcing people to
use a mechanism that setuptools doesn&#39;t explicitly document much less say is
stable. This is all taking place <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-September/031548.html">six years</a>
after PEP-517 was accepted.</p>
<p>I&#39;m kind of at a loss for words here. I understand pip&#39;s desire to delete some
legacy code and standardize on the new way of doing things. But it really looks
like they are breaking backwards compatibility for <code>setup.py</code> a bit too
eagerly. That&#39;s a <em>questionable</em> decision in my mind, so I
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859#issuecomment-1778620671">write a detailed comment on the pip issue</a>
explaining how the interface works and asking the pip folks to hold off on
deprecation until setuptools has a stable, documented solution. Time will
tell what happens.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>What an adventure that Python packaging yak shave was! I feel
like I just learned a whole lot of things that I shouldn&#39;t have needed to learn
in order to keep my Python package building without deprecation warnings.
Yes, I scope bloated myself to understanding how things worked because
that&#39;s my ethos. But even without that extra work, there&#39;s a lot here that I
feel I shouldn&#39;t have needed to do, like figure out the undocumented
<code>--config-settings=--build-option=</code> interface.</p>
<p>Despite having ported my <code>python setup.py</code> invocation to modern, PEP-517 build
frontends (<code>build</code> and <code>pip</code>) and gotten rid of various deprecation messages
and warnings, I&#39;m still not sure the implications of that transition. I really
want to understand the trade-offs for adopting <code>pyproject.toml</code> and using the
modern build frontends for doing things. But I couldn&#39;t find any documentation
on this anywhere! I don&#39;t know basic things like whether my adoption of
<code>pyproject.toml</code> will break end-users stuck on older Python versions or what.
I still haven&#39;t ported my project metadata from <code>setup.py</code> to <code>pyproject.toml</code>
because I don&#39;t understand the implications. I feel like I&#39;m flying blind and
am bound to make mistakes with undesirable impacts to end-users of my package.</p>
<p>But at least I was able to remove deprecation warnings from my packaging CI
with <em>just</em> several hours of work.</p>
<p>I recognize this post is light on constructive feedback and suggestions
for how to improve matters.</p>
<p>One reason is that I think a lot of the improvements are self-explanatory -
clearer warning messages, better documentation, not deprecating things
prematurely, etc. I prefer to just submit PRs instead of long blog posts. But
I just don&#39;t know what is appropriate in some cases: one of the themes of this
post is I just don&#39;t grok the state of Python packaging right now.</p>
<p>This post did initially contain a few thousand words expanding on what all I
thought was broken and how it should be fixed. But I stripped the content
because I didn&#39;t want my (likely controversial) opinions to distract from
the self-assessed user experience study documented in this post. This content
is probably better posted to a PyPA mailing list anyway, otherwise I&#39;m just
another guy complaining on the Internet.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/user-experience-with-porting-off-setup-py/37502">posted a link</a>
to this post to the
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging/14">packaging category</a> on
<a href="https://discuss.python.org">discuss.python.org</a> so the PyPA (and other
subscribed parties) are aware of all the issues I stumbled over. Hopefully
people with more knowledge of the state of Python packaging see this post,
empathize with my struggles, and enact meaningful improvements so others
can port off <code>setup.py</code> with a fraction of the effort as it took me.</p>
