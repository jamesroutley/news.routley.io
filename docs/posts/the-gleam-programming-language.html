    <h1>The Gleam Programming Language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><section><p>The power of a type system, the expressiveness of functional
              programming, and the reliability of the highly concurrent, fault
              tolerant Erlang runtime, with a familiar and modern syntax.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam/io</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
  <span>io</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>&#34;hello, friend!&#34;</span>)
}</code></pre></section><section><div><h2>Reliable and scalable</h2><p>Running on the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers
              planet-scale systems such as WhatsApp and Ericsson, Gleam is ready for
              workloads of any size.</p><p>Thanks to its multi-core actor based concurrency system that can run
              millions of concurrent green threads, fast immutable data
              structures, and a concurrent garbage collector that never stops
              the world, your service can scale and stay lightning fast with ease.</p></div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; <span>Nil</span> {
  
  <span>list</span>.<span>range</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>200_000</span>)
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>list</span>.<span>each</span>(spawn_greeter)
}

<span>fn</span> <span>spawn_greeter</span>(i: <span>Int</span>) {
  <span>process</span>.<span>spawn</span>(<span>fn</span>() {
    <span>let</span> n = <span>int</span>.<span>to_string</span>(i)
    <span>io</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>&#34;Hello from &#34;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> n)
  })
}</code></pre></section><section><div><h2>Ready when you are</h2><p>Gleam comes with compiler, build tool, formatter, editor integrations,
              and package manager all built in, so creating a Gleam project is just
              running <code>gleam new</code></p><p>As part of the wider BEAM ecosystem, Gleam programs can use thousands of
              published packages, whether they are written in Gleam, Erlang, or
              Elixir.</p></div><pre><code><span>➜ (main)</span> gleam add gleam_json

              type system. Whether you&#39;re writing new code or maintaining old code,
              Gleam is designed to make your job as fun and stress-free as possible.</p></div><pre><code><span>error:</span> Unknown record field

  ┌─ ./src/app.gleam:8:16
  │
8 │ user.alias
  │ <span>    ^^^^^^ Did you mean `name`?</span>

The value being accessed has this type:
    User

It has these fields:
    .name
</code></pre></section><section><div><h2>Multilingual</h2><p>Gleam makes it easy to use code written in other BEAM languages such as
              Erlang and Elixir, so there&#39;s a rich ecosystem of thousands of open
              source libraries for Gleam users to make use of.</p><p>Gleam can additionally compile to JavaScript, enabling you to use your
              code in the browser, or anywhere else JavaScript can run. It also
              generates TypeScript definitions, so you can interact with your Gleam
              code confidently, even from the outside.</p></div><pre><code><span>@external</span>(erlang, <span>&#34;Elixir.HPAX&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;new&#34;</span>)

  })
