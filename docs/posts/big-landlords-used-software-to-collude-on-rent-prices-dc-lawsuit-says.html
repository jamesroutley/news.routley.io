<p>DC&#39;s attorney general has sued 14 of the city&#39;s largest landlord firms, claiming they entered into agreements with a property management software firm to keep rent prices high in a city with a housing affordability crisis.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/DC%20OAG%20RealPage%20Complaint%20-%20Filed.pdf">complaint</a>, filed earlier today by Attorney General Brian Schwalb, focuses on the multifamily landlords&#39; use of software from Texas-based firm RealPage, which suggests rental prices based on a pricing algorithm. Key to those models, according to the suit, is the data fed in from the landlords and the pressure RealPage puts on them to stick to the code-derived rental rates.</p>
<p>&#34;RealPage and the defendant landlords illegally colluded to artificially raise rents by participating in a centralized, anticompetitive scheme, causing District residents to pay millions of dollars above fair market prices,” Schwalb said in <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-sues-realpage-residential">a release tied to the complaint</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration &#34;amounts to a District-wide housing cartel,&#34; Schwalb said, noting that &#34;well over&#34; 30 percent of buildings with five or more units use RealPage&#39;s software, along with 60 percent of 50-unit-plus buildings. Across a wider Washington-Arlington-Alexandria area, more than 90 percent of units in large buildings are subject to RealPage pricing, according to Schwalb&#39;s office.</p>
<p>RealPage&#39;s rent management service, <a href="https://www.realpage.com/videos/yieldstar-optimizes-rent-pricing/">YieldStar</a>, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. RealPage and the property management firms utilizing their software were the subject of <a href="https://www.hausfeld.com/media/550bhzyp/realpage-complaint-filed.pdf">a class-action suit</a> filed in the Southern District of California in October 2022, alleging the &#34;cartel&#34; artificially inflated prices. The Department of Justice&#39;s Antitrust Division <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-realpage-rent-doj-investigation-antitrust">opened an investigation in November 2022</a> into RealPage&#39;s role in potential landlord collusion.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent">ProPublica&#39;s investigation in October 2022</a>, which seemingly incited legal action, noted that YieldStar discourages direct bargaining with renters and can recommend landlords accept lower occupancy rates rather than take lower rents. A developer who worked on YieldStar&#39;s algorithm told ProPublica that rental leasing agents had &#34;too much empathy&#34; compared to the software&#39;s pricing systems. Its creation of &#34;work groups&#34; of would-be rival landlords could also invite antitrust scrutiny, a former federal prosecutor told ProPublica.</p>
<p>Ars contacted RealPage and defendant Greystar Management Services for comment and will update the post with any new information.</p>
<p>In response to ProPublica&#39;s reporting, a RealPage representative said the firm used &#34;aggregated market data from a variety of sources in a legally compliant manner.&#34; The representative also suggested that without RealPage, landlords typically conduct phone checks of competitors&#39; prices, whereas RealPage can &#34;prioritize a property&#39;s own internal supply/demand dynamics over external factors such as competitors&#39; rents.&#34;</p>
<p>Schwalb&#39;s DC lawsuit cites a former &#34;high-ranking manager&#34; at Greystar Management Services, one of the RealPage customers named in the suit, as confirming that landlords used rent management software to collude and raise prices. &#34;He responded that of course they did—it&#39;s the entire reason landlords used the software,&#34; according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The complaint also cites internal and public statements by defendant landlords regarding their strong alignment with RealPage pricing. A slide from an internal Greystar presentation cited in the complaint suggested that &#34;at least 95 percent&#34; of RealPage prices should be used, as &#34;Discipline of using revenue management increased more consistent outcomes.&#34; Former Greystar employees allegedly told the Attorney General&#39;s office that negotiating rents outside RealPage guidance was &#34;unacceptable.&#34;</p>
