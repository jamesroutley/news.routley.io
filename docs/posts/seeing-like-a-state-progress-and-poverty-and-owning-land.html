        I have recently been reading <em>Seeing Like a State</em> by James C.
        Scott, a book about ways in which governments create simplified schemas
        in order to make complex systems “legible”; i.e. understandable,
        measurable, manipulatable. It’s also about how these schemas, applied by
        the power of the state, actually end up shaping what they measure,
        usually along the lines of creating an optimization process for the
        metric or narrow set of metrics being measured, often at the expense of
        the system as a whole. For example, if you were a state managing a
        forest for lumber, you might track the number of trees of a certain
        variety and their heights and diameters as a way to know how much lumber
        you might expect to be able to extract from the forest per year, and
        ignore such things as the density and diversity of undergrowth, animals
        that live in the forest, etc. However, this might lead you to begin
        planting rows of trees of all the same species to replace the old growth
        forests you cut down, because according to the way you “see” the forest
        this is optimal for maximizing lumber. Your schema for seeing the forest
        ignores the necessity of its diversity, and this results in some
        unforeseen side-affect like disease destroying your whole crop of
        planted trees, or declining soil fertility which results in poor yields
        several generations down the line.

        Scott applies this lens to land use, which is where this book gets
        really good. As the modern state developed, it was tasked with “somehow
        attaching every parcel of taxable property to an individual or an
        institution responsible for paying the tax on it” in order to be able to
        collect taxes on land. This was not really straightforward, because land
        use customs (not laws; they were flexible and usually not written)
        varied so much across different localities and were ever-changing. He
        provides an illustration of a hypothetical “traditional” land use
        scenario. I’ll quote the whole thing because I found it really
        interesting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Let us imagine a community in which families have usufruct rights to
          parcels of cropland during the main growing season. Only certain
          crops, however, may be planted, and every seven years the usufruct
          land is redistributed among resident families according to each
          family’s size and its number of able-bodied adults. After the harvest
          of the main-season crop, all cropland reverts to common land where any
          family may glean, graze their fowl and livestock, and even plant
          quickly maturing, dry-season crops. Rights to graze fowl and livestock
          on pasture-land held in common by the village is extended to all local
          families, but the number of animals that can be grazed is restricted
          according to family size, especially in dry years when forage is
          scarce. Families not using their grazing rights can give them to other
          villagers but not to outsiders. Everyone has the right to gather
          firewood for normal family needs, and the village blacksmith and baker
          are given larger allotments. No commercial sale from village woodlands
          is permitted. Trees that have been planted and any fruit they may bear
          are the property of the family who planted them, no matter where they
          are now growing. Fruit fallen from such trees, however, is the
          property of anyone who gathers it. When a family fells one of its
          trees or a tree is felled by a storm, the trunk belongs to the family,
          the branches to the immediate neighbors, and the “tops” (leaves and
          twigs) to any poorer villager who carries them off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Land is set aside for use or leasing out by widows with children and
          dependents of conscripted males. Usufruct rights to land and trees may
          be let to anyone in the village; the only time they may be let to
          someone outside the village is if no one in the community wishes to
          claim them. After a crop failure leading to a food shortage, many of
          these arrangements are readjusted. Better-off villagers are expected
          to assume some responsibility for poorer relatives—by sharing their
          land, by hiring them, or by simply feeding them. Should the shortage
          persist, a council composed of heads of families may inventory food
          supplies and begin daily rationing. In cases of severe shortages or
          famine, the women who have married into the village but have not yet
          borne children will not be fed and are expected to return to their
          native village. This last practice alerts us to the inequalities that
          often prevail in local customary tenure; single women, junior males,
          and anyone defined as falling outside the core of the community are
          clearly disadvantaged.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Scott is quick to mention that this scenario itself is a simplification,
        and creates the false impression that these customs are fixed, when they
        are closer to a living, negotiated set of practices continually adapting
        to ecological and social circumstances. Because this type of thing can’t
        be encoded in a set of laws, and because customs varied so widely from
        village to village, this way of dividing and using land could not be
        “legible” to the state. These fine-tailored and context-dependant land
        use practices are opaque to an outsider, so land cannot be managed from
        a centralized authority, and it cannot be taxed as effectively.
        According to Scott: “Indeed, the very concept of the modern state
        presupposes a vastly simplified and uniform property regime that is
        legible and hence manipulable from the center.” To fix this, the state
        (Scott mostly focuses on Russia and France for these chapters) undertook
        a scheme to introduce individual freehold tenure, where “Land is owned
        by a legal individual who possesses wide powers of use, inheritance, or
        sale and whose ownership is represented by a uniform deed of title
        enforced through the judicial and police institutions of the state.”
        This idea is obviously quite familiar to a 21st century Western reader.
        In fact, any other way of dividing land feels quite foreign to me, so it
        was surprising to learn that this was a relatively recent development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another book that I read recently is <em>Progress and Poverty</em> by
        Henry George, which is also about land use. George basically
        deconstructs all of our accepted ideas about land ownership. He claims
        that they have no basis in nature, showing how traditional societies did
        not have a concept of single ownership of land (he uses Native American
        societies for his argument). He points out that there are no
        “legitimate” claims to land ownership; all land ownership has its origin
        in bloodshed, whether in the New World, where Europeans appropriated
        land that had traditionally been lived on and used by Indigenous
        peoples, or in the Old, where land ownership has always come from
        conquest and war. George’s philosophy is that man is entitled only to
        what he produces through his own labour, and since land (and the value
        of land) is not created by man, it cannot be the entitlement of anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Scott, George is mostly focused on land use in modern, urban
        environments. George shows how, in cities, since new land cannot be
        created, land values will increase as the wealth of the city grows. As a
        downstream consequence, rents will rise to eat up any increase in wealth
        produced by the labour of the people of that city. Land owners, while
        producing no wealth, will be able to appropriate the wealth produced by
        others due to their monopoly on land. This book is almost 200 years old,
        but this situation sounds familiar doesn’t it? Now, I don’t know if I
        agree wholeheartedly here. It seems to me that if housing is abundant
        enough, say because land has been developed to higher intensification as
        the city has grown, then landlords will not be able to gouge their
        tenants, as long as the market is competitive. Still, George makes a
        solid argument that land speculation and rent gouging are the two main
        causes of the economic ills of industrial, urban society. You can read a
        much more detailed summary and review of
        <em>Progress and Poverty</em> on AstralCodexTen by Lars Doucet,
        <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, so Henry George convinced me that our system of land ownership is
        unjust; and George and Scott together convinced me that it isn’t
        inevitable. So what’s the alternative? The kind of anarchistic form of
        negotiated and customary land use described by Scott is does not easily
        translate to a modern industrial city setting. Besides, the peasants
        described by Scott still owned and had full control over their own
        houses in the village, it was the “common land” whose use was more
        complex and communal. I’m not sure how much this philosophy of the
        commons is relevant to urban areas. In my mind it makes more sense that
        a single government representing the people should decide how common
        land should be used. I <em>do</em> think that privately owned land
        should have a lot more flexibility in how it is used and built upon in
        urban environments, but that is slightly tangential.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resolve the issue of private land ownership, Henry George proposes a
        land tax, which he says would eradicate land ownership in practice by
        making it impossible to profit off of the value of land. The government
        would assess land values and tax land owners at 100% of the value of the
        land. That way, people would be free to “own” land in the sense of
        having their name on a deed and autonomy over its use, but they would
        have to pay the value of that land back to the commons in the form of a
        tax. We kind of already do tax land. We have property taxes. The
        difference is that property taxes are levied on the value of the land
        and the <em>improvements</em> on the land. So, if you buy land and then
        build a house on it, your tax bill will increase since the property
        value has increased. Also, property taxes generally don’t capture
        anywhere near 100% of the property&#39;s land value.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like this idea a lot, but I don’t think it will ever be politically
        popular. People like to own land. It gives them a sense of security and
        pride. You can imagine how a land tax could undermine this. For example,
        say I’m Carl Fredricksen from the Pixar movie <em>Up.</em> I bought my
        house 55 years ago, and in the time that I’ve lived in it the city has
        grown up around me so that the plot of land that my house sits on is now
        extremely valuable. In our existing system of modest property taxes, I
        can continue to live in the house as long as I can stomach paying a
        slightly larger tax bill each year. In some places (like California),
        I’m actually exempt from property tax increases; so it&#39;s very unlikely
        that I&#39;ll ever have trouble affording to stay in my home. If I was being
        taxed at 100% of the land’s value, the pressure to sell or try to
        develop my land would become massive as the land value appreciates.
        Remember that Carl’s house is flanked on each side by high-rises,
        implying that <em>a lot</em> of value (in the form of rent) could
        theoretically be extracted from his land. It is safe to say that in a
        100% land tax system, Carl would be forced off his land. This kind of
        possibility makes people very uncomfortable. The movie actually
        demonstrates a way that this tension could be resolved. Carl doesn’t
        <em>like</em> living in a busy construction zone, but he is emotionally
        attached to the house he shared with with deceased wife and can’t let it
        go. For this reason, moving the house – accomplished in the movie by
        attaching a clump of balloons to it and making it float away – eases the
        tension. Carl gets to keep his house, and presumably the land underneath
        it gets put to better use.

      <p>
        So Scott shows us how the modern state created freehold land ownership
        to make land use more “legible” for taxation. George starts with the
        system of freehold tenure, but shows us how we might co-opt it and give
        the wealth back to the common good. One thing to point out here is that
        <em>Seeing Like a State</em> is overflowing with historical examples of
        governments expanding their power and wealth and using their increase
        for anything but the common good. Scott’s book is fairly wary of
        large-scale government intervention in general, a sentiment backed up by
        example after example of governments using taxation, or increased
        information about their citizens, to wreak havoc on social systems that
        are illegible to them. Can we believe that a 100% land tax would, as
        George hopes, be used in place of all other taxes? George envisions that
        the revenues from this tax would be invested in public works and
        distributed as a “dividend” to all citizens – a universal basic income.
        Whether this would happen in practice I imagine Scott would be highly
        doubtful. Still, a land tax seems like the only way we could “eliminate”
        land ownership without restructuring society.
      </p>
      <p>
        To summarize how these two books have changed my thinking on land
        ownership, I would firstly say that both books have worked together to
        convince me that the system of land use and ownership that dominates the
        world today is actually an historical anomaly (not land ownership itself
        of course, but the system of deeds and cadastral maps that we moderns
        are familiar with). This opens the door to accepting that current
        holders of land, and the laws that back them, are not standing firmly on
        a foundation dating back to the dawn of civilization as they might want
        you to believe. That truth probably should have been more obvious to me
        as a Canadian citizen; a nation founded on land that had been used by
        other people for tens of thousands of years prior to European
        settlement. Every land deed in this country should have the world’s
        largest disclaimer attached to it. Yet, as Henry George points out, the
        institution has a shady history no matter where in the world you look.
        In this spirit, I think our social discourse should have more
        willingness to explore alternate ways that our land could be used and
        shared, with a philosophy that land should serve the common good
        foremost.
