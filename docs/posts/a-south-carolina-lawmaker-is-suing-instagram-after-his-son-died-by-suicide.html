      About two weeks after his oldest son’s funeral, South Carolina state house<strong> </strong>Rep. Brandon Guffey says he received a private Instagram message with a laughing emoji.
  </p>

      Gavin Guffey, 17, had fatally shot himself in a bathroom in July 2022, and the grieving father was searching for clues on what led to his suicide.

      Then Guffey and his younger son began to get messages demanding money in exchange for nude photos of his late son. Anyone on Gavin’s Instagram followers list who had the last name Guffey got similar messages, his father says.

      The family began piecing together Gavin’s last moments and discovered he had encountered a scammer on Instagram and unwittingly became a victim of sexual extortion, a crime the FBI warns is increasingly targeting underage boys and leading to an alarming increase in suicides nationwide.

      Now Guffey is suing Instagram’s parent company, Meta, for wrongful death, gross negligence and other claims, saying it does not do enough to protect children like Gavin from online predators.

      The lawsuit, filed in South Carolina state court last week, accuses Meta’s social media platforms of causing a range of problems in children, including depression, low self-esteem, anxiety and eating disorders. It alleges<strong> </strong>that Meta uses algorithms to aggressively target adolescents and does not do enough to keep them safe from harm.

      In the suit, Guffey says Meta does not have tools in place to protect underage kids who use its platforms in “almost every aspect of their lives” and are unaware of its potentially negative effects.

      But the spokesperson said that teen safety is a big priority for the company and that it offers <a href="https://familycenter.meta.com/" target="_blank">dozens of resources</a> to help its young users stay safe. The company says it also encourages teens to seek help and to fight back if they’ve been targeted.

      Minutes before he died by suicide at his home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, Gavin texted his younger brother and his friends a heart-shaped symbol of love – &lt;3 – on a black background.

      Since then, Guffey has been outspoken about his son’s death and sponsored legislation last year that makes sexual extortion an aggravated felony punishable by years in prison if the victim is a minor or <a href="https://governor.sc.gov/news/2023-08/governor-henry-mcmaster-signs-gavins-law#:~:text=The%20legislation%20makes%20sexual%20extortion%2C%20the%20act%20of%20blackmailing%20someone%20using%20sexually%20explicit%20images%20or%20videos%2C%20a%20felony%20offense%20and%20an%20aggravated%20felony%20if%20the%20victim%20is%20a%20minor%2C%20vulnerable%20adult%2C%20or%20if%20the%20victim%20suffers%20bodily%20injury%20or%20death%20directly%20related%20to%20the%20crime." target="_blank">vulnerable adult or if the victim suffers bodily injury or death directly related to the crime</a>.

      State senators passed the bill and named it “<a href="https://ed.sc.gov/newsroom/strategic-engagement/gavins-law/" target="_blank">Gavin’s Law</a>” before sending it to Gov. Henry McMaster, who signed it into law.

      Before Gavin’s death by suicide, scammers had reached out to him on Instagram, convinced him he was talking to a girl his age and persuaded him to send nude photos, his father says.

      The extortion started almost immediately after. The scammers demanded money, and Gavin sent $25 via Venmo, which is all he had at the time, Guffey says. He pleaded with his scammers to give him more time.

      Sextortion scams have increasingly made headlines nationwide. In August, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan extradited two men from Nigeria for allegedly extorting young men and teenage boys.

      “If I have a party on my property, and I invite everybody on there, I’m responsible for what happens on my property,” Guffey told CNN.  “And for some reason, we treat these digital companies different. These companies hide behind section 230 and say they’re not responsible.”
