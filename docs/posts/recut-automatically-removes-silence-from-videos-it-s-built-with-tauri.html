        <p>I knew getrecut.com is awesome, but it blew my freakin mind anyway.</p>
        <p>I used to say that 1 minute of video takes 1 hour to make.</p>
        <p>Well I just made 11 minute video in ~30 minutes.  Recording and everything.</p>

        <p>I absolutely <em>LOVE</em> Recut! I&#39;ve been creating Youtube videos for over a year, and half of my time editing is spent doing the tedious things like editing out the silence / breaths between words. This was easily the best $100 I&#39;ve ever spent.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons I&#39;ve not been in a rush to find an editor is because of Recut. It&#39;s one of the few things that has honestly been a game changer for me when it comes to Youtube.</p>

        <p>I bought this in a heartbeat. It&#39;s going to save so much time editing screencasts.</p>
        <p>Such a smart, simple app.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Thank you a MILLION for writing Recut. This is a tool that, after using it once, I would have paid $100 just for that one time. Thank you so much for developing and doing it well.</p>
        <p>This tool REVOLUTIONIZES how I&#39;m able to not only edit videos, but conceive and record them since it frees me up to not worry about dead time or bad takes. It paid for itself after one use. It‚Äôs stupid easy to use and is enabling me to produce more content, faster, and easier.</p>

<h2>Editing videos normally takes <em>*forever*</em></h2>
<p>Even after all the time planning and recording, you know you&#39;re in for a few more hours of tedious editing.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re like many screencasters, YouTubers, and course creators I know, a big chunk of that time is spent slicing out the silent parts.</p>
<p><em>click</em> ... <em>split clip</em> ... <em>click</em> ... <em>split clip</em> ... <em>select the silence</em> ... <em>ripple delete</em></p>
<p>Over and over. Until you&#39;ve got something like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://getrecut.com/images/speed-up-screenflow-workflow.png" srcset="images/speed-up-screenflow-workflow@2x.png 2x" height="126" alt="Screenshot of a timeline with hundreds of cuts for a 10 minute video"/></p>
<p>Hundreds of tiny, tedious, Hand-Crafted‚Ñ¢ cuts.</p>
<h2>Shortcuts and tricks don&#39;t cut it</h2>
<p>You&#39;ve tried all the strategies to make this faster...</p>
<ul>
<li>leaving long pauses, or clapping between takes</li>
<li>using &#34;markers&#34; during recording to help find the &#34;good takes&#34; and eliminate the bad</li>
<li>learning all the keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>These all help quite a bit! But even with these tricks up your sleeve, removing silence is still a manual slog.</p>
<h2>What if the computer did it for you?</h2>
<p>How about this workflow, instead?</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag your video into Recut.</li>
<li>Recut finds the silence automatically...</li>
<li>...and cuts the video into clips for you.</li>
<li>Hit <em>Export</em> to send the clips to your favorite editor</li>
</ol>
<p>Bye-bye silence üëã, hello free time.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Remove Silence</h3>
    <p>Recut finds silence and deletes it, so you can spend less time doing tedious editing.</p>
    <p>Here it is in its natural habitat, cutting a 10 minute recording down to 5:22.</p>
    <p><img src="https://getrecut.com/images/feature-remove-silence.png" srcset="images/feature-remove-silence@2x.png 2x" alt="Delete silence from videos, podcasts, and screencasts"/>
  </p></div>
  <div>
    <h3>Instant Live Preview</h3>
    <p>Hit Play and immediately hear how it sounds, skipping over the silent parts, without waiting for an export.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Edit Audio, Too</h3>
    <p>Recut works on audio files too, so you can import your podcasts (or long lecture recordings) and cut out all the pauses with a few clicks.</p>
  </div>
  <!--
  <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-span-1">
    <h3 class="text-2xl text-bluegray-700 mt-12 sm:mt-8">Cut the Bad Takes</h3>
    <p>A quick click + Delete will remove any audible parts that you wish didn't exist.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl text-bluegray-700 mt-12 sm:mt-8">Don't Cut Everything!</h3>
    <p>If you have some important silent parts ‚Äì like showing something on screen, or pausing for dramatic effect ‚Äì you can tell Recut to keep them.</p>

    <h3>Sounds Natural</h3>
    <p>Tweak the &#34;padding&#34; between cuts to give your words a little breathing room, or cram it together withzerobreaksbetweenwords if you want.</p>

  <div>
    <h3>Export the Timeline</h3>
    <p>Exporting the cut list is perfect when you have more editing to do after the silence is gone.</p>
    <p>Auto-delete the silence using Recut, then export the cut list to a variety of tools lik Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, Sony PowerDirector, and others that support XML or FCPXML.</p>

<h2>Works with audio, too</h2>
<p>Got a podcast to edit? Or maybe a long call you want to cut down to size.</p>
<p>Drag that file right into Recut :)</p>
<h2>Export the timeline to edit in other apps</h2>
<p>Your original recording is never modified ‚Äî this is <em>nondestructive editing</em>.</p>
<p>Recut can export the cutlist to your favorite app, where you can do the final edits, audio adjustments, screen annotations, and whatever else you normally do.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve probably invested a lot of hours learning your current set of tools. Recut won&#39;t make you throw them away.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>How does the license work?</h3>
<p>You can buy <strong>a single license</strong> and use it on <strong>both</strong> Windows and Mac. You do not need to buy separate copies for your Mac and PC.</p>
<p>The license is for <strong>one individual</strong> on all of the computers in your household.</p>
<p>If you are buying for a company or outfitting a team, you&#39;ll need one copy per person.</p>
<h3>Is this a subscription?</h3>
<p>Buying a license gets you unlimited use of the app, and one year of updates.</p>
<p>After one year is up, you can choose to buy an upgrade for another year of updates ‚Äì but you don&#39;t have to. If the app is still doing everything you need, awesome! Keep on using it. It will continue to work after the year is up.</p>
<p>It does <em>not</em> automatically renew.</p>
<p>Kind of like a magazine subscription (minus the auto-renewal): you pay for a year of issues. If you stop paying, they stop coming, but you can keep the ones you have.</p>
<h3>What&#39;s the refund policy?</h3>
<p>There&#39;s a 30-day money back guarantee. If Recut doesn&#39;t suit your needs, just send an email to <a href="mailto:dave@getrecut.com">dave@getrecut.com</a> and I&#39;ll send you a full refund.</p>
<h3>What operating systems does Recut support?</h3>
<p>Recut works on Windows 8+ and macOS 10.13+.</p>
<p>It runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon M1 Macs.</p>
<p>Recut doesn&#39;t run on Linux, iPad, iPhone, or Android ‚Äì sorry!</p>
<h3>What video/audio formats can Recut open?</h3>
<p>Recut works with a wide variety of video and audio formats ‚Äì all the standard ones like MP4, M4A, MP3, MKV, and so on.</p>
<p>Please download a copy of the free trial and give it a try with your own files to make sure everything works before purchasing.</p>
<p>There are a few known formats that Recut <em>can&#39;t</em> read:</p>
<ul>
<li>BRAW</li>
<li>ScreenFlow recordings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can I edit my podcast (or other audio) with Recut?</h3>
<p>Yes! You can open audio-only files like .mp3, .wav, and .m4a.</p>
<p>Recut can either export the cut list (which you can import into a full-featured editor like Adobe Premiere), or export the edited audio as an .m4a file.</p>
<h3>What formats can Recut export to?</h3>
<p>Recut can export either a cut list, or an audio/video file.</p>
<p>If you need to do more editing in your favorite editor, you can export a cut list in these formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>XML (for Adobe Premiere, Sony PowerDirector, OpenShot, and others that can import XML)</li>
<li>FCPXML (for Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just want the video or audio, export an MP4, M4A, or WAV with the silence stripped out.</p>
<h3>Can Recut handle multiple tracks at once?</h3>
<p>Yes! If your workflow involves multiple cameras, or you record video + audio separately, you can open all of those files in Recut and remove silence from the batch of them.</p>
<p>There are controls to let you &#34;ignore&#34; certain tracks from having silence removed, which is useful if you have a track with background music or gameplay, or you have a combo of camera audio and an external mic (and you want to mute the camera audio after syncing everything up).</p>
<h3>Is Recut a full-featured video editor?</h3>
<p>Recut is great at finding and removing silence, but it&#39;s a very focused tool.</p>
<p>Recut does support exporting the timeline of edits to other apps for fine tuning, though, so you can start with Recut and finish with your favorite tool.</p>
<h3>Will Recut fit my workflow?</h3>
<p>Everyone has a different way of working, and it&#39;s hard to know if a piece of software will fit until you try it out.</p>
<p>The best way to find out is to <a href="#" data-micromodal-trigger="download-trial">download the trial</a>. You can get a feel for how it works with your workflow.</p>
<h3>Does Recut have [awesome feature xyz]?</h3>
<p>I&#39;m gonna be totally honest with you: Recut doesn&#39;t have a lot of features. Not yet, anyway ;)</p>
<p>Here are some things that Recut can&#39;t do right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>batch editing</li>
<li>transcription</li>
<li>remove &#34;ums&#34; and &#34;ahs&#34;</li>
<li>fancy video overlays...</li>
<li>or actually, any kind of video overlays</li>
<li>...plenty more</li>
</ul>
<p>As a solo developer with limited time, I wanted to prioritize getting something <em>useful</em> into people&#39;s hands <em>now</em>, rather than striving for something perfect in the far future.</p>
<p>If Recut doesn&#39;t fit your needs yet, keep checking back! It&#39;ll keep getting better.</p>
