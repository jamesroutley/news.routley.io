<p><em>This article is an adaptation of a Lightning Talk I gave at CppCon2021. A link to the video will be given here as soon as it’s available.</em></p>



<p>I’ll touch on a lighter subject this week, nonetheless quite important: is my cat Turing-complete?</p>



<h2 id="meet-peluche">Meet Peluche</h2>



<p>Peluche (meaning “plush” in French) is a smooth cat that somehow lives in my house.</p>







<p>She will be our test subject today.</p>



<h2 id="is-peluche-turing-complete">Is Peluche Turing-complete?</h2>



<h3 id="what-is-turing-completeness">What is Turing-completeness</h3>



<p>Turing-completeness is the notion that if a device can emulate a Turing machine, then it can perform any kind of computation<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>.</p>



<p>It means that any machine that implements the eight following instructions is a computer (and can thus execute any kind of computation):</p>



<ul><li><code>.</code> and <code>,</code>: Inputting and outputting a value</li><li><code>+</code> and <code>-</code>: Increase and decrease the value contained in a memory cell<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup>.</li><li><code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>: Shift the current memory tape left or right.</li><li><code>[</code> and <code>]</code>: Performing loops.</li></ul>



<p>So, if Peluche can perform these eight instructions, we can consider her Turing-complete.</p>



<h3 id="proof-of-the-turing-completeness">Proof of the Turing-completeness</h3>



<h4 id="input-and-output">Input and output</h4>



<p>First, I tried to poke Peluche if I could get a reaction.</p>







<p>She looked at me, then just turned around.</p>







<p>So here it is: I poked her, and I got a reaction. So she can process inputs and give outputs.</p>



<p>Input/output confirmed!</p>



<h4 id="increase-and-decrease-memory-value">Increase and decrease memory value</h4>



<p>The other day, I came back from work to this:</p>







<p>Kibbles everywhere…</p>



<p>But then I took a closer look and realized that the slabs could be numbered, like this:</p>







<p>This looks pretty much like a memory tape to me! Since she can spill kibbles on the tiles and then eat them directly from the floor, she can increase and decrease the values contained in a given memory cell.</p>



<p>Increase/decrease confirmed!</p>



<h4 id="shift-the-current-memory-cell-left-or-right">Shift the current memory cell left or right</h4>



<p>Another time, I was doing the dishes and <em>inadvertently </em>spilled some water on Peluche. She began to run everywhere around the kitchen, making a huge mess. </p>







<p>If you look close (at the tip of the red arrow), you may notice that while making this mess, she displaced her bowl.</p>



<p>Displacing her bowl means she will spill her kibbles in another tile. This counts as shifting the memory head to edit another memory cell.</p>



<p>Shift of the memory tape confirmed!</p>



<h4 id="perform-loops">Perform loops</h4>



<p>So, after this mess, I (obviously) had to clean up. </p>



<p>No more than five minutes later, I went back to the kitchen to this:</p>







<p>Yeah… she can <em>DEFINITELY</em> perform loops…</p>



<p>Loops confirmed!</p>



<p>We have just proven that Peluche is, indeed, Turing-complete. So now, how can we use her to perform high-performance computations?</p>



<h2 id="what-to-do-with-her">What to do with her?</h2>



<p>Now that I’ve proven that Peluche is Turing-complete, I can literally do anything with her!</p>



<p>Thus, I tried to give her simple code to execute<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p>The result was final: she wouldn’t do a thing. </p>



<p>Though they can, maybe cats are not designed to execute code after all?</p>



<h2 id="about-cat-computing">About “cat-computing”</h2>



<p>Jokes aside, <em>cat-computing</em> is the name I give to this generalized practice. In my experience, it happens quite often that when someone discovers a new feature of a language, they begin to use it everywhere, just because they can and they want to.</p>



<p>However, just like you can execute code using a cat<sup><a href="#note">4</a></sup> but shouldn’t, it’s not because you <em>can </em>use a feature that you <em>should</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>They were too busy wondering if they could to think about whether they should.</p><cite>Dr Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park</cite></blockquote>



<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Cat-computing seems to be a rookie mistake (and it is), but even the most experienced developers sometimes make rookie mistakes (and there’s no shame in that).</p>



<p>Every three years, a new version of C++ is published. Every time, it makes me want to use the new features in every possible situation. Though this is a good opportunity to build some experience around that (one of the best ways to avoid misuses of a feature is to perform these misuses once, in my opinion), this is also favorable ground for acquiring bad practices. </p>



<p>Always ask yourself if a feature is necessary<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> before using it, or else you may do cat-computing.</p>



<p>Also, cat-computing is animal abuse, so don’t do it 😠.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading and see you next week! </p>



<p>(<em>No cats were harmed during the writing of this article, but one was gently poked.</em>)</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>



<ol><li>This is a simplified definition, very inaccurate but accurate enough for this example. If you want the real definition, go there: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing completeness – Wikipedia</a></li><li>I did not state it explicitly, but a Turing machine has a “memory tape” with “memory cells” on it. The machine is always pointing to a memory cell, which is the mentioned “current” memory cell.</li><li>You may not be able to read this sample of code — this is a fancy new language I designed called “braincat”.</li><li>Actually, you can’t execute code using a cat, I know, but it’s for the sake of the metaphor that I assume you can.</li><li>Of course, necessity occurs when there is a known benefit to the feature. I’m not talking about “absolute necessity” but about “practical necessity”.</li></ol>
