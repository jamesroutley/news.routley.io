                            <p>This is the third time I&#39;ve re-read this book, and I liked it the least this time. This book has a few important points, some of which I haven&#39;t found other books that talk about â€” in particular, the ideas about the tautological nature of &#34;rationality&#34; and &#34;science&#34; are important and unique, and the ideas about the nuances of what about the relationship of people to technology causes unhappiness and strife is well-considered. Unfortunately, much of the book is discussion of the novel philosophical concept that the author calls &#34;Quality&#34;, a concept which I think is ill-considered and ill-argued. Frustrating, since the disagreements the author assumes a reader might have with his arguments are not the ones that I have.</p>
<p>I still do love this book, and I certainly would still recommend it in many circumstances, but I was sad to return to it and find it not quite as lovely as I&#39;d remembered. Then again, this book has somewhat of a reputation as being a book that&#39;s attractive to younger people, so perhaps that&#39;s natural.</p>
