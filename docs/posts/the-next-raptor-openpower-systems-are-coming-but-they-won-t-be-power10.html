Considering the official announcement said &#34;direct upgrade&#34;, I&#39;m hoping that means that OSes like Ad√©lie Linux and OpenBSD will continue to function on the new chip.</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="6403910662664813262">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=6403910662664813262">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c7104173422567006263"><p><img src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif" alt=""/></p><div><p>Hello i really wanted power 10 cpu for new raptor computer.

The Power10 implements ISA 3.1, so the S1 would be compatible with it, but I imagine the new name is to avoid confusion and make it clear it&#39;s not saddled with the original&#39;s baggage.</p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=3213619785742672276">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li></div></ol></div></div></li><li id="c6793855930588393425"><p><img src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif" alt=""/></p><div><p>The most pressing question is, who is going to fab these chips, and at what node? This will have massive impact on both performance and power consumption as well as cost: And nodes that are competitive with what other architectures have on offer are expensive.</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="6793855930588393425">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=6793855930588393425">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c4808875893586578243"><p><img src="https://www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""/></p><div><p>The S1 cannot be anything other than a Power10.

Indeed it cannot be if it&#39;s intended to be a competitive performer. Just what exactly it is, where it comes from, and how they&#39;re planning to get it made, is still not entirely clear from the announcements.</p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=6346703402465915734">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c8824896107921625721"><p><img src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif" alt=""/></p><div><p>to me, the best case could be: if they licensed chunks of the power10 IP from IBM, and stripped out the bad bits, it&#39;s feasible that they could have licensed the memory controller or done it themselves, and then get the result fabbed at the same places power10 is done at, we would basically end up with what we wanted from the start</p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=8824896107921625721">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li></div></ol></div></div></li><li id="c2906635654348631589"><p><img src="https://www.blogger.com/img/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""/></p><div><p>This is actually what I was hoping for. IBM really hasn&#39;t been interested in workspace/small servers since before they sold all their x86 stuff off. While we have some info here that the BMC is based on the work done off of the MicroWatt and Raptor CS BMC, I really hope a bunch of the other work is based-on, and potentially gets upstreamed into MicroWatt and other repos.  It&#39;d be quite nice to have POWER that implements an ISA, a spec, and can be looked at to see the peculiarities of it. It&#39;d also be nice to have a QEMU platform for it so we can start cobbling together software for it before it gets released.</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="2906635654348631589">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=1196390459016343329&amp;postID=2906635654348631589">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li></ol></div>
