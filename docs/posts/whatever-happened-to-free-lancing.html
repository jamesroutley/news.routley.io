    <h1>Ask HN: Whatever Happened To *Free*lancing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m trying to break into freelancing/consulting/contracting.</p><p>Following best advice on the net/podcasts/etc I&#39;m contacting my past companies plus some new ones and all of them tell me the same exact story.</p><p>&#34;No. We cannot hire freelancers directly. You must go through a third company (consulting firm/body shop) which we work with.&#34;</p><p>But why the heck would I even consider doing that? The whole point of freelancing (at least IMO) is being _free_ from the middlemen.</p><p>Anyway, humoring the idea of actually doing that I contacted one of these middlemen companies and was sent a hideous contract full of terms that -let&#39;s put it mildly- are not in my favor. (Liabilities fully on me, limitations on where I can go afterwards, Information asymmetry, need to support for long after project finish, etc).</p><p>So the question remains - is there any real freelancing still on? (I&#39;m not talking platforms here - I wouldn&#39;t go there for several reasons).</p><p>Could it be that the specific market I&#39;ve been looking at (UK/IE) is skewed like that and other markets are in better shape?</p><p>Thanks</p></div></div></div>
