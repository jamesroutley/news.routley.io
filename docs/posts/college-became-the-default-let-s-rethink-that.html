    <h1>College became the default – Let&#39;s rethink that</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>I graduated from Rutgers University in 1985 and recently had occasion to visit the campus. I was struck, just as I was decades ago, by the contrast between the look of the dormitories built early in the 20th century like Ford Hall (1915) and Hegeman Hall (1922) and that of the great many put up after World War II such as Frelinghuysen Hall (1956) and Mettler Hall (1964). University campuses tend to harbor that kind of contrast between the doughty old ones and the midcentury-modern-ish new ones. Often, the proliferation of the latter allowed the schools to accommodate a vast increase in the student body in the wake of the G.I. Bill after the war.</p><p>It was then that the idea really started settling in that the prescribed path in America is to go to college after high school. In 1940, only <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/comm/cb17-51_educational_attainment.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about one in 20</a> adults had completed college (today it’s closer to one in three), and that wasn’t thought of as a tragedy. By contrast, a White House <a href="https://sites.ed.gov/whiaiane/files/2012/04/President-Obamas-education-agenda.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> on President Barack Obama’s education agenda once proclaimed, “Because economic progress and educational achievement go hand in hand, educating every American student to graduate prepared for college and for success in a new work force is a national imperative.”</p><p>The question is why we can’t just prepare students for the work force. Why do we assume that people need four whole years of further education after high school? One answer comes from Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College. He wrote an underattended manifesto about what American education should be, “Jefferson’s Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture,” which is 25 years old this year. Before Rutgers, I attended Bard’s subsidiary Simon’s Rock (now Bard College at Simon’s Rock), but I would be singing this book to the skies even if I had never known Bard, Simon’s Rock or Botstein.</p><p>The upshot is simple: The idea that in our society the ordinary trajectory after high school is to attend another four years of school has become arbitrary, purposeless and even absurd. Botstein noted, “America has a more elaborate educational system that spreads over more years, reaches more people and ends up with results for the entire population that are worse than those countries with educational systems that are explicitly not democratic and on the surface offer fewer opportunities for advanced education.” This model, he argued, is hardly what we would choose if asked with no experience how things should go. He argued that the model of high school we currently use is from a time when teenagers were, on average, less intellectually mature than they are now. Botstein proposed instead that childhood education can stop at 10th grade and that the education kids get during that year be a richer one than kids typically get today even going up through 12 grades.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Simon’s Rock takes kids from 10th or 11th grade and jumps them right onto the college track — what the school calls “early college.” That means Rockers (as we call ourselves) are technically high school dropouts. I, for one, have no high school diploma and never took the SAT. (I invite my detractors to have fun with that fact.) As the school’s website <a href="https://simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes clear</a>, when a student applies, what Simon’s Rock is looking for is “not a set of numbers but an expression of your character, ambitions, imagination and intelligence.” Put another way, the idea is to respect the minds of young people, rather than assume that they are for some reason unburnished until the magic age of 18.</p><p>We should also understand that just as some kids at 16 are ready for a college education, just as many kids at that age are ready to take their places in the working world. Most of us today would have a hard time articulately justifying why people must spend four years taking about 40 courses in this and that before becoming executives, administrators or fund-raisers.</p><p>Sure, you might worry that they wouldn’t be educated enough for those roles after completing the 10th grade, but here’s some more about Botstein’s hypothesized 10-grade curriculum: The dream is that students would be steeped not in memorization but in thought. They would be indoctrinated in neither sugarcoated celebration nor radical pieties. Rather, they’d be taught the importance of having open and moral minds with a curriculum rich in text and chronicle.</p><p>As a demonstration of what young minds are capable of, consider that in the past, Americans without formal postsecondary education could be better educated in some ways than college graduates are today. The eloquently composed letters from modestly educated soldiers during the Civil War are a famous example. Another one that I have always kept in mind is that in the 1830s, in a diary entry that became public when he was tried for the murder of a courtesan, a teenager <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=W_xvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=Most+youths+at+seventeen+or+eighteen+years+of+age+take+a+pride+in+boasting+of+their+amours,+of+their+dissipations,+and+of+their+wild+exploits;+I+have,+however,+no+taste+for+such+exposures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wBH0RhkUhP&amp;sig=ACfU3U3bMHj_OIV-XLiPzre4G8DUqfjH0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm15SN6Pr2AhV4oXIEHePNCp8Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Most%20youths%20at%20seventeen%20or%20eighteen%20years%20of%20age%20take%20a%20pride%20in%20boasting%20of%20their%20amours%2C%20of%20their%20dissipations%2C%20and%20of%20their%20wild%20exploits%3B%20I%20have%2C%20however%2C%20no%20taste%20for%20such%20exposures&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: “Most youths at 17 or 18 years of age take a pride in boasting of their amours, of their dissipations and of their wild exploits; I have, however, no taste for such exposures.”</p><p>I know it sounds idealistic that high school sophomores could start productive workaday lives as if they were 22-year-olds. But venturing what seems far-fetched is a part of what sparks progress, and books like “Jefferson’s Children” stand as prophecy. It’s true that the way things are now, a college degree means higher earnings and the unemployment rate for those with degrees <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/unemployment-rate-3-7-percent-for-college-grads-6-7-percent-for-high-school-grads-in-march-2021.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is lower</a> than for those without. One is not allowed into most of the highest-paying careers without a bachelor’s degree. But that’s just it: In this hypothetical America of the future, where public education is about presenting young adults to the world after 10th grade, the idea is that the stewards of these lucrative positions — the people doing the hiring — would be more open to applicants without degrees. Much of what makes this sound so strange today is a mission creep in what high school and college are supposed to be for.</p></div></div><div><div><p>College should be something some kids choose out of personal predilection. When I was at Rutgers, I lived in Demarest Hall, which for decades has been a quirky outlier dorm, with each hallway dedicated to investigating and celebrating special-interest subjects such as German and the performing arts. It has an especially progressive social atmosphere. Junot Díaz set much of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” in Demarest at a time not long after I was there and captures the place perfectly. It was a whole building where almost everybody actively wanted to be doing this college thing.</p><p>But it was hard not to see that this wasn’t true of many other college kids at that time. Even as a young student, it was hard for me not to notice how many of my contemporaries were just marking time until they “got that piece of paper,” as some would put it. Yes, they were smart and capable. But they were largely jumping through hoops: It seemed that they might have been better off just getting out there and doing what they wanted to do, without four years of expensive preparation only diagonally related to what they were going to spend their lives doing. Half the students seemed to be majoring in economics and not because they had a special interest in the Laffer Curve but because they saw it as a major that would help them “get a good job,” as many would say. Did society need to put all those students through that exercise?</p><p>I don’t mean to imply that kids like that lacked curiosity or weren’t “college material.” The question was what the college mission, as constituted by then, was even for. Nowadays especially, if you want to know about nearly any subject, you don’t have to have a college professor teach it to you. At least not live, in person and as part of a rigid credentialing requirement: College-level education is more readily available today than it has ever been because of online sources. Companies like the Great Courses (which hosts some of my lectures) are ubiquitous. There are countless podcasts about countless subjects available at the push of a button, whereas 40 years ago, when I was an undergraduate, books, periodicals and maybe PBS or NPR probably constituted most of your options. It’s a new world out there.</p><p>True, in-class instruction, with its required attendance and the availability of professors for questions, has its advantages, as does the experience of spending four years interacting with a wide range of people. But the question is whether those advantages are so very important as to justify continuing to think of college, including the expense and debt involved, as a default American experience. There is no sacrosanct reason for keeping students in high school through 12th grade, much less for enshrining eight further semesters of formal education as something we quietly pity people for having done without.</p><p>We think of four years of high school and four years of college as normal because it’s what we know. But we could be a society of solidly educated people if we improved and bolstered public education while reclassifying a college education as a choice among many. Call this a pipe dream — I realize it wouldn’t happen overnight. But I suspect quite a few would see Botstein’s idea as valuable if we rolled back the tape and started over. That kind of hypothetical is invaluable to assessing where we are and where we might like to go.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
