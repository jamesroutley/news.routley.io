			<p>The American Astronomical Society (AAS) is an international non-governmental organization with a mission to enhance and share humanity’s scientific understanding of the universe as a diverse and inclusive astronomical community.</p>
<p>To further support the Society’s mission and provide immediate access to important research, the AAS will be transitioning its entire journals portfolio to fully open access (OA) as of 1 January 2022. As of that date all content — past, present, and future — will be immediately and openly accessible: anyone can read, download, and share anything in the portfolio and there will be no subscription fees or paywalls.</p>
<p>The AAS <a href="https://aas.org/press/aas-journals-open-access">announced this transition</a> publicly on 1 September 2021. <strong><span>The transition takes effect 1 January 2022.</span></strong></p>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Paywalls and subscription fees limit who is able to read, share, and benefit from the latest developments in scientific research. When only researchers at well-funded institutions have immediate access to the latest research results, collaboration and scientific progress are impeded.</p>
<p>In the past, the AAS has attempted to mitigate this problem by maintaining very low subscription fees, making articles free to read 12 months after publication, and allowing authors to post their work to preprint servers like arXiv. The AAS journals’ new, fully open access model takes this a step further, ensuring that all people everywhere are able to immediately access the important research published in the journals.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="what_open_access" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>As of 1 January 2022, the AAS journals will all qualify as “Gold OA.” This means that all articles and related content in AAS journals — past, present, and future — will be made freely and permanently accessible to everyone immediately upon publication. Subscription charges to AAS journals will be eliminated, and the journals will be fully supported by article publication charges (APCs) assessed to authors. All articles will be published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"><u>Creative Commons (CC-BY) 4.0 license</u></a>, under which the authors retain copyright to their work.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="journal_content" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>No. The journals will retain the same rigorous editorial standards and scope as before the transition to full open access. This change merely increases the reach, visibility, and high impact the journals are known for.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="why_publish_oa" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>OA publishing means that the final, best version of your article is immediately available to astronomers everywhere. Your work is more likely to be widely read and cited.</p>
<p>As an example, consider all articles published in <em>AJ, ApJ, ApJL, </em>and<em> ApJS</em> in 2019. For this set, the median number of downloads in 2019 for OA articles was more than 250% higher than that for subscription articles, and the median number of citations in 2019 for OA articles was 25% higher than that for subscription articles.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="why_publish" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Formal publishing in a journal like the AAS journals provides significant benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peer review improves the final article and establishes a trusted version of record</li>
<li>Additional review from professionals like the AAS statistics and data editors help strengthen article results and make them more accessible</li>
<li>Digital assets like figure sets, animations, and interactive figures are integrated into the article, enhancing the article</li>
<li>Professional typesetting ensures an easy-to-parse, consistent final article with important features like integrated citation linking</li>
<li>Journals provide for long-term archiving, curation, and preservation, as well as migration to new standards as they develop</li>
<li>Journal publicity vehicles like <a href="https://aasnova.org/"><u>AAS Nova</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0I9IE4LANg&amp;list=PLFhVT3VzlwKrArGdcNhtSCF4NbDBd6K5_"><u>AAS Journal Authors</u></a> interview series ensure that authors’ work ends up in front of a large and broad audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Publishing in a journal greatly increases the value and impact of your work by making your article stronger, more trustworthy, and easier to find, read, and cite, while also ensuring that the version of record is preserved in perpetuity.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The <em><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2632-3338"><u>Planetary Science Journal</u></a> (PSJ)</em>, the AAS’s newest journal published in partnership with its <a href="http://dps.aas.org/"><u>Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS)</u></a>, is already a fully OA journal. Submission fees for <em>PSJ</em> will not be governed by the joint rate structure that will be instituted for all other AAS journals in 2022; instead, <em>PSJ</em> will maintain its own, separate rate structure, a decision made by DPS leadership.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="new_oa_copyright" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>Effective 11 October 2021, all articles accepted for publication in all AAS journals will be published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><u>CC-BY 4.0 license</u></a>. With this license, authors retain copyright to the content and grant the AAS a license to publish it.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="past_content" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>From 1 January 2022, all articles — past, present, and future — published in AAS journals will be fully open access: free to read, download, and share. Content published prior to 2022 under the subscription model will be labeled “Free Access.” This content will be free to access, download, and share, but it will not be subject to a CC-BY license unless it was accepted after 11 October 2021. <a href="https://journals.aas.org/article-charges-and-copyright/#AAS_material"><u>Permission to reuse content</u></a> accepted before that date will still be required.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="funder_mandates" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>Yes, as of 1 January 2022, publication in the AAS journals will fully comply with funder OA mandates like <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/"><u>Plan S</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/"><u>UKRI’s OA policy</u></a>, and others.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="institutional_agreements" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<p>No. The AAS has always maintained a low subscription rate and assessed article publication charges to authors to support the journals. With our low subscription rates, <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/23/transformative-agreements/"><u>institutional agreements</u></a> such as transformative agreements or read-and-publish agreements do not fit with our mission for the journals and would be difficult — if not impossible — to implement from a business standpoint, given that our current hybrid model relies heavily on publication charges as the primary source of revenue.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="important_dates" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>

		<div>
			<p>The new AAS OA article publication charges will come into effect for articles submitted on and after <b><span>1 January 2022</span></b>. The current charges remain in place for authors submitting until that date.</p>
<p>All articles accepted for publication in AAS journals after <b><span>11 October 2021</span></b> will be assigned a CC-BY 4.0 license, with the authors retaining copyright. From that date authors will no longer be asked to transfer copyright to the AAS.</p>
<p>All AAS journals content — including both new publications and back content — becomes freely available for all to read on <b><span>1 January 2022</span></b>. Subscription fees will no longer be assessed after this point.</p>

			<p>The AAS calculates article publication charges using an approach that counts “digital quanta,” units of information in digital form that the author supplies. Digital quanta can include words, figures, tables, data components, and figures within a figure set.</p>
<p>As of 1 January 2022, article publication charges will be assessed to authors according to the tiered rate structure below, with the tiers set by the number of quanta in the publication. The following table applies to <em>AJ</em>, <em>ApJ</em>, <em>ApJS</em>, and <em>ApJL</em>; the<em> PSJ</em> will maintain its own, separate rate structure.</p>

		<p>Based on submissions to AAS journals in 2017–2019, we expect that more than 80% of <em>ApJ</em>, <em>ApJS</em>, and <em>AJ</em> submissions will fall into the lowest two tiers. We expect almost all <em>ApJL</em> submissions to fall into the first <em>ApJL</em> tier.</p>

		<p>No. The AAS believes that identifying errors in published research and correcting them through the publication of errata is an important part of maintaining the scientific value and integrity of the journals. There will be no charges going forward for publishing errata.</p>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="charge_comparison" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>

		<p>Article publication charges are based on the number of digital quanta in each article. The table below shows a comparison of article publication charges in 2021 and 2022 for several different example articles that have different quanta counts. In most cases, the 2022 open access charges are lower than our 2021 optional gold open access charges.</p>

			<p>The figure below shows the trend for publication charges assessed to authors in AAS journals over time. The charge for a typical article appearing in <em>ApJ</em>, <em>ApJS</em>, and <em>AJ</em>, normalized to the most common 2020 article length and adjusted for inflation using standard consumer price index tables, is shown for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Historically, the article publication charges have trended downward over time, with a brief adjustment period when AAS journals transitioned from charging by page count to charging by digital quanta count in 2011. For the last three years, article publication charges have increased slightly each year to cover increased publication costs (which include increased costs in both editorial and production services), but they have remained well below historical charges.</p>

			<p>Other astronomical and physics journals have open access publication charges that range from $3,080 to $4,000 for full open access, while high-profile journals like <em>Nature</em> charge as much as $11,390.</p>
<p>Based on articles submitted to AAS journals 2017–2019, we expect ~84% of articles submitted to <em>AJ, ApJ, </em>and<em> ApJS</em> to fall into the lowest two tiers, resulting in article page charges of $1,149 to $2,599. Only 15% of articles are expected to be larger articles that fall into the third tier, and fewer than 1% of articles are likely to be so large that they are assessed the surcharge of $450.</p>
<p>For articles submitted to <em>ApJL</em>, we expect ~99% to fall into the lowest tier, resulting in article page charges of $2,400. Only ~1% are likely to be so large that they are assessed the surcharge of $250.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="apc_change" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Because the journals will no longer charge subscription fees, article publication charges will be the sole source of funding to cover journal operating costs. In our old business model, subscription revenue represented 32% of the total journals revenue. The total revenue must be collected to fund the journal operations.</p>
<p>In addition, to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to publish in AAS journals despite the change in article publication charges, we have built a significantly increased and flexible author <a href="https://journals.aas.org/waivers/">waiver budget</a> into our new pricing model.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div><div id="waiver_budget" data-vc-content=".vc_tta-panel-body"><div>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Our financial waiver budget is substantially higher under the new OA model. If authors request a financial waiver for an article in <em>AJ, ApJ</em>, or <em>ApJS,</em> the Editor in Chief can authorize a waiver of 5–100%, depending on need. If authors request a financial waiver for <em>ApJL</em>, up to 80% of the article publication charges can be waived, based on need. We are requiring that authors pay a $450 handling fee for all <em>ApJL</em> articles to cover the extra costs related to the speed of publication. <a href="https://journals.aas.org/waivers/"><u>More information about waivers can be found here</u></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, major US research funding agencies such as NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have expressed support for open access publishing and generally cover publication costs — including costs of the new OA model — as allowable expenses for grants. The AAS is working closely with NASA and NSF to ensure a smooth transition for current grantees. The AAS recommends that grant applications submitted after September 1, 2021 include a publications budget that takes into account the estimated fees associated with the new OA model.</p>
