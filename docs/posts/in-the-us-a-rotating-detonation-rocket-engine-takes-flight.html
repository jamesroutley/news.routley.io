    <h1>In the US, a rotating detonation rocket engine takes flight</h1>

          <p>A US-based propulsion company, Venus Aerospace, said Wednesday it had completed a short flight test of its rotating detonation rocket engine at Spaceport America in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s chief executive and co-founder, Sassie Duggleby, characterized the flight as &#34;historic.&#34; It is believed to be the first US-based flight test of an idea that has been discussed academically for decades, a rotating detonation rocket engine. The concept has previously been tested in a handful of other countries, but never with a high-thrust engine.</p>
<p>&#34;By proving this engine works beyond the lab, Venus brings the world closer to a future where hypersonic travel—traversing the globe in under two hours—becomes possible,&#34; Duggleby told Ars.</p>
<h2>A quick flight</h2>
<p>The company has only released limited information about the test. The small rocket, powered by the company&#39;s 2,000-pound-thrust engine, launched from a rail in New Mexico. The vehicle flew for about half a minute, and, as planned, did not break the sound barrier.</p>
<p>Governments around the world have been interested in rotating detonation engine technology for a long time because it has the potential to significantly increase fuel efficiency in a variety of applications, from Navy carriers to rocket engines.</p>
<p>In contrast to a traditional rocket engine, in which a highly pressurized propellant and an oxidizer are injected into a combustion chamber where they burn and produce an energetic exhaust plume, a rotating detonation engine is different in that a wave of detonation travels around a circular channel. This is sustained by the injection of fuel and oxidizer and produces a shockwave that travels outward at supersonic speed.</p>
