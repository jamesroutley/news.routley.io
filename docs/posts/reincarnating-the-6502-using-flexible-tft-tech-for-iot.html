			<p>Despite being nearly 47 years old, the MOS Tech 6502 – or its low-power direct equivalents – is still being manufactured and is widely used in consumer products such as toys, automotive, and appliances as well as in embedded and industrial applications. It would seem that interest in this chip isn’t dying out any time soon. Due to its simple design and the large existing repository of knowledge and code, this chip could find new uses in the emerging world of IoT and ubiquitous computing.</p>
<p>At the recent 2022 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), a team of researchers from the University of KU Leuven in collaboration with imec and PragmatIC Semi presented the world’s fastest TFT-based processor, the Flex6502.</p></div>
