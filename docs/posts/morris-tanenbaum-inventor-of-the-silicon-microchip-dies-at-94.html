    <h1>Morris Tanenbaum, Inventor of the Silicon Microchip, Dies at 94</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2660061561" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-memoriam-may-2023" data-authors="Amanda Davis" data-headline="Morris Tanenbaum, Inventor of the Silicon Microchip, Dies at 94"><div><p><strong>Morris Tanenbaum</strong></p><p>Silicon microchip inventor </p><p>Fellow, 94; died 26 February</p><p>Tanenbaum’s research in the mid-1950s proved that silicon was a better semiconductor material for transistors than germanium, which was commonly used at the time. His discovery paved the way for more efficient transistors critical in technologies that ushered in the Information Age.</p><p>He began his career in 1952 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, in Murray Hill, N.J., as a researcher in its chemical physics department. Two years later, under the direction of physicist and inventor <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-william-shockleys-robot-dream-helped-launch-silicon-valley" target="_self">William Shockley</a>, who at the time worked at Bell Labs, Tanenbaum began investigating whether silicon crystals could be used for transistors.</p><p>In 1955 he and colleague Ernest Buehler demonstrated the first silicon <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>.</p><p>Tanenbaum later developed the first gas-diffused silicon transistor, which could amplify and switch signals above 100 megahertz at a switching speed 10 times that of previous silicon transistors.</p><p>Despite Tanenbaum’s early work on silicon transistors, <a href="https://www.att.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a> did not support further research or advancement of the technology. At the time, Bell Labs was the research arm of AT&amp;T. Although Bell Labs had “a significant technological lead in silicon transistor technology, it stopped doing proper research in the field—partly because it just wasn’t immediately relevant to AT&amp;T’s business—so silicon transistor technology, including the integrated circuit, was done by <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intel</a> and <a href="https://www.ti.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Texas Instruments</a> instead,” Tanenbaum said in a 1999 <a href="https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Morris_Tanenbaum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oral history</a> conducted by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a>.</p><p>Tanenbaum instead worked on other new technologies in the decades that followed. In 1962 he was named assistant director of Bell Labs’ metallurgical department. He led the team there that created the first high-field superconducting magnets, which are now used in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-superconducting-shields-behind-mris" target="_self">MRI machines</a> and other medical imaging technologies. Later he helped develop optical fiber and digital telephone switching.</p><p>Tanenbaum went on to serve as president of AT&amp;T’s New Jersey Bell (now part of <a href="https://www.verizon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Verizon</a>) in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p><p>He was appointed president of <a href="https://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=7468" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Communications</a> in 1984. He retired five years later as AT&amp;T’s vice chairman and chief financial officer.</p><p>A member of the <a href="https://www.amacad.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, he also was a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.aps.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Physical Society</a> and a member of the <a href="https://corporation.mit.edu/membership/all-members" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT board of trustees</a>. </p><p>He received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry in 1949 from <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>, in Baltimore, and earned a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Princeton</a>.</p><p><strong>Adolf Goetzberger</strong></p><p>Photovoltaics pioneer</p><p>Life Fellow, 94; died 24 February</p><p>Goetzberger was an early proponent of solar energy technologies. Today solar is the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third largest renewable-electricity sector</a> behind hydropower and wind.</p><p>Together with physicist Armin Zastrow, he pioneered the concept of <a href="https://renewablepedia.com/the-history-of-agrivoltaic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agrivoltaics</a>—the use of land for both agriculture and solar energy generation. </p><p>After receiving a doctorate in physics in 1955 from <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität</a>, in Munich Goetzberger joined <a href="https://www.siemens.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siemens</a>, a multinational conglomerate, also in Munich. He then moved to the United States in 1958 to work as a senior scientist at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_Semiconductor_Laboratory" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory</a>, in Palo Alto, Calif. </p><p>After five years at Shockley, he left to join <a href="https://ethw.org/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, in Murray Hill, N.J., where he conducted research on metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. He returned to Germany in 1968 and became director of the <a href="https://www.iaf.fraunhofer.de/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF)</a>, in Freiburg. Three years later, while working at the IAF, he was named an honorary professor in the <a href="https://uni-freiburg.de/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Freiburg</a> physics department.</p><p>In 1981 Goetzberger founded the <a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE)</a>—now Europe’s largest solar research institute—also in Freiburg. That same year, he and Zastrow introduced the agrivoltaic concept, in which solar panels are built atop greenhouses or in structures above field crops to maximize land use. As of 2021, agrivoltaic systems were capable of producing more than 14 gigawatts of electricity, according to an ISE estimate.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Goetzberger conducted pioneering research into fluorescent planar collector-concentrators, utilizing photovoltaic (PV) material mixed with fluorescent dyes to separate the various wavelengths of light and convert them using solar cells with different band gaps. The research paved the way for more effective solar power generation. Under Goetzberger’s leadership, the ISE developed the first highly efficient, fully electronic inverter for stand-alone PV systems. </p><p>Goetzberger was ISE director until he retired in 1993. He then served as president of the <a href="https://www.dgs-berlin.de/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">German Solar Energy Society (DGS)</a>, from 1993 to 1997. Based in Berlin, the DGS supports the introduction of solar technologies and renewable energy resources into the power grid.</p><p>He coauthored the seminal 2005 textbook <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b137803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Photovoltaic Solar Energy Generation</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Goetzberger, who held more than 30 patents in Europe, was awarded a <a href="https://www.epo.org/news-events/events/european-inventor/about/categories.html#lifetime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> from the <a href="https://www.epo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Patent Office</a> in 2009. In 1997 he received three prestigious awards: the <a href="https://www.ises.org/who-we-are/ises-awards/karl-boer-solar-energy-medal-merit-award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Karl Böer Solar Energy Medal of Merit</a> from the <a href="https://www.ises.org/home-ises" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Solar Energy Society</a>, the<a href="https://www.becquerel-prize.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Becquerel Prize</a> from the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Commission</a>, and the <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/awards/cherry-award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cherry Award</a> from the <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Electron Devices Society</a>. IEEE EDS also honored him in 1983 with its <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/awards/j-j-ebers-award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ebers Award</a> for his development of the silicon field effect transistor, which uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor. Goetzberger was the first German to receive the honor. </p><p><strong>Peter W.
