    <h1>We Are All Nerds: The Literary Works of Neal Stephenson</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>If you and I ever had a longer conversation, chances are that <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a> might have come up once or twice.
As contemporary authors go, Neal’s books are by far the most enthralling
on my long and ever-growing reading list. This post is primarily written
for people that usually shy away from reading what they consider
‘science fiction’ literature because they consider it to be
insufficiently serious or just plain weird.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I hope to dispel some
myths and whet your appetite for this type of books.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to get away with first: many authors believe that
the term <em>speculative fiction</em> might be much more appropriate than
<em>science fiction</em>. This term is chosen because it encompasses things
like alternative histories or stories that are playing in our future but
use essentially the same technology. A perfect example would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale">The
Handmaid’s Tale</a>.
Nothing whatsoever in this great book is really about technology or
progress; instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>
paints a picture of a near-dystopian future, similar in technological
prowess but highly dissimilar in terms of basic human rights and
freedoms.</p>
<p>Speculative fiction is thus an umbrella term, born out of the
necessity of encompassing more than the cliché ‘Look at all these great
starships’ type of books.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Since several of the works of Neal
Stephenson defy a strict categorisation—more about this later—the
classification as speculative fiction is apt.</p>

<p>My main fascination with Neal’s works boil down to several reasons,
which I will subsequently comment on briefly. Note that their ordering
does <em>not</em> reflect their rating or relevance; indeed, your own reading
taste might assign little to no relevance to certain aspects.</p>
<h2 id="world-building">World-building</h2>
<p>Being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximalism">maximalist</a> writer,
all of Neal’s books try to build a realistic world. Many things and
aspects, such as technology and clothing, are described in meticulous
detail, giving you an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_of_depth_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings">impression of depth</a>.
Just like you would expect from an excellent story-teller, not every
detail is <em>explained</em>, mind you; in fact, the characters inhabiting the
respective world often take the use of a certain technology for granted.
However, Neal’s writing also makes use of the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">Infodump</a>,
meaning that you will learn <em>a lot</em> about certain things.</p>
<p>This is point of conflict for many readers, and you have to ask yourself
whether you enjoy learning about, say, simple cryptographic
protocols<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or sailing techniques.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In any case, you can be sure
that Neal did his homework—everything has been repeatedly checked for
correctness and consistency.</p>

<p>Almost every book that takes places in the near-future features
realistically-extrapolated technologies.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <em>Snow Crash</em> (1992),
for instance, features the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">metaverse</a>.
<em>Cryptonomicon</em> (1999) prominently features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>.
This extrapolation does not stop at technology; Neal’s books also point
out potential political implications that are not too far-fetched. Here
are some themes that come to my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dangers of rampant capitalism.</li>
<li>The increasing fragmentation of political opinions leading to
societal divides.</li>
<li>The reactions of governments to large crises.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, you might disagree with the specific direction Neal’s
extrapolations take, but most of them are not really that far-fetched.
Like any good work of literature, many of his works paint a satirised
picture of the world, sometimes making use of hyperbole to get the point
across.</p>
<p>All of this, however, is done <strong>without sounding preachy</strong>. You, i.e.
the reader, get thrown into the world as it is and have to judge it for
yourself.</p>
<h2 id="realistic-characters">Realistic characters</h2>
<p>Staying with the theme of not being preachy, I also find that Neal has
a knack of describing realistic characters. By this, I mean that there
are typically no direct conflicts in terms of good versus evil.
While some of the books, such as <em>REAMDE</em> (sic), feature characters
that are pretty much beyond our normal moral horizon and potentially
way outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a>,
some of their actions may still surprise you in their decency. Even the
antagonists of many works are described as full humans and reasons for
their flaws are given. That is <em>not</em> to say that their behaviour is
excused somehow, but every work tries very hard to explain to readers
how certain characters ‘got that way.’</p>
<p>Seeing even the antagonists as fully-realised human beings with innate
thoughts and drives makes the world that much more believable. Without
adopting a postmodern ’there is no right or wrong’ position, Neal’s
characters have their own agendas going and might not always live up to
the standards of a hero or anti-hero.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to some of the more classical speculative
fiction works, where the scientists remain objective and highly stoic
even in the case of impending destruction, always coolly observing the
world. Stephenson’s worlds are not populated predominantly by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Heinleinian</a> larger-than-life characters than can do anything,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> but by,
well, <em>normal</em> people that are sometimes acting irrationally because
they are afraid, cowards, or just confused. That is not to say that you
will not find a bunch of geniuses or unfathomable characters in each
book, but it will be possible to connect to them through their flaws.</p>
<p>Moreover, especially in Neal’s more recent books, characters are usually
ranging from different walks of life. Thus, while technology still plays
a large role in the books, not every character is part of the same
technologist caste. This is very much in line with and old statement
that Neal gave in talk, namely that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwV3x1jZ8oE">‘We Are All Geeks Now’</a>.</p>

<p>Having waxed poetic on the writing style, I want to briefly give you
a taste test of a selected subset of Neal’s works. I will <em>not</em> spoil
you but try to give an interesting synopsis nonetheless, as well as
a weirdness rating, which I calibrated using the tastes of my family,
who typically enjoy reading historic fiction and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco">Umberto Eco</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash (1992)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Pizza driver/sword artist/hacker saving the world from
a (meta)virus. Features a fragmented and splintered United States,
discussion on consciousness, philosophy of mind, and anthropology, as
well as a large subplot involving the Mafia, now finally being
franchised and officially recognised.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 5/5: The world is exceptionally weird and zany;
social order has crumbled and most of the real estate has been
divided up into <em>Franchise Oriented Quasi-National Entities</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">The Diamond Age (1995)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Explores the old theme of nature versus nurture. In
a world that could move towards a post-scarcity society, how much of
your future is being determined by your class and ethnicity? Part
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>, this
book prominently features the interactions of an AI and a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 4/5: Similar to <em>Snow Crash</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
at the beginning, the world is rather wacky for those unused to the
benefits of nanotechnology. However, readers familiar with historic
fiction might enjoy subsequent parts much more thanks to the
Victorian phyle; moreover, the bildungsroman parts are heart-warming
up to a certain point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon (1999)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synposis</strong>: Two tales interwoven across space and time. In the
present universe, follow intrepid entrepreneurs trying to connect the
world better and build a data-haven free from governmental
interference. In the past, follow their ancestors trying to survive
the Second World War by, among other things, cracking German
encryption. Features a large degree of discussion on cryptography,
what makes currency valuable, whether cryptocurrencies are the
future, and how to find gold in the strangest places.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 2/5: As far as technology goes, there won’t be
any surprises there. The characters are quite unique, though, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> makes
a surprise appearance. Personally, this is still my favourite of
Neal’s books, and I revisit it every once in a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle">The Baroque Cycle (2003–2004)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: An epic tale spanning the late 17th and the early 18th
century of our world. A time of upheaval—at least in Europe—but
also the birth of modern science and modern banking. It is hard for
me to mention all the different plots in these books; suffice it to
say that Neal manages to intersperse more serious matters like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution">The Glorious Revolution</a>
with comical diversions on vagabonds in Europe (and beyond).
This is definitely a book for which the moniker <em>speculative fiction</em>
is very apt: no special technology, just a somewhat alternative
history of the world, comprising historic characters like Newton and
Leibniz as well as fictional characters that interact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 1/5: The undaunted reader familiar with
historic novels will feel right at home here. One word of caution,
though: these books are <em>long</em>; depending on your translation or
edition, we are talking more than 2,000 pages. However, it is
definitely worth the time investment, in particular if you are an
avid reader of novels in this time period. Interestingly, some
ancestors of the protagonists in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> appear here for the
first time—if you first read <em>The Baroque Cycle</em> and then
<em>Cryptonomicon</em>, you will feel right at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem">Anathem (2008)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: A world in which academia and the ‘worldly powers that
be’ have parted ways for quite a while: academics are living in
monastic communities and are only allowed contact in specific
intervals with the ‘secular’ world. A cataclysmic event of worldwide
importance forces both sides to work together. This tall tale also
contains meditations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">Platonism</a>,
learning, and—once again—nature versus nurture. Readers familiar
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a> may think
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game">The Glass Bead Game</a> with
a larger focus on how the two domains, i.e. science and the secular world, interact.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 3/5, verging on 4/5: The novel features a new
language <em>because of course it does</em>. Technology is kept to minimum,
given the vow of poverty of the protagonists. Readers will have to
like speculations on the nature of reality, though. Interestingly,
this work is in my opinion the one that differs the most from the
others. The world described in <em>Anathem</em> feels slightly more alien to
me than all the worlds in all other books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamde">REAMDE (2011)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Online game players try to make money by holding
in-game currency hostage, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">ransomware</a> in our world.
Through chance or fate, they interfere with the Russian mob and an
Islamist cell, the latter of which are planning an attack on American
soil. The game might play a large role in preventing the attack from
happening.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 2/5: You have to like computer games, or at
least not hate them altogether. Other than that, REAMDE follows an
engaging thriller plot! You might find the different subplots to be
a little bit over the top, but everything makes sense—and the
characters even ‘lampshade’ the confluence of events that brought
them together multiple times during the novel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves">Seveneves (2015)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: The moon breaks up and humanity is doomed. Against this
very pessimistic end-of-the-world scenario, Neal manages to develop
an epic of the attempts at surviving and thriving in outer space.
Features astronauts from all nations and a lot of digressions on
dynamics and physics—and that’s only the first part of the novel.
The second part jumps a few centuries in time and shows you what
humanity has become or, given the fact that this is a novel
ostensibly playing in our universe, what humanity <em>might</em> become
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 3/5 for the first part, 5/5 for the second
one: Accepting the scenario for the first part requires some
suspension of disbelief and a love for space travel. Definitely more
in the <em>speculative</em> part of <em>speculative fiction</em>. The second part
is apparently not to everyone’s liking since it may come across as
your typical space opera. I can assure that this is <em>not</em> the case,
and Neal instead just explores one potential future of humanity, but
I also concede that this one might be harder to stomach for
a first-time reader of this type of novel. That being said, it <em>is</em>
a stand-alone novel, depicting a completely different cast of
characters. If space is your thing, it might be a good idea to start
your journey into Neal’s work with this one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_D.O.D.O.">The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. (2017)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: What if magic really worked and could be scientifically
harnessed? What if the only people willing and able to help harness
it would be a shadowy government organisation? What if witches could
travel through time and change history? This whimsical and
entertaining novel is all about the implications of time travel,
magic, and, you might have guessed it, bureaucracy.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 2/5: I concede that one has to suspend one’s
disbelief quite a lot to accept the magic. However, the rest is just
such a lovely-crafted tale full of humour that I think will be
appreciated even by readers that dislike this type of literature.
Neal co-wrote this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Galland">Nicole Galland</a>, and it shows:
the book is much more accessible than his other works, and also
features a female protagonist who is the main narrator for most of
the story. I would recommend this to any first-time Neal Stephenson
reader that is already familiar with more ‘fantastic’ literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall;_or,_Dodge_in_Hell">Fall; or, Dodge in Hell (2019)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: A world in which the internet has finally ensured that
echo chambers are the norm meets an afterlife simulation. Explores
the ever-pertinent question of what makes our consciousness work and
whether we are living in a simulation or not. Contains a retelling of
many biblical stories; not a book for everyone, but I enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 3/5 for the first part, 4/5 for the second one:
The fragmented world full of echo chambers might be all too familiar
for us, but the ‘afterlife’ type of technology, coupled with genesis
stories, is <em>definitely</em> more wacky than one might anticipate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termination_Shock_(novel)">Termination Shock (2021)</a></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Earth is in the grip of climate change, but large
governments are not really helping. A motley crew tries to take
matters into their own hands by attempting to pull off
a geoengineering project. How will governments of the world react
when they find out that the project does not have evenly-distributed
positive consequences?</p>
<p><strong>Weirdness rating</strong>: 1/5: As far as technology goes, everything is
more or less familiar. Neal extrapolated once again a very realistic
state of the world, in which people are still trying to do the best
they can to survive amidst a more dangerous climate. Again, this
books contains a unique cast of characters and is not connected to
previous works in the ‘Stephensonverse,’ so it might be an excellent
start for first-time readers, too.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this post served as a nice introduction into the wonderful world
of Neal Stephenson’s works. Speculative fiction has evolved quite a lot
over the past decades: it is not only a way to escape our troubled times
but also a way to reflect deeply on the future <em>we</em> want to create.
Beyond the superficial descriptions of technological prowess and tales
of derring-do, these works enable us to understand ourselves and
humanity a little bit better.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. Until next time!</p>
