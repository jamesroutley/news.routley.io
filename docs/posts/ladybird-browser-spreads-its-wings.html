<p><a href="https://ladybird.dev/">Ladybird</a> is an open-source
project aimed at building an independent web browser, rather than
yet another browser based on Chrome. It is written in C++ and licensed under a
two-clause BSD license. The effort 
began as part of the <a href="https://www.serenityos.org/">SerenityOS</a> project, but
developer Andreas Kling <a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/forking-ladybird-and-stepping-down-serenityos">announced</a>
on June 3 that he was &#34;forking&#34; Ladybird as a separate project and stepping away from
SerenityOS to focus his attention on the browser completely. Ladybird
is not ready to replace Firefox or Chrome for regular use, but it is showing
great promise.</p>

<p>Kling started working on SerenityOS in 2018 as a therapy project
after completing a substance-abuse rehabilitation program. The SerenityOS name is a
nod to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">serenity
prayer</a>. Prior to working on the project, he had worked on
WebKit-based browsers at Apple and Nokia. Eventually he <a href="https://awesomekling.github.io/I-quit-my-job-to-focus-on-SerenityOS-full-time/">made
SerenityOS his full-time job</a>, and funded the work through
donations, sales of SerenityOS merchandise, and income from
YouTube. (Kling posts monthly updates to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@awesomekling/videos">YouTube
channel</a> about Ladybird, as well as hacking videos where he walks
through working on various components in the browser, such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mxubNQC5O8">JavaScript JIT
compiler</a>.)</p>

<h4>Taking flight</h4>

<p>Kling <a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/ladybird-a-new-cross-platform-browser-project">announced</a>
the Ladybird project in September 2022. He said that the project
started while creating a Qt GUI for SerenityOS&#39;s LibWeb browser
engine. He decided to target Linux as well as SerenityOS so it would be easier for
people to work on and debug while in Linux. In the post announcing his
intent to work solely on Ladybird, he noted that he had been focusing
all of his attention on the Linux version of Ladybird. With that
realization, he decided to step down as &#34;benevolent dictator for
life&#34; (BDFL) of SerenityOS so its development would not be held back:</p>

<blockquote>
Before anyone asks, there is no drama behind this change. It&#39;s simply
recognizing that there have been two big projects packed uncomfortably
into a single space for too long, and I&#39;m doing what I believe will
make life better for everyone involved.
</blockquote>

<p>Ladybird&#39;s governance is similar to SerenityOS. Kling is the
BDFL, with a group of maintainers (currently ten) who can
approve and merge pull requests. The <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing</a>
guide notes that maintainership is &#34;<q>by invitation only and does not
correlate with any particular metric</q>&#34;. Project development
discussions are held on a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nvfjVJ4Svh">Discord server</a>
(account required).</p>

<p>Now independent, Ladybird has dropped SerenityOS as a development
target, and has moved to <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird">its own GitHub
repository</a>. In addition, Kling has relaxed his self-imposed policy
of excluding &#34;not invented here&#34; (NIH) code that had applied to SerenityOS, which
means that the Ladybird project will be able to make use of existing
libraries rather than writing from scratch.</p>

<p>Comparing the <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file in the standalone Ladybird repository
against the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/Ladybird/README.md">README</a>
file in the SerenityOS repository, the goal has
evolved from creating &#34;<q>a standards-compliant, independent web browser with
no third-party dependencies</q>&#34; to developing an independent browser &#34;<q>using a
novel engine based on web standards</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>The changes to the section that enumerates the core libraries for Ladybird 
provide some hints about Kling&#39;s plans
to use existing libraries rather than continuing to reinvent the
wheel. The core support libraries for the project include homegrown
libraries for cryptography, TLS, 2D-graphics rendering, archive-file
format support, Unicode, as well as audio and video playback.
In the pre-fork documentation, they are described
as alternatives to other software. For example, Ladybird&#39;s TLS (LibTLS)
and cryptography (LibCrypto) libraries are &#34;<q>Cryptography primitives
and Transport Layer Security (rather than OpenSSL)</q>&#34;. The &#34;rather
than&#34; language has been removed in the journey to the standalone
repository, and the LibSQL library from SerenityOS has <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/commit/8362c073f34f25ef2fbe800780f4b8790b3fffa8">already
been stripped out</a> in favor of sqlite3.</p>

<p>In a discussion in the project&#39;s Discord instance on June 5, Kling indicated that font rendering
would likely be replaced with a third-party library. A user asked on
June 6 what would determine whether a component would be developed in-house versus
using a third-party library. Kling responded that if it implements a web
standard, &#34;i.e DOM, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Wasm, etc. then we build it
in house.&#34; Otherwise, the project would look to alternatives &#34;unless we
believe we can build something better ourselves&#34;.</p>

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>Ladybird is still in early development (&#34;pre-alpha&#34;) today. It
currently runs on Linux, macOS, and other
UNIX-like operating systems. It&#39;s also possible to use on Windows with
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 2, but there appears to
be no effort to target Windows independently at this time. At the
moment, the project does not provide binaries for any
platform. Interested users will need to grab the source and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/BuildInstructionsLadybird.md">build
instructions</a>. Users will need GCC 13+ or Clang 17, and Qt6
development packages to play along at home. Ladybird compiles and runs
on, for example, Fedora 40 without a problem, but it is a long
way from being suitable for regular use.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One might expect that the browser
would be more usable with sites with simpler layouts and little to no JavaScript
(e.g. LWN) than those with complex layouts and a fair amount of
JavaScript (e.g. GitHub). However, this isn&#39;t always the case—Ladybird
rendered GitHub and many other sites well, if slowly. Browsing
LWN anonymously worked well, but logging into LWN,
however, consistently proved to be too much for the
application. Each time, it basically froze on the front page and clicking links to
articles did nothing.</p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, it was not possible to log
into Discord using Ladybird. It does a fair
job of rendering pages, but speed and stability are
still wanting. Each Ladybird tab has its own render process, which is
sandboxed as a security measure to prevent any malicious pages from
affecting the rest of the system. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to suffice
to keep a single page from crashing the browser entirely. That&#39;s to be
expected from a project that&#39;s still considered pre-alpha, though.</p>

<p>The current feature set is, not surprisingly, minimal. Ladybird has
a URL/search bar, reload, tabs, can zoom in/out on content, take
screenshots, and (of course) has backward and forward navigation. It
does not, however, have bookmarks, a history display, extensions,
password management, printing, or even the ability to save an
image. WebRTC does not seem to be supported yet. CSS support seems
relatively robust. Ladybird passes 100% of the CSS Selectors tests for
levels 1-3, for example, using <a href="https://css4-selectors.com/browser-selector-test/">this
test</a>. It gets a 53% score for level 4, while Firefox gets 71%, so
not a terrible showing at all. JavaScript support seems solid, but
slow: the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ex_browser.asp">examples
here</a> work, but they load slowly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ladybird does have tools for developers, such as
inspectors for the document object model (DOM) tree and accessibility
trees, as well as the ability to create dumps of various things:
the DOM tree and layout tree, computed styles, and so forth. It also
has the ability to spoof the User-Agent sent by the browser so that testers
can try to get around sites that refuse to work with &#34;unknown&#34;
browsers. However, toggling the User-Agent wasn&#39;t enough to get
past Google&#39;s gatekeeping to sign into Gmail—but it&#39;s unclear if
that meant Ladybird wasn&#39;t sending the string correctly or if Google
is using other means to fingerprint non-approved browsers.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, Ladybird is not ready for mainstream use but it
<em>does</em> show potential. In the past month, the project has had
more than 880 commits from 49 authors. If the project maintains that
kind of momentum, or picks up steam, it could become a usable
alternative to mainstream browsers before too long.</p></div></div>
