    <h1>PSA: reward is part of the habit loop too</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>The usual setup of a habit is</p>
<ol>
<li>cue</li>
<li>craving</li>
<li>routine</li>
<li><em><strong>reward</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Among my social circle, rewarding oneself seems to be lost by the wayside. Sadly funny for a crowd of people into reinforcement learning, since they&#39;re trying to skip the reinforcement and wondering why it doesn&#39;t stick. My reward is usually reading fiction or playing a video game. For brushing my teeth, it&#39;s the nice shiny feeling at the end, which I make a point of noticing. For going to the gym, it&#39;s the steam room after.</p>
<p>Figure out what you like. Anything can be a reward as long as it <em>feels</em> good. Don&#39;t try to logic yourself into wanting &#34;the right rewards&#34;. Has that worked before? Surrender. Let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.</p>
