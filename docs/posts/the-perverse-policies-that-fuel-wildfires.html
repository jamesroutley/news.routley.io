A second wildfire of note was recorded that same day, in the town of Evansburg. Four days later, an astonishing seventy-two wildfires were burning, and three days after that the number had grown to a hundred and nine. Some thirty thousand people had to be evacuated, and Alberta’s premier declared a state of emergency. “It’s been an unusual year,” Christie Tucker, an official from the province’s wildfire information unit, observed at the end of the week.</p><p>The unusual soon became the unheard-of. Owing to a combination of low winter snowfall and abnormally high spring temperatures, many parts of Canada, including the Maritime Provinces, were just a cigarette butt away from incineration. On May 28th, with flames bearing down on Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, some eighteen thousand people were told to evacuate. “Basically, all hell is breaking loose,” a fire chief in Halifax, Rob Hebb, said. Meanwhile, the largest fire ever recorded in Nova Scotia—the Barrington Lake fire—was burning toward the city’s southwest.</p><p>The fires kept hopscotching across the country. Before the Barrington Lake fire had been contained, a new monster, the Donnie Creek fire, emerged in British Columbia. On June 18th, after scorching more than two thousand square miles, Donnie Creek became British Columbia’s largest recorded blaze. Saskatchewan saw dozens of wildfires, Quebec hundreds. Evacuation orders went out to the entire city of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories. Many of the blazes created their own weather, in the form of thunderstorms spawned by rapidly rising hot air. The smoke from the fires drifted across much of the United States, prompting health alerts from Minneapolis to Washington, D.C. By late June, Canada had broken its previous annual record for acreage burned, set in 1995, and by mid-October nearly forty-six million acres—an area larger than Denmark—had been charred. This was almost triple the previous record and nine times the annual average.</p><p>“This summer across Canada has been absolutely astounding,” Lori Daniels, a professor in the department of forest and conservation sciences at the University of British Columbia, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “The word ‘unprecedented’ doesn’t do justice to the severity of the wildfires,” Yan Boulanger, a research scientist at Natural Resources Canada, said.</p><p>As bad as Canada’s 2023 wildfire season was—Europe, too, saw its largest wildfire on record, a blaze that consumed more than three hundred square miles in northeastern Greece—the conflagrations are predicted to keep growing. A paper that appeared last summer in the journal <em>Fire Ecology</em> warned that “increasing warming and drying trends” will make wildfires “more frequent and severe,” and a recent report from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, a body established by Congress, predicted a future “defined by wildfires that are increasingly extreme, vast in scale, and devastating.” Another recent <a href="https://fas.org/publication/next-generation-fire-and-vegetation-modeling-for-a-hot-and-dry-future/">report</a>, from the Federation of American Scientists, observed that the world is warming so fast that the models firefighters rely on to predict how blazes will behave have become obsolete. “Climate change is drying fuels and making forests more flammable,” the report said. “As a result, no matter how much money we spend on wildfire suppression, we will not be able to stop increasingly extreme wildfires.”</p><p>As the wildfires have multiplied, so, too, have books on the subject. Recent volumes range from the intimate (Manjula Martin’s “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Fire-Season-Personal-Pyronatural/dp/0593317157/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Fire-Season-Personal-Pyronatural/dp/0593317157/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Fire-Season-Personal-Pyronatural/dp/0593317157/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Last Fire Season: A Personal and Pyronatural History</a>”) to the sweeping (Edward Struzik’s “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Days-Noon-Future-Fire/dp/0228012090/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Days-Noon-Future-Fire/dp/0228012090/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Days-Noon-Future-Fire/dp/0228012090/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dark Days at Noon: The Future of Fire</a>”) and the quick-turnaround (“<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Canada-Burned-Wildfire-Shocked/dp/1778401872/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Canada-Burned-Wildfire-Shocked/dp/1778401872/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Canada-Burned-Wildfire-Shocked/dp/1778401872/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Summer Canada Burned: The Wildfire Season That Shocked the World</a>,” compiled by Monica Zurowski). Fire, it might be said, is a hot topic.</p><p>M. R. O’Connor’s “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Ignition-Lighting-Fires-Burning-World/dp/164503738X/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Ignition-Lighting-Fires-Burning-World/dp/164503738X/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ignition-Lighting-Fires-Burning-World/dp/164503738X/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ignition: Lighting Fires in a Burning World</a>” (Bold Type) began, in the author’s telling, with a “gimmick.” Several years ago, O’Connor, a Brooklyn-based journalist, visited Florida’s Apalachicola National Forest with a local botanist. The two came upon a rare wildflower, <em>Gentiana catesbaei</em>, which, the botanist explained, thrives on recently torched ground. Many plants, O’Connor learned, have evolved to tolerate fire—these are known as pyrophytes—and some have come to depend on it to stimulate reproduction. Intrigued, she enrolled in Introduction to Fire Effects, an online course offered by the University of Idaho.</p><p>One thing leads to another, and pretty soon O’Connor finds herself travelling to central Nebraska to light it on fire. As part of a crew producing a “prescribed burn,” she’s handed a drip torch—basically, a fuel cannister attached to a long nozzle. Although she hasn’t had much training, she’s soon igniting the prairie. She describes the experience as “thrilling.” A professional fire-setter tells her, “You have the fire bug.”</p><p>In the course of starting more blazes—in upstate New York and California—O’Connor comes to see the wildfire problem less in terms of surfeit and more in terms of scarcity. Prior to human settlement, lightning-induced fires were, it seems, a regular occurrence in North America. These blazes acted as a kind of ecological reset; from the ashes of the incinerated forest (or grassland), pyrophytes blossomed. Later, Native Americans routinely burned the landscape—to foster the growth of useful plants, to clear space for farming, and to improve the conditions for hunting. In the sixteen-thirties, Thomas Morton, an English colonist who settled in Massachusetts, wrote that this practice produced a parklike landscape that was “very beautifull and commodious.” Two hundred years later, the artist George Catlin described the sight of Native Americans burning the prairie as “indescribably beautiful.” At night, Catlin wrote, the flames could be seen from many miles away, “creeping over the sides and tops of the bluffs, appearing to be sparkling and brilliant chains of liquid fire.” In addition to maintaining parklike conditions, these managed blazes prevented fuel from building up, and so staved off larger, potentially unmanageable conflagrations.</p><p>Once the U.S. government had pushed Native Americans onto reservations and seized their land, controlled burning ceased across much of the country. Then the U.S. Forest Service moved to eliminate wildfires entirely. Gifford Pinchot, who became the agency’s first director, in 1905, considered flames to be the enemy of the trees.</p><p>“Of all the foes that attack the woodlands of North America, no other is so terrible as fire,” he wrote. Toward the end of the summer of 1910—an unusually dry one in the American Northwest—gale-force winds whipped up hundreds of blazes in Idaho and western Montana. These coalesced to form one of the largest forest fires in U.S. history—an inferno that killed eighty-seven people, destroyed several whole towns, and consumed more than three million acres. Following what became known as the Big Blowup, the Forest Service doubled down on fire control. William Greeley, who became the head of the agency in 1920, wrote that the great fire had “burned into” him the conviction “that fire prevention is the No. 1 job of American foresters.”</p><p>In 1933, the Roosevelt Administration created the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the earliest New Deal programs. The C.C.C. put millions of (mostly single) men to work on projects that included building fire lookouts, digging firebreaks, and fighting forest fires. In 1935, the leader of the Forest Service, Ferdinand Silcox, announced the “10 <em>A</em>.<em>M</em>. Policy.” All fires on Forest Service land were to be extinguished by the morning after the day they were reported. Other federal agencies, following the Forest Service’s lead, soon adopted similar policies. Though many blazes pushed past the 10 <em>A</em>.<em>M</em>. deadline, the policy remained in effect until the late nineteen-seventies.</p><p>Gradually, it became clear that fire suppression was wrecking many of the forests it was intended to save. (Among the trees whose seeds require fire to germinate are giant sequoias.) These days, O’Connor writes, the Forest Service likes to boast that it oversees the country’s biggest prescribed-fire program, which burns almost 1.5 million acres a year. But this isn’t nearly enough to make up for what’s become known as the “fire deficit.” According to some estimates, this deficit amounts to more than three million acres just in the mountains of New Mexico and Arizona, and according to others it amounts to more than ten million acres across Washington and Oregon. A wildlife biologist whom O’Connor meets in central Nebraska tells her that the controlled burns he’s organized in the past decade have charred about thirty thousand acres. But to preserve the prairie that remains, he estimates, nearly twice that area should be combusted every year. “I have a dream of road-to-road fires one day,” he tells her. “Our goal here is to dream big.”</p><p>At one point in her travels, O’Connor visits Yosemite National Park with Stephen J. Pyne, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University. Pyne might be described as the Gibbon of fire history; he has written some thirty books on the subject, including a nine-volume work, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Florida-Fire-Survey-Last-Smoke/dp/0816532729/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Florida-Fire-Survey-Last-Smoke/dp/0816532729/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Florida-Fire-Survey-Last-Smoke/dp/0816532729/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">To the Last Smoke</a>,” on the legacy of fire in different regions of the U.S. As O’Connor was interviewing Pyne for her book, Pyne was researching a book of his own, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Park-Journey-Yosemite-National/dp/0816549230/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Park-Journey-Yosemite-National/dp/0816549230/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Park-Journey-Yosemite-National/dp/0816549230/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pyrocene Park: A Journey Into the Fire History of Yosemite National Park</a>” (University of Arizona).</p><p>Geologically speaking, we live in the Holocene, the epoch that began about twelve thousand years ago, at the close of the last ice age. But many geologists argue that the Holocene, too, has come to an end, and that we have entered a new epoch, widely referred to as the Anthropocene. Pyne believes that the new epoch would be better labelled the Pyrocene, a term of his own invention. “The Pyrocene began when a fire-wielding creature met a fire-receptive period in the Earth’s history and their interaction made anthropogenic fire an informing presence,” he writes in a previous book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Created-Fire-What-Happens/dp/0520383583/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Created-Fire-What-Happens/dp/0520383583/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyrocene-Created-Fire-What-Happens/dp/0520383583/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pyrocene: How We Created an Age of Fire, and What Happens Next.</a>”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28412&#34;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28412" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I’m looking for love, but I’ll settle for peanut butter.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Victoria Roberts</span></p><div></div></div></span></p></figure><p>Pyne’s argument for the Pyrocene begins with fire itself, which he divides into three sorts. “First-fire” is the kind that requires no human intervention. This sort is as old as the hills, or even older: the earliest evidence of fire on Earth comes from fossilized charcoal dating to the Silurian period, when plants were just starting to creep onto dry land. Second-fire, in Pyne’s scheme, is the kind that humans set, or at least control. It’s not clear when, exactly, hominins learned how to manipulate fire, but the discovery may go back as far as 1.5 million years. Controlling fire was such a significant breakthrough that, Pyne argues, it altered the course of evolution. Cooking enabled our ancestors to devote less space to digestion and more to cognition, developments that, in turn, meant humans could no longer live without flames.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
