<p><strong>tl;dr - Don’t chuck the Sony 1000XMs/AirPods just yet. Throat mics are an improvement over a standalone wired microphone (if that’s what you are using), and have better background noise reduction but in a quiet room your usual bluetooth headset is still way more convenient.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly when the thought first snuck into my head, but I’ve been <strong>a little obsessed</strong> with getting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat_microphone">throat microphone</a> setup working for a while now.</p>
<p>What’s a throat mic, you ask? Well they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="throat mic on mannequin&#39;s neck" src="https://www.wired.com/images/throat-mic-on-mannequin.png"/>
</p>
<p>Your face probably has more features than that but you get the idea. For a better view of the one I actually bought:</p>
<p><img alt="ZTAC throat mic" src="https://www.wired.com/images/ztac-throat-mic.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>Here’s the story of how I scratched my itch.</p>

<p>Like most, the common usage I know of is in the military industrial complex – I can’t say I’m a huge action buff, but operators going into sticky situations but not worrying about having to shield their microphones from wind or look like call center employees always seemed pretty convenient.</p>
<p>Somewhat related, the next most common group of customers for this tech seems to be the advanced-hobbyist airsoft/paintball crowd. Thanks to these people there are at least a few manufacturers making this tech relatively cheaply (most out of China, unfortunately).</p>
<p>And that’s just about all I know about them!</p>

<h2 id="produced-podcast-quality-audio">Produced-Podcast Quality Audio?</h2>
<p>Like everyone else, I listen to a few podcasts. One thing that is quite common in seemingly expensively produced podcasts (and some cheap ones) is incredibly good sound quality.</p>
<p>Could Throat mics be the ultimate in high quality audio for cheap? (not really).</p>
<h2 id="good-fallback-linux-mic">Good fallback Linux mic?</h2>
<p>I also <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch">run Arch (btw)</a>, and one of the things that plagued me on a recent work engagement was my bluetooth headset not working consistently.</p>
<p>These days I’ve tweaked and grown quite used to my setup and rarely have issues, but back then there were a lot of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pulseaudio</code> would sometimes stop working, and periodically be broken after upgrades</li>
<li>pipewire was still not quite encouraged for primetime</li>
<li>my manually manage bluetooth stack (<code>bluetoothctl</code>)</li>
<li>New-ish software (at the time) – <a href="https://tandem.chat/">Tandem</a> (the app mostly worked great on Linux! They actually did much better than most, which I suspect has to do with being built on browsertech)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever I had problems with my mic setup, going to a plug in mic was one of the easiest ways to cut out some complexity and usually get sound working properly (sometimes even that wasn’t enough).</p>
<p>Headsets with mics that plug in are lame, decent quality (even with noise in the background!)</p>
<p>I also had a vague idea that this could be amazing for podcasts – Imagine if you could get that pefect voice quality for your podcast guests <em>without</em> the complicated sound setup and expensive external microphones!</p>
<p>Great, natural noise cancellation for the outside (no complaints about ACs in the background, youtubers!) along with decent sound quality.</p>
<h2 id="great-for-a-home-personal-assistant">Great for a home personal assistant?</h2>
<p>Another place that I thought having a throat mic might be useful would be talking to a virtual personal assistant in a noisy place.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t want an Alexa or Siri or a Nest listening in but if I was running something self-hosted (let’s say <a href="https://www.hackers-game.com/2022/01/03/home-automation-home-assistant-vosk-and-python/">HomeAssistant + VOSK</a> or even <a href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/">CMUSphinx</a>) it might be nice to have a throat mic so I could converse with the system even if ambient music was playing or there was noise.</p>

<p>I spent a bunch of time trying to find exactly what to buy, and ended up buying exactly one incorrect connector (and one extra throat mic by accident!).</p>
<p>I’m in Tokyo so I’m sometimes limited in what I can get shipped/purchase. It was surprisingly hard for me to figure out exactly what I needed to buy to get it to be usable on a computer, but here it is (so you don’t have to):</p>

<li>To be used with the 3.5mm -&gt; Bluetooth as a hacky solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the PTT connectors stay open when connected to a computer (no need to hold down the push to talk button or anything like that).</p>

<p>Well I’ve been using a throat mic for a couple weeks now and it’s actually pretty good – sound quality is good, there’s a bit of protection from outside sound (though most of the time there isn’t much outside sound in my home!).</p>
<p>I don’t have any hard numbers (decibels, in particular) to share with you, (measuring mic/sound fidelity is not a competency of mine), but I am do have some <em>feelings</em> I can share!</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like on my desk:</p>

<h2 id="good">Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>I don’t have to change bluetooth headset modes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_(A2DP)">High Fidelity Playback w/ A2DP</a> vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Headset_Profile_(HSP)">Headset Unit HSP/HFP</a>), higher quality audio 100% of the time for my ears.</li>
<li>The throat mic relatively resistant to background noise</li>
<li>Good mic sound quality, switch was not detectable to people on the other end, and was clear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bad">Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reduced mobility compared to Bluetooth (obviously) – less important for meetings, but more important for informal calls where I might get up and walk around.</li>
<li>Set up was surprisingly error-prone (knowing which cords to get)</li>
<li>More connectors and wires than you’d think it should take
<ul>
<li>This is mostly my fault for not just buying one that goes straight to 3.5mm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People can hear me gulp</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least a few things that would improve this setup:</p>
<h2 id="going-wireless-bluetooth">Going Wireless (Bluetooth)</h2>
<p>Obviously – it’s 2022. Either converting (via dongle) or getting a bluetooth-first version of this microphone would massively improve it.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Creative-Compatible-Bluetooth-Transmitter-HP-BTW3/dp/B08B8RZZKR">Bluetooth transmitters</a> (I bought a different one, actually), but I haven’t tried it yet (I bought a female-female 3.5mm adapter as well just to try!).</p>
<p>This feels like a perfect idea for a kickstarter – getting a manufacturer that already produces these units to produce a version of these units that has bluetooth and a small battery built in.</p>
<p>I could actually build this myself with an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266">ESP8266</a>, a small lithium battery and a 3d printer… Guess I have something to put on my list of projects. That would have probably made for a much more interesting post!</p>
<p>In a more MVP fashion I could probably build a basic version by just cutting down the wiring on a throat mic I have and connecting the 3.5mm -&gt; Bluetooth dongle I bought… I might try that.</p>
<h2 id="try-an-expensive-one">Try an expensive one?</h2>
<p>ASUS also sells a <a href="https://iasus-concepts.com/about-us/about-throat-mics/">range of throat mics</a> at considerably higher cost.</p>
<p>While I doubt that the increased cost transfers to a large increase in sound quality, I sure would like to give it a try. It looks like ASUS <em>does</em> have a <a href="https://iasus-concepts.com/wireless-headsets/stealth/">wireless one</a>, though it’s pretty steep at $299! Looks pretty sick though.</p>
<p>A cursory search seems to indicate that there aren’t a <em>ton</em> of other wireless options for the throat mic… I wonder if ASUS has a patent out or something – I can see whispers of one made by a company called Andoer but all the links are dead.</p>

<p>Being tied to my desk is a pretty steep disadvantage compared to my Sony 1000XM2/AirPods I can’t say that a throat mic is <em>always</em> better than main disadvantage is being tied to my desk, but I’m going to look into whether</p>
