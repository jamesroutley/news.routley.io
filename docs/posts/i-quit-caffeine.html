    <h1>I quit caffeine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><small>Monday, January 10th 2022</small></p></div><div><div><p>It&#39;s 6am. I&#39;m groggy. I hate mornings. I need some caffeine.</p>
<p>I need a quick fix. I make a Nespresso. It&#39;s good enough. I&#39;ll make a french press after this cup wakes me up.</p>
<p>I sit in my office chair and browse the Hacker News homepage, check out /newest, and then I check Reddit.</p>
<p>I already feel jittery, but I ignore it. Like every other day.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 6:30am. I finish my cup. I&#39;m not awake. I get up to prepare my french press. The good stuff. <em>Black gold.</em></p>
<p>(At this point, coffee doesn&#39;t give me energy. It just makes me feel <em>normal.</em>)</p>
<p>I grind my own beans. They&#39;re shipped to my door, freshly roasted, every couple weeks.</p>
<p>I put the water on the kettle and get the press ready. A quiet sound grows into a loud whistle. My addiction&#39;s almost ready.</p>
<p>I dump the coffee grounds into the press, pour in the boiling water, and put the lid on. I throw a towel over it.</p>
<p>Over the years, I learned that a towel keeps the coffee hot for longer. It&#39;s a nice trick, because it means I can make more.</p>
<p>Five more minutes.</p>
<p>I like my morning routine. It&#39;s been this way — more or less — for the past 10–15 years. It&#39;s how I start my day.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 8am and I lift up my hands from my keyboard and hold them in front of my monitor. They&#39;re visibly shaking. I don&#39;t remember them shaking so early in the morning.</p>
<p>My heart skips a beat. It&#39;s been happening more frequently, so I look it up and they&#39;re apparently called &#34;palpitations.&#34; I ignore it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 9am. I&#39;m anxious. Nothing out of the norm, though. I lift up my hands again and I see more of the same. My heart has skipped a handful of beats this morning. One made me jump.</p>
<p>But it didn&#39;t stop me from pouring another cup. Keep em&#39; coming.</p>
<p>I worked at a coffee shop in my early twenties. I drank it until sunrise to sunset. I could do this all day. But I&#39;m in my thirties now, and caffeine just hits different.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 1pm. I finish lunch with my family. I&#39;m about to head back to the office, but my coffee&#39;s gone to nil.</p>
<p>I contemplate brewing more.</p>
<p>I usually make a decaf Nespresso. But I have a lot to do today, and I&#39;m tired. Instead, I opt for another caffeinated hit.</p>
<p>My 2 year old daughter helps me work the Nespresso. I love that she loves helping me make coffee.</p>
<p>I see that I&#39;m running low on Nespresso pods. I make a reminder to order some tonight.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 3pm. I look down at my keyboard. I can see my fingers lightly tapping my keys, uncontrollably. I probably overdid it today.</p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling anxious. A bit more than before. I get up for a glass of water.</p>
<p>When I stand up, my heart skips another beat. Weird. This is getting annoying, I think to myself.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 9pm. I finish putting my daughter to bed and lay down on the couch to watch TV with my wife. I feel weird. Still anxious.</p>
<p>My heart skips a few beats, rapidly. It makes me more anxious. It&#39;s <em>been</em> making me more anxious.</p>
<p>Pretty soon I feel like I&#39;m having an anxiety attack, but I&#39;ve never had one before so I can&#39;t really be sure.</p>
<p>I calm down after 10 or 50 minutes. I don&#39;t know — I wasn&#39;t keeping time. I was trying to calm down.</p>
<p>I think, &#34;is this worth it?&#34;</p>
<p>A few days pass.</p>
<p>I was at my wife&#39;s prenatal appointment and they were discussing decaf coffee and some coffee alternatives. I&#39;ve never liked coffee alternatives, and I don&#39;t really like tea.</p>
<p>I like my coffee strong and black, and alternatives are never strong enough, or worse, they require heretical &#34;cream&#34; to taste good.</p>
<p>But I ask our midwife a few questions. She&#39;s also a nutritionist. I&#39;ve told her about my heart palpitations in the past, which we attributed to caffeine and stress, so she asked if those are still happening.</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>I listen to her recommendations, as I sip on my extra-shot latte.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 9pm. I finish the bedtime routine and sit on the couch. I sip on Lagavulin 16 while reading &#34;Dark Matter.&#34; I&#39;ve had a few jumps tonight, but nothing out of the norm. I had a busy day, lots of caffeine.</p>
<p>My mind wanders.</p>
<p>I forgot to order coffee a few days ago. I should do that.</p>
<p>I sit at my Amazon cart&#39;s checkout screen, still anxiously pondering &#34;is this worth it?&#34; I close the app.</p>
<p>I decide to order one of our midwife&#39;s recommendations instead. It&#39;s made with mushrooms and roots and has &#34;adaptogens.&#34; Who knows what that means, but I go all in with the sampler kit.</p>
<p>A week passes.</p>
<p>I got my coffee alternative shipment in the mail last night.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 6am. I brew my first tasting. I use a french press, as recommended. I throw a towel over it and let it steep for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I pour my first cup. It&#39;s not bad. It doesn&#39;t taste like coffee, but it&#39;s strong and I kind of like it. Maybe it&#39;ll grow on me.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 9am. I finish off the french press. I lift up my hands and notice they&#39;re not shaking. But my head <em>hurts.</em></p>
<p>I decide to press through the pain. In a moment, my love for coffee turned into hatred. It was no longer worth hurting myself.</p>
<p>I head to the kitchen and grab a big glass of water. I sit at my desk to try and get some work done.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 1pm. Lunch is over and instead of making a decaf coffee, I decide to make another batch of the new stuff.</p>
<p>&#34;More coffee, daddy?&#34;</p>
<p>Not today.</p>
<p>I do this for days. I think it&#39;s called cold-turkey.</p>
<p>A couple days pass.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 6pm. I sit over a sandwich and soup from Panera as I try to get through a migraine. They&#39;ve been happening a lot lately, but this one is the worst. I feel nauseous.</p>
<p>I put some Wintergreen essential oil on my temples to help with the headache and I go to lay down.</p>
<p>I ponder the inverse, &#34;is <em>this</em> worth it?&#34;</p>
<p>A couple weeks pass.</p>
<p>(It took about this long for the caffeine withdrawal symptoms to completely ease up.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s 6am. I do my morning routine. Not much has changed. But by midday, I feel less anxious and I&#39;m not jittery anymore. And better yet, the caffeine-induced heart palpitations are completely gone.</p>
<p>I sit in my office chair and browse the Hacker News homepage, check out /newest, and I see my post. I&#39;d upvote it, but I can&#39;t.</p>
<p>I feel good. I don&#39;t really mind mornings now.</p>

<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
<p>It&#39;s been 4 months since I quit caffeine cold-turkey. I was addicted for 15 years. It helped me get through a lot — from late nights in the office to early mornings with newborns. But now, at what cost?</p>
<p>Quitting was incredibly challenging. I won&#39;t pretend it was easy. I&#39;ve never had worse headaches in my life. And I&#39;m sure I was not a joy to be around during that time.</p>
<p>But it <em>was</em> worth it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried having an occasional cup of coffee and it always results in the same symptoms. Like clockwork. Any caffeine does. I guess my body is saying &#34;stop.&#34; And I need to listen.</p>
<p>I do still have a cup of decaf every few days, because sometimes it&#39;s just easier to do a pod than a french press.</p>
<p>But even having more than one cup of <em>decaf</em> brings on the shakes and skipped beats. The caffeine microdosing adds up, I guess.</p>
<p>I still have my morning routine. It takes a bit longer (I let my Rasa steep for about 30 minutes before drinking it, to make it extra strong), but it&#39;s still the same, just different.</p>
<p>I actually now <em>prefer</em> it over coffee. I never thought I&#39;d ever say something like that, but here we are.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake up and forget my ritual, without later repercussions. Before, coffee was <em>always</em> the first thing on my mind.</p>
<p>Overall, I can&#39;t express how much cutting caffeine has improved my wellbeing. If you need to chat, <a href="https://twitter.com/ezekgabrielse">my mailbox is open</a>.</p>
