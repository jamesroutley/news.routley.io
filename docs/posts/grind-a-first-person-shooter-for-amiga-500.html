Well if you&#39;re looking for more gaming news on this upcoming first person shooter, we have not only been informed that a new demo has been made available, but the latest footage and detailed press release shows that John is true to his word in bringing a Doom-like experience to the Amiga as the holy-grail of Amiga gaming! So without further-ado, here&#39;s the latest blurb about this incredible looking game.<span></span></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/doD7hmlKun8" width="640" youtube-src-id="doD7hmlKun8"></iframe></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11TYIX6TRyg" width="640" youtube-src-id="11TYIX6TRyg"></iframe></p><p>&#39;&#34;Darkenward east&#39; is planned to be one of the early levels in the game, taking place in a city area. The map is in it&#39;s very early stages and will be overhauled once more levels are introduced and the enemy roster gets more complete (currently there&#39;s a lack of low tier enemies and other important classes). This release in general marks the complete transition of the project in regards to its visuals and now fully embraces the Steampunk/Lovecraftian aesthetic with the addition of the new HUD and protagonist, as well as brand new, high quality Weapon designs!&#34;  </p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9uzjdulEMJTcR-BV-YkdPNFS1ZeZOFlW32H6HKqvy1RCyZm2x5PVzWZ4mVNip_I61GHq299dfMaEGY1mnIxmS_9IZb4N7aHdVkGzEqPC7kgr0tmXWuLSyJjyVGyFcqdWQ3NmOcj4Q8S_SPoepkipU_2qVVf5RPN6PxT5huEQYss9KqP0dhR67BtbSxqY/s1154/Clipboard01.jpg"><img data-original-height="832" data-original-width="1154" height="462" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9uzjdulEMJTcR-BV-YkdPNFS1ZeZOFlW32H6HKqvy1RCyZm2x5PVzWZ4mVNip_I61GHq299dfMaEGY1mnIxmS_9IZb4N7aHdVkGzEqPC7kgr0tmXWuLSyJjyVGyFcqdWQ3NmOcj4Q8S_SPoepkipU_2qVVf5RPN6PxT5huEQYss9KqP0dhR67BtbSxqY/w640-h462/Clipboard01.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>Here&#39;s a list of features still missing (and planned to be added soon) as well as other details that are to be worked next, in order to reach the &#39;vertical slice&#39; short-term goal: </p><ul><li>Music support for the Amiga version</li><li>SFX overhaul (includes adding ambient stuff and enemy growls)</li><li>Further polish on weapon models</li><li>Complete the weapon models replacement (Chaingun and Missile-launcher are still wip - the demo only features the pistol and shotgun for now)</li><li>Add secondary weapon attacks (using RMB)</li><li>Existing enemies polishing (various high-tech details still need altering or removing from some models)</li><li>Create and add new enemy types   </li><li>Complete and add 2 more levels (the previous and the next one).
