    <h1>Oxide Cuts Data Center Power Consumption in Half</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="content"><div id="preamble"><div><p>Here’s a sobering thought: today, data centers already consume <strong>1-2% of the world’s power</strong>, and that percentage will likely rise to <strong>3-4% by the end of the decade</strong>. According to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand">Goldman Sachs research</a>, that rise will include a doubling in data center carbon dioxide emissions. As the data and AI boom progresses, this thirst for power shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Two key challenges quickly become evident for the <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/amazon-ceo-85-percent-of-it-spend-remains-on-premises-gen-ai-will-fuel-aws-cloud-sales">85% of IT</a> that currently lives on-premises.</p><div><ol><li><p><em>How can organizations reduce power consumption and corresponding carbon emissions?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How can organizations keep pace with AI innovation as existing data centers run out of available power?</em></p></li></ol></div><div><p><img srcset="https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/goldman-datacenter-chart.svg?w=700 700w, https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/goldman-datacenter-chart.svg?w=1400 1400w, https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/goldman-datacenter-chart.svg?w=2100 2100w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 700px, 1400px, 2100px" src="https://oxide.computer/img/blog/power-consumption/goldman-datacenter-chart.svg" alt="Graph of AI &amp; Data Center Growth Boosting Electricity Demand"/></p><p>Figure 1. Masanet et al.

Individual rackmount servers are stacked together, each with their own AC power supplies, cooling fans, and power management. They are then paired with storage appliances and network switches that communicate at arm’s length, not designed as a cohesive whole. This approach fundamentally limits organizations&#39; ability to maintain sustainable, high-efficiency computing systems.</p><p>Of course, hyperscale public cloud providers did not design their data center systems this way. Instead, they operate like a carefully planned smart home where everything is designed to work together cohesively and is operated by software that understands the home’s systems end-to-end. High-efficiency, rack-scale computers are deployed at scale and operate as a single unit with integrated storage and networking to support elastic cloud computing services. This modern architecture is made available to the market as public cloud, but that rental-only model is ill-fit for many business needs.</p><div><p><img srcset="https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/oxide-power-efficiency-illustration.svg?w=700 700w, https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/oxide-power-efficiency-illustration.svg?w=1400 1400w, https://oxide-computer.imgix.net//img/blog/power-consumption/oxide-power-efficiency-illustration.svg?w=2100 2100w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 700px, 1400px, 2100px" src="https://oxide.computer/img/blog/power-consumption/oxide-power-efficiency-illustration.svg" alt="Illustration of Oxide racks at a higher density (2x) than conventional ones"/></p></div><p>At Oxide, we’ve taken this lesson in advancing rack-scale design, improved upon it in several ways, and made it available for every organization to purchase and operate anywhere in the world without a tether back to the public cloud. Our Cloud Computer treats the entire rack as a <strong>single, unified computer</strong> rather than a collection of independent parts, achieving unprecedented power efficiency.</p><p>By designing the hardware and software together, we’ve eliminated unnecessary components and optimized every aspect of system operation through a control plane with visibility to end-to-end operations.</p><div><blockquote><p>When we started Oxide, the DC bus bar stood as one of the most glaring differences between the rack-scale machines at the hyperscalers and the rack-and-stack servers that the rest of the market was stuck with. That a relatively simple piece of copper was unavailable to commercial buyers — despite being unequivocally the right way to build it! — represented everything wrong with the legacy approach.</p>
<p>The bus bar in the Oxide Cloud Computer is not merely more efficient, it is a concrete embodiment of the tremendous gains from designing at rack-scale, and by integrating hardware with software.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum="">The improvements we’re seeing are rooted in technical innovation</h2><div><div><ul><li><p><strong>Replacing low-efficiency AC power supplies with a high-efficiency DC Bus Bar</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bigger fans = bigger efficiency gains</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose-built for power efficiency</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hardware + Software designed together</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>Learn more about Oxide’s intelligent Power Shelf Controller</p>

</p></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum="">The Bottom Line: Customers and the Environment Both Benefit</h2><div><p>Reducing data center power demands and achieving more useful computing per kilowatt requires <strong>fundamentally rethinking</strong> traditional data center utilization and compute design. At Oxide, we’ve proven that dramatic efficiency gains are possible when you rethink the computer at rack-scale with hardware and software designed thoughtfully and rigorously together.</p><p>Ready to learn how your organization can achieve these results? <strong>Schedule time with our team <a href="https://oxide.computer/sales">here</a>.</strong></p><p>Together, we can reclaim on-premises computing efficiency to achieve both business and sustainability goals.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
