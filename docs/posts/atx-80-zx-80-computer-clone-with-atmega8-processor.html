<p><SPAN face="Arial">The ATX-80 is a microcomputer derived from
the ZX-80, with an ATmega8 processor. It does not emulate code,
but replaces the original computer with custom code with similar
functionality in AVR assembly. It allows output of the video to a
VGA monitor or to a PAL/NTSC television. BASIC programs can be
stored in internal EEPROM, internal Flash or external EEPROM
memory (32 memory slots) and also transferred between PC and
memory. The advantages are easy construction and small size. It
can be used as a small inexpensive computer for teaching basic
BASIC programming. Includes 32 sample programs.</SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="description"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Description</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The original intent of the project was to
create a computer with similar features and technical limitations
as the original ZX-80. That is, a fully functional BASIC
interpreter with only 1 KB of RAM and as close to 4 KB of ROM as
possible. The project was also conceived as a study of the
original ZX-80 BIOS ROM. It must be admitted that the original
ZX-80 BIOS was an admirable creation. In addition to being very
innovative, it was created with a high optimization of code size,
and although this required a considerable amount of clarity in
the flow of data between functions, the author maintained an
overview of the code with minimal errors. I have tried to keep
the functionality of the original code as accurate as possible
and commented my code in detail, which can be a useful addition
to explain the BIOS functionality. The ZX-80 BIOS is a very
useful and informative study material and, despite its age,
deserves more attention as an admirable work.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The ATmega8 processor was chosen to rewrite
the code, which has 1 KB of RAM (the same limitation as the
ZX-80) and 8 KB of Flash memory. Although the Flash memory is
more than the original 4 KB, the code was about 40% longer after
rewriting (AVR instructions are 16-bit) and additional functions
were added, such as a more complex video generator, memory
handling, 1 KB of internal Flash was used as a memory slot to
store programs, so the 8 KB of memory was used efficiently.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The ATX-80 includes a keyboard of 40 micro
switches. It can generate video for VGA monitor and also video in
PAL and NTSC television standard via Cinch connector. It is
powered by an external +5V source via USB connector (USB charger
or computer connector). An external 32 KB EEPROM memory is used
to store user BASIC programs, allowing 32 programs to be stored
in 32 memory slots. In addition to the external EEPROM memory,
one internal memory slot in the processor&#39;s Flash memory can be
used to copy programs between different external EEPROM memories.
The edited program is also automatically mirrored in the internal
EEPROM memory. The internal EEPROM has a size of only 512 bytes,
so some programs do not fit in it completely, but most programs
are no larger than 512 bytes (RAM must be shared with variables
and video memory) and for longer programs at least a larger part
is backed up.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Advantages of the ATX-80 over the original
ZX-80:</SPAN></p>

<ul>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">VGA video output</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Image is generated while the program
        is running (FAST and SLOW modes can be used)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Preservation of the edited program
        even after shutdown</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Saving programs to external EEPROM</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Autorepeat keys</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Function with memory information</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Higher program running speed</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Small size</SPAN></li>
</ul>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Limitations of the ATX-80 compared to the
original ZX-80:</SPAN></p>

<ul>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Cannot run programs in machine code
        (USR function is not functional)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Memory cannot be increased by external
        memory</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Cannot connect additional devices via
        external bus</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">The tape recorder cannot be used to
        store programs, only its own EEPROM memory can be used</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">Generated image characters contain an
        extra 9th white bar (consequence of image generation by
        SPI port)</SPAN></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.breatharian.eu/hw/atx80/img/atx80_2.jpg"><SPAN face="Arial"><img src="http://www.breatharian.eu/hw/atx80/img/atx80_2_m.jpg" width="400" height="287"/></SPAN></a></p>

<h2><a name="errata"></a><SPAN face="Arial">ZX-80 BIOS errors</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">While studying the ZX-80 BIOS I came across
a few minor bugs.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">1) REM command error. The address of the
REM routine should be L0849 instead of L084A. The error causes
that giving the REM command without parameters (no text) will not
execute the next line.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">2) Error in the ED-EDIT routine - the
following instructions should be in reverse order. The error can
cause the computer to crash when writing a command when memory is
full.</SPAN></p>

<pre><SPAN size="4">	JR NC,L03A7	; back to ED-COPY if not enough
			; room to fill edit line.
	POP HL		; restore program position.</SPAN></pre>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">3) The following error, although not
apparent, is a potential risk when changing the compilation. At
the beginning of the L03CB ED-EDIT routine, the initialization of
register B to a value representing the number of lines to print
is missing (a number of 2 or higher is needed). At this point,
register B contains a value of 3 (derived from address L03CB),
which is suitable, but recompiling from a different address could
cause the bottom screen to stop printing. However, it is possible
that the author deliberately omitted this instruction there, as
part of the optimization.</SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="diagram"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Wiring diagram</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The main processor is ATmega8. If
necessary, it can be replaced by ATmega88, ATmega168 or ATmega328
processors, which are pin compatible. A different firmware code
must be used, which is also provided in the download package.
However, the larger memory of the higher processor types is not
used.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The processor is driven by a 24 MHz
crystal. This frequency is necessary to display the required
resolution on a VGA monitor. Although the frequency of the
crystal used lies above the limits declared by the manufacturer,
in practice it has been found that practically all processors can
handle such overclocking fine. Still, it is advisable to use a
socket for the processor and try another piece of the processor
in case of difficulties. Insufficient supply voltage may also be
the cause of malfunction. The cutoff frequency of the processor
is dependent on the power supply, a low supply voltage may cause
the processor to not work properly with the crystal used.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The keyboard is wired in a 5x8 key matrix,
with similar wiring to the original ZX-80, just with reverse
current flow. When scanning the keyboard, signals COL1 to COL5
are wired as input (i.e., high impedance state) and only one of
the COL signals is set as output with the LOW level. Signals ROW1
to ROW8 are connected as input with an internal pull-up resistor.
When the keypad is scanned, one of the COL signals is activated
to LOW level and the reading of the ROW signals detects the key
pressed.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The MOSI output from the SPI generator is
routed as a video signal to both the VGA connector and the CINCH
connector for output to the TV. The output is assumed to be
loaded with a 75 ohm input resistor, which will provide the
required voltage level of 0.7V. The SYNC signal is the output
from Timer1, which provides horizontal synchronization. Timer1
simultaneously triggers an interrupt to the video generator,
which sends the video data through the SPI controller.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The VSYNC signal is only used in &#34;old
VGA display&#34; mode. Otherwise, a CSYNC sync mix is normally
generated at the SYNC output. The vertical signal is created in
the sync mix by negating the horizontal sync signal. Most current
VGA monitors support sync mix and work well in this mode. Only
older VGA monitors require the use of a VSYNC signal as well. For
most monitors, no difference between old/new VGA monitor modes
should normally be observed.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The external EEPROM memory is connected via
the TWI/I2C signals (SDA and SCL). A 32 KB 24LC256P memory is
recommended as the most suitable type, which can hold 32 user
programs (32 slots, where each slot is 1 KB in size). In addition
to this, 24LC32 (4KB, i.e. 4 slots), 24LC64 (8 KB, i.e. 8 slots),
24LC128 (16 KB, i.e. 16 slots) and 24LC512 (64 KB, i.e. 64 slots)
can also be used. The memories differ only in the number of
available memory slots.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">It is advisable to use a socket for the
EEPROM memory so that it can be replaced with another one with
different stored programs if necessary. Programs can be copied
between memories using both the slot in the internal Flash memory
and the included copy utility.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The EEPROM memories used contain a
write-protect input pin. The ATX-80 does not provide for this,
but a configuration jumper can be added to the board to enable or
disable writing to the EEPROM memory and thus protect its
contents against unwanted overwriting.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> The
ATX-80 does not recognize the size of the attached EEPROM memory.
It is up to the user to use the correct slot number. If you use a
slot number outside the memory range, the slot number will be
overwritten by modulo operations to another slot (EEPROM ignores
unused higher address bits) and may inadvertently overwrite
another stored program. For example, writing to slot 34 in a 32
KB memory will write to slot 2.</em></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><em><strong>Note 2:</strong></em><em> It is
assumed that the same hardware will be used for the planned ZX-81
clone, but a different processor with larger memory (probably
ATmega328) will be used. Therefore, use a socket for the
processor to make it easily replaceable.</em></SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="construction"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Construction</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The ATX-80 is designed for a 100x75 mm
single-sided PCB - partly because of the limitations of the
freeware version of the Eagle editor, and partly because this is
one of the dimensions of commonly sold photo-etch PCBs. I produce
the PCB by printing the master in an inkjet printer on
transparent film (gluing 2 printed master with adhesive for
better coverage), illuminating with UV-LED field (10 minutes from
a distance of 30 cm), exposing in potassium hydroxide and etching
in ferric chloride.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Please note that in case of customised PCB
production, it is necessary to check the definitions of the hole
diameters in the template (I drilled the holes myself and
therefore not verified).</SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="programming"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Programming and
starting up</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Set the fuses as follows:</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">ATmega8: low 0xEF (default 0xE1), high 0xC7
(default 0xD9)</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The fuses are set to map the boot loader to
the smallest memory size (needed for writing to the internal
flash memory), protect the internal EEPROM during programming,
and fast external crystal.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">If you connect a VGA monitor after
programming the processor, you should see a basic white screen
with a &#34;K&#34; cursor in the lower left corner. If this
does not happen, a video mode other than the default VGA may be
selected. To switch the video mode, hold down any of the buttons <strong>1</strong>
through <strong>4</strong> on the keyboard while turning on the
power:</SPAN></p>

<ul>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>1 + power supply:</strong> old
        VGA monitor (uses VSYNC signal)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>2 + power supply:</strong> new
        VGA monitor (uses CSYNC sync mix)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>3 + power supply:</strong>
        NTSC TV video mode (output via CINCH connector)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>4 + power supply:</strong> PAL
        TV video mode (output via CINCH connector)</SPAN></li>
</ul>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The selected configuration is stored in the
last byte of the EEPROM memory for future use. If the video mode
cannot be switched, you may have a short circuit on one of the
buttons.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Be careful not to use the above operation
to set the vieomode on a processor with a copy utility. It could
inadvertently activate the programming of the external EEPROM.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">You can check whether the processor is
working without connecting the display. Insert the LED into the
VGA connector between pins 14 (anode, long plus pin) and 10
(cathode, shorter minus pin). If you turn on video mode 1 (the
old VGA monitor), the LED will light up (VSYNC signal is active),
the LED will not light up for other video modes. Or you can plug
the LED into the CINCH connector (anode to the pinhole, cathode
to the shell) - if an image is being generated, the LED will
light.</SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="eeprom"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Programming EEPROM
with sample programs</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>Uploading programs to EEPROM</strong></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">After testing the basic functionality of
the ATX-80, I recommend programming the connected external EEPROM
memory. In the attachment you will find a set of utilities to
load a set of 32 sample programs into the EEPROM. This requires
either reprogramming the main processor or using another
processor as a &#34;copier&#34;.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">In the utilities package there is a folder <strong>ATX80_Import</strong>,
where you can find firmware (BIN files) for the copy processor,
prepared for ATmega8/88/168/328 processors (the first number in
the BIN file name indicates the processor). There are 3 sets of
programs for each type of processor: slot 1 to 12, slot 13 to 24
and slot 25 to 32. The contents of the programs can be found in
the utility package in the files Programs_1.txt, Programs_2.txt
and Programs_3.txt. Alternatively, the program descriptions can
be found in the Programs.txt file in the ATX-80 source code
package.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The copy program does not use a display,
but only an indicator LED to save memory. Insert it into the VGA
connector on the VSYNC signal, between pins 14 (anode, long plus
pin) and 10 (cathode, shorter minus pin).</SPAN></p>

<p><a href="http://www.breatharian.eu/hw/atx80/img/atx80_6.jpg"><SPAN face="Arial"><img src="http://www.breatharian.eu/hw/atx80/img/atx80_6_m.jpg" width="400" height="198"/></SPAN></a></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><img src="http://www.breatharian.eu/hw/atx80/img/atx80_7_m.jpg" width="250" height="124"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Load the *_1.bin program with the first set
of sample programs into the processor. The LED will flash rapidly
to indicate that the processor is in a standby state. If you now
press button <strong>4</strong> on the keypad, the LED will light
steadily for a few seconds to indicate that EEPROM programming is
in progress. It will then flash again quickly to indicate that
the operation has been completed. Load the other 2 sets of sample
programs in this manner one at a time. The button must be pressed
for at least half a second to be registered - the LED must light
up for at least 1 second.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>Copying programs between EEPROMs</strong></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The program set in the utility package is
also used to download or copy programs from the external EEPROM
memory. Use the following procedure to copy the contents of the
EEPROM to another memory.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Load the program from the <strong>ATX80_Copy</strong>
folder for the corresponding processor into the processor. The
LED will flash to indicate readiness. Press any of the buttons 1
through 3. The LED will light momentarily to indicate an
operation in progress, and the programs from the EEPROM will be
downloaded to the processor&#39;s internal Flash memory. The button
determines which slots are downloaded. Button <strong>1</strong>
downloads slots 1 through 11, button <strong>2 </strong>downloads
slots 12 through 22, and button <strong>3</strong> downloads
slots 23 through 32. Theoretically, the ATmega8 may not fit 11
slots - they would mean 11 KB of memory, but the ATmega8 has only
8 KB. In practice, most programs are smaller so they can fit into
8 KB. If sometimes they don&#39;t, you would need to use a processor
with more memory or adjust the slot counts in the copy program
source code.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">After downloading the programs to the
processor, turn off the power, replace the EEPROM memory, and
turn on the power. Press button <strong>4 </strong>to save the
loaded programs from Flash memory to the new external EEPROM
memory. All programs that are in memory are saved and stored in
the same slots from which they were downloaded.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><strong>Download programs from EEPROM</strong></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">You can also download programs to your PC
using utilities. First, as in the previous case, download the
appropriate set of programs to the processor&#39;s Flash memory
(using buttons 1 to 3). Connect the CPU programmer and download
the CPU Flash memory to the ATX80_Copy folder, to files named
1.bin to 3.bin. In the <strong>ATX80_Export</strong> folder, run
the command file !.bat. This will export the programs from the
downloaded Flash memory images to the text files Programs_1.txt
through Programs_3.txt in the base utilities folder. Within the
files, you can edit the downloaded files in text form. Each
program code is prefixed with a &#34;SLOT x&#34; to indicate
which slot the program belongs to. The label indicates the start
of the program for further processing. All subsequent lines
starting with a number are processed as program lines. Program
lines may be followed by LET or DIM statements containing the
filling of numeric or text variables.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">If you wish to load programs in text form
back into EEPROM, run the !.bat command file in the <strong>ATX80_Import</strong>
folder. This will ensure that the programs from the text form are
imported back into the copy program images. Then all you have to
do is load the programs into the processor and press button 4 to
save them to the external EEPROM, just as described at the
beginning of this chapter.</SPAN></p>

<h2><a name="basic"></a><SPAN face="Arial">Description of the
ATX-80 BASIC</SPAN></h2>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The ATX-80 BASIC is almost completely
identical to the ZX-80 BASIC, except for a few small differences.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The program line number can range from 1 to
9999. After each change in program lines, the program is
automatically backed up to the internal EEPROM. The internal
EEPROM has a capacity of only 510 bytes and therefore may not
hold the entire program. When the ATX-80 is turned on, the
program stored in the internal EEPROM is restored.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The BASIC ATX-80 operates with integers in
the range -32768 to +32767. Variables can be of the following
types:</SPAN></p>

<ul>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">an integer variable with an
        arbitrarily long name (starts with a letter, can be
        followed by letters or digits)</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">an integer variable with only 1 letter
        can be used as a FOR loop parameter</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">text variable is 1 letter followed by
        $, text can be of any length</SPAN></li>
    <li><SPAN face="Arial">the array is 1 letter, the array index
