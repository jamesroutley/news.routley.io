          <div><div><p>The word <u>‘</u>unwanted<u>’</u> is particularly subjective as these plants provide a great source of food and shelter to the smallest of creatures. Although many may dismiss or even dislike the presence of these resilient plants, their benefits are great.</p>
<p>These plants have adapted to the changing landscape, swapping paddocks for pavements and downlands for drain covers.  Look out, pause and admire the pluck and resilience of the willing weed, growing where it ought not to!</p>
<p>Watch out for weeds on your walks around the city. Particular species consistently pop out of the concrete to greet you. Here are just some of the plants that you may spot:</p>
<p>Starting with a nostalgic favourite of mine, I distinctly remember sitting on the curb of the road outside my house, squashing the heads of this plant and enjoying its earthy pineapple scent. Aptly named the pineappleweed due to its smell and appearance, this introduced species arrived in the late 19th Century from North America. The plant quickly spread from the growth of motor transport as the seeds got trapped in the tyre treads, transported and planted themselves into the compacted soil of untarmacked roads! It is a member of the daisy family, a composite flower made up of individual blooms, but it has no ray florets, so it looks a little like a bald daisy!</p>
</div></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><p>Although these weeds tend to become more apparent in the springtime along with the usual calendar of flowering plants, to mark the beginning of the year, the brave groundsel is one of the first plants to flower with its yellow head. I often spot this scrappy weed perching along the pavement line where brick walls stand, nestling itself in opportune splits in the concrete. The little yellow head of the groundsel transforms into a tuft of white once the plant has seeded; in ode to this proud sprout of white, the Latin name of the groundsel is <em>Senecio Vulgaris</em>, Senecio, meaning old man!</p></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><p>Now, although these are pavement plants, they are welcome additions to any green space such as a garden, so by simply leaving your garden down to nature, or at least a section of your garden, these plants can take root, providing food and shelter to a variety of insects and creatures. Creating more opportunities for larger creatures, such as birds, to be attracted to your space. </p></div>
