<p>A massive Microsoft outage affects Bing.com, Copilot for web and mobile, Copilot in Windows, ChatGPT internet search and DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Microsoft outage started at approximately 3 AM EDT and seems to have primarily affected users in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/mayank_jee/status/1793560213498581389" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to user reports</a> and our tests, if you try to open Bing.com, you&#39;ll either see a blank page or a page with a 429 HTTP code error. However, Bing search still works if accessed directly. For some reason, the outage only affects the homepage.</p>

<p>To use Bing, <a href="https://www4.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">go to this URL</a> and search as usual. It will work. However, Copilot is completely offline whether you use the website, app, or Copilot in Windows.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also important to note that ChatGPT internet search and DuckDuckGo are experiencing similar issues because they use the Bing API.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo refuses to load search pages, displaying an error message: &#34;There was an error displaying the search results. Please try again.&#34;</p>
<p>While Microsoft has yet to comment on the outage, OpenAI confirmed issues with ChatGPT internet search in an update on its <a href="https://status.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">support page</a>.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story...</em></p>
<p>Update 1: Microsoft has confirmed an issue where users may be unable to access the Microsoft Copilot service. &#34;We&#39;re working to isolate the cause of the issue. More information can be found in the admin center under CP795190,&#34; the company <a href="https://x.com/msft365status/status/1793564067191259271" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted in a post on X</a>.</p>
