          <h4>Open Source HTTP Reverse Proxy built in Rust for Immutable Infrastructures</h4>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu">GitHub</a></p>
          <p>Most existing tools have a static vision of production: a service is installed once on a long lived server, updated from time to time, with configuration rarely changing.</p>
          <p>There&#39;s now a shift in infrastructure to short lived virtual machines and hundreds of new deployments per day, and the usual tools reach their limits.</p>
          <p>How do we reconcile a dynamic environment with availability guarantees? How can we get &#34;zero downtime&#34; deployments for critical services?</p>
          <p>SŌZU is a HTTP reverse proxy built in Rust, that can handle fine grained configuration changes at runtime without reloads, and designed to never ever stop.</p>
