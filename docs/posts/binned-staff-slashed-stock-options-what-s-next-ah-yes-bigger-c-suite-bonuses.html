    <h1>Binned staff, slashed stock options. What&#39;s next? Ah yes, bigger C-suite bonuses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>After another round of mass layoffs and reports of slashed stock options for remaining employees, Meta has like clockwork opted to reward its top executives with a substantial bonus increase.</p>
<p>The Facebook giant revealed in a government <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680125000021/meta-20250213.htm" rel="nofollow">filing</a> that its Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (CNGC) approved a target annual bonus increase for its top executive officers bar CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The bonus was raised from 75 percent of base salary to a whopping 200 percent, effective with the 2025 annual performance period.</p>
<p>&#34;Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation,&#34; the filing notes. It added that prior to the adjustment, those executives were only at or below the 15th percentile in total cash compensation compared to their peers. </p>

    

<p>According to Meta&#39;s April 2024 proxy <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/8c7f110d-9cc4-4034-b356-ece89d4cb1c5.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> [PDF], CTO Andrew Bosworth&#39;s base salary was $945,000. His actual eligible earnings were slightly lower due to the timing of his raise. However, factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and Meta&#39;s 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023, his total bonus payout amounted to about $1.05 million.</p>

        


        

<p>Assuming Bosworth&#39;s salary remains the same, and Meta&#39;s company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025, the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly $3 million. That&#39;s before any stock-based compensation and other add-ons. And he&#39;s not even the highest-paid member of Meta&#39;s named executive team.</p>
<p>For balance&#39;s sake, and some might find this hard to swallow but, $3 million annual cash compensation for a CTO in Bosworth&#39;s position is about right for Silicon Valley; it&#39;s nothing outrageous, relatively speaking. The vast majority of his pay package is in shares; in 2023 for instance, he was awarded more than $20 million in stock. The salary, like for many in his role, is the cherry on top of an enormous cake.</p>

        

<p>Some of that bonus cash, though, might be coming from Meta&#39;s latest round of layoffs, which saw <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/10/meta_to_toss_5_of/">around 3,700 people</a> - about five percent of its workforce - axed this month. The cut reportedly targeted low performers, and followed a year in which the biz reported a net income of $62.36 billion, a 59 percent year-over-year increase. </p>
<p>This comes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67a4c030-a7f6-47af-bab0-a998f0a09506" rel="nofollow">reports</a> surfaced this week that Meta has cut back on its yearly distribution of stock options by 10 percent to most staff, though we do note that the corp&#39;s share price has climbed 10 percent in the past month, and 46 percent for the past year.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve reached out to Meta to confirm reports of the stock option cut. </p>

<p>Zuckerberg started 2025 by describing Meta&#39;s plans for the year as &#34;intense,&#34; with massive AI investments lined up as the Facebook maker shifts focus beyond its struggling <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/meta_metaverse_report/">metaverse</a> ambitions. </p>
<p>Following OpenAI&#39;s announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company/">$500 billion</a> in an AI infrastructure project dubbed Stargate, Zuckerberg announced his own AI spending plans - Meta would pour $60 billion or more to expand its AI infrastructure in 2025. </p>

        

<p>&#34;This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,&#34; Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0219ude255AKkmk4JAueXZeZ9zpjNYio2tBkd7bNmCaRbJ6iJaVVjypUgDg78CNdq5l" rel="nofollow">said</a> of the effort. Hopefully it will prove more successful than that Metaverse shift for the sake of those executives&#39; bonuses. ®</p>
