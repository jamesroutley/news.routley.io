    <h1>A Love Letter to People Who Believe in People</h1>

		<p><strong>Tina on the transformative power of enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>When I was eight, I made a big, hand-drawn poster that said, “Do you want to join my fan club?” and put it up in the small Swiss town where I grew up. </p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-year-old-Tina-Roth-Eisenbeg.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="585" srcset="https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-year-old-Tina-Roth-Eisenbeg.jpg 585w, https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-year-old-Tina-Roth-Eisenbeg-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"/></p>
<p>Neighbors would ask me, “What are we going to be fans of?” and I’d say, “It doesn’t matter—it’s just about being excited.” Eight year old Tina.</p>
<p>Decades later, I’m still convinced that being a fan is a state of mind.</p>
<p>Being a fan is all about bringing the enthusiasm. It’s being a champion of possibility. It’s believing in someone. And it’s contagious. When you’re around someone who is super excited about something, it washes over you. It feels good. You can’t help but want to bring the enthusiasm, too.</p>
<p>This, to me, is the real transformation. Confidence is impressive, but enthusiasm can change people’s lives.</p>

<p>If I trace all the defining moments of my life back to their beginnings, I can always find a person with this fan state of mind: someone who believed in me, opened a door, or illuminated a new path just by being who they are.</p>
<p>This is a love letter to all the people who believe in us and nudge us in new directions with their enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>To the person who showed me you can live life your way—my beloved, eccentric Aunt Hugi</strong></p>
<p>She was the most creative, unique, stubborn, wild Swiss woman I have ever known. I grew up in the Swiss countryside and visiting Hugi in Zurich was always an adventure. She was a fashion designer, artist, and a true original. As I got older, I really started to appreciate how she didn’t care what people thought. She lived a courageous, creative life and inspired me to be bold, forge my own path, and break rules.</p>

<p><strong>To the person who opened up a different future—my first boss, Matthew Waldman</strong></p>
<p>After I earned my graphic design degree, I convinced my parents that I wanted to go to New York to find a three-month internship. I arrived on a Monday night and had an interview lined up the next morning with Matthew Waldman—the CEO of a small, now defunct design studio. Within five minutes of talking to me, he offered me a job and predicted that I would never leave New York.</p>
<p>Not only was he right, but his instant belief in me taught me that your boss can be enthusiastic, kind, and caring. This set the tone going forward—I would not accept anything other than a loving work environment.</p>

<p><strong>To the person who nudged me to ask myself, “What am I waiting for?”—my daughter Ella</strong></p>
<p>While working as a Design Director at a digital agency and pregnant with my daughter Ella, I found myself inspired to think bigger. I always wanted to run my own design studio and an urgency suddenly hit me—I was making a human, and I wanted to be a role model to them, so what was I waiting for? I started my own design studio the day she was born.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella-989x1024.png" alt="" width="989" height="1024" srcset="https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella-989x1024.png 989w, https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella-480x497.png 480w, https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella-768x795.png 768w, https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella-1483x1536.png 1483w, https://www.swiss-miss.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ella.png 1930w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px"/></p>
<p><strong>To the person who helped me realise “I can do this too”—the inspiring Jim Coudal</strong></p>
<p>My blog swissmiss became quite popular, but when I had other ideas, I’d second-guess them. I’d think, Who am I to do this thing? A real epiphany came when I was watching Jim Coudal at SXSW. As he was describing his fun side projects, including The Deck Network, Layer Tennis, and Field Notes, I realized I could put my ideas into the world, too. Seeing someone create the things they want to create can give us permission to do the same.</p>
<p>So I did it. I knew intuitively that the people you surround yourself with change what you dream about, which led me to start the coworking space Studiomates (now known as Friends Work Here). It has been magical to see what unfolds when you gather creative, kind, driven humans in a physical space. We often find ourselves in deep, engaging conversations over coffee or lunch, which in turn has led to the founding of multiple companies, magazines and conferences. We believe in each other, and we make each other brave. </p>

<p><strong>To the person who encouraged the momentum of CreativeMornings—co-founder of Mailchimp, Ben Chestnut</strong></p>
<p>After experiencing the power of my coworking community, I felt inspired to share the magic. I was in a city of eight million people, but the creative communities felt fragmented and disconnected. I knew there had to be more heart-centered, creative people looking to connect. So, I decided to invite people to the space for a free breakfast and a talk. I vividly remember being made fun of for inviting people to an event at 8:30 a.m., and assuming no one would show up. I am proud to say we had 50 attendees at the first ever CreativeMornings in October of 2008. </p>
<p>Just four months and four events later, I received an email from Ben Chestnut, co-founder of Mailchimp, saying he and his team were big fans and he wondered if they could sponsor future events. I had never dealt with sponsors before and clumsily invited them to pay for breakfast, which turned into the most supportive and encouraging 15-year corporate partnership and friendship.</p>
<p>Mailchimp consistently reminded us to focus on what we do best: serving and growing our community. Having more people say, “We just want to make sure you can do your magic,” is what the world needs.</p>

<p><strong>To the person who helped CreativeMornings think bigger and bolder—Ruth Ann Harnisch</strong></p>
<p>When I first met Ruth Ann, a former journalist and the visionary philanthropist leading the Harnisch Foundation, she told me she believed in CreativeMornings’ potential to change the world, one friendship at a time. In an act of radical generosity, she pledged <a href="https://creativemornings.com/blog/harnisch-foundation-grant-announcement">$1 million</a> and became our first ever patron—the ultimate fan!</p>
<p>Her support isn’t just financial—it’s a reflection of her deep belief in people and their potential.</p>
<p>With her donation, we’ve been able to pilot <a href="https://creativemornings.com/clubs">Clubs</a>: intimate, community-led gatherings built around a shared passion. In just one year, NYC Clubs brought together 6,000 attendees, further propelling the CreativeMornings friendship-engine.</p>

<p><strong>To all the people who transform our lives</strong></p>
<p>Every time I meet someone with a fan state of mind, I am transformed—my limiting beliefs are challenged, and possibilities are expanded.</p>
<p>If one person can change the trajectory of my own life, imagine what entire communities can do?</p>
<p>I believe heart-centered communities can create a cultural shift towards generosity, kindness, and curiosity.</p>
<p>A central agreement for CreativeMornings is: “I believe in you, you believe in me.” We celebrate with each other. That kind of mutual uplift changes you—it helps you step into your potential and work towards a better future.</p>
<p>And that’s the power of enthusiasm. In a world that sometimes feels like it’s waiting to discourage you, we need to find and become uplifting, optimistic, heart-forward people more than ever. People who ask, “What if it turned out better than you ever imagined?”</p>
<p>This is a love letter to the people who inspire us to be bolder and braver, but also an invitation to show an unwavering belief in someone else.</p>
<p>People show us what’s possible every day—and each of us, in our own way, can be those very people. To be a fan is to open your heart, stand courageously in your enthusiasm, and help transform the world.</p>
<p>So be the eccentric Aunt Hugi to someone.</p>
<p>Share your ideas with the world to inspire others.</p>
<p>Contribute to the things you love and would miss if they were gone.</p>
<p>Believe in people. Be a fan. </p>
