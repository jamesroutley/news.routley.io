    <h1>Fauna Service Winding Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we have some significant announcements about the future of the Fauna service as well as our core technology.</p><p>Fauna’s mission has been to make working with operational data productive, scalable and secure for every software development team. Over the years Fauna built a revolutionary new document-relational database that has delighted thousands of development teams across the globe and powered the businesses of hundreds of paying customers.
However, after careful consideration, we have made the hard decision to sunset the Fauna service over the next several months.</p><p>Driving broad based adoption of a new operational database that runs as a service globally is very capital intensive. In the current market environment, our board and investors have determined that it is not possible to raise the capital needed to achieve that goal independently.
While we will no longer be accepting new customers, existing Fauna customers will experience no immediate change. We will gradually transition customers off Fauna and are committed to ensuring a smooth process over the next several months.  For more specifics see the FAQ below.</p><h2><span id="a-commitment-to-open-sourcing-the-fauna-technology"></span>A commitment to open sourcing the Fauna technology</h2><p>With this change we are also committing to releasing an open source version of Fauna’s core database technology alongside our existing open source drivers and CLI tooling. This ensures that Fauna&#39;s unique capabilities—our transactional features, document-relational data model, and our database language (FQL)—will be available to the community. We hope this will serve as both a valuable reference for database practitioners and will provide ongoing value to the wider developer community.</p><p>We are profoundly grateful to our customers, partners, and investors who have been integral to the Fauna journey.  We would not have accomplished what we did without your support.  We understand that this is going to be a disruptive change to many and are fully committed to working with our existing customers to help them migrate off the service over the next several months.  While this marks the end of the paid Fauna service the team looks forward to sharing the Fauna technology with the broader community.</p><p>To read more about the migration support and timelines for existing customers please follow the link below.</p><ul><li><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/eol-faq">FAQs for Fauna customers</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/eol-faq"><span><i></i></span></a></li><li><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/migrate">Migration guide</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/migrate"><span><i></i></span></a></li></ul></div></div>
