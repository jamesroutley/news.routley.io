<p>Many things happened since last May.</p>
<p>I won’t list all of them, but here are a few about the <a href="https://www.finartcialist.com">finartcialist</a> project.</p>
<section id="icad-2023">
<h2>ICAD 2023<a href="#icad-2023" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>In June 2023, I went to Sweden to present at the <a href="https://icad2023.icad.org/">International Conference for Auditory Display</a>. It was my first time playing sound art works of my own in a concert hall.</p>
<p>I had fun meeting lots of interesting people in data sonification, and experiencing the quasi-midnight sun.</p>
<p>I presented the work <a href="https://finartcialist.bandcamp.com/album/implied-weather">implied weather</a>, which sonifies weather and weather derivatives products data points, for one month, in New York City.</p>
<p>I am still struggling with how to present my work, both theoretically and practicaly. I think I am getting better at explaining why I do the things I do, and how - I still don’t quite know all the things about mixing live or recorded sound… so I want to do more public presentations, I guess? I am not sure how/when. I have ideas, but making them happen is often another story. Installation work maybe?</p>

<section id="montreal-python">
<h2>Montréal-Python<a href="#montreal-python" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>I did a <a href="https://finartcialist.com/presentation-csound-python/">presentation at Montréal-Python</a> in Fall 2023, in person. No recordings besides that transcript.</p>
<p>It’s always special going back to <a href="https://mtlpy.org/">Montréal-Python</a>, given that I’ve been attending their meetups for more than a few years now!</p>
<p>It was a good opportunity for me to sum up the ongoing work starting from the beginnings, with a few people already familiar with the work that were in the audience. My <a href="https://github.com/finartcialist/original-luminx/blob/main/EViau_Luminx_2019.pdf">first presentation there was in 2019</a>, and it was one of the first few public presentation of my finance x arts projects.</p>

<section id="notam-online">
<h2>Notam (online)<a href="#notam-online" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>I presented some of my works online, at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/960288322306683/960288335640015/">Notam</a>, at the <a href="https://notam.no/meetups/meetup-for-women-working-with-arts-and-technology/">Meetup for Artists in technology</a>. It was a good experience in public speaking.</p>
<p>I did a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQGnOzABjqDrP62DaqTjK6qa2yehzHqv4dU67qZvWBB3KNCT_nU-2hWVfJLdc53QINpYiwPI1YEXPcz/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">talk on some net.art projects</a> I did in the last few years that I never presented publicly, besides them being on my website.</p>
<p>While everything is slowly moving offline, I appreciate that there are still online meetups that allow us to network internationally without having to travel to some place, especially for more informal opportunities.</p>
<p>I presented alongside <a href="https://www.solomiyamoroz.com">Solomiya Moroz</a>, who talked about composition, gesture and technology.</p>
<p>Thanks to Notam and the hosts in making this happens!</p>

<section id="fondation-phi">
<h2>Fondation PHI<a href="#fondation-phi" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>Later in 2023, I networked a bit with the folks behind the <a href="https://bureauofnoncompetitiveresearch.com/">Bureau of Non-competitive Research</a> about their <a href="https://phi.ca/fr/evenements/bureau-rnc-installation/">residency at Fondation PHI</a> and the <a href="http://finartcialist.com/plus-longue-rencontre/">longest meeting in the world project</a> that I had first presented during a <a href="https://creerdesponts2022.artsouterrain.com/">Art souterrain residency</a>. They were kind and curious enough to help me host a session of the longest meeting, during the <a href="https://phi.ca/fr/evenements/bureau-rnc-journees-detude">Fail Pass journées d’études</a>.</p>
<p>It was a practical exercise for me to get out in the real world with a real project of my own. Through friends and their friends, and curious passerbys and participants from the FAIL/PASS journée d’étude, we were a small group in the installation space, talking about meetings, collective decision making, the feeling of emptiness, the feeling of being or not being listened to, or not being listening ourselves…</p>
<p>Thank you PHI and the Bureau for giving me this opportunity to showcase my project &lt;3</p>

<section id="wordhack">
<h2>Wordhack<a href="#wordhack" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>I did a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2lBqXdWDJnhQShMMhPJ3ArHgNEAED6FE9p8u2TFam_oPH4pxSz-cVd_56vwHpo7JY2ooMqo86onw4/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">talk on the Type and Trade and Type (or TTType) project at Wordhack</a>, similar to the one at Notam in topics and scope, but focusing on a single project from 2021… and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHv7ZhNohWo">recorded</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/finartcialist/tttype">TTType (2021)</a> is an esolang plugin that have you trade programming characters and glyphs in order for you to code in a programming language of your choice.</p>
<p>I presented alongside <a href="https://toddwords.com/">Todd Anderson</a> and <a href="https://violand.xyz/">Viola He</a>. Todd did a great performance/presentation on his work <a href="https://sfpc.study/sessions/winter-24/httpoetics">building websites and teaching about them</a>. Viola presented some stand up comedy with a <a href="http://violahaha.glitch.me/">highlight of crowd participation</a>. I was curious to hear some words said automatically by the text-to-speech used and made some of my own suggestions - Viola played gracefully around them, and the whole show was hilarious! If you can catch one, please GO :)</p>
<p>Thumbs up to <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/">Wonderville</a> for hosting the night.</p>

<section id="that-s-it">
<h2>That’s it!<a href="#that-s-it" title="Lien permanent vers cette rubrique">¶</a></h2>
<p>This sums it up for now :)</p>
<p>I have long write ups in my notes and in my head that I would like to get around with. I also have a list of never-ending projects. And… Summer is starting in this part of the world… there will be rainy days to address some of these ideas ;)</p>
<p>I’d like to do a better job at announcing things I do <em>before they happen</em>, haven’t found the right way to do this yet. Maybe a board on <a href="https://www.are.na/mercure-m/noise-and-music-in-the-financial-world">are.na</a> ? Feel more than welcome to write me an email at <em>info@eviau.net</em> if you’d like to be kept in the loop, in the future.</p>
<p>thank you for your attention and support &lt;3</p>
