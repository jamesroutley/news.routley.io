    <h1>Glass Dip Pens (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  
<p>I decided to try out a few glass dip pens as a way to easily swatch and use a lot of different inks without having to keep so many pens inked. I tried to order a Majohn N10 a few months ago but the order was cancelled. I finally got around to ordering a Majohn Starry Sky (fine) and a Majohn Blue Swirl Capped Dip Pen (medium) from Jetpens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by both pens. They write fairly smoothly. The ink load is variable but that&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to practice with. The traditional pen can hold more ink, and the F nib means you could potentially for a while without dipping.</p>
<p>I really love the look of the capped pen, and of course, the cap means it can be handled like a normal pen and is less likely to break. The point is shorter, so it holds less ink. This particular nib is uneven, one side is slightly smoother than the other.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of samples to see how well and far the pens write on a single dip. I noticed some inks definitely work better with glass than others (Diamine Writer&#39;s Blood is really wet and runs out quickly, for example). Shimmer is more evident, sheen is okay, but I think shading is showed off best with a standard nib.</p>
