<em>Soft language</em> is a phrase coined by American comedian George Carlin to describe <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/euphemism-words-term-1690680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">euphemistic</a> expressions that &#34;conceal reality&#34; and &#34;take the life out of life.&#34;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2">
&#34;Americans have trouble facing the truth,&#34; Carlin said. &#34;So they invent a kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it&#34; (<em>Parental Advisory</em>, 1990).
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">
Under Carlin&#39;s definition, euphemisms are the closest synonym to &#34;soft language&#34;, although the &#34;softness&#34; is implied to be an effect of the euphemism&#39;s usage. When a euphemism is used, its purpose is to soften the impact of something shocking, crude, ugly, embarrassing, or something along those lines. Carlin&#39;s point is that this indirect language may spare us some discomfort, but at the cost of vividness and expressiveness.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-6">
A corollary to this is jargon, which is specialized language for particular fields. On the surface, its intention is to express specialized ideas more clearly and specifically. In practice, however, jargon-heavy language tends to obscure the point rather than clarify it.

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12"> <span> Examples and Observations </span> </h2>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-13">
<li>&#34;Sometime during my life toilet paper became <em>bathroom tissue</em>. . . . Sneakers became <em>running shoes</em>. False teeth became <em>dental appliances</em>. Medicine became <em>medication</em>. Information became <em>directory assistance</em>. The dump became the <em>landfill</em>. Car crashes became <em>automobile accidents</em>. Partly cloudy became <em>partly sunny</em>. Motels became <em>motor lodges</em>. House trailers became <em>mobile homes</em>. Used cars became <em>previously owned transportation</em>. Room service became <em>guest room dining</em>. Constipation became <em>occasional irregularity</em>. . . .​&#34;<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/cia-jobs-want-to-be-a-spy-3321484" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">The CIA</a> doesn&#39;t kill anybody anymore. They <em>neutralize</em> people. Or they <em>depopulate</em> the area. The government doesn&#39;t lie. It engages in <em>misinformation</em>.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When a company is &#39;levering up,&#39; it often means, in regular language, that it is spending money it doesn’t have. When it is &#39;right-sizing&#39; or finding &#39;synergies,&#39; it may well be firing people. When it &#39;manages stakeholders,&#39; it could be lobbying or bribing. When you dial into &#39;customer care,&#39; they care very little. But when they call you, even at dinnertime, then it’s a &#39;courtesy call.&#39;&#34;</li><span></span>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-15"> <span> George Carlin on &#34;Shell Shock&#34; and &#34;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder&#34; </span> </h2>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-16">
<li>&#34;Here’s an example. There’s a condition in combat that occurs when a soldier is completely stressed out and is on the verge of a nervous collapse. In World War I <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/trenches-in-world-war-i-1779981" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">it was called &#39;shell shock.&#39;</a> Simple, honest, direct language. Two syllables. Shell shock. It almost sounds like the guns themselves. That was more than eighty years ago.</li><span></span>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18"> <span> Jules Feiffer on Being &#34;Poor&#34; and &#34;Disadvantaged&#34; </span> </h2>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-19">
<li>&#34;I used to think I was poor. Then they told me I wasn&#39;t poor, I was needy. Then they told me it was self-defeating to think of myself as needy, I was deprived. Then they told me deprived was a bad image, I was underprivileged. Then they told me underprivileged was over-used, I was disadvantaged. I still don&#39;t have a dime. But I have a great <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/vocabulary-definition-1692597" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">vocabulary</a>.&#34;</li>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-21"> <span> George Carlin on Poverty </span> </h2>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-22">
<li>&#34;Poor people used to live in slums. Now &#39;the economically disadvantaged&#39; occupy &#39;substandard housing&#39; in the &#39;inner cities.&#39; And a lot of them are broke. They don&#39;t have &#39;negative cash flow.&#39; They&#39;re broke! Because many of them were fired. In other words, management wanted to &#39;curtail redundancies in the human resources area,&#39; and so, many workers are no longer &#39;viable members of the workforce.&#39; Smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins. It&#39;s as simple as that.&#34;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-24"> <span> Soft Language in Business </span> </h2>
<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-25">
<li>&#34;It is perhaps only a sign of the times that one business appoints a new executive, a chief information officer, to &#39;monitor the life cycle of documents&#39;--that is, to take charge of the shredder.&#34;</li>

<li>&#34;Today, the real damage isn&#39;t done by the euphemisms and <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-circumlocution-1689843" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">circumlocutions</a> that we&#39;re likely to describe as Orwellian. <em>Ethnic cleansing, revenue enhancement, voluntary regulation, tree-density reduction, faith-based initiatives, extra <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/affirmative-action-overview-3528265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">affirmative action</a></em>--those terms may be oblique, but at least they wear their obliquity on their sleeves.</li>

<ul id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-31">
<li>&#34;Goatish creatures with human faces, horny-browed, lightly bearded and grey as india-rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. . . . <strong>Soft language</strong> issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling closer and closer to enclose, to enclose, soft language issuing from their lips, their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces . . ..&#34;</li>
