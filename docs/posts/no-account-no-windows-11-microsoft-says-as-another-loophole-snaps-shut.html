    <h1>No account? No Windows 11, Microsoft says as another loophole snaps shut</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft is closing a popular loophole that allowed users to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>The change has appeared in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6772-dev-channel/">recent Insider builds</a> of Windows 11, indicating it is likely to be included in the production version soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft refers to these loopholes as &#34;known mechanisms&#34; and is talking about local commands in this instance. You can learn all about these in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/set_up_windows11_local_account/">piece</a> for getting Windows 11 installed with a local account, but suffice to say <code>start ms-cxh:localonly</code> is no more.</p>

    

<p>&#34;While these mechanisms were often used to bypass Microsoft account setup, they also inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use,&#34; Microsoft said.</p>

        


        

<p>&#34;Users will need to complete OOBE with internet and a Microsoft account, to ensure [the] device is set up correctly.&#34;</p>

<p>As far as Redmond is concerned, this is all for the user&#39;s own good. It is also important to note that managed devices are not directly affected, just hardware that users want to get running with Windows 11 without having to deal with a Microsoft Account during setup.</p>
<p>The change is part of Microsoft&#39;s ongoing game of Whac-A-Mole with users trying to find ways of avoiding its online services. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/31/windows_11_insiders/">March</a>, it removed the <code>bypassnro.cmd</code> script that allowed users to get through the Windows 11 setup without needing an internet connection. That time, Microsoft said the change was to &#34;enhance security and user experience of Windows 11.&#34;</p>
<p>There remain a number of ways to avoid the Microsoft account requirement during setup, including setting up an unattended installation, but these are more complicated. It is also clear that Microsoft is determined to continue closing loopholes where it can.</p>

        

<p>It is getting increasingly difficult to use Windows 11 on an unmanaged device without a Microsoft account. Users who don&#39;t want to sign up should perhaps consider whether it&#39;s time to look at an alternative operating system instead. ®</p>
