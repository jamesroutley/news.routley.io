    <h1>The End of CI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hard to understand, but I could see a world where CI doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p>â€” Matt Rickard (@mattrickard) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrickard/status/1435620189891186691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Today, Continuous Integration (CI) is something that nearly every engineering organization does. However, I predict that in the future, nobody will do it. </p><p>CI is the process of integrating different changes from each developer into the main development branch. CI is often triggered by creating a pull request to merge a branch into main. Therein lies the problem.</p><p>First, CI rarely knows <em>what</em> has changed, so everything needs to be rebuilt and retested. We found solutions to this: recreate the dependency graph in specialized CI scripts or painstakingly use a verbose declarative build system. Unfortunately, neither is tenable for most engineering organizations.</p><p>Next, CI is a <em>post-commit </em>workflow. How often have you or a coworker pushed an empty commit to &#34;re-trigger&#34; the CI? As I wrote in <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/your-integration-tests-are-too-long/">Your Integration Tests are Too Long</a>, developers become reliant on CI and won&#39;t run the tests until merge-time. </p><blockquote><em>Workflows are shifting left. </em></blockquote><p>Continuous integration is anything <em>but continuous. </em>Changes might be integrated once a day, or more likely, once a feature is ready. Tight feedback loops are the lifeblood of engineering organizations, and developers want to integrate early and often. Running tests <em>pre-commit </em>is one answer. Yet, there are roadblocks today that need to be fixed, like tests that don&#39;t fit on your laptop.</p><p>The reason why it&#39;s so hard to see a world without CI is how blinded we&#39;ve become with version control workflows. Today, a developer would be crazy to suggest anything other than git and trunk-based development for a project. But all technology evolves, and git is already showing its weaknesses. Fork-and-pull isn&#39;t the final form of development workflows.</p><p>I predict the answer is something even more continuous than continuous integration. It might look like real-time integration of your changes, collaborative editing, or smarter build systems that produce near-live feedback. I, for one, hope that we aren&#39;t using Jenkins in 2025.</p></div></div>
