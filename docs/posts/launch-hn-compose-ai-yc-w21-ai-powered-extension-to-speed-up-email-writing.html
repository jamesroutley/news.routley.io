    <h1>Launch HN: Compose.ai (YC W21) – AI-powered extension to speed up email writing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hey HN! Michael here—founder of Compose AI (<a href="https://www.compose.ai" rel="nofollow">https://www.compose.ai</a>) (also joined by my co-founder Wilson). Compose AI is a free Chrome extension that cuts your writing time by up to 40% with AI-powered autocompletion, rephrasing, and full-length email generation. It works across ~30 websites, so besides email, you can use it to do things like write Notion documents or chat on Slack (browser only (for now)).<p>I was in Mexico typing my 10th reply to a mundane email when it hit me: people shouldn’t be typing every letter of every word — especially not the same things over and over again. That got me thinking about building a tool that helps people type faster anywhere online and ultimately save them time—something that was easier said than done. It was quite challenging to balance the speed needed for real-time predictions with the model complexity needed for high quality predictions. Also, it was surprisingly challenging to integrate with a ton of different websites – I learned that there are many, many different ways to implement a “text box,” and experienced first hand, the joys of integrating with things like shadow dom and iframes.</p><p>I have been thinking about how to communicate with computers since I was in maybe 6th grade when I would literally dream about it. I remember I had a notebook in which I tried to analyze the linguistic structure of English to teach my computer English (not a great approach in retrospect). Later on, I worked in ML and AI at IARPA, Amazon, Disney, and BCG before starting an ML consulting firm. The trends in NLP finally caught up to my dream (LLM, distillation, fine-tuning, transformers, GPUs), so working on Compose AI seemed like the next logical step.</p><p>We are working to create a more holistic, AI-first writing solution. For now, our chrome extension has autocompletion, rephrasing (shorten, lengthen, change mood), and full email/reply generation functionalities. As you’re typing, the text is streamed to our backend servers, where we have relatively large transformers models that are tuned for specific scenarios.</p><p>If you need help with long-form content or the creative process, our web app (<a href="https://web.compose.ai" rel="nofollow">https://web.compose.ai</a>) can generate product descriptions, blog outlines, sales pitches and more. Note: our web app asks for credit card on sign-up but includes a free 7-day trial.</p><p>For our Chrome Extension, we make money using a freemium subscription model. Your data is end-to-end encrypted and encrypted at rest. We will never sell your data and will only use it to fulfill your completions or improve your results.</p><p>Here are a couple demo videos of the extension generating responses to a Hacker News email:</p><p><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/c36ec67b0a3a466aaa2ec5ee2399cb15" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/c36ec67b0a3a466aaa2ec5ee2399cb15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/44cf0f5893094d1191143b9f6fe11a5d" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/44cf0f5893094d1191143b9f6fe11a5d</a></p><p>Thanks for reading!
