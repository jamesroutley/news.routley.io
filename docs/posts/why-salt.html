    <p>The most common road and sidewalk de-icer in use today is rock salt (aka halite, aka sodium chloride). While there are more effective de-icers, NaCl’s predominance is because it’s <em>cheap</em>, which is very relevant at the scale street de-icer is used. It has two primary mechanisms of action: one, the uneven surface increases traction; and two, the freezing point of salt water is -17C (0F) rather than 0C (32F), so at temperatures between -17C and 0C, less ice actually forms.</p>

<p>Salt’s cheapness is extra funny from a historical perspective. Salt was an essential trade good whose importance is clear from the salt mines of Salzburg (literally, “salt castle”) to the Classical Latin noun <em>salarium</em> (literally, “saltiness”), the ancestor of English <em>salary</em>. It’s not just that you will literally die if you don’t eat enough salt; it’s also an important way to preserve food in the millennia before refrigeration.</p>

<p>Salt deficiency’s mechanism of action of causing death turns out to be the same as what you die from if you drink too much water, <em>hyponatremia</em>. Water is the substance with the highest known LD50: an average person has a 50% chance of dying after drinking about 7 liters (2 gallons) of water in one sitting. The least deadly substance known to man is somehow still the cause of most deaths by drowning.</p>
