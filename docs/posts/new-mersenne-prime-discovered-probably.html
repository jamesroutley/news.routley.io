      <span>October 13, 2024</span> — Yesterday, a participating GIMPS computer reported a successful Fermat probable prime
      test to the server!  A proof of work was uploaded and certified.  This certification proves there were no calculation errors during the probable
      prime test.  Several Lucas-Lehmer tests are underway to definitively prove the number prime.  These tests will be run using several
      different programs and on different hardware.  Soon after the result is officially confirmed an announcement will be made
      with all the details.  Assuming the result holds, this new prime will be GIMPS first new prime in nearly six years.

      <h2><center>Prime95 version 30.19 released</center></h2>

	  <p>Version <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download">30.19 is now available</a>.  ECM stage 2 is now much faster if you can give prime95 lots of memory to use.
	  This is similar to the improvements to P-1 stage 2 in version 30.8.  There are other minor bug fixes and tweaks.  This is not a required upgrade -- version 30.3 and
	  later can be used to hunt for new Mersenne primes.  Should you decide to upgrade, if any workers are currently in ECM or P-1 stage 2 wait for ECM or P-1 to finish before upgrading.
	  If you have any upgrade questions, ask in  <a href="https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=27905">this thread</a> at Mersenne Forum.

Now, thanks to the largely unheralded and dedicated efforts

      <h2><center>First-time Lucas-Lehmer Testing Ends</center></h2>

	  <p>One year ago, first-time PRP primality testing with proofs was introduced.  It has been a huge success, saving GIMPS tens of
	  thousands future double-checks.  Going forward, the server will no longer make available exponents for first time Lucas-Lehmer tests.
	  Users that have not yet upgraded to <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">prime95 version 30.3</a> or
	  <a href="https://www.mersenneforum.org/forumdisplay.php?f=171">gpuowl for GPUs</a> should do so.  Failure to upgrade
	  will result in unnecessary double-check work.  GIMPS has a multi-year backlog of double-checks to work through.  There is even a chance that
	  a new Mersenne prime is hidden in all those double-checks.
	  </p>
	  <p>The server will continue to accept Lucas-Lehmer results.  There is no need to worry about any LL tests that are currently underway.

      <h2><center>BIG Changes Are Here!  Prime95 version 30.3 released.</center></h2>

	  <p>For almost 25 years, GIMPS has looked for new Mersenne primes by running a primality test on one computer and later
	  running the exact same primality test on another computer to guard against hardware errors having corrupted the first primality test.
	  </p>

	  <p>A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf">breakthrough by Krzysztof Pietrzak</a> makes it possible to eliminate the
	  second primality test!  The first primality test produces a proof file that can be securely verified with less than 0.5% of
	  the work required to re-run the primality test.  This breakthrough will nearly double GIMPS&#39; throughput in the long run.
	  </p>

	  <p>Version <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download">30.3 is now available</a> with PRP proofs.  While not a required upgrade, at some point in the
	  future only users running version 30.3 with PRP proofs will be assigned first-time primality tests.  Should you run into any problems,
	  support is available at this <a href="https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=25823">thread at Mersenne Forum</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>Many thanks to Mihai Preda for discovering the paper on the breakthrough and realizing its importance to the GIMPS project.
	  Also, thanks go to Pavel Atnashev for important ideas on adapting the discovery for use by GIMPS.

      <h2><center>51st Known Mersenne Prime Found!</center></h2>
      <p><span>December 21, 2018</span> —
      The <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a> has discovered the
      largest known prime number, <span>2<sup><span>82</span><span>589</span><span>933</span></sup>-1</span>, having
      <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/primes/digits/M82589933.zip"><span>24</span><span>862</span><span>048</span>      digits</a>.  A computer volunteered by Patrick Laroche from Ocala, Florida made the find on
      December 7, 2018.  The new prime number, also known as <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/M82589933">M(<span>82</span><span>589</span><span>933</span>)</a>, is calculated by multiplying
      together <span>82</span><span>589</span><span>933</span> twos and then subtracting one. It is more than one and a half million digits larger than
      the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/primes/?press=M77232917">previous record prime number</a>.
      </p>

      <p>GIMPS has been on amazing lucky streak finding triple the expected number of new Mersenne primes -- a dozen
      in the last fifteen years.  This prime was even luckier for Patrick Laroche, striking pay dirt on just his fourth try.
      For years, Patrick had used GIMPS software as a free &#34;stress test&#34; for his computer builds.  Less than four months ago
      he started prime hunting on his media server to give back to the project.  By way of comparison, some GIMPS participants
        have searched for more than 20 years with tens of thousands of attempts but no success.  This proves that, with luck,
      anyone can find the next new Mersenne prime.
      </p>

      <p>The new prime is only the 51st known Mersenne prime ever discovered.  Mersenne primes were named for the French monk
      <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mersenne/">Marin Mersenne</a>,
      who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago.  GIMPS, founded in 1996, has discovered
      the last 17 Mersenne primes.
      Volunteers <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">download a free program</a> to search for these primes, with a cash
      award offered to anyone lucky enough to find a new prime.
      Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an authoritative web site on
      <a href="https://www.utm.edu/research/primes/largest.html">the largest known primes</a>,
      and has an excellent <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html">history of Mersenne primes</a>.
      </p>

      <p>  Patrick is one of thousands of volunteers using
      free GIMPS software available at <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">www.mersenne.org/download/</a>.
      Credit for this prime goes not only to Patrick Laroche for
      running the Prime95 software, Woltman for writing the software, Blosser for keeping the
      Primenet server running smoothly, and the thousands of GIMPS volunteers that sifted through millions of non-prime candidates. 
      In recognition of all the above people, official credit for this discovery goes
      to &#34;P. Laroche, G. Woltman, A. Blosser, et al.&#34;

      <h3>What are Mersenne primes and why do we search for them?</h3>
      <p>Prime numbers have long fascinated amateur and
      professional mathematicians. An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only
      divisors are one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. For example, the
      number 10 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime is a prime of the
      form 2<sup>P</sup>-1. The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127 (corresponding to P = 2, 3, 5,
      7). There are only 51 known Mersenne primes.
      </p>
      <p>GIMPS, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search,
      was formed in January 1996 to discover new world-record-size Mersenne primes. GIMPS harnesses the
      power of thousands of small computers like yours to search for these &#34;needles in a
      haystack&#34;.
      </p>
      <p>Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill
      of possibly discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new Mersenne prime. Of course, there
      are <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/why_join/">many other reasons</a>.
