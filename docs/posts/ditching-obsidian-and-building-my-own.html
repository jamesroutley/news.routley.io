    <h1>Ditching Obsidian and building my own</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote><p>&#34;You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.&#34; - Maya Angelou. </p></blockquote><p>The age-old mission to capture and make sense of our knowledge and experiences echoes through history, from Thomas Jefferson&#39;s Commonplace book detailing his ideas on government to Marcus Aurelius&#39;s Meditations saturated with quotations and personal reflections.</p><p>However, this pursuit to preserve knowledge isn&#39;t without its own set of fears. Are our deepest thoughts private? Are we spending a disproportionate time customizing our notes system than benefiting from it? Will our preferred notes system last the sands of time? </p><p>These were the questions that motivated me to step outside conventional offerings and build my own solution. I&#39;m sharing my story here not to prescribe, but to demonstrate it&#39;s okay to color outside the lines. Perhaps my journey to create a simple, secure, and lasting &#39;note vault&#39; will spark ideas for how you can better cultivate your own knowledge garden.</p><h2 id="conventional-knowledge-gardens"><span>Conventional<!-- --> </span><span>knowledge<!-- --> </span><span>gardens<!-- --> </span></h2><p>A personal knowledge management systems (PKMS), also known as &#34;second brain&#34; is are central repositories for actively collecting one&#39;s meaningful insights, ideas and inspirations encountered throughout life. The benefit of decades of notes accruing and reinforcing knowledge is immense. That is why critically analyzing what you need your PKMS to achieve is crucial. </p><p>The most commonly used PKMS or note-taking apps today are Notion, Obsidian, Evernote and Logseq. The problem is that PKMS come and go. Could you see yourself using your note-taking app you use today in 30 years? Probably not. Do you ever have concerns around the privacy of your notes? Are you spending more time setting up your notes system rather than managing your notes? What does an effective and timeless PKMS even look like?</p><h2 id="pulling-at-a-thread"><span>Pulling<!-- --> </span><span>at<!-- --> </span><span>a<!-- --> </span><span>thread<!-- --> </span></h2><p>My PKMS journey started with Obsidian. For those unfamiliar with Obsidian, it&#39;s a digital notebook that lives only on your computer. Its special feature is letting you internally link related notes together similar to Wikipedia. Beyond linking, its true power comes from the huge range of plugins. Out of all the great community plugins, Dataview is my personal favorite. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/">Dataview</a> is a powerful scripting tool which pulls data from markdown notes to generate tables, graphs, and other insights.</p><p>Obsidian was a great tool for me personally for a long time. But I felt frustrated when I wanted to access my notes on my phone while on-the-go and saw that I had to pay for this feature. Obsidian charges $8 a month to access the same notes across multiple devices. While not a huge amount for such a useful app, it adds up to an eye-watering amount - almost $1,000 if I planned to use Obsidian for a decade. I was surprised at this fee because I thought Obsidian was open-source. I later realized that the Obsidian community plugins are open-source, but Obsidian itself is, in fact, not. These were the same plugins I was spending an inordinate abount of time <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-blu/obsidian_dataview_example_vault/blob/b6740b4d8a7e0b408669563e1b3c4028df36e207/20%20Dataview%20Queries/Show%20a%20Goals%20Overview%20with%20progress%20bars%20for%20included%20projects%20and%20overall%20progress.md">personalizing Obsidian with</a>, rather than being productive.</p><p>I started to have concerns about the longevity of the plugins and app itself. Some of you may remember when Evernote aggressively limited free users to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://henry-chong.com/blog/the-downfall-of-evernote/">50 notes</a>, many users migrated their notes elsewhere. I was one of those users.</p><p>After some mental gymnastics weighing if I should continue with Obsidian, I found solace when asking myself <em>&#34;Can I see myself using this in 20 years?&#34;</em>. I couldn&#39;t. The thought of cyclically migrating notes from one PKMS to another every 5 years, as I had done from Evernote to Notion to Obsidian, made me feel tired. So I grabbed some coffee and began my search for the digital equivalent of the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault">Svalbard Global Seed Vault</a>, but for my notes.</p><h2 id="my-perfect-note-vault"><span>My<!-- --> </span><span>perfect<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>Key requirements were that my new PKMS needed to be easy to use, offer a plugin-like experience and be secure. Privacy and security were paramount. I didn&#39;t want my innermost thoughts being exposed to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23andMe_data_leak">23andMe data leak</a> scenario. Data security aside, I have a hard time trusting for-profit companies will keep their hands out of the cookie jar. I can imagine there&#39;s a killing to be made from targeted advertisements online using your notes or for them to be used to train AI. I wanted to know with certainty that I control my data. Entrusting a company to store my notes for free, couldn&#39;t give me that assurance.</p><p>Being a full-stack software engineer, the answer was obvious. I should step outside the commercial-PKM ecosystem entirely - I should build my own.</p><p>But if it&#39;s so obvious, why aren&#39;t other developers rolling out their own PKMS? Perhaps I&#39;m the first to discover this or perhaps developers aren&#39;t writing about their custom PKMS. My guess is that commercial note-taking apps have larger, more vocal communities that drown out the murmurings of other DIY solutions.</p><p>It was here I decided to pull the trigger to build and host my own PKMS. It felt pertinent to write about it so others feel confident to do so too. Spoiler - it sounds like a daunting feat, but in reality it was so comically easy my only regret is that I hadn&#39;t done it years ago.</p><h2 id="the-note-vault"><span>The<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>Here&#39;s how my PKMS looks as of writing. I can create a note, update it in markdown format and then preview what the note looks like in rendered markdown.</p><p><img alt="gif using the PKMS&#39;s markdown editor" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/0f1cfdfb-ed3d-450e-8701-8ef7a9f2d7a5"/></p><p>Finally, I can access my notes from my phone too, right where I left off. No monthly fees for this feature either.</p><p><img alt="Using the PKMS from my phone with a thumbs up sign" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/e12f4587-b8a5-4739-9b16-7e925037ac9b"/></p><p>Since my PKMS is hosted online to manage notes across devices, I have multiple layers of security to ensure my notes are kept private.</p><p><img alt="the PKMS&#39;s login screen with an empty form" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/c42ab6b2-4eae-4956-b886-50d70aacba70"/></p><p>And if I ever want to move to greener pastures, all my notes are stored in Markdown so I can export them with two command lines to my terminal. Here&#39;s an under-the-hood view of how my notes are stored in the database - just text! <a target="_self" rel="noreferrer" href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p><img alt="shows the markdown output from a database query" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/2847aa38-5356-4e1d-80d9-feb5e738eee2"/></p><h2 id="benefits-of-a-note-vault"><span>Benefits<!-- --> </span><span>of<!-- --> </span><span>a<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>I&#39;ve found that consistently collecting and reviewing valuable information promotes a deeper engagement with ideas. As a result, I&#39;ve noticed my memory improving, and I started seeing surprising links between seemingly unrelated topics. Plus, it&#39;s created this incredible record of my learning and personal growth.</p><p>I found Ryan Holiday&#39;s take on the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">Commonplace Book</a> particularly insightful for efficiently using a PKM. While Ryan advocates for analog notes, the same principles can be applied to digital notes. While physical writing has its merits, digital notes provide superior search capabilities and flexible organization. Ryan himself states how impracticability of a physical PKMS - &#34;Because mine is a physical box with literally thousands of cards, I don’t carry the whole thing with me&#34;. </p><p><img alt="Illustration featuring a system for filing notes" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/85ba3989-f61c-4f4f-8764-b1f8c267cbaa"/></p><p><small><center>Image sourced from Houghton Library, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</center></small></p></div></div></div>
