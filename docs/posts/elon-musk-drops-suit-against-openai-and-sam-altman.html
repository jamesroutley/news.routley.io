    <h1>Elon Musk drops suit against OpenAI and Sam Altman</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-5-2"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107399197" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>In this photo illustration, the logo of &#39;OpenAI&#39; is displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of a computer screen displaying the photographs of Elon Musk and Sam Altman in Ankara, Turkiye on March 14, 2024.</p><p>Muhammed Selim Korkutata | Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div><p>Elon Musk on Tuesday withdrew his lawsuit against OpenAI and two of the company&#39;s co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, in California state court. Musk&#39;s decision to file to dismiss the suit came just one day after he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-openai-deal.html">publicly criticized OpenAI</a> and its new partnership with Apple.</p><p>The case was dismissed without prejudice, according to a court filing obtained by CNBC.</p><p>In February, Musk had filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, Altman and Brockman — the current CEO and president of OpenAI, respectively — for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.</p><p>A hearing was scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco, in which the judge was going to consider whether the case should be dismissed as requested by the defendants.</p><p>Experts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/read-the-complaint-in-elon-musk-v-sam-altman-greg-brockman-openai.html">told CNBC in March</a> that the case was built on a questionable legal foundation, because the contract at the heart of the suit was not a formal written agreement that was signed by all parties involved.</p><p>Rather, Musk had alleged that the early OpenAI team had set out to develop <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/read-the-complaint-in-elon-musk-v-sam-altman-greg-brockman-openai.html">artificial general intelligence</a>, or AGI, &#34;for the benefit of humanity,&#34; but that the project has been transformed into a for-profit entity that&#39;s largely controlled by principal shareholder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Musk had used much of the 35-page complaint (plus attached exhibits) he filed in March to remind the world of his position in the creation of a company that&#39;s since become one of the hottest startups on the planet, (OpenAI ranked first on CNBC&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/openai-disruptor-50.html">Disruptor 50 list</a> in 2023) thanks largely to the viral spread of ChatGPT.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s certainly a good advertisement for the benefit of Elon Musk,&#34; Kevin O&#39;Brien, partner at Ford O&#39;Brien Landy LLP and former assistant U.S. attorney, told CNBC at the time. &#34;I&#39;m not sure about the legal part though.&#34;</p><p>Last year, Musk debuted his own AI startup and OpenAI competitor, xAI, which last month <a href="https://x.ai/blog/series-b" target="_blank">announced</a> a $6 billion Series B funding round. Investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company. </p><p>X.AI seeks to &#34;understand the true nature of the universe,&#34; according to its website. Last year, X.AI released a chatbot called Grok, which the company says is modeled after &#34;The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy.&#34; The chatbot debuted with two months of training and has real-time knowledge of the internet, the company claims.</p><p>Representatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>—<em>CNBC&#39;s Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>Correction: The lawsuit was filed in February. An earlier version of this story misstated the month.</em></p></div></div></div>
