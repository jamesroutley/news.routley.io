about 47% decline in the number of apps on Google Play Store.</p><p>As a hobby Android developer, who has been developing

for the last five years,
I thought I would share my experience of maintaining an Android app.
And why this reduction in the number of apps is not surprising to me.</p><p>I have
<a href="https://ashishb.net/programming/how-to-deploy-side-projects-as-web-services-for-free/">several side-projects</a>
that run on a
<a href="https://ashishb.net/tech/server-vs-mobile-development-where-code-runs-matter/">backend server</a>
with a limited web UI, and it is much less effort to maintain them.</p><p>However, maintaining an Android app as a side-project is a more involved affair.
And here are some of the problems I have faced.</p><h2 id="java-vs-kotlin">Java vs Kotlin</h2><p>Kotlin is clearly the preferred language of development if you are starting a new Android project in 2025.
But what if you are maintaining a hobby project written in Java?
You will start seeing incompatibility when your dependencies are re-written in Kotlin.</p><ul><li>If you depend on a library that uses
<a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser/issues/160?utm_source=https://ashishb.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog" rel="nofollow noopener">Kotlin’s coroutines</a>
or relies on Kotlin’s

,
then you will have to work around it, or rewrite your app in Kotlin as well!</li><li>Jetpack Compose, an official Google UI library for Android is

from Java.</li><li>I would imagine that if you started with Kotlin first then a big chunk of StackOverflow questions written for
Java audiences require you translate them to corresponding Kotlin code as well</li></ul><p>To their credit, Android documentation still gives code samples in both Java and Kotlin.</p><h2 id="google-makes-breaking-changes-to-its-libraries">Google makes breaking changes to its libraries</h2><p>Google has a habit of making breaking changes to its Android libraries.
Here’s a list of some of the libraries that I have used in my app and the issues I have faced.</p><h3 id="media-3">Media 3</h3><p>Android ships with

But migrating from one version of Material Design to another is not trivial either.

was good to get app ratings, and then it was abandoned.</p><p>I don’t blame the maintainers here.
If you use an open-source library, you have to be prepared for the fact that it may not be maintained.
I am just pointing out, how some of the obvious boilerplate tasks that one requires for building an Android app
are suddenly in a limbo.</p><h2 id="two-different-versioning-schemes-for-everything">Two different versioning schemes for everything</h2><p>Android has two
<a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platforms?utm_source=https://ashishb.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog" rel="nofollow noopener">versioning schemes</a>
,
Android API version is for developers and Android version for marketing.</p><p>For example, Android 11 is API 30, Android 12 is API 31 as well as 32(!), Android 13 is API 33, Android 14 is API 34.
The developer documents would reference one scheme or the other or sometimes both!
And you are supposed to memorize the mappings while trying to debug issues using GitHub issues or StackOverflow.
It just adds unnecessary friction and confusion.</p><h2 id="forced-upgrades">Forced upgrades</h2><p>There are multiple versions in an Android app, all tightly coupled with each other.</p><ul><li><code>minSdkVersion</code> and <code>targetSdkVersion</code> of the app</li><li>Java <code>sourceCompatibility</code> and <code>targetCompatibility</code></li><li>version of dependencies</li><li>version of Android build tool chain</li><li>version of Gradle</li><li>version of Android Studio</li></ul><p>You might think that all updates are optional, but they aren’t</p><ul><li>Gradle and Android Studio must be upgraded together for

So, if you are planning to build an Android app as a hobby, keep the ongoing maintenance cost in mind.</p></div></div>
