    <h1>Time Station Emulator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> turns almost any phone or tablet into a low-frequency
radio transmitter broadcasting a time signal that can synchronize most
radio-controlled (“atomic”) clocks and watches.</p>
<p dir="auto">Real time signal broadcasts are limited in geographic range and notoriously
prone to interference in urban areas, so many such clocks end up never actually
using their self-setting functionality. <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> may allow
setting such clocks when/where a suitable signal is not otherwise available.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Compatible with most radio-controlled clocks</strong>: Emulates the five
operational radio time signal stations
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPC_(time_signal)" rel="nofollow">🇨🇳 BPC</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77" rel="nofollow">🇩🇪 DCF77</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJY" rel="nofollow">🇯🇵 JJY</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_from_NPL_(MSF)" rel="nofollow">🇬🇧 MSF</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB" rel="nofollow">🇺🇸 WWVB</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Network time</strong>: Derives the current time from the network using an NTP-like
algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Location-agnostic</strong>: Supports applying an offset to the transmitted time of
±24 hours from the present.</li>
<li><strong>BST/CEST/DST-aware</strong>: Transmits daylight saving time information for DCF77,
MSF, and WWVB.</li>
<li><strong>Leap second-aware</strong>: Transmits a DUT1 offset for MSF and WWVB.</li>
<li><strong>Client-side, browser-based</strong>: Runs entirely in the browser; no
installation, no signup, no data collection.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The hard requirements of note are browser WebAssembly support and DAC support
for ≥44.1 KHz PCM. Almost any device running a browser from ≥2019 should
work.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, as of early 2024, <strong>Safari on iOS</strong> and <strong>Firefox on Android</strong> have
multiple breaking issues and <strong>will not work</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For other devices, <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> works best with a
<strong>built-in speaker</strong> of a <strong>phone or tablet</strong>. See
<a href="#technical-details">Technical Details</a> for an explanation.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose emulator settings.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The most important setting is which time station to emulate. Certain settings
are only available for certain stations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Clocks (or watches) that support more than one station may prefer one of them
over the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose any clock settings and place the clock into sync mode.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">If your clock has them, try to choose station and/or time zone settings that
make sense for your location.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most clocks provide a way to force a synchronization attempt. You will
probably have to navigate menus and/or press physical buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Position the speaker as close as possible to the clock’s antenna.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The transmission range is quite short, so positioning is crucial. Some
experimentation will probably be required, especially if you’re unsure where
the antenna is.</p>
<p dir="auto">The volume should be set so that the clock picks up the cleanest signal.
Usually, this occurs at or near the maximum possible volume.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> generates an audio waveform intentionally crafted to
create, when played back through consumer-grade audio hardware, the right kind
of RF noise to be mistaken for a time station broadcast.</p>
<p dir="auto">Specifically, given a fundamental carrier frequency used by a real time station,
it generates and modulates the highest odd-numbered subharmonic that also falls
below the Nyquist frequencies of common playback sample rates.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the higher-frequency harmonics inevitably created by any real-world DAC
during playback will then be the original fundamental, which should leak to the
environment as a short-range radio transmission via the ad-hoc antenna formed by
the physical wires and circuit traces in the audio output path.</p>
