    <h1>Japan&#39;s Comfort Food: The Onigiri</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Walk into any Japanese convenience store and you will <em>always</em> find a shelf dedicated to one item: <em>onigiri.</em></p><p>The <em>onigiri</em>, often translated as “rice ball”, literally means “grasping a fistful” and is in many ways Japan&#39;s original fast food, before fast food. Quick to make, quick to eat, easy on the wallet, reminds you of home, and unreasonably delicious!</p><h2 id="what-is-an-onigiri">What is an <em>Onigiri</em>?</h2><p>The simplest <em>onigiri</em> has just two ingredients: rice, and salt. Cook the rice, salt it, and gently press ~100g of the fluffed rice into a triangular shape. Really, that is all there is to it.</p><p>To impart an interesting taste, one could also wrap the <em>onigiri</em> in a sheet of <em>nori</em> (dried seaweed). The <em>nori</em> gives it a crunch and brings contrasting flavors that complement the rice.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGTpt7xI1oo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="セブン-イレブン 新・手巻きおにぎり テレビCM（2003年1月）"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>A simple </span><i><em>onigiri</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><p>O<em>nigiri</em>s can also have fillings. Traditional fillings include pickled plum, bonito, and seasoned seaweed.</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/51712161377_4b9f2885ac_h-1-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="823" height="1006" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/51712161377_4b9f2885ac_h-1-1.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/51712161377_4b9f2885ac_h-1-1.jpg 823w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><i><em>Onigiri</em></i><span> with sea urchin filling </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://flic.kr/p/2mMCkXg?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><i><em>Hideya HAMANO</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you also have the mixed-into-the-rice <em>onigiri</em>s, where a variety of ingredients are cooked with the rice.</p><p>Making <em>onigiri</em>s has lots of parallels with making eggs: simple to make but devilishly complex to master.</p><p>People can be <em>veeeryyy</em> specific about “The Right Way ™” to eat an <em>onigiri. </em>Some people think <em>onigiri</em> is best eaten cold, while others disagree vehemently. Personally though, the feeling of opening your warm <em>onigiri</em> and seeing the aroma waft out ... <em>chef&#39;s kiss</em></p><h2 id="a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-the-onigiri"><strong>A (Brief and Incomplete) History of the Onigiri</strong></h2><p>Archeologists have unearthed <em>onigiri</em>-like foods from ruins that date to about 2,000 years ago.</p><p>Today’s <em>onigiri, </em>though, really rose from post-war Japan’s economic miracle.</p><p>When talking about WW2 and Japan, most people remember the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. What often remains in the shadows is the large-scale carpet bombing that Allied forces undertook over large parts of Japan. These raids flattened whole <em>cities</em> overnight.</p><p>After Japan surrendered, rebuilding the nation required every adult  (and often children) to work to the bone. And they did. This is where the roots of Japanese workaholism started.</p><p>To support this increasingly busy population, supermarkets started stocking convenient and familiar foods. <em>Onigiri</em> was first sold at supermarkets in 1952.</p><p>This is interesting because <em>onigiri</em> was never a food that you bought or ate outside. It was something you made at home and packed into a lunch box.</p><h2 id="konbini-and-onigiri">Konbini and Onigiri</h2><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/8822182618_c2405ead36_k.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/8822182618_c2405ead36_k.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/8822182618_c2405ead36_k.jpg 1000w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/8822182618_c2405ead36_k.jpg 1600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/8822182618_c2405ead36_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>The </span><i><em>onigiri</em></i><span> shelf at a convenience store never disappoints </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://flic.kr/p/erzZwS?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer" title="Go to Nullumayulife’s photostream"><i><em>Nullumayulife</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>The meteoric rise of the <em>onigiri</em> is inextricably tied to the story of convenience stores in Japan. (Psst: We wrote about those <a href="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/combini-part-1/"><u>here</u></a>)</p><p><em>Konbini</em> (Japanese for convenience store), which were open 24x7 wanted to provide their customers with familiar, fresh, and healthy food at a price that made sense.</p><p>They focused on lunch boxes (<em>bento</em>) and <em>onigiri</em>.</p><p>7-Eleven was one of the first convenience stores to stock <em>onigiri, </em>starting with traditional flavors like pickled plum, <em>mentaiko</em> (spicy cod roe) and kelp. Competitors were quick to recognize the demand and flocked in. Soon every convenience store chain had their own brand of <em>onigiri.</em></p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9tjLdX-xY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="懐かしいCM　セブンイレブン　「おにぎり」"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>1980s 7-Eleven commercial for </span><i><em>onigiri</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><p>Each chain was competing on freshness, taste, variety, well-stockedness, and most importantly, the <em>nori</em>. This competition heated up so much that at one point newspapers started calling these “The <em>Onigiri</em> Wars”.</p><h2 id="rice-seaweed-and-whole-lot-of-engineering"><strong>Rice, Seaweed, and Whole Lot of Engineering</strong></h2><p>The story of the <em>onigiri</em>’s rise to stardom is also the story of Japan’s engineering prowess.</p><p>See, <em>onigiri</em> in its most basic form could just be a ball of rice wrapped in <em>nori,</em> in a cling wrap. But then the <em>nori</em> would be stuck to the rice and would be soggy by the time the customer bought it. Many people didn’t like this.</p><p>There is a long-running rivalry between the east and west of Japan. Kansai (west) includes cities like Kyoto and Osaka, and Kantou (east) includes Tokyo and Yokohama.</p><p>For reasons the author doesn’t understand well, the people of Kansai and Kantou pride themselves on these differences. Hell, even electricity is different between these two regions (one runs at 50Hz, while the other is at 60Hz).</p><p>The people of Kansai and Kantou prefer their <em>nori</em> differently as well. One side likes them soggy, while the other likes them crisp.</p><p>You will not believe just how much money has gone into solving the engineering problem of “I want my <em>nori</em> to be crisp but I also want the rice to be moist and fluffy”. </p><h4 id="the-separate-method">The &#34;Separate Method&#34;</h4><p>The first <em>onigiri</em>s on the market used the “Separate Method”, where the <em>onigiri</em> was wrapped in a double walled pack. The double walled pack contained a sheet of <em>nori</em>. Customers would open the <em>nori</em> and then wrap it around the <em>onigiri</em>. It worked, but many hated how clumsy it was.</p><h4 id="the-parachute">The Parachute</h4><p>In the early 80s, Shinobu foods, a company from Osaka, came up with a brilliant invention called the “Parachute Method”, where the <em>nori</em> and <em>onigiri</em> were separated by a umm.. rip cord. One pull from the top gave you a soft <em>onigiri</em> wrapped in fresh <em>nori</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-ZpuxF-rxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="【懐かCM】志乃ぶ寿司 / ひっぱるだけのおにぎりQ（1985年）"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Watch the parachute in action in this 1985 commercial</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>However, because they had to use oil to make the parachute pull out smoothly, the <em>onigiri</em> tasted different and people were displeased.</p><h4 id="the-cut-tape-method">The &#34;Cut Tape Method&#34;</h4><p>The next iteration came from 7-Eleven, called the “Cut Tape Method”, where customers simply had to tear a tape running vertically through the packaging. This didn’t use any oil and forms the basis for today’s <em>onigiri</em> packaging.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kObjapyDYD8?start=62&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="1980年代セブンイレブンCM"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>1:02 - 1:17 showing the Cut Tape Method in action</span></p></figcaption></figure><h4 id="the-cut-tape-wave-method">The &#34;Cut Tape Wave Method&#34;</h4><p>Not to rest on their laurels, 7-Eleven engineered the pack to make it even easier to tear and landed with the “Cut Tape Wave Method”, where the packaging tears apart further, making it easier to open:</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/20140518_1_8.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="320" height="180"/><figcaption><span>&#34;Cut Tape&#34; vs. &#34;Cut Tape Wave&#34; </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://www.tbs.co.jp/gacchiri/img/archives/2014/20140518_1_8.jpg?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io"><i><em>TBS</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>After 50 years of innovation, this is where Japan has landed:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7RXtvQbXKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="【必見】絶対に手が汚れないコンビニおにぎりの開け方。“How to open the correct convenience store rice balls.”"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The high-tech, elegant way of opening an </span><i><em>onigiri</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="always-new-and-yet-the-same">Always New and Yet the Same</h2><p>The <em>onigiri</em> is a versatile, low-maintenance food.

Every year new flavors are introduced, and companies try new combinations of rices, ingredients, and preparation methods. And yet, every year it still feels like the same, familiar <em>onigiri</em> from years ago. That is an enduring testament to this wonderful food!</p><hr/>
