    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, famous VC Jason Lemkin passed on a startup because the deck was dated from 2 months ago, which he saw as a negative signal.</p>
<p>Of course, people on Twitter and Linkedin got riled up.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why (a) Jason did nothing wrong, and (b) most founders have the wrong expectations when it comes to VC relationships.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the full tweet that caused the outrage:</p>

<p>So, Jason opens a cold email. The deal seems decent, but not that exciting. Then, he notices that the date on the cover is outdated. Small detail? Yes, but also a red flag that tips the scale. Jason passes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you just got introduced to the VC &#34;game of inches&#34;.</p>
<h2 id="signaling-and-red-flags-vcs-play-a-game-of-inches">Signaling and red flags: VCs play a game of inches</h2>
<p>Founders may be horrified, but look at the investor&#39;s point of view.</p>
<p>A VC receives 10 to 50 decks per week. Out of those, 10% are hot: think OpenAI. These deals don&#39;t even need a deck to raise. They thrive on FOMO, it&#39;s a <a href="https://www.openvc.app/blog/pool-party" target="_blank">pool party</a>. VCs fight for allocation on those cap tables.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the rest.</p>
<p>The bottom 90%. The normal founders. You and I.</p>
<p>For these ones, it&#39;s an elimination process: kill as many decks as fast as possible. Whatever remains gets a second look.</p>
<p>
    <b>This is where &#34;red flags&#34; come into play. Because VCs have zero context on a cold email, they rely on micro-signals:</b>
</p>
<figure>
    <ul>
        <li>&#34;Market size is $200Tn&#34; -&gt; Founder is naive or delusional</li>
        <li>Lots of text written small -&gt; Founder has low empathy, poor marketing skills</li>
        <li>The deck is outdated¬† -&gt; Founder has low attention to details</li>
        <li>Etc etc.</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<p>(By the way, the OpenVC pitch deck tutorial explicitly says to never include the date on your cover. If you haven&#39;t read it, it&#39;s free and available to all founders <a href="https://openvc.app/blog/startup-pitch-deck" target="_blank">here</a> ).</p>

<p>If you listen to VCs, they are your friends.</p>
<p>&#34;We want to be the first check in.&#34; &#34;We add value&#34; &#39;We are responsible investors&#34;. &#34;We&#39;re in for the long run&#34;. &#34;We back outliers&#34; and the oh-so-famous &#34;Let me know how I can be helpful&#34;.</p>
<p>That&#39;s normal, that&#39;s part of their brand building.</p>

<p>VCs want to see as many deals as possible. Even if they barely open your deck, they want to increase their &#34;coverage rate&#34; and report a growing top of funnel to their LPs.</p>
<p>
    <b>Founders however, especially first-time founders, rarely get that nuance. They want to believe that there&#39;s a bunch of nice people who will support their journey with advice, cheers, and yes, money.</b>
</p>
<p>This is partly true. Most VCs I&#39;ve met - and I&#39;ve met 100+ at this point - are good human beings and diligent professionals.</p>
<p>But they remain money allocators. Don&#39;t be fooled by the Allbirds, the fleece vest, and the Twitter threads. VCs are investors. They manage millions of dollars, report to their own investors (the LPs) and if they don&#39;t deliver the expected returns, they won&#39;t raise their next fund.</p>
<p>As much as they want to be your friends, the fund comes first (as it should).</p>

<h2 id="jason-did-nothing-wrong">Jason did nothing wrong?</h2>
<p>This brings us back to Jason Lemkin&#39;s post.</p>
<p>I actually believe Jason&#39;s post to be sincere and helpful.</p>
<p>For one thing, he is one the few who actually opens cold emails, replies to them, and invests in them. He famously funded Algolia, Pipedrive, Salesloft, and Talkdesk on a cold email.</p>
<p>
    <b>He also openly shares his decision-making process, which is rare and valuable. Think about it: investment bankers and experienced founders know better than sending an outdated deck. Now, outsiders know about this, too.</b>
</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I believe Jason did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>He just gave founders a sense of how ruthless and biased the selection process can be. A few founders got offended, but many more learnt from it and adjusted their decks accordingly.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#39;s a net positive.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-right-distance-with-vcs">Find the right distance with VCs</h2>
<p>I work with first-time founders on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed a typical emotional journey from excitement (pre-raise) to frustration (1-2 months into the raise) to downright anger (3+ months) when they realize VCs don&#39;t open their decks, don&#39;t reply to their emails, and don&#39;t provide <a href="https://openvc.app/blog/investors-honest-feedback" target="_blank">any feedback</a>.</p>
<p>I believe this is due to wrong expectations.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve never dealt with professional investors, this is something you have to learn.</p>
<p>
    <b>VCs aren&#39;t your teachers nor your managers. They don&#39;t have an obligation to provide feedback or even to reply to your emails. They won&#39;t give you a second chance. They won&#39;t coach you so you can do better next time.</b>

<p>Instead, think of a VC as a sales prospect.</p>
<p>They have been pitched 10 times and are jaded. They are irrational and demanding. If you want to close that deal, you need to bring your A game, especially if you&#39;re an &#34;almost&#34; deal.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also decide that belly dancing for VCs is not your thing and go another route like bootstrapping. Perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>Simply remember: VCs are investment professionals before being a founder&#39;s best friend.</p></div></div>
