    <p>The meal <em>supper</em> is another of the many English borrowings from French where our first written evidence is from around 1300. Old French <em>soper</em>, meaning “supper”, is derived from Old French <em>sope</em>, meaning “soup”, the traditional evening meal at the time. English <em>soup</em> was also borrowed from <em>sope</em> in the same time period. It makes sense that food terms from the more prestigious language tended to stick.</p>

<p><em>Sope</em> is descended from Late Latin <em>suppa</em>, meaning “sopped bread”. I could imagine a food getting named after the thing you use to eat it. The part I found hard to believe is that Latin <em>suppa</em> is an ouroboros-like borrowing from Proto-Germanic <em>supô</em>, originally a form of “to drink”. <em>Supô</em> also has a direct English descendant that doesn’t improbably go through French: <em>soap</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe the synonym <em>dinner</em> has a less silly origin story? It’s another of those 1300s borrowings from Old French, in this case from <em>disner</em>, meaning… “lunch”. <em>Disner</em> is descended from Vulgar Latin <em>disiūnāre</em>, also meaning “lunch”, which is in turn from Late Latin dis- + iēiūnāre, which means “fast” as in time without eating. It’s from Latin “break fast”. Incredible.</p>
