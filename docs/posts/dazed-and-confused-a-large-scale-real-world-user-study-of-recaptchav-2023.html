            <span>Abstract:</span>Since about 2003, captchas have been widely used as a barrier against bots, while simultaneously annoying great multitudes of users worldwide. As their use grew, techniques to defeat or bypass captchas kept improving, while captchas themselves evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming increasingly difficult to solve for both bots and humans. Given this long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is important to investigate usability, solving performance, and user perceptions of modern captchas. In this work, we do so via a large-scale (over 3, 600 distinct users) 13-month real-world user study and post-study survey. The study, conducted at a large public university, was based on a live account creation and password recovery service with currently prevalent captcha type: reCAPTCHAv2.
