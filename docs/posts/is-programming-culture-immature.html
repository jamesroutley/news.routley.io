    <h1>Ask HN: Is Programming Culture Immature?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I enjoy all facets of using computers, including programming, and am decent at it. I like many others also enjoy the theory crafting aspect which means spending time reading/thinking about programming and technical concepts and engaging with or observing discussions and even debates.</p><p>Programming is intellectually challenging, and that seems make insiders and outsiders assume that in order to have some success as a programmer, one must be intelligent, rationale, sensible, or heaven forbid, wise.</p><p>Yet in my experience, it doesn&#39;t take a lot a long time engaging with the digital-technical community at large to realize there is often a large gap between intelligence and wisdom or even basic sensibilities. A field which has so many tools to objectively quantify their work and the result so often are debates displaying poorly concealed biases and egos.</p><p>I was visiting the Star Citizen subreddit where a user posted a readable, short, simple proof of concept to improve a longstanding inelegant UI element.</p><p>I read debates about languages and see the most reasonable of authors walking on egg shells and writing caveats like they are commas lest one misstep allows a snowballing tirade of people missing the point.</p><p>And more universally, I see people who have acquired anywhere from basic to advanced competency spit jargon of the most specific like it is poetry, in a field where learning specifics on the job is the norm (and not that difficult), it seems people cannot resist using obtuse language to virtue signal their intelligence relative to other people.</p><p>There are obviously exemplary members of the outward facing tech community; they often have great success for being the foil to what is above, but more and more I become frustrated and begin to believe that progress in digital technology is greatly hindered by the low quality background of interaction between those who use it.</p><p>I say this fully embracing that in a domain like tech where extremely complex and nuanced problems need to be solved that disagreements, sometimes passionate ones, will need to be resolved one way or another - I am not against or complaining about that fact; I am simply growing tired of what I think most reasonable people can identify as basic immaturity and the surprising and disappointing commonplace nature of it.</p><p>Do I have to issue any more caveats? I am dead certain their have been numerous and highly successful workplaces which were the anti-thesis to these complaints.</p><p>I have less experience in this space and in life than many of you - so please offer your perspectives.</p></div></td></div></div>
