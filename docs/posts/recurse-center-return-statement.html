    <h1>Recurse Center return statement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: The Recurse Center is a programming retreat based in New York City. It’s free to attend, welcomes programmers of varying ages and  experience, and is self-directed. It’s possible to attend entirely in person at the hub in downtown Brooklyn, remotely, or some combination of these. Read more <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">about RC</a>.</p>



<p><strong>My story</strong>: I first heard about the Recurse Center while listening to an episode of the <em>CodeNewbie </em>podcast. I was so impressed with RC that I wrote about it <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/cs50x-memory/">right here on this blog</a>.</p>



<p>For a while it seemed like the idea of the Recurse Center would just be a source of inspiration as I continued to study on my own. But at the end of last year, things aligned in my life and I decided to apply. I didn’t know if I was ready—I was applying as a career changer (I most recently worked in technical support) and a self-taught programmer. But I had just finished the <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/review-cs50x-introduction-to-computer-science/">CS50x</a> course which I think gave me a good foundation for further learning, as well as a complete software project that I could include in my application.</p>



<p>After submitting my written application, I had a conversational interview and a pair programming interview. My interviewers were lovely and I was thrilled to receive an invitation to attend an upcoming batch! </p>



<p><strong>My batch</strong>: I participated in the Winter 2, 2025 batch, which ran from January 6th to March 28th.</p>



<p>Here is a list of what I did during the 12 weeks of my batch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Met kind, smart, creative people</li>



<li>Participated in pair programming sessions
<ul>
<li>RC highly encourages pair programming and these sessions took many forms: building small projects with one or two other people, asking someone to give me a tour of their project’s codebase, inviting someone to work with me on one of my own projects, and working through LeetCode and similar problems in a Python study group.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Participated in RC’s Tuesday event series
<ul>
<li>I challenged myself to create and demo projects for events like Pairing Jam, Impossible Day, and Demo-Palooza!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Attended Thursday Presentations</li>



<li>Attended two <a href="https://www.recurse.com/localhost">Localhost</a> events</li>



<li>Attended the Game Dev Interest Group regularly</li>



<li>Attended the Python Skills Accelerator study group regularly</li>



<li>Attended workshops on Typst, MLOps, and vibe coding</li>



<li>Wrote RC niceties
<ul>
<li>These are a way to share written compliments or thanks to others at RC—writing them was a great way to reflect on the connections I made along the way and I was really touched by the niceties shared with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked on projects:
<ul>
<li>Mastermind (on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/mastermind">GitHub</a>) w/ Elizabeth</li>



<li>Eat the Pie (on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/eat_the_pie">GitHub</a>) w/ Kevin &amp; Shannon</li>



<li>Croissant Maker (for my first game jam) (on <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.itch.io/croissant-maker">itch.io</a>)</li>



<li>Slow Art Online (at <a href="https://slowartonline.com/">slowartonline.com</a>)</li>



<li>Conway’s Game of Life (on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/conway-game-of-life">GitHub</a>) w/ Andie</li>



<li>Skyspace Locator (started on Impossible Day) (on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/skyspace-locator">GitHub</a>)</li>



<li>Unity Essentials Final Project (on <a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/78e4f370-7e71-42c0-8bd5-61a536f337ab/unity-essentials-project">Unity Play</a>)</li>



<li>Three Paths Home (for my second game jam) (on <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.itch.io/three-paths-home">itch.io</a>)</li>



<li>Bookmark Analyzer (CS50P final project) (on <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/bookmark-analyzer">GitHub</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked through courses on Python and Unity:
<ul>
<li>CS50P—completed &amp; published a <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/review-cs50p-introduction-to-programming-with-python/">course review</a></li>



<li>Unity Essentials—completed &amp; published a <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/review-unity-essentials-in-editor-pathway/">course review</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Read a technical book
<ul>
<li>Read <em>Grokking Algorithms</em> and published a <a href="https://jcbookreviews.wordpress.com/2025/03/28/grokking-algorithms/">blog post</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Prepared for my programming job search
<ul>
<li> Attended career and resume workshops and started working with Career Services to prepare for my job search</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>One of my goals going in was to blog every day about what I was working on and learning—and I did it!  </p>

<p>I learned so much from my time at RC! One of my top goals going in was to improve my programming skills in Python and JavaScript. I ended up prioritizing Python, and I found that the combination of following a structured course to learn the fundamentals and getting advice from more experienced programmers in my batch on which tools to use and how to set up my environment worked really well, since I got to apply what I was learning on real projects and work with others all along the way. </p>



<p>I launched my first Flask app, Slow Art Online, and was very pleased to hear positive feedback from others. I also had some fun with game dev and published my first Twine game, Bitsy game, and Unity project. It was a fun challenge to learn new tools quickly and create games for the game jams we organized in the Game Dev Interest Group. And talking with people at the hub introduced me to a range of technical topics from bitwise operators to lambda calculus.</p>



<p>Besides the technical knowledge I gained, I will continue to think about RC’s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">self-directives</a> to work at the edge of your abilities, build your volitional muscles, and learn generously. These are principles that I want to apply throughout my life.</p>



<p><strong>Never graduate</strong>: One of the most wonderful things about the Recurse Center is that after completing a batch, alumni are still welcome to join events, visit the hub, and hang out online. It’s been a week since I “never graduated” and I already attended a couple of events that caught my interest and I’m looking forward to more in the future. </p>



<p>Participating in a batch at the Recurse Center was an overwhelmingly positive, supportive experience. I’m grateful that I got to have this experience, and that I pushed myself to make the most of it. If you enjoy programming and this sounds intriguing to you, you can learn more about <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">applying to RC</a>—and maybe start your own application? 🙂</p>
