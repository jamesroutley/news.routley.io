    <h1>Recurse Center Return Statement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><time datetime="2024-09-25">2024-09-25</time></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lb6p8e">I recently wrapped up a 12-week batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" rel="nofollow">Recurse
Center</a> (RC) in Brooklyn, NY, and I can safely
say that attending RC was one of the best decisions I have ever made. This
was the most creative period of my life, and the amount I learned rivaled
my time in college with the added bonus that I was able to learn what <em>I</em>
wanted to learn. I had a few bigger projects that I worked on while at RC
that I think are worth discussing.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-12m1j9a">What I worked on</h2> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-wy77k0">Poker library</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-e0bgu1">The first project I worked on was a poker library called
<a href="https://github.com/winstonrc/casino" rel="nofollow">casino</a> that is designed to perform
hand-ranking in games such as Texas hold ‘em as well as provide
a terminal-based way to play poker games. I began working on this as
a project for fun because I enjoy playing Texas hold ‘em but wanted
a better way to practice in a more realistic setting without having to bet
money. I also pursued this as an exercise in improving my Rust code as
well as shipping an actual product with real users.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z3kpal">I ended up publishing three crates related to the project that
have collected thousands of downloads. I wrote dozens of tests and feel
pretty good about my backend for hand-ranking. I still haven’t finished
the gameplay implementation yet, but the core pieces to do that are there.
Eventually, I want to vastly improve the computer AI to provide more
realistic opponents, but I’m not very close to that point yet. Overall,
I’m happy with the state of the project and am still working on it
post-batch.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-lwae5t">Plight of the Wizard</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ee70kv">My next project was a game for the Playdate titled <a href="https://sotix.itch.io/plight-of-the-wizard" rel="nofollow">Plight of the
Wizard</a>. This game was
initially created during a four-day game jam. I enjoyed my work on the
game and learned so much that I ended up pursuing this project deeply in
the following weeks. I went on to publish the game, and it has received
hundreds of downloads as well as multiple donations.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11vg4ug">Plight of the Wizard was my highlight during my time at RC. I first began
programming when I was a kid to mod games, and I eventually made the
career switch from accounting to software engineering in 2020 because
I began picking up programming again to create a game. For one reason or
another, I never got around to creating a complete game while I worked on
my career switch. RC finally provided me with the space to work on a game
while also providing immediate feedback from others that followed my
progress.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yoducn">This ended up being one of the more demanding projects that I worked on,
which surprised me. Performance optimizations required me to significantly
expand my expertise in data structures and algorithms because the
Playdate’s limited CPU and memory didn’t allow for poorly optimized code
to run at my particular standards. Perhaps even tougher than writing
optimized code was nailing the feeling of “fun”. Strongly optimized code
means nothing if the player doesn’t even play the game long enough for it
to matter. <em>I</em> think that I was able to make the game fun. I still play it
daily on my subway rides, so I know there’s at least one person enjoying
it. The game also got strong feedback from strangers that tried it out,
which was really exciting to experience.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-vhavd3">Delivering weekly technical presentations on features that I implemented
and publishing blog posts on my progress were enjoyable and helped expand
my skills beyond simply writing code. This was a project I always wanted
to pursue, and I’m extremely satisfied with the outcome.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1xsj9i0">Chip-8 emulator</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-qoohnx">Another project I worked on was a <a href="https://github.com/winstonrc/chip8" rel="nofollow">Chip-8
emulator</a>. This project was for a day
at RC called “impossible day” where you try to work on something that
pushes your abilities to the limit. I’ve always deeply enjoyed playing
emulators and have been interested in the technical details around their
implementations. After talking with a few recursers who had worked on
similar projects, I settled upon starting my journey into emudev with the
Chip-8 since it was more approachable than more complex systems such as
the Game Boy or NES.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qjf4eo">I ended up writing the emulator with SDL integration in a day, which was
a surprise to me. I wasn’t expecting to be able to parse the required info
to implement it so quickly, but a combination of helpful blog posts as
well as previously studying the underlying concept of how emulators and
virtual machines work helped me greatly. The next day, I added WebAssembly
support to execute my Rust code in the browser. This was a cool project,
and I learned a lot while doing it.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1dsaf8m">Rotation-Based Compression</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-p68bw7">My final project at RC was a bit of an accident. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/blog/rotation-based-compression" data-sveltekit-reload="">blog
post</a> that went into more details on my rotation-based compression
algorithm, named <a href="https://github.com/winstonrc/strawberry" rel="nofollow">strawberry</a>,
but the quick summary is that I discovered rotating an image using Mac’s
<code>sips</code> tool resulted in smaller file sizes than directly compressing the
image to the same quality without a perceivable difference to the human
eye.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-k2akxk">This began as an observation that made me do a quick double take, turned
into a fun evening of experimentation, and ended with me taking the idea
way too far because I was having so much fun with it. I gave my favorite
presentation during my time at RC on it, and I think I left quite a few of
the more technically impressive members baffled. Even after the post
(barely) hit the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41640388" rel="nofollow">Hacker
News</a>, I <em>still</em> don’t have
a conclusive answer on what’s going on here. I’d love some insight if
anyone thinks they have an answer!</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1tx51sh">The social side</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ds8cnk">Beyond working on cool technical projects, RC was a very fun social
experience. After spending over a year at my last software engineering job
working remotely, I forgot how great being in person with other talented
individuals is. The space that RC provides attracts a lot of intelligent,
kind, and curious people. It’s the perfect combo for having a great time
working on seriously cool projects and pair programming with others. But
it also provided a fun atmosphere to be social and experience
non-programming topics.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1q52942">To that end, I ended up hosting the weekly Non-Programming Talks, which
are a longstanding tradition to discuss anything people are excited to
share that are explicitly not programming related. I gave a talk myself on
an adaption of my blog post <a href="https://github.com/blog/a-basic-introduction-to-accounting" data-sveltekit-reload="">A
Basic Introduction to Accounting</a>. Hosting these helped me improve as
a public speaker, get pretty good at convincing shier people to present on
cool topics, and meet a lot more people than I would have otherwise.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lrt2hm">I also took it upon myself to host a couple of happy hours to bring people
together in a non-programming context. I think these were pretty
successful given the high turnout rate. I ended up forming stronger bonds
with other recursers and was also able to find people to pair on future
projects who I might not have talked with as much if I only ever saw them
at the hub.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-17cggjb">Finally, I hosted the weekly game dev group. This was fun to engage in as
I worked on my game. I received a lot of amazing feedback from more
experienced game devs, and I got to see the progress on their games as
well. This ended up being my favorite meeting of the week, and it was
really fun to interact with other people facing specific issues that
non-game devs didn’t have as much insight into. I also hosted a game jam
for the batch after mine where I set the theme for the jam to be
<em>claustrophobia</em>. Everyone absolutely nailed it! I was really impressed
with what they created in such a short period of time, and it was
rewarding to pass the torch to such a talented set of individuals.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1p8672r">Outside of RC, it was a great experience living in New York. I already had
a number of friends in the area, but moving to a new city — even for
a short period of time — can be a daunting task. Having a naturally large
community at RC really helped fill in the gaps while I experienced the
city. Being in person at RC to experience NYC was a major highlight of the
entire experience, and I’m really happy that I did it.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-tyy7t3">Why RC was successful for me</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-rkrtj9">Looking back on my time, I think there were a few reasons I was able to
thrive during my time at RC.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1sph8ya">First, I am a strong self-learner. Having spent 8 months camped in
a library while studying the CPA exam, 5 years studying computer science
on the side with 1 year of dedicated study, as well teaching myself how to
speak Greek were all indicators that I excel when learning on my own but
also all contributed to developing that muscle. I’m not sure if that style
of learning is the best for everyone, but I believe it’s a hard
requirement for anyone that wants to do well at RC.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ge1emn">Further, I couldn’t have passed the four sections of the CPA exam on my
first attempt, made the switch into software engineering, or learned how
to speak Greek without a community of incredibly talented and supportive
people around me. People often don’t consider that side of things when
they look at those achievement, but there are always dozens of people that
are part of my journey that deserve significant praise. Understanding this
was a major reason I ended up deciding to attend RC. Fortunately, it did
indeed provide a supportive community that helped me improve as a software
engineer. I believe that in addition to being a strong self-learner you
have to be able to work well with others in various capacities to be
successful while at RC.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-oqa60d">Next, I tried very hard to push the edge of my abilities. This began with
working on programming challenges that were <em>hard</em>. There were so many
times while working on my game where the frame rate dropped to a sluggish
5 FPS, and I was completely stumped. But I never gave up on difficult
challenges. If I was at a complete standstill, I’d reach out to someone
here for help and pickup another task while I waited to hear back.
Inevitably, a solution would be found, and I would overcome the issue.
When presenting on that issue the following week, it would always seem so
trivial, which was because I had grown as a developer. There’s a Greek
saying, «Πρέπει να παθάνει για να μάθαίνει», which translates more bluntly
in English as, “You must suffer to learn.” I find this to be quite true.
The hardest challenges resulted in the largest growth for me.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fp5ow8">I also grew from my experience pair programming with others. There were
a few times where I hit a wall with a particularly Rust-specific issue
that wasn’t very intuitive. Sitting down with Rust experts that were able
to clarify my problems helped me a lot. On the other side of things,
sitting down with someone else to debug an issue in their code was also
valuable. Working alongside others can be a lot of fun to see how they
think and approach their code, and I was able to grow from practicing that
skill.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-i8myok">Beyond pushing the edge of my technical abilities, I pushed many other
abilities. I forced myself to deliver weekly presentations, host
non-programming talks, and organize social events and the game dev group.
I felt that I went from a pretty average presenter to a much more capable
and confident one. I’ve long had experience organizing events, having done
so for my friend group as well as a fantasy football league for well over
a decade, but I also grew in that area by having to do that for people
I wasn’t as close with. I deliberately made myself be more social and take
on larger responsibilities than I normally do, and I found that to be one
of the better decisions I made while at RC.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1l903s3">What I would do differently</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fls48g">I honestly can’t think of anything I would have changed about my
experience. I pursued a vibes-based decision process where I let what
capture my curiosity lead my path for the day. Early on, I heard an RC
faculty say that the people who wrote the most code tended to grow the
most during their time at RC, so I decided to write <em>a lot</em> of code.
I think that advice was spot on. Rather than excessively deliberate over
what to work on or spend time thinking of how to maximize my efficiency,
I focused on simply creating things every day. I spent my weekdays coding
features on my todo list and Fridays experimenting on fun ideas. Fridays
are where all of the most fun gameplay elements in my game came from, and
I’m glad I followed that structure. I was able to deliver a game in
a timely manner with a lot of unique and clever aspects.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1drnudk">Final thoughts</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xi7q0z">If you couldn’t tell, I’m very happy with my time at RC. It was one of the
best decisions I have ever made, and I’m glad taking time off from working
for income paid off in a greater way than money ever could. I have been
doing a lot of studying and interview prep recently, so I didn’t have to
completely sacrifice that side of things. I made multiple new friends from
countries all over the world and greatly expanded my professional network
too. I’m impressed by every individual I met at RC, which is not something
I can say about most other organizations I’ve participated outside of my
high school. I didn’t find a single disappointing person here. That’s an
incredible feat by the founders and the current faculty. RC sounded too
good to be true before I attended, and it still feels that way now. I am
beyond impressed with my overall experience, and it feels bittersweet to
wrap up my time here.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10pqkla">If any of this sounds interesting to you, I strongly suggest clicking the
