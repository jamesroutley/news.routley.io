    <h1>Recurse Center: return &#34;statement&#34;;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boy did that go fast...</p><p>RC has a motto to &#34;Never Graduate&#34;. An encouragement to always persue learning and growth. To build your volitional muscles. To learn generously.</p><p>A worry I had before joining my batch was <em>~unemployment~</em>. Being laid off earlier last year, hearing about all the other layoffs in the industry, and going through some loops before the new year, I knew it was going to be hard to focus 100% on RC.</p><p>But during my interview with RC and during the batch, I was encouraged to take care of myself and do what I needed to do. And I found support from some of my batchmates in similar situations.</p><p>It&#39;s a weird time right now. Whether people blame it on &#34;ZIRP&#34;, pumping up stock prices, or looming AI automation, the tech job market is not poppin&#39;.</p><p>Anyways, back to RC.</p><h3 id="heading-what-were-your-goals-when-you-applied-to-rc-how-did-you-expect-to-spend-your-time-here-what-did-you-actually-work-on">What were your goals when you applied to RC?

A fellow Recurser recommended I take a look at the MPS implementation of PyTorch as an area that could use some improvement and that was a great idea. I love the idea of making ML more accessible for the &#34;GPU-poor&#34;. A Mac Mini M2 with 16GB of RAM is $700. For some rough comparison of LLM inference performance, checkout this <a href="https://github.com/XiongjieDai/GPU-Benchmarks-on-LLM-Inference">repo</a>.</p><p>While I loved building my PC back in the day, it&#39;s not something I&#39;m drawn to anymore and don&#39;t think most people will either. A low power server that I can SSH into via Tailscale is awesome and I highly recommend if you already have a laptop and don&#39;t want to shell out $2K+ for a new M-series Macbook Pro.</p><p>I&#39;m looking forward to diving deeper into the MPS implementation.</p><h4>Learning ML / AI</h4><p>My two slides on Transformers and DPO were well received on LinkedIn. I enjoy teaching and sharing a lot so that refilled the tank. They both did take longer than expected but that&#39;s the price of learning. It&#39;s also nice to have some artifact to post on the blog. Check out the <a href="https://lamroger.com/slides">slides</a>.</p><p>The field doesn&#39;t stop so also looking forward to doing more of this.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.latent.space/p/community">Latent Space</a> Discord has a weekly journal club on Wednesdays at 12pm Pacific if you want more of this.</p><h4>Job</h4><p>This one is difficult. I still think of this blog post from DeepMind about <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/">AI modeling global weather forecasting</a>. HOW COOL IS THAT?!</p><p>That&#39;s the direction I want to move in. The journey is likely a 5-10 year endeavour. I just need to keep moving in that direction.</p><p>So for now, I&#39;m looking to do what I&#39;m good at - building backend and infra systems, while continuing to learn and apply my learning to create cool ML / AI powered solutions.</p><h3 id="heading-rc-thoughts">RC Thoughts<a href="#heading-rc-thoughts"><span role="text"> permalink</span><svg fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M9.199 13.599a5.99 5.99 0 0 0 3.949 2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0 5.105-1.702l2.995-2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0 1.695-4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0-1.831-4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0-6.431-1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0-1.905 1.24l-1.731 1.721a.999.999 0 1 0 1.41 1.418l1.709-1.699a3.985 3.985 0 0 1 2.761-1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1 2.799 1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1 .111 5.644l-3.005 3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1-3.395 1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1-2.632-1.563A1 1 0 0 0 9.201 13.6zm5.602-3.198a5.99 5.99 0 0 0-3.949-2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0-5.105 1.702l-2.995 2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0-1.695 4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0 1.831 4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0 6.431 1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0 1.905-1.24l1.723-1.723a.999.999 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L9.836 19.81a3.985 3.985 0 0 1-2.761 1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1-2.799-1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1-.111-5.644l3.005-3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1 3.395-1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1 2.632 1.563 1 1 0 0 0 1.602-1.198z"></path></svg></a></h3><h4>Being remote</h4><p>TBH, I think to experience RC the fullest, you&#39;ll want to visit regularly.</p><p>Being in LA, I got to meet up with a local batchmate twice and that was really nice. I just imagine that times 100 being in Brooklyn.</p><p>RC does put a lot of effort into setting up coffee chats and pairing sessions. Those were always nice too. I just get too much Zoom fatigue and after Zoom, I go back to staring at my monitor.</p><p>A cool thing is that RCers are welcome to apply again to later batches. I&#39;d love to go in-person one day.</p><h4>Career team</h4><p>The career team has been very helpful in getting me intros and interviews with companies. They&#39;re so encouraging and I really appreciate that. I love that they have this to lean on.</p><h3 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#heading-conclusion"><span role="text"> permalink</span><svg fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="1em" height="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M9.199 13.599a5.99 5.99 0 0 0 3.949 2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0 5.105-1.702l2.995-2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0 1.695-4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0-1.831-4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0-6.431-1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0-1.905 1.24l-1.731 1.721a.999.999 0 1 0 1.41 1.418l1.709-1.699a3.985 3.985 0 0 1 2.761-1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1 2.799 1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1 .111 5.644l-3.005 3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1-3.395 1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1-2.632-1.563A1 1 0 0 0 9.201 13.6zm5.602-3.198a5.99 5.99 0 0 0-3.949-2.345 5.987 5.987 0 0 0-5.105 1.702l-2.995 2.994a5.992 5.992 0 0 0-1.695 4.285 5.976 5.976 0 0 0 1.831 4.211 5.99 5.99 0 0 0 6.431 1.242 6.003 6.003 0 0 0 1.905-1.24l1.723-1.723a.999.999 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L9.836 19.81a3.985 3.985 0 0 1-2.761 1.123 3.975 3.975 0 0 1-2.799-1.122 3.997 3.997 0 0 1-.111-5.644l3.005-3.006a3.982 3.982 0 0 1 3.395-1.126 3.987 3.987 0 0 1 2.632 1.563 1 1 0 0 0 1.602-1.198z"></path></svg></a></h3><p>I&#39;m running out of gas writing this blog post. I look fondly back at my time in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">RC</a> and recommend tinkerers from all backgrounds to check it out, and I look forward to building connections with alumni in the area too.</p><p>Take care.</p></div></div>
