I think it is the purest and most beautiful of all the intellectual disciplines. It is <em>the </em>universal language, both of human beings and of the universe itself. Sadly, there is all sorts of baggage around learning it (at least in the US educational system) that is completely unnecessary and awful and prevents many people from experiencing the pure joy of mathematics. One of the lies I have heard so many people repeat is that everyone is either a “math person” or a &#34;language person” — such a profoundly ignorant and damaging statement. Here is the truth: if you can understand the structure of literature, if you can understand the basic grammar of the English language or any other language, then you can understand the basics of the language of the universe. That doesn’t mean it’s easy — no, mathematics is an incredibly challenging discipline, and there is nothing easy or straightforward about it — but, honestly, I have yet to find a single topic, discipline, or intellectual pursuit that is easy or straightforward to learn at any advanced level. </p><p>The secret to learning math is this: accept that it is a difficult subject and that understanding it is going to be hard, study it in small manageable pieces (like the curriculum I’ve put together here), be patient with yourself and with your study, and work diligently to understand it. I promise you that it is worth every moment, every effort, every precious bit of energy. </p><p>My goal here is to provide a roadmap for anyone interested in understanding mathematics at an advanced level. Anyone that follows and completes this curriculum will walk away with the knowledge equivalent to an undergraduate degree in mathematics.  This guide only covers an undergraduate mathematics curriculum, because, unlike the fields of physics and philosophy (both of which I have studied at the graduate level), that’s where my math knowledge ends. While I have taken a few graduate courses in mathematics and have studied a handful of topics in mathematics (including differential geometry and logic) at the graduate level, I don’t have enough experience or knowledge to feel comfortable evaluating graduate-level mathematics textbooks, and, as a matter of principle, I won’t recommend or include a textbook in one of my guides that I haven’t studied (whether in full or in part) either on my own or for a course. I’m always learning new things, so if/when that ever changes, I’ll update this guide. </p><p>Anyone can understand mathematics. The joy of learning to speak the language of humanity and of the universe is accessible to anyone who has (1) the desire to think about things a little more deeply and (2) the curiosity and patience to discover what’s possible. </p><p>Godspeed!<br/></p><h3><strong>Before You Begin</strong></h3><h4><strong>Popular Math Books</strong></h4><p>Before you dive into the more formal and difficult coursework, you might find it helpful or fun to read some books about mathematics and mathematicians that are a little more accessible than many of the textbooks you will find in the curriculum that follows. </p><p>Here are a handful of my favorite popular mathematics books, ranked in order of difficulty:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691168482/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0691168482&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=d7007592786cd84368390fe8b2dbfc92&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>e: The Story of a Number </em>by Eli Maor</a> <strong>(Level: Easy)</strong>.

If you need a refresher or if you are unfamiliar with the material, I recommend either working through the Khan Academy math courses (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/)</a> or the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Math-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387944273?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp%3Bqid=&amp;amp%3Bsr=&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=0fc3187aa8b5febcc75391ba905635b5&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Why Math?</em> by R.D.

Zill and Jacqueline M. Dewar</a> is a very comprehensive, well-written book (like every one of Zill’s wonderful textbooks!). If you haven’t taken a precalculus course or studied precalculus before, I recommend working through the entire book and getting comfortable with the concepts before moving onto the calculus course that kicks off our math curriculum. You can supplement this textbook with the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus" target="_blank">Khan Academy Precalculus</a> course if needed. <strong> </strong></p></li></ul><h4><strong>How to Study</strong></h4><p>Every person learns in their own special way, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes, by talking, by watching, by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. Think about this before you begin so that you&#39;ll know how to structure your studies. </p><p>Regardless of your learning style, you&#39;ll still need to solve the problems in each textbook. <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics" target="_blank">Just like in physics</a>, <strong>solving problems is the only way to understand mathematics.</strong> There&#39;s no way around it. </p><p>One tough thing about learning on your own is that you may not know whether you are solving the problems correctly. A number of the textbooks listed below have answers to selected exercises in the back of the book, but these aren’t always adequate for two reasons: (1) they often only show the solutions to the problems, and not the steps taken to get there; and (2) it’s much better to do <em>all</em> of the exercises rather than just a select few. The good news is that many of the solutions (and step-by-step ways to solve them) can be found online with a simple google search. If you are going to google the answers, however, <em>please first try to solve the problems on your own, and try multiple times</em> (you’re not in school trying to get a perfect grade — you’re trying to learn and understand).</p><h4><strong>Further Reading and Misc.

Calculus</strong></h4><p><strong>What It’s All About</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, calculus is the study of change. Just like almost every undergraduate mathematics student, you will probably spend a good deal of your mathematics education studying calculus: most undergraduate math majors take two full years of calculus courses (not including precalculus or any other prerequisites) — a four-course series with names like “Calculus 1,” “Calculus 2&#34;,” etc. —  and then study calculus <em>again </em>when, later, they study analysis. You may find that you can work through this first course much more quickly than that, but don’t be discouraged if it takes you one or more years to get through the textbook. You may also find calculus difficult, especially if you’ve never studied it before; part of the difficulty sometimes comes from the foreignness of the material (it can take a while for your brain to get used to it), and the rest of the difficulty stems from the fact that it can be a challenging subject to learn! Take your time, do as many problems as you can, and keep going. (Note: if you do end up finding calculus too difficult, make sure you go back to high school algebra and precalculus and cover everything you might have missed or not understood very well.)</p><p><strong>Readings</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1285741552/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1285741552&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e693e1af538673dcd7833d5f247747ca&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 8th Edition </em>by James Stewart</a> (essential). This is an excellent textbook and it is a classic for a reason. Everything you need to know about undergraduate calculus is in this book. Everything. It contains excellent problems, good examples, and straightforward explanations. There is also a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1305272420/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1305272420&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=8c31534236a7b66532ffb5e09d7f6a39&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Student Solutions Manual</em></a><em> </em>that you may find very useful. The earlier editions of the book are just as good as this one — just make sure you are able to find the corresponding solutions manual. (Note: I also frequently recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Calculus-14th-Joel-Hass-dp-0134438981/dp/0134438981?language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=e055fccb0e90aa26395bf8b70ad8eb90&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Thomas’ Calculus</em></a><em>, </em>which is also excellent,<em> </em>but I have lately found myself preferring Stewart; both books are fantastic and they each have their nuances and quirks — if you find you don’t like one, give the other a try.) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312185480/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312185480&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=f77fd8a70b9c53d8f82f48dfe7574a27&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Calculus Made Easy</em> by Silvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner</a> (supplement). This is such a wonderful, thoughtful book. I recommend reading it alongside Stewart when you are just getting started — it may help you make sense of what you’re learning.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Additional Material</strong></p><p>When I was a student at Penn, the most useful mathematics courses I took were ones that I snuck into (some of them I couldn’t enroll in because I didn’t have the necessary prerequisites, others because they were too full and I couldn’t register). My favorite secret classes were the calculus courses taught by <a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/" target="_blank">Robert Ghrist</a>. He had a way of explaining concepts in calculus that made them just <em>click</em> for me. He also lectured with this really infectious energy that made me strongly reconsider my devotion to physics — I’d leave his lectures wanting to devote my whole life to mathematics. Luckily, you don’t have to sneak into his classes to listen to his lectures, since he now offers them for free online through Coursera: (1) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-variable-calculus" target="_blank">Calculus: Single Variable Part 1 - Functions</a>, (2) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/differentiation-calculus" target="_blank">Calculus: Single Variable Part 2 - Differentiation</a>, (3) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/integration-calculus" target="_blank">Calculus: Single Variable Part 3 - Integration</a>, (4) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/applications-calculus" target="_blank">Calculus: Single Variable Part 4 - Applications</a>. I highly recommend his lectures — they pair well with Stewart’s <em>Calculus</em> and they will stick in your head for many, many years.</p><h4><strong>2. Introduction to Proofs</strong></h4><p><strong>What It’s All About</strong></p><p>Much (if not all) of advanced mathematics (i.e., things beyond high school math and introductory calculus) is not about <em>calculating</em> things or solving problems but about <em>proving </em>things. Proving is very different than calculating or solving, and there is an entire toolkit you’ll need before moving on to more advanced courses. Here, you’ll become familiar with mathematical reasoning, will learn how to read and write proofs, and will start learning to think like a mathematician.</p><p><strong>Readings</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521675995/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521675995&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=b6d15ccb6b2b68ff1edef9d41f933796&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>How to Prove It: A Structured Approach</em></a><em> </em>by Daniel J.

This absolutely enormous book may seem overwhelming at first, but once you jump in, you’ll find that it’s huge because it’s incredibly detailed, filled with examples and exercises, and relatively straightforward to follow once you get used to it. It’s worth reading and studying carefully, and don’t be afraid to take your time — remember that many full-time math students will study this for <em>at least</em> an entire academic year as part of a two-semester (sometimes even three-semester) advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course in abstract algebra.

Real Analysis</strong></h4><p><strong>What It’s All About</strong></p><p>Mathematical analysis is divided into two groups: real analysis and complex analysis, which are the study of the real numbers and real functions and the complex numbers and complex functions, respectively. To jump into real analysis, you’ll need the four semesters (two years) of foundational calculus courses as well as the familiarity with proofs that you’ll get from abstract algebra (however, I think you could start studying real analysis after working through the first chapter of Dummit and Foote, and study the two topics in parallel if you really wanted to). </p><p><strong>The Best Textbooks to Use</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1493927116/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1493927116&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=861a7a72cb83cb1a9a4d8012e97ba9ab&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Understanding Analysis, Second Edition, </em>by Stephen Abbott</a> (essential).

(I should note that if you are also studying physics and engineering on the side, I do recommend studying ODEs sooner rather than later because of how important they are for physics and engineering, but that’s not necessary if you’re only studying math.)</p><p><strong>The Best Textbooks to Use</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Differential-Equations-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486649407?crid=2A06Q6PA1XLMT&amp;keywords=ODE%20tenenbaum&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=3ad23680f7da689463a8535a5bac582b&amp;qid=1646610864&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=ode%20tenenbaum%20%2Cstripbooks%2C121&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank"><em>Ordinary Differential Equations</em> by Morris Tenenbaum and Harry Pollard</a> (essential).
