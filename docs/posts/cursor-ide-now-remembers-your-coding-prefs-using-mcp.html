    <h1>Show HN: Cursor IDE now remembers your coding prefs using MCP</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi, I&#39;m Daniel from Zep. I&#39;ve integrated the Cursor IDE with Graphiti, our open-source temporal knowledge graph framework, to provide Cursor with persistent memory across sessions. The goal was simple: help Cursor remember your coding preferences, standards, and project specs, so you don&#39;t have to constantly remind it.</p><p>Before this integration, Cursor (an AI-assisted IDE many of us already use daily) lacked a robust way to persist user context. To solve this, I used Graphiti’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which allows structured data exchange between the IDE and Graphiti&#39;s temporal knowledge graph.</p><p>Key points of how this works:</p><p>- Custom entities like &#39;Requirement&#39;, &#39;Preference&#39;, and &#39;Procedure&#39; precisely capture coding standards and project specs.</p><p>- Real-time updates let Cursor adapt instantly—if you change frameworks or update standards, the memory updates immediately.</p><p>- Persistent retrieval ensures Cursor always recalls your latest preferences and project decisions, across new agent sessions, projects, and even after restarting the IDE.</p><p>I’d love your feedback—particularly on the approach and how it fits your workflow.</p><p>Here&#39;s a detailed write-up: <a href="https://www.getzep.com/blog/cursor-adding-memory-with-graphiti-mcp/">https://www.getzep.com/blog/cursor-adding-memory-with-graphi...</a></p><p>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/getzep/graphiti" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/getzep/graphiti</a></p><p>-Daniel</p></div></div></div>
