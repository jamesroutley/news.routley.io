    <h1>Ingrid Daubechies awarded National Medal of Science</h1>

<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/03/president-biden-honors-nations-leading-scientists-technologists-and-innovators/">has announced</a> that <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ingrid.daubechies">Ingrid Daubechies</a>, James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emerita of <a href="https://math.duke.edu/">Mathematics</a>, will receive the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/03/president-biden-honors-nations-leading-scientists-technologists-and-innovators/">National Medal of Science</a> in 2025. She is being honored for her pioneering work on signal processing.</p>



<p>Established by the U.S. Congress in 1959, the National Medal of Science is the highest possible recognition bestowed on scientists and engineers in the nation. Each year, a committee of distinguished scientists and engineers is appointed by the president of the United States to evaluate nominees from areas as diverse as astronomy, chemistry, computer and information science, engineering, geoscience, materials research, and research on STEM education.</p>



<p>“Ingrid Daubechies is a singular figure in her field, and we congratulate her on this recognition of her profound impact on science and technology,” said Duke Provost Alec D. Gallimore. “Her distinguished career has demonstrated the enormous potential of academic research and the transformative power of interdisciplinary thinking.”</p>

<p>Nicknamed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/magazine/ingrid-daubechies.html">The Godmother of the Digital Image</a>” by The New York Times, Daubechies’ research on wavelet theory — a refinement of the Fourier technique — underlies much of today’s image processing technologies, including image compression and denoising. Anytime you go to a movie theater, each frame has been compressed using Daubechies’ wavelet-based method.</p>



<p>“Ingrid invented a really elegant way of storing the important information within images that preserves edges and allows compression, but also allows almost perfect reconstruction of the image, even from highly compressed versions of it,” <a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/news/images-legendary-female-mathematician">said</a> <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/rudin">Cynthia Rudin</a>, Gilbert, Louis, and Edward Lehrman Distinguished Professor of <a href="https://cs.duke.edu/">Computer Science</a>.</p>

<p>The elegance of Daubechies’ technique comes from the mathematics derivation of wavelets. “The derivation boosted Ingrid into legendary status among the mathematical world as well as among electrical engineers,” said Rudin, who also holds appointments in Statistical Sciences, Mathematics, Electrical and Computing Engineering, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics.</p>



<p>Armed with her elegant math and unwavering curiosity, Daubechies spent much of her career <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2016/08/daubechies">defying disciplinary boundaries</a>, weaving in and out of fields as disparate as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/using-mathematics-to-repair-a-masterpiece-20160929/">art restoration</a> and evolutionary biology.</p>



<p>“We join so many in congratulating Ingrid on this thrilling recognition of her life’s work and the far-reaching impact of her research, scholarship and mentorship,” said Gary Bennett, dean of Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences. “Beyond her historic findings in the fields of mathematics and engineering, Ingrid is a tireless advocate for increasing the number of women in the sciences. We’re beyond proud of what she has accomplished and how she is changing Duke and the world for the better.”</p>



<p>Her early work helped the FBI squeeze down millions of fingerprints in 1990s computers. She has worked with geologists to peek under the Earth’s crust, analyzing seismograms from earthquakes. She has partnered as with neuroscientists and cardiologists, reading MRI images of brain activity and patterns in electrocardiograms.</p>



<p>Using one of her techniques to compare 3D shapes, Daubechies has worked with fossil experts, analyzing scans of bones and teeth to learn about an extinct animal’s diet or locomotion patterns. In a completely different kind of museum, Daubechies and her team used wavelets and machine learning to distinguish forgeries from true works by Vincent van Gogh. The ensuing collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists, museum curators and art historians has led to algorithms used to date and mathematically restore artwork that has cracked, faded, or been reduced to rubble by wartime bombing.</p>



<p>“I really get a lot of joy out of seeing creativity at work in any field; it doesn’t have to be a scientific field,” said Daubechies <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2019/06/12/making-wavelets-a-profile-of-ingrid-daubechies/">in an interview with the Simon’s Foundation Flatiron Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Born in Houthalen, Belgium, Daubechies studied theoretical physics at the Vrije Universiteit, in Brussels, the same institution where she completed a doctorate in quantum physics in 1980. In the United States, she conducted research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey before joining Princeton University’s faculty in 1993, where she became the first woman to be a tenured professor in mathematics.</p>



<p>This was only one of many “firsts” in Daubechies’ career. In 2000, she was the first woman to receive the National Academy of Sciences Award in Mathematics. A decade later, she was the first woman elected president of the International Mathematical Union. In 2018, she was <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2018/06/duke-professor-wins-100000-prize-applied-mathematics">the first female recipient of the William Benter Prize in Applied Mathematics</a>. She is a 1992 MacArthur Fellow, a 2010 Guggenheim Fellow and has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2019, she was awarded <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2019/06/harvard-present-ingrid-daubechies-honorary-degree">an honorary degree from Harvard University</a> and the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/loreal-and-unesco-award-us-based-physicist-and-applied-mathematician-for-outstanding-scientific-achievements-300793114.html">L’Oreal-UNESCO Women in Science award</a>. She received the <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2023/02/duke-professor-wins-one-most-prestigious-awards-mathematics">2023 Wolf Prize in Mathematics</a>, and, in 2024, was elected to the <a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/news/ingrid-daubechies-elected-royal-society">Royal Society of London</a></p>

<p>Rather than boasting about such achievements, Daubechies has worked hard to help make the concept of “first female to” a thing of the past, advocating tirelessly to break gender barriers in STEM. “I feel successful being part of a bigger whole,” she <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mathematics-pioneer-ingrid-daubechies-has-more-barriers-to-break-11579888523?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1">told the Wall Street Journal</a>. “It’s such a man thing to want your effigy. That may be a reason why women have been so forgotten.”</p>



<p>Daubechies, along with the other 13 National Medal of Science awardees, received the medal from the president Jan. 3 during a ceremony at the White House.</p>



<p>At Duke, she will join <a href="https://provost.duke.edu/profile/robert-j-lefkowitz/">Robert Lefkowitz</a>, Chancellor&#39;s Distinguished Professor of Medicine, who was presented with the National Medal of Science in 2008, as a recipient of this prestigious honor.</p>
