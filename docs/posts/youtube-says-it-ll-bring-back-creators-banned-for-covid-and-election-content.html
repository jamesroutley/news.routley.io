(Read the letter in full below.)</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee published the letter on its website on Tuesday following its monthslong investigation into whether Biden White House officials pressured Big Tech platforms into censoring content. A Google spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the letter.</p><p>YouTube&#39;s about-face on previously banned accounts marks the latest shift in Big Tech content moderation.

Kennedy Jr.&#39;s</a> nonprofit activist group, as well as those from lesser-known creators — had been banned from YouTube for flouting its <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-expands-anti-vaccine-rules-bans-prominent-anti-vaxxers-covid-2021-9" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">COVID-19 misinformation</a> and election-related policies. Bongino has since become the deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, while Kennedy leads the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Google&#39;s lawyer said in the letter published Tuesday that YouTube had ended all of its stand-alone, COVID-19-related policies by December 2024 and retired a separate policy regarding election integrity in 2023 to &#34;allow for discussion of possible widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurring in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.&#34;</p><p>The letter didn&#39;t go into detail about how previously banned creators could resume their terminated channels or whether their content would be monetized and therefore eligible to get a cut of ad revenue.</p><p>Google, via its @UpdatesFromYT X account, later clarified that it is planning a pilot program that would be available to a &#34;subset of creators&#34; who have been suspended from YouTube — in addition to accounts that were kicked off for violating COVID-19 or election-misinformation policies that have since been deprecated.</p><p>The Google spokesperson had no further comment but added the company would have more to say in the coming weeks.</p>
              
              
              
            <p>&#34;This is another victory in the fight against censorship,&#34; Jordan wrote in a post on X.</p><p>Google&#39;s move to reinstate previously banned channels comes just over a year after <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-letter-jim-jordan-meta-facebook-censorship-politics-meaning-2024-8" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a> said — also in a letter to Jordan — that <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-content-moderation-policy-fact-checkers-elon-musk-rogan-2025-1" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">the Biden administration</a> had repeatedly pressured Meta in 2021 to remove content related to COVID-19.</p><p>&#34;I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,&#34; Zuckerberg wrote in the August 2024 letter.</p><p>Google, too, said senior Biden administration officials, including White House officials, had pressed the company to remove content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that didn&#39;t violate YouTube&#39;s policies.</p><p>&#34;It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how&#34; a company moderates content, Google wrote in the letter published Tuesday.</p><p>Google said it has been testing a feature similar to X&#39;s Community Notes to allow people to provide relevant context about its videos, but it &#34;has not and will not empower fact-checkers to take action on or label content&#34; on the platform.</p><p><strong>Here&#39;s the letter from Google counsel to the House Judiciary Committee:</strong></p>
