    <h1>Cummins pickup truck engines systematically tricked air pollution controls</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The United States Department of Justice is slamming an Indiana-based engine manufacturing company with a $1.675 billion penalty in a settlement that says the company violated the federal Clean Air Act.</p><p>The department alleges Cummins Inc. installed devices that can bypass emissions sensors on 630,000 RAM pickup truck engines, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-merrick-garland-agreement-principle-cummins-settle-alleged" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">according to a news release Friday</a>. The whopping financial penalty is the largest ever violation since the law was enacted in 1963 to protect the nation&#39;s air quality.</p><p>“The types of devices we allege that Cummins installed in its engines to cheat federal environmental laws have a significant and harmful impact on people’s health and safety,&#34; wrote Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. He said Cummins&#39; engines caused excess emissions of nitrogen oxides, which can cause asthma and respiratory infections.</p><p>The company agreed to pay the $1.675 billion fine to the U.S. and the State of California to settle the claims, according to the Department of Justice. The penalty is the second largest environmental penalty in the history of the nation, according to the Department of Justice.</p><p>The company does not admit wrongdoing and says no one in the company acted in bad faith, said Jon Mills, a spokesperson for Cummins Inc. in an email to USA TODAY.</p><p>&#34;The company has cooperated fully with the relevant regulators, already addressed many of the issues involved, and looks forward to obtaining certainty as it concludes this lengthy matter,&#34; reads a news release from the company.</p><h2>What is the Department of Justice penalizing Cummins Inc. for?</h2><p>Cummins Inc. allegedly installed defeat devices on the engines of hundreds of thousands of 2013 to 20199 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks, according to the Department of Justice. The DOJ also says the company installed defeat devices on the engines of 330,000 newer RAM pickup trucks.</p><p>Defeat devices are hardware or software used in vehicles to trick air pollution tests, or bypass emissions controls.</p><p>The company said it has since recalled those trucks. It has also &#34;initiated a recall of model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks and previously accrued a total of $59 million for the estimated costs for executing these and other related recalls,&#34; according to a Friday news release from the company.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/f465c41d7b7f7ca23c261feac8e7627066d48822/c=0-104-580-430/local/-/media/2017/01/15/USATODAY/usatsports/2014-ram-ecodiesel-v6_large.jpg?width=580&amp;height=326&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Did FCA&#39;s 3.0 liter turbo V6 &#34;EcoDiesel&#34; engine have a defeat device?

It&#39;s the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s role to uphold the law.</p><p><strong>Communities facing air pollution</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/04/07/epa-put-new-rules-chemical-plants-reduce-air-pollution/11620822002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:22|${u}">Could get relief as EPA proposes new rules on chemical plants</a></p><p><em>Contact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.
