    <h1>How I stopped worrying and loved Makefiles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I was invited for my first job interview in the IT, Iâ€™ve been asked such question:</p><blockquote><p>How would you typically build a program from sources, what commands will you use?</p></blockquote><p>I answered:</p><blockquote><p>Itâ€™s obvious:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>./configure
</span></span><span><span>make
</span></span><span><span>make install
</span></span></code></pre></div></blockquote><p>Those times belong to the past now and nowadays not many programmers use GNU Make<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Try asking this question and you will see disgust at best.</p><p>For many itâ€™s the fist contact with <code>make</code> and often the last one, but not for me ðŸ˜‰</p><h2 id="what-make-does">What <code>make</code> does?</h2><p>Let build a base line. <code>make</code> orchestrates tasks based on dependencies, executing commands to generate target files and keep them up to date efficiently. It streamlines software compilation and project management.</p><p>As simple as it is, it does few things pretty well:</p><ul><li>detects changes in files (source -&gt; binary),</li><li>manages dependencies,</li><li>manages default values for variables much easier than Bash,</li><li>allows to build in parallel,</li><li>OS detection,</li><li>on my system binary is only 16kB in size,</li><li>is available on any OS,</li><li>and much more!</li></ul><h2 id="my-second-contact-with-make---postfix">My second contact with make - Postfix</h2><p>The second non obvious use of <code>make</code> I stood, was the way to refresh Postfixâ€™s map files. With Postfix servers, youâ€™ve been usually writing a bunch of text files like <code>aliases</code>, <code>transports</code>, etc, which have to be indexed to the binary Berkley DB format.</p><div><div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
