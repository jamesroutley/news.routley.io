    <h1>Teams are becoming smaller</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As the head of marketing for a UK restaurant group, James’s role was to develop its long-term strategy, steadily build its digital audience and gradually increase footfall. However, his job looked different in practice – there were never enough employees to get even the smaller, more routine tasks done, let alone focus on the job he was hired to do.</p>
<p>“From day one, there was a lack of numbers,” says London-based James, whose surname is being withheld for career-security concerns. “I was spread too thinly to be able to work effectively: I’d have to try and fit the big-picture strategic stuff of marketing alongside the granular day-to-day stuff.” His bosses, he says, showed little sympathy, and James often found himself working 16-hour days.</p>
<p>His team was so lean, hobbled by labour shortages following Brexit, pandemic-enforced lockdowns and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220908-the-jobs-employers-just-cant-fill">overall hiring crisis in the service industry</a>, that James says even managers would often have to wait tables. And these issues also had a knock-on effect for his job: “Customers would have a bad experience at the venue because it was so short-staffed that it would negatively affect me as a marketer,” he says.</p>
<p>Lacking help daily, James’s job soon became impossible. “I understand why companies want to run things with low staffing to minimise risk, particularly as hospitality is going through a very difficult period,” he says. “However, it takes a great toll on everyone involved.”</p>
<p><strong>Unbearable workloads</strong></p>
<p>Being on a small team doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily understaffed, even if work demands are high.</p>
<p>Some teams are simply designed to be lean, with these employees expected to be in multifaceted roles that enable them to work with limited resources. “In some cases, employees have varied skill sets that enable them to be efficient, productive and get their jobs done,” explains Deniece Maston, HR advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management (Shrm), based in Virginia, US.</p>
<p>But there’s a significant difference between a team that’s intentionally designed to be small and nimble, versus one that is resource-poor.</p>
<p>If workloads are no longer bearable when an employee is absent, and colleagues are suddenly thrust into performing another worker’s job requirements, then it’s likely to be a case of understaffing. “In these situations, employees can frequently find themselves needing to work overtime,” says Maston.</p>
<p>As global layoffs pick up speed, remaining employees are finding themselves on shrinking teams. And continuing economic uncertainty means many businesses are striving to do more with less, as they cut jobs and slam the recruitment brakes. For the employees still working, reduced headcounts mean they’re often expected to pick up the slack, lift heavier workloads and complete tasks beyond their job remit.</p>
<p>All this comes at a cost. Economic conditions may mean more workers could find themselves in understaffed workplaces and, amid broader market uncertainty, have little choice but to stretch themselves to their limits. While the work may still get done in the short term, understaffing ultimately takes a toll: creating stress, anxiety and burnout for employees, and other insidious consequences long-term.</p></div></div></div>
