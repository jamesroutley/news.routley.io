    <h1>Ask HN: How does my Instagram keep getting compromised?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I was an early Instagram user and got my nickname as my handle and I keep getting either locked out of my account or compromised altogether.<p>Over the years, hackers have tried a number of things to steal my handle and I can usually tell how they get in. These days, I have no idea. I&#39;ve been SIM swapped a handful of times. One time a hacker faxed a fake ID to Godaddy to try and swap out my domain to gain control of my email (they were successful).</p><p>Now, I will try to log in to my account and will just be locked out. The email I created specifically for Instagram is not recognized, and there is no way to reset my password.</p><p>I have two-factor auth on, I don&#39;t use the same password anywhere else, I change it regularly, etc.</p><p>My current theory is there is some employee at Meta that&#39;s ultimately stealing the account. Does anybody have any idea how they&#39;re hacking me?</p><p>PS: the worst part about all this is in order to get the handle back, I have to pull strings with folks I know at Meta, for a normal user, they would have absolutely no way of regaining access...</p><p>[Update] Just got the account back and still have no idea how my email was removed from the account...</p></div></div>
