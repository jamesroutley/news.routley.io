      Wayfire is a wayland compositor based on
      <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>.
      It aims to create a customizable, extendable and lightweight environment
      without sacrificing its appearance.

    <p>Hello everyone, this is the next blog in the series about writing Wayfire plugins. Again, I will be writing a custom plugin and explaining the steps along the way. This time however the focus will be on the rendering parts of Wayfire.</p>

    <p>If someone were to ask me what is the greatest aspect of Wayfire, then this would undoubtedly be its customizability and modularity.
There are a ton of options you can tweak to your liking.
However, options are rarely enough if you want to make your desktop truly your own.
And this is why Wayfire uses a plugin architecture.</p>

    <p>It has been a relatively long time since the last time I have written in this blog. That doesn’t mean work on Wayfire has stopped! In fact, I’m happy to announce the release of Wayfire 0.3. There are quite a few improvements, which I’d like to share.</p>

    <p>Wayfire is a project which has had 4 versions and has been rewritten 3 times. In this blog post I’ll try to outline why those rewrites were necessary.</p>

    <p>Hello all, I’ve recently been spending a lot of time developing <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire">Wayfire</a>, so with the help of Drew DeVault (a huge thanks for setting up the blog) I decided to start telling more about it.</p>
