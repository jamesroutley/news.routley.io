    <p>
      When I was a kid, my dad gave me a piece of paper with a grid printed on
      it. It consisted of larger squares than standard graph paper, about an
      inch in size. It was basically a blank chessboard. The columns of the
      grid were labeled with letters (“A”, “B”, “C”, etc.), the rows labeled
      with numbers (“1”, “2”, “3”, ...). My dad then helped me draw a map of
      an imaginary island within the grid’s boundaries. I sketched the
      squiggly coastline of my island, forming a splattered blob shape, within
      which I added the obvious necessary features all mysterious islands
      require: forests of crudely draw trees, a mountain with a cave entrance
      leading to a secret underground network of caverns, an abandoned hut on
      the beach. There were variations of this game: sometimes the map was of
      a completely imaginary place, but other times we mapped a known area —
      like our backyard — and added fantastic elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      My dad showed me how we could use the labeled rows and columns of the
      grid to address places of interest in our imagined islands: buried
      treasure was at square “B-4”, the entrance of the cave was at square
      “C-2”. We listed out the landmarks next to the map, creating a
      coordinate-based index. The grid plus index elevated my child-like
      imaginary treasure island into the grown-up world of official maps and
      systems, and thereby transformed it into a real, visitable place.
    </p>

    <p>
      An obsession was born. I was intoxicated by graph paper. The emptiness
      of a totally blank page intimidated me by demanding that I make the
      first move, but graph paper invited my participation by steering my
      pencil in the grooves of its strictly regular lines. The grid was like a
      friend who had already done half the work for me. I drew mazes, maps,
      patterns, plans — all held by the sturdiness of the grid. The effect was
      soothing. Through the grid’s lattice, all my drawings, no matter how
      primitive, took on an air of rational certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around the same time that my dad showed me the grid map game, I started
      using a computer. In our house, down the carpeted stairs, in the
      basement, there was a light wood desk, upon which sat a beige plastic
      box with a rainbow striped Apple logo on the front: the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7500">Power Macintosh</a>. Through this machine’s chunky,
      low res monitor, I witnessed a grid
      come to life. Each pixel was a modular, addressable component in a
      digital whole. The windows, the buttons, the fonts, the menus, and the
      icons — oh, the icons! The world of the computer was filled with little
      hieroglyphic pictures representing folders, files, control panels, and
      drawing tools, each crisply rendered on the pixel grid of the screen.
      The logic and aesthetic of the grid permeated the virtual world of the
      computer — all rational, all peaceful.
    </p>

    <p>
      My infatuation with the computer led to a curiosity about how software
      was made, and here my dad was a valuable resource. Although not a
      programmer, he was technically savvy, and he taught me how to use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>, a sort
      of “program for creating programs” distributed with the Mac operating
      system. HyperCard’s simple monochromatic drawing tools gave me insight
      into how the virtual world of the computer might have been constructed.
      Although mysterious, I realized that the virtual world didn’t just come
      from nowhere — it was made by people.

    <p>
      In 1982, when designer and artist Susan Kare was commissioned to design
      a set of icons for Apple&#39;s new Macintosh computer, she bought a small
      graph paper notebook from a University bookstore and sketched some
      initial ideas, using the cells of the graph paper to represent the
      pixels of a computer screen. The preserved notebook, pictures of which
      can be
      <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/susan-kare-apple-macintosh-icons-california-designing-freedom-design-museum-240517">found</a>
      <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/188382?artist_id=38483&amp;page=1&amp;sov_referrer=artist">online</a>,
      could not be more humble; it’s dirty and beat up and the $2.50 price
      sticker is still stuck to the backside of the cover. A pixelated
      rendering of a pointing hand adorns the first page, sketched in thick
      hot pink marker, with a label scrawled below: “PASTE” (as in, “copy and
      paste”). This low res pictograph supported the desktop metaphor by
      translating a human concept into the rational structure of the pixel
      grid. With her
      <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile">“marriage of
        craft and metaphor,”</a>
      Kare went on to design countless icons and interface elements, helping
      to define the visual language of the Mac, including HyperCard.
    </p>

    <p>
      When seen on screen, stripped of the graph paper scaffold, Kare’s icons
      seem inevitable and timeless. But in her sketches, the same icons are
      fragile and human. They are accessible. To me, Kare&#39;s notebook expresses
      an optimism about technology by inviting the viewer to participate, in
      the same way that my dad&#39;s grid-based map game was an invitation to
      imagine new worlds. What appears inevitable on the screen is anything
      but. The graph paper says: you can make your own icons, too.
    </p>

      I think that if you want to know how something is made, you should look
      for the grids. They are the ever-present, behind-the-scenes structure of
      our cities, our machines, our homes, and our lives. You&#39;ll find the grid
      in the artist&#39;s studio, in the patterns of the textile weaver&#39;s pattern
      book, in the architect&#39;s floor plan sketches, in the engineer&#39;s CAD
      software; even the monospaced fonts that programmers use fit to the
      grid. The grid can be found throughout history, from
      <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ks3JNA8BhnAC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22It+is+possible+that+the+concept+of+coordinates+grew+out+of+the+Egyptian+use+of+square+grids+to+copy+or+enlarge+artwork,+square+by+square.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rwv_PkC_ML&amp;sig=ACfU3U0O3JNutJuEvjqYHUHpjA6ZVsg4tA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjowcSN06r9AhUeE1kFHaI-AjgQ6AF6BAgGEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%20is%20possible%20that%20the%20concept%20of%20coordinates%20grew%20out%20of%20the%20Egyptian%20use%20of%20square%20grids%20to%20copy%20or%20enlarge%20artwork%2C%20square%20by%20square.%22&amp;f=false">ancient
        Egyptian architectural plans</a>
      to
      <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/368249">medieval European embroidery designs</a>. These
      artifacts trace the practitioner’s process along the grid&#39;s
      axial constraints.

      The grid is the lens through which we understand the natural world. It
      abstracts over the messy reality of blobs, fluids, particles, trees,
      mountains, oceans and streams. Seen through the grid, all of the objects
      you touch, all of the landscapes you see, all the experiences you live,
      happen in the same place. That place has a name, <i>space</i>, and it is
      measured, quantified, and standardized by the grid, tamed by its regular
      meter. No nook or cranny of nature is safe from this blanket of
      rationalization, stretching to cover the entire Earth in a global-scale
      grid of longitude and latitude.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      As a kid, you might not fully understand the power the grid confers, but
      you have a sense of it. You are probably introduced to the idea through
      play. When I asked my dad, in the course of writing this essay, where
      <i>he</i>
      first encountered a coordinate grid, he told me it was the game
      Battleship.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Battleship, you place a set of ships onto a grid representing the
      ocean, hidden from your opponent. You take turns naming a row and a
      column of your opponent’s hidden grid to bomb, and your opponent
      responds with whether your attempt was a hit or miss, a fact that you
      record in order to guide further strikes. Here the addressability of the
      grid becomes a tool for military tactics, the coordinate system a
      technology of toy violence. Grid-based games like Battleship and Chess
      demonstrate a grown-up truth about the rationalization of space: those
      who can map and navigate space can also dominate it. Perhaps my
      childhood infatuation with grids was at least partly an infatuation with
      the control of space — the coordinate index of my imaginary island
      hinting at a desire to conquer that island, to own it by trapping it in
      the grid’s net.

      As I waited in line to enter the museum, I saw my dad&#39;s name on a
      promotional poster for the same exhibit. 11 years after Susan Kare
      sketched her icons in the graph paper notebook, my dad and his brother
      created a computer game called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>. The game was
      groundbreaking for its time, earning praise and accolades throughout the
      90&#39;s, although I now find it is rare to encounter someone under the age
      of thirty who has played it. I went to the exhibition to witness Susan
      Kare&#39;s graph paper notebook, and ran into my dad&#39;s legacy, the man who
      inspired my love for graph paper in the first place. I felt a surge of
      pride at this surprise. I wanted to tell the museum visitors next to me
      in line, “That’s my dad! He’s in the MoMA!” I kept my cool and pretended
      it was normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exhibition activated a constellation of memories: my childhood
      preoccupation with graph paper, the imaginary maps my dad helped me
      draw, my love for pixelated iconography, the pseudo-games I created with
      HyperCard. The humble graph paper notebook in front of me at the Museum
      of Modern Art now became the center of this constellation; it was the
      hub that linked these personal experiences together. Then my grid-vision
      exploded outwards from this center, enveloping everything, and I dreamed
      that the grid was the understructure to not just my own memories but to
      the world. I think we project grids outwards onto the world from within
      ourselves, shining their structure from our minds. We radiate grids. If
      you are caught in the beam of someone else’s grid, as I was in my dad’s,
      the grid’s virality will infect you. Its intoxicating pattern will flow
      through your thoughts and become the architecture of your reality. You
      will radiate the grid too.
