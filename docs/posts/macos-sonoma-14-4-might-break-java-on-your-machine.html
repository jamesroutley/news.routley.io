                    <p>A bug in the release version of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos-sonoma" title="macOS Sonoma" data-kpt="1">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.4 causes Java processes to terminate unexpectedly, so Mac users who need to run Java should delay updating.
</p><p>The new issue is affecting all versions of Java from version 8 on up, including current early access builds. There is currently no workaround available, <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8327860" title="Java bug documentation">according</a> to Oracle.
</p><p>The flaw wasn&#39;t seen in the betas leading up to the release of 14.4, according to Oracle Senior Director of Product Management Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro. &#34;Ahead-of-Time compiled applications created with GraalVM Native Image should not be affected, but your ability to build new images may be,&#34; he noted in <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/java-on-macos-14-4" title="Oracle blog post about the bug">a post</a> warning about the flaw.
</p><p>Oracle has notified its partners in OpenJDK, customers, and Apple of the problem. Since there is no easy way to revert a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos" title="macOS" data-kpt="1">macOS</a> update, affected <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-silicon" title="Apple Silicon" data-kpt="1">Apple Silicon</a> Mac users who have already upgraded to version 14.4 will have to wait for a fix from Apple to overcome the issue.
</p><p>If users have a cloned copy of their previous complete system configuration, they may be able to return to that in order to keep running Java until the solution is found. The problem does not affect most typical Mac users, as Java was <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/10/16/software-update-removes-apple-provided-java-applet-plug-in" title="AppleInsider article about Apple removing Java from Macs">deprecated</a> for the Mac back in 2012.
</p><p>This new report comes alongside other, unrelated problems found in the final release of macOS 14.4. The update has caused some <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/12/latest-macos-sonoma-update-is-breaking-some-usb-hubs-in-monitors" title="14.4 final release breaks some third-party monitor hubs">in-monitor hubs</a> from third parties to stop working, as well as removing or corrupting <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/14/the-macos-sonoma-144-update-is-breaking-printers-for-some-users" title="AppleInsider article on macOS 14.4 breaking some printer drivers">some printer drivers</a>.</p>
