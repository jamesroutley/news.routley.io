    <h1>Jeffgeerling.com has been migrated to Hugo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><div><section><p>Since 2009, this website has <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2009/moved-drupal-hello-drupal">run on Drupal</a>. Starting with Drupal 6, and progressing through major site upgrades and migrations to 7, 8, 9, and 10, I used the site as a way to dogfood the same CMS (Content Management System) I used in my day job for <em>over a decade</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/jeffgeerling-old-drupal.png" alt="JeffGeerling.com - Old Drupal site" width="700" height="auto"/></figure><p>But as time progressed—especially after completing a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-8-live">grueling upgrade from Drupal 7 to 8</a>—my enthusiasm for maintaining what&#39;s now a more enterprise-focused <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/what-digital-experience-platform-dxp">Digital Experience Platform</a> or &#39;DXP&#39; for a personal blog has waned.</p><p>Not to mention, the blog is a passion project. I use it as a scratchpad for thoughts, and deeper dives for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling">my YouTube videos</a>. Time spent maintaining a complex CMS is time I can&#39;t spend actually <em>writing</em> (not to mention time spent on everything else in life!).</p><h2 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo?</h2><p>I&#39;ve moved other hobby sites to static hosting. For older sites I don&#39;t actively update, I <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/drupal-on-mothballs-convert-static-html">scrape and mothball</a> them. But for sites I wanted to keep active, I converted them to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, both of which are competent and full-featured modern SSGs (Static Site Generators).</p><p>Jekyll is perfect for the static sites I host for free on GitHub Pages, like the <a href="https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com">Raspberry Pi PCIe Database</a> or <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com">Project MINI RACK</a>, but I&#39;m not a Ruby programmer, so I like Hugo for anything I run on my <em>own</em> infrastructure (like <a href="https://www.geerlingengineering.com">Geerling Engineering</a>). It&#39;s simpler to set up and a little faster.</p><h2 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h2><p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been working on the migration in <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/issues/158">this GitHub issue</a>, and there are bound to be mistakes, broken image references, and probably some old URLs that just go <em>poof</em>!</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/jeffgeerling-new-hugo.png" alt="JeffGeerling.com - New Hugo site" width="700" height="auto"/></figure><p>I try to keep everything where it is, or add redirects. But with 20 years of baggage and 3500+ posts (many of those were individual photos converted into &#39;blog&#39; nodes in a prior upgrade... oops!), it&#39;s hard to run a perfect migration.</p><h2 id="markdown-workflow">Markdown Workflow</h2><p>I&#39;ve been writing all my posts in Markdown <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/issues/13">since 2020</a>, and even before that, was drafting them in Markdown in Sublime Text, then exporting that to HTML via <a href="https://facelessuser.github.io/MarkdownPreview/">MarkdownPreview</a>.</p><p>So having a tool (Hugo) that uses Markdown natively is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Beyond that, I&#39;ve grown fond of &#39;sticking to the defaults&#39; over the years. On my initial Drupal 6 site, I installed something like 30 modules (plugins in Drupal parlance), but almost all of those modules bit me in one way or another as I upgraded to Drupal 7, 8, 9, or 10...</p><p>Honestly, upgrading from 8 to 9 to 10 was easier than 6 to 7 and 7 to 8, simply because I had stripped my site down to the basics.</p><p><em>However</em>, in so doing, I also made my content authoring experience a bit horrid:</p><ol><li>Write a blog post on my computer in a Markdown file</li><li>Create new unpublished Drupal blog post</li><li>Paste the Markdown content into the body and add a title</li><li>Individually upload each picture</li><li>Put cursor where each picture goes in the content, scroll down to the uploaded picture, click &#39;Insert&#39; to insert the preformatted <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> markup, and rinse-and-repeat for all images (sometimes up to 25-30 per post!).</li><li>Clear out the &#39;Authored on&#39; field to make sure the date would update when I publish the post</li><li>Toggle the &#39;Published&#39; option and save the node</li><li>Run an Ansible playbook to drop Drupal caches, Nginx caches, and trigger a Cloudflare purge of the relevant URLs (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/three-ddos-attacks-on-my-personal-website">ongoing DDoSes since 2022</a> caused me to <em>really</em> lock down my caching)...</li></ol><p>It was a <em>lot</em>. Just to publish a blog post—and none of that helped with writing or being creative, it was just a bunch of work.</p><p><em>Yes</em>, I could automate each step in Drupal. There are even modules for Drupal, like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/scheduler">Scheduler</a> for scheduling posts and updating publish dates, and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cloudflare">Cloudflare</a> for purging CDN cache... but you know what? I used to use those modules, but after four Drupal upgrade cycles, I was burned out on managing patches for months, years, or <em>indefinitely</em> since some of the modules took that long to have a stable release for [current Drupal version].</p><p>And don&#39;t get me started on having to rebuild entire content authoring workflows (e.g. WYSIWYG editors, media management, and content fields) every time a major Drupal version was released! That specific type of churn, thankfully, is not <em>as</em> bad these days, but it was <em>really</em> bad prior to Drupal 10 or so.</p><p>For <em>Hugo</em>, since my workflow already started with a Markdown file... the whole process is done after step 1, basically.</p><p>To publish, I guess I <em>do</em> have to update the <code>date</code> in my post&#39;s frontmatter, and change <code>draft</code> to <code>false</code>, but that&#39;s about it. <code>hugo &amp;&amp; git commit -m &#34;Updated post.&#34; &amp;&amp; git push</code> and the blog is up to date!</p><p>And for maintenance, don&#39;t get me started on managing Composer, Drush, PHP, MariaDB, Nginx, Cloudflare, etc. — for an enterprise website, with multiple content workflows, dozens or hundreds of users with RBAC, etc., sure, it&#39;s fine. But for a blog where I just want to <em>write</em> and <em>publish</em>, it has been wearing me down for the past few years.</p><h2 id="todos">TODOs</h2><p>Comments will be missing site-wide initially, as I&#39;ve chosen to tackle a <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/issues/167">self-hosted static site commenting system</a> in a &#39;phase two&#39;. I love having comments enabled, despite the moderation overhead, and don&#39;t think blogging is the same without them.</p><p>I also loved having integrated site search, since I use my blog as a project journal, referencing it often. The Drupal site was integrated into an Apache Solr search instance I also ran as part of <a href="https://hostedapachesolr.com">Hosted Apache Solr</a>... which I sunset years ago at this point. So I&#39;ll have to decide <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/issues/168">how I want to implement search within Hugo</a>.</p></section></div></div></article></div></div>
