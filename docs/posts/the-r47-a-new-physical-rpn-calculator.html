    <h1>The R47: A new physical RPN calculator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>The next RPN scientific</h4><p>The R47 is a powerful, RPN-based programmable scientific calculator with an extensive feature set. Its software has been refined over many years, born from the vision of a <em>dream calculator</em> developed by a team of engineers and mathematicians, all dedicated calculator enthusiasts.</p><h4>Background and lineage</h4><p>Community-developed and manufactured by SwissMicros, the R47 runs firmware that is functionally identical to that of the <a href="https://www.47calc.com">C47</a>, which offers a way to transform a <a href="https://www.swissmicros.com/product/model-dm42n">DM42n</a> into a feature-rich RPN calculator using a dedicated keypad overlay.</p><p>The C47/R47 firmware originated as a fork of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/rpncalculators/wp43">WP43</a> project, itself derived from the WP34S. A core component carried through this lineage is the decNumber library by Mike Cowlishaw, also used in GCC for precise decimal arithmetic.</p><p>Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-41C">HP‑41C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-42S">HP‑42S</a>, the R47 builds on this foundation with a redesigned keypad featuring two shift keys, preserving a familiar feel while being entirely new in execution.</p><h4>R47 calculator features</h4><ul role="list"><li><strong>Advanced Math Capabilities:</strong><ul role="list"><li>Solve equations and systems of equations.</li><li>Perform definite and indefinite integration.</li><li>Handle matrix and vector calculations.</li><li>Work with complex numbers.</li><li>Utilize base-n arithmetic.</li><li>Provides 34 digits of precision; exponents to ±6144; up to 1000 named variables.</li><li>Utilizes scientific calculator functions like trigonometry, hyperbolics, logs, and antilogs.</li><li>Features a 2-variable statistics with best-fit modelling and basic plotting.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Programming and Editing:</strong><ul role="list"><li>Create programs using a multi-line editor.</li><li>Keystroke programmable with tests, flags, looping, and branching.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Engineering and Utilities:</strong><ul role="list"><li>Conduct financial and date-based calculations, including time value of money operations.</li><li>Apply built-in unit conversions and library of constants.</li><li>Perform date and time math as well as built-in clock.</li><li>Equation writer with support for solving, numeric integration and derivatives, and basic plotting.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Display and User Interface:</strong><ul role="list"><li>Features a high-resolution display with 4 stack levels, 3 rows of menus, and status bar always shown.</li><li>User-customizable keyboard and softkey-based menus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data Management:</strong><ul role="list"><li>I/O to built-in flash memory or via USB for backing up and restoring states, programs, and configuration.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>‍</h3><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div><div><p>‍</p><div><table>
