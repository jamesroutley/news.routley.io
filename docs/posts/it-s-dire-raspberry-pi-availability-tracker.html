    <h1>It&#39;s dire: Raspberry Pi availability tracker</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday André Costa emailed me about his new website, <a href="https://rpilocator.com">rpilocator</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a website to track Raspberry Pi 4 model B, Compute Module 4, Pi Zero 2 W, and Pico availability across multiple retailers in different countries.</p>

<p>In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This database was created out of frustration trying to locate a Raspberry Pi product in the height of the chip and supply chain shortages of 2021. I got tired of visiting multiple websites every day trying to figure out if there were any Raspberry Pi&#39;s in stock. I coded this website in a few days during my spare time and had it hosted on a Raspberry Pi for a couple of weeks before deciding to make it publicly available. This is not hosted on a Raspberry Pi anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>André has tried including all the official Pi vendors (who contractually will sell Pi models at MSRP and not the insane markups you&#39;ll find on eBay or Amazon), but some block script-based access, so only about half the vendors are currently accounted for.</p>

<p>Checking yesterday, two models were available—across all the 29 models tracked. And today that number&#39;s down to one, a lonely CM4 model with 2 GB of RAM, 32 GB eMMC storage, and WiFi/Bluetooth.</p>

<p>When will the situation improve? Well, there&#39;s this, straight from the horse&#39;s mouth:</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ex-stock availability is going to take a while, but we&#39;re planning to build ~150ku this quarter, and nearly ~500ku next quarter. That compares to 250ku in the whole of 2021.</p>— Eben Upton (@EbenUpton) <a href="https://twitter.com/EbenUpton/status/1486107991271260168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2022</a></blockquote>



<p>It seems the CM4 availability <em>may</em> improve later this year, but when exactly is anyone&#39;s guess. Many people see lead times of &#34;late 2022&#34; or &#34;January 2023&#34;, and think the worst, but usually if it&#39;s more than six months out, that just means the retailer is like <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code> and it could be anywhere from weeks to years before they get stock.</p>

<p>For the Pi 4, the situation may improve even sooner:</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re building as fast as we can, prioritising 2GB and 4GB, but 8GB stock should start to flow through in the next few weeks.</p>— Eben Upton (@EbenUpton) <a href="https://twitter.com/EbenUpton/status/1483013315462930435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2022</a></blockquote>



<p>But it remains to be seen. Right now, the best we can do is dig through drawers and boxes and find that old Pi 3 model B to tide us over until a Pi 4 is available again...</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://rpilocator.com">https://rpilocator.com</a> — and at least for Newark, PiShop, SparkFun, Seeed Studio, Farnell, The Pi Hut, and Adafruit, maybe it can save you a few dozen page refreshes every day.</p></div></div>
