    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
      Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops
      in and says something in the lines of,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span>Foobar123:</span>
      <p>
        Any Java experts around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is bad form, for several reasons. What the person is
      <em>actually</em> asking here is,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span>Foobar123:</span>
      <p>
        Any Java experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my
        problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it&#39;s not actually
        related to Java or if someone who doesn&#39;t know anything about Java
        could actually answer my question?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would
      not admit to it. By asking, you&#39;re asking for more than what you think
      you&#39;re asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You&#39;re asking people to take responsibility. You&#39;re questioning people&#39;s
      confidence in their abilities. You&#39;re also unnecessarily walling other
      people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I
      have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way)
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it can be seen as..
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span>Foobar123:</span>
      <p>
        I have a question about Java but I&#39;m too lazy to actually formalize it
        in words unless there&#39;s someone on the channel who might be able to
        answer it
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ..which is just lazy. If you&#39;re not willing to do the work to solve your
      problem, why should we?
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling
      on the channel and only every now and then glances what&#39;s going on is
      unlikely to answer to your &#34;asking to ask&#34; question, but your actual
      problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, don&#39;t ask
      <em>&#34;Any Java experts around?&#34;</em>,
      but rather ask
      <em>&#34;How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?&#34;</em>
