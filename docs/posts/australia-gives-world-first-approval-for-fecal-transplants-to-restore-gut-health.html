    <h1>Australia gives world-first approval for fecal transplants to restore gut health</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Australia has given regulatory approval for faecal transplants, the first country in the world to do so.</p><p>For such a transplant, poo donors – who have to meet a list of conditions – provide healthy genetic material from their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/11/unlocking-the-gut-microbiome-and-its-massive-significance-to-our-health" data-link-name="in body link">microbiomes</a>. The microbes are collected and delivered into the gastrointestinal tract of an unhealthy person, where they have been shown to treat conditions such as the potentially deadly bacteria <em>Clostridium difficile colitis</em> (<em>C diff</em>).</p><p>Transplants are currently delivered through the colon, but oral delivery is expected to be available before too long.</p><p>BiomeBank, in Adelaide, is the first company in the world to have regulatory approval for a donor-derived microbiome therapy.</p><ul>

</ul><p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration granted approval for faecal microbiota transplants as a low-risk biological for the “restoration of gut microbiota in the management of gastrointestinal disorders”.</p><p>The managing director of BiomeBank, Sam Costello, said the product had been provisionally available to patients for several years, but regulation would ensure “essentially a pharmaceutical standard”.</p><p>“We’re the first to meet that standard,” he said.</p><p> “That approval should give doctors confidence to prescribe this therapy.”</p><p>Human microbiomes – particularly in western countries – have become increasingly depleted from both environmental and dietary changes. </p><figure id="02276d29-7330-4f3a-80b9-ee88f4ae8d82" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:10,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/super-poo-the-emerging-science-of-stool-transplants-and-designer-gut-bacteria&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Super poo: the emerging science of stool transplants and designer gut bacteria&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;02276d29-7330-4f3a-80b9-ee88f4ae8d82&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-10 | 10" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Studies have found links between the microbiome and mental health, cancer, immunity, obesity and other conditions.</p><p>The TGA approval is only for the treatment of recurrent <em>C diff</em>, but Costello said it opened a path to approve microbiome therapies for other conditions.</p><p><em>C diff</em> is a common gut bacteria that can turn toxic and cause severe diarrhoea and illness in vulnerable people. It often spreads in hospitals and can be resistant to treatment.</p><p> BiomeBank has been building a library with strains of bacteria from donors to tackle <em>C diff</em> and, eventually, other disorders. </p><p>BiomeBank’s head of donor screening, Dr Emily Tucker, said it had been a challenge to get the right donors since the pandemic subsided.</p><p>While people were unable to travel they weren’t picking up exotic gut parasites, and fewer people were getting sick as a side effect of avoiding Covid, so there were fewer colds or antibiotic prescriptions, all of which rule out potential donors.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"></figure><p>Good donors are sometimes called unicorns because they are so rare. They have to be screened and assessed as healthy before making a donation in a special donor room, after which the right strains of bacteria are isolated and categorised. The donors receive a small compensation for their time.</p><p>“It has been tricky,” Tucker said.</p><p>“But we’ve got a good collection of donors now. It’s hard work to find them, but they become really engaged and driven by the desire to provide something that does so much good.”</p><p>As for those on the receiving end, Tucker says people should speak to their doctor.</p><p>“There are very well-defined criteria for which patients would be able to have this therapy,” she said.</p><p>The next stage, Costello said, was to create a second-generation artificial version that can be scaled up and taken to the world – a “super poo” that can target specific diseases.</p><p>“Our main ambition is to create a cultured version of the product,” he said.</p><p>“We have a large culture collection of strains, of individual bacteria that have been collected from these screened donors and we are working to culture these together to create an artificial version of a faecal community.</p><p>“Such a therapy would have advantages in the sense it wouldn’t need donors and would be able to be more closely defined in its composition and also scalable so you could supply a far larger number of patients more easily.”</p></div></div></div>
