    <h1>VLC tops 6B downloads, previews AI-generated subtitles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">VLC media player, the popular open-source software developed by nonprofit VideoLAN, has topped 6 billion downloads worldwide and teased an AI-powered subtitle system.</p>

<p>The new feature automatically generates real-time subtitles — which can then also be translated in many languages — for any video using open-source AI models that run locally on users’ devices, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud services, VideoLAN demoed at CES.</p>







<p>The firm didn’t say when it planned to rollout the feature.</p>

<p>VideoLAN started in 1996 as a project by students at Ecole Centrale Paris trying to stream videos across campus. Unlike many open-source projects that have struggled to survive on donations alone, VLC has maintained its free, ad-free model while expanding across multiple operating systems. The media player continues to operate without advertising, data collection, or commercial revenue streams.</p>

<p>“The number of active users of VLC is actually growing, even in this age of streaming services,” VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282533937812258816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post.</p>
