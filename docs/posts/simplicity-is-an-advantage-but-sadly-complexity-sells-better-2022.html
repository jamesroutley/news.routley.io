    <h1>Simplicity is an advantage but sadly complexity sells better (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We sometimes hear of a paper submission being rejected because the method was too simple, or a promotion being denied because the work artifacts lacked complexity. I think this can be partly explained by Dijkstra‚Äôs quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSimplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.‚Äù ‚Äî <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra" target="_blank">Edsger Dijkstra</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-does-complexity-sell-better">Why does complexity sell better?</h2>
<p><strong>Complexity signals effort.</strong> Papers with difficult ideas and technical details suggest blood, sweat, and tears. Systems with more components and features hint at more effort than systems with less. Because complex artifacts are viewed as requiring more effort, they‚Äôre also deemed as more challenging to create and thus more worthy. And because of the perceived effort involved, they‚Äôre often judged to be higher quality.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity signals mastery.</strong> A complex system with many moving parts suggests that the designer has proficiency over each part and the ability to integrate them. Inaccessible papers peppered with jargon and proofs demonstrate expertise on the subject. (This is also why we quiz interview candidates on algorithms and data structures that are rarely used at work.) If laymen have a hard time understanding the complex idea or system, its creator must be an expert, right?</p>
<p><strong>Complexity signals innovation.</strong> Papers that invent entirely new model architectures are recognized as more novel relative to papers that adapt existing networks. Systems with components built from scratch are considered more inventive than systems that reuse existing parts. Work that <em>just</em> builds on or reuses existing work isn‚Äôt <em>that</em> innovative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe idea is too simple, almost like a trick. It only changes one thing and everything else is the same as prior work.‚Äù ‚Äî Reviewer 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Complexity signals more features.</strong> Systems with components that can be mixed and matched suggest flexibility to cover all the bases. For example, supporting both SQL and NoSQL data stores, or enabling both batch and streaming pipelines. Because complex systems have more lego blocks relative to simple systems, they‚Äôre considered more adaptable and better able to respond to change.</p>
<p>All in all, the above leads to <a href="https://fs.blog/complexity-bias/" target="_blank">complexity bias</a> where we give undue credit to and favour complex ideas and systems over simpler ones.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-simplicity-an-advantage">Why is simplicity an advantage?</h2>
<p><strong>Simple ideas and features are easier to understand and use.</strong> This makes them more likely to gain adoption and create impact. They‚Äôre also easier to communicate and get feedback on. In contrast, complex systems are harder to explain and manage, making it difficult for users to figure out what to do and how to do it. Because there are too many knobs, mistakes are more frequent. Because there are too many steps, inefficiency occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Simple systems are easier to build and scale.</strong> Systems that require less rather than more components are easier to implement. Using standard, off-the-shelf technology also makes it easier to find qualified people who can implement and maintain it. And because simpler systems have less complexity, code, and intra-system interactions, they‚Äôre easier to understand and test. In contrast, needlessly complex systems require more time and resources to build, leading to inefficiency and waste.</p>

<p>When Instagram was acquired in 2012, it had a 13-person team serving tens of millions of users. It <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/89025069/Mike-Krieger-Instagram-at-the-Airbnb-tech-talk-on-Scaling-Instagram" target="_blank">scaled</a> and kept operational burden per engineer low by <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad" target="_blank">sticking to proven technologies</a> instead of new, shiny ones. When other startups adopted trendy NoSQL data stores and struggled, Instagram kept it lean with battle-proven and easy-to-understand PostgreSQL and Redis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Simple systems have lower operational costs.</strong> Deploying a system is not the finish line; it‚Äôs the starting line. The bulk of the effort comes <em>after</em> the system is in production, likely by <em>someone other than the original team</em> that built it. By keeping systems simple, we lower their maintenance cost and increase their longevity.</p>
<p>Simple systems have fewer moving parts that can break, making them more reliable and easier to fix. It‚Äôs also easier to upgrade or swap out individual components because there are fewer interactions within the system. In contrast, complex systems are more fragile and costly to maintain because there are so many components that need to be grokked by a limited team. Having more interdependent parts also makes troubleshooting harder.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-rewarding-complexity">What‚Äôs wrong with rewarding complexity?</h2>
<p><strong>It incentivizes people to make things unnecessarily complicated.</strong> Using simple methods or building simple systems may appear easier and is thus valued less. As a result, people game the system to get more rewards and the simplest solution is no longer the most obvious one. Complexity begets more complexity, eventually making it impossible to work.</p>
<p><strong>It also encourages the ‚Äúnot invented here‚Äù mindset</strong> where people prefer to build from scratch and shun reusing existing components even though it saves time and effort. This wastes time and resources and often leads to poorer outcomes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most promotion processes overemphasize complexity in work artifacts.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simple solutions are easier to implement and scale than complex solutions. However promotions often are rewarded to those who create complex solutions. We need to start acknowledging the power of simple. Don‚Äôt accept complex. It‚Äôs a trap.</p>‚Äî Bryan Liles (@bryanl) <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1555619528096235525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2022</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>Ditto for machine learning paper submissions.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A common point raised by ML reviewers is that a method is too simple or is made of existing parts. But simplicity is a strength, not a weakness. People are much more likely to adopt simple methods, and simple ones are also typically more interpretable and intuitive. 1/2</p>‚Äî Micah Goldblum (@micahgoldblum) <a href="https://twitter.com/micahgoldblum/status/1554485034744160258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>(If your idea didn‚Äôt get the credit it deserves, take comfort in the fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1548321060201803776" target="_blank">breakthroughs</a> such as Kalman Filters, PageRank, SVM, LSTM, Word2Vec, Dropout, etc got rejected too. We‚Äôre generally bad at assessing how useful or impactful an innovation will be. ü§∑)</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-think-about-complexity-instead">How should we think about complexity instead?</h2>
<p><strong>The objective should be to solve <em>complex</em> problems with as <em>simple</em> a solution as possible.</strong> Instead of focusing on the complexity of the <em>solution</em>, we should focus on the complexity of the <em>problem</em>. A simple solution demonstrates deep insight into the problem and the ability to avoid more convoluted and costly solutions. Often, the best solution is the simple one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler‚Äù ‚Äî Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead of having a complex, catch-all solution, consider multiple focused solutions.</strong> A one-size-fits-all solution is usually less flexible and reusable than expected. And because it serves multiple use cases and stakeholders, it tends to be ‚Äútightly coupled‚Äù and require more coordination during planning and migrations. In contrast, it‚Äôs easier to operate‚Äîand unavoidably, deprecate‚Äîsingle-purpose systems.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-juice-worth-the-squeeze">Is the juice worth the squeeze?</h2>
<p>One way to overcome the complexity bias is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#39;s_razor" target="_blank">Occam‚Äôs razor</a>. It states that the simplest solution or explanation is usually the right one. Thus, let‚Äôs not be too quick to dismiss simple ideas or add unnecessary complexity to justify their worth.</p>
<p>Alternatively, ask yourself: Given the cost of complexity, is the juice worth the squeeze?</p>
