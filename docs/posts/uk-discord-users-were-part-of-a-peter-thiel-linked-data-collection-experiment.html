            <p>
Discord have belatedly confirmed that they&#39;re working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord&#39;s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an &#34;experiment&#34; involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>

<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an &#34;experiment&#34;, isn&#39;t it? Never mind that Discord <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-promise-they-wont-force-everybody-to-do-a-face-scan-following-outrage-at-new-age-verification-policy">assured us earlier</a> that &#34;identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.&#34; Discord haven&#39;t yet said what the &#34;experiment&#34; is supposed to explore or prove. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine, though. It&#39;s not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord&#39;s new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>&#34;If you&#39;re located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what&#39;s truly needed for age verification is used.&#34;</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new &#34;age assurance&#34; system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona&#39;s involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here&#39;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona&#39;s lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were The Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA&#39;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren&#39;t responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn&#39;t seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir&#39;s UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley&#39;s grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification &#34;experiment&#34; bearing Thiel&#39;s fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord&#39;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.
