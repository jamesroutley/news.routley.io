        <p><span>Scientists at Harvard Medical School have designed a versatile, ChatGPT-like AI model capable of performing an array of diagnostic tasks across multiple forms of cancers. </span></p><p><span>The new AI system, described </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07894-z"><span>Sept. 4 in</span><em><span> Nature</span></em></a><span>,</span><em><span> </span></em><span>goes a step beyond many current AI approaches to cancer diagnosis, the researchers said. </span></p><p><span>Current AI systems are typically trained to perform specific tasks — such as detecting cancer presence or predicting a tumor’s genetic profile — and they tend to work only in a handful of cancer types. By contrast, the new model can perform a wide array of tasks and was tested on 19 cancer types, giving it a flexibility similar to that of large language models such as ChatGPT.</span></p><p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/sign-email-communications"><span><strong>Get more HMS news here</strong></span></a></p><p><span>While </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07441-w"><span>other foundation AI models</span></a><span> for medical diagnosis based on pathology images have emerged recently, this is believed to be the first to predict patient outcomes and validate them across several international patient groups.</span></p><p><span>“Our ambition was to create a nimble, versatile ChatGPT-like AI platform that can perform a broad range of cancer evaluation tasks,” said study senior author </span><a href="https://yulab.hms.harvard.edu/yu/"><span>Kun-Hsing Yu</span></a><span>, assistant professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. “Our model turned out to be very useful across multiple tasks related to cancer detection, prognosis, and treatment response across multiple cancers.”</span></p>
