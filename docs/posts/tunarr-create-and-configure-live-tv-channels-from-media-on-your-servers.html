<p>Create live TV channels from media on your Plex/Jellyfin servers, and more!</p>
<p>Configure your channels, programs, commercials, and settings using the Tunarr web UI.</p>
<p>Watch your channels by adding the spoofed Tunarr HDHomerun tuner to Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby. Or utilize generated M3U files with any 3rd party IPTV player app.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?<a href="#what-is-this" title="Permanent link">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Tunarr was originally a fork of <a href="https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv"><strong>dizqueTV</strong></a> (which in itself was a fork of other projects!) which evolved into a near-complete rewrite. This project was born out of both a love for TV and an appreciation for the work put into dizqueTV and its predecessors.</p>
<p>Tunarr has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernize the stack, both backend and frontend</li>
<li>Provide an <a href="https://tunarr.com/getting-started/setup/#migrating-from-dizquetv">migration path</a> for existing users</li>
<li>Stabilize the program, fix bugs, and improve performance (Tunarr currently is developed and tested on Node 20.11.1, which offers <a href="https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023">non-trivial performance improvements</a> over previous versions)</li>
<li>Modernize and &#34;prettify&#34; the Web UI</li>
<li>And of course, <strong>Add a ton great new features!</strong></li>
</ul>
