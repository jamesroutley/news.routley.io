            <p>Gather round young&#39;uns, let me tell you of a time where the the Internet only existed when you sought it out rather than embedding itself in virtually every aspect of our existence. Typically this would be at a single place in the home, something like the desk pictured above.</p><p>I think back to my time with the computer during those days and I vividly remember <em>looking forward</em> to spending time on it. Today it&#39;s impossible to get away from it, with hundreds of notifications a day and an expectation that you&#39;ll always be available at a moment&#39;s notice.</p><p>I suppose that&#39;s the trade-off for all the world&#39;s knowledge in your hand. I&#39;m still not convinced it&#39;s a good deal. Instant gratification and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA&amp;ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">algorithms everywhere</a> has fried our brains a bit.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently taken a break from a lot of social media, especially heavily algorithmic ones, and was wondering what it might be like if we could have The Internet Desk again.</p><p>The way I envisioned this is your computer (a MacBook Pro in this case) has its internet access removed if it&#39;s not at your desk. It&#39;s not perfect, and obviously doesn&#39;t work for cell phones, but it&#39;s a start.</p><p>Here&#39;s how it looks in action before I get into the details. This is the &#34;<a href="https://github.com/kjoconnor/the-internet-desk/blob/main/aesthetic-automation.yaml?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">aesthetic</a>&#34; version that comes complete with a dialup modem sound and an associated waiting period to let you really think about how you plan to spend your online time. There&#39;s also a <a href="https://github.com/kjoconnor/the-internet-desk/blob/main/utilitarian-automation.yaml?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">utilitarian</a> one that lets you get right to business with no waiting period.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGEfCJhw5x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Internet Desk"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>It&#39;s a little tough to see, but I tried to illustrate network connectivity by keeping a </span><a href="https://browserping.com/?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer"><span>Browser Ping</span></a><span> tab open to show when I had network access vs not.</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking it down</h2><p>There&#39;s a few problems to solve here:</p><ul><li>How do we tell if the computer is at the desk?</li><li>How do we give the user some acknowledgement or ambience that it&#39;s Internet Time?</li><li>How do we actually limit internet access in a fairly quick on/off way?</li></ul><h3 id="presence-detection">Presence Detection</h3><p>We want to be able to detect the presence of a device with a few conditions:</p><ol><li>We should aim detect it as fast as possible</li><li>It shouldn&#39;t require any software at all on the target device</li><li>It shouldn&#39;t require any special device in any port on the target device</li><li>It should require no action from the user other than setting down or picking up the device from the desk</li></ol><p>I ended up going with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">NFC</a>. I felt this was a good fit because you can apply tags in as simple a form factor as a <a href="https://www.tagstand.com/product-categories/tag/sticker/?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">sticker</a>, they require no power, and are easily read by very low cost hardware. With the way I ended up designing things, I don&#39;t need to store any data on the tag itself, but you easily can store small amounts of data. In retrospect this might have been useful, but maybe I&#39;ll get to that in a future iteration.</p><p>On the hardware side I went with an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">Adafruit ESP32 Feather</a> and a PN532 board that handles NFC reading. My typical way of working here is to start in Arduino land, so I was using the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">Adafruit PN532 library</a> to mess around with it while I figured out the pin arrangements.</p><p>I initially tried using it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">I²C</a> mode, which is generally the easiest way of connecting these things, and I just could not get it to work. Did I have the GPIO pinout wrong? Does the library not work for the particular board I have? Are the dipswitches on the board wrong? I didn&#39;t even know there were dipswitches originally, and then when I did find them, trying to figure out the right arrangement seemed pretty difficult.</p><figure><img src="https://rulethepla.net/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="550" height="519"/><figcaption><span>The dipswitches to control the mode (between I²C, UART, SPI) in the bottom left. Can you figure it out?</span></figcaption></figure><p>This part of the project is probably what took me the longest and was by far the most annoying. There&#39;s just so many different board configurations and revisions between the ESP32s and this NFC reader that you&#39;re just left with a lot of trial and error to find what will work. I moved on to HSU (High Speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">UART</a>) before finally biting the bullet and soldering on 6 more pin headers to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">SPI</a> which is supposedly more reliable with these (quite old) boards. It finally ended up working and I could read tag data.</p><p>To make this work with the device, I put the reader on the desk under a pad and then stuck an NFC card to the bottom of my MacBook. I ended up running into an issue where if NFC tags are touching metal they stop working, so I put a bunch of electrical tape and some anti-static bags under it to give it a barrier from the MacBook&#39;s metal case and it worked well enough for a proof of concept.</p><p>OK - so we have tag data...now what? How do we take some actions in response to recognizing a tag?</p><figure><pre><code>spi:

I went with a couple different ones:</p><ul><li>one was the Aesthetic version that changes the lights, plays a dialup tone and some other <a href="https://archive.org/details/im_20191103/Welcome.wav" rel="noreferrer">familiar</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/im_20191103/Goodbye.wav" rel="noreferrer">sounds</a>, and then changes the network state</li><li>the other just changes the lights and proceeds as fast as possible to change the network state as requested</li></ul><p>The automation has a mapping of NFC Tag ID -&gt; MAC address of the device I&#39;m targeting, which leads to the next section.</p><h3 id="network-blocking">Network Blocking</h3><p>At home I run <a href="https://www.ui.com/?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">Unifi</a> equipment to power my network. The wonderful thing about Home Assistant is there&#39;s an integration for everything, and my network equipment is no exception. I already had my network in HA, and I just had to create a <code>switch</code> entry in its integration that matched my MacBook&#39;s MAC address and it would allow me to toggle its access to my network on and off. Easy!</p><h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading!</h2><p>In day to day usage, I&#39;d use the utilitarian version of the automation, but the aesthetic one is fun. Very nostalgic. You used to have a few seconds to think about what cool Geocities website you&#39;d try and check out before you got connected.</p><p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/kjoconnor/the-internet-desk?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><p>I have a few more projects I plan on sharing here in this vein, so if you&#39;re interested please sign up below or follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rulethepla.net?ref=rulethepla.net" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p>
