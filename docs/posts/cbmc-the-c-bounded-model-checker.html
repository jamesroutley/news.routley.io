      <span>Abstract:</span>  The C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) demonstrates the violation of assertions
in C programs, or proves safety of the assertions under a given bound. CBMC
implements a bit-precise translation of an input C program, annotated with
assertions and with loops unrolled to a given depth, into a formula. If the
formula is satisfiable, then an execution leading to a violated assertion
exists. CBMC is one of the most successful software verification tools. Its
main advantages are its precision, robustness and simplicity. CBMC is shipped
as part of several Linux distributions. It has been used by thousands of
software developers to verify real-world software, such as the Linux kernel,
and powers commercial software analysis and test generation tools. Table 1
gives an overview of CBMC&#39;s features. CBMC is also a versatile tool that can be
applied to solve many practical program analysis problems such as bug finding,
property checking, test input generation, detection of security
vulnerabilities, equivalence checking and program synthesis. This chapter will
give an introduction into CBMC, including practical examples and pointers to
further reading. Moreover, we give insights about the development of CBMC
itself, showing how its performance evolved over the last decade.
