    <h1>Why do domain names sometimes end with a dot?</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! When I was writing the zine <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/">How DNS Works</a>
earlier this year, someone asked me &ndash; why do people sometimes put a dot at the
end of a domain name? For example, if you look up the IP for <code>example.com</code> by
running <code>dig example.com</code>, you&rsquo;ll see this:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig example.com
example.com.		5678	IN	A	93.184.216.34
</code></pre>

<p><code>dig</code> has put a <code>.</code> to the end of <code>example.com</code> &ndash; now it&rsquo;s <code>example.com.</code>! What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p>Also, some DNS tools require domains to have a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> at the end: if you try to pass <code>example.com</code> to <a href="https://github.com/miekg/dns">miekg/dns</a>, like this, it&rsquo;ll fail:</p>

<pre><code>// trying to send this message will return an error
m := new(dns.Msg)
m.SetQuestion(&quot;example.com&quot;, dns.TypeA)
</code></pre>

<p>Originally I thought I knew the answer to this (&ldquo;uh, the dot at the end means
the domain is fully qualified?&ldquo;). And that&rsquo;s true &ndash; a fully qualified domain
name is a domain with a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end!</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t explain <em>why</em> dots at the end are useful or important.</p>

<h3 id="in-a-dns-request-response-domain-names-don-t-have-a-trailing">in a DNS request/response, domain names don&rsquo;t have a trailing &ldquo;.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I once (incorrectly) thought the answer to &ldquo;why is there a dot at the end?&rdquo;
might be &ldquo;In a DNS request/response, domain names have a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end, so we
put it in to match what actually gets sent/received by your computer&rdquo;. But
that&rsquo;s not true at all!</p>

<p>When a computer sends a DNS request or response, the domain names in it don&rsquo;t
have a trailing dot. Actually, the domain names don&rsquo;t have <em>any</em> dots.</p>

<p>Instead, they&rsquo;re encoded as a series of length/string pairs. For example,
the domain <code>example.com</code> is encoded as these 13 bytes:</p>

<pre><code>7example3com0
</code></pre>

<p>So there are no dots at all. Instead, an ASCII domain name (like &ldquo;example.com&rdquo;)
gets translated into the format used in a DNS request / response by various DNS
software.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about one place where domain names are translated into DNS responses: zone files.</p>

<h3 id="the-trailing-in-zone-files">the trailing &ldquo;.&rdquo; in zone files</h3>

<p>One way that some people manage DNS records for a domain is to create a text
file called a &ldquo;zone file&rdquo; and then configure some DNS server software (like <code>nsd</code>
or <code>bind</code>) to serve the DNS records specified in that zone file.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an imaginary zone file for <code>example.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>orange  300   IN    A     1.2.3.4
fruit   300   IN    CNAME orange
grape   3000  IN    CNAME example.com.
</code></pre>

<p>In this zone file, anything that doesn&rsquo;t end in a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> (like <code>&quot;orange&quot;</code>) gets
<code>.example.com</code> added to it. So <code>&quot;orange&quot;</code> is shorthand for
<code>&quot;orange.example.com&quot;</code>. The DNS server knows from its configuration that this
is a zone file for <code>example.com</code>, so it knows to automatically append
<code>example.com</code> at the end of any name that doesn&rsquo;t end with a dot.</p>

<p>I assume the idea here is just to save typing &ndash; you could imagine writing
this zone file by fully typing out all of the domain names:</p>

<pre><code>orange.example.com.  300   IN    A     1.2.3.4
fruit.example.com.   300   IN    CNAME orange.example.com.
grape.example.com.   3000  IN    CNAME example.com.
</code></pre>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a lot of typing.</p>

<h3 id="you-don-t-need-zone-files-to-use-dns">you don&rsquo;t need zone files to use DNS</h3>

<p>Even though the zone file format is defined in the official DNS RFC (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-4.1.1">RFC 1035</a>), you don&rsquo;t have to
use zone files at all to use DNS. For example, AWS Route 53 doesn&rsquo;t use zone
files to store DNS records! Instead you create records through the web
interface or API, and I assume they store records in some kind of database and
not a bunch of text files.</p>

<p>Route 53 (like many other DNS tools) does support importing and exporting zone
files though and it can be a good way to migrate records from one DNS provider
to another.</p>

<h3 id="the-trailing-in-dig">the trailing &ldquo;.&rdquo; in dig</h3>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about <code>dig</code>&rsquo;s output:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig example.com
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.18.1-1ubuntu1.1-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; +all example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 10712
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;example.com.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.		81239	IN	A	93.184.216.34

</code></pre>

<p>One weird thing about this is that almost every line starts with a <code>;;</code>. What&rsquo;s
up with that? Well <code>;</code> is the comment character in zone files!</p>

<p>So I think the reason that dig prints out its output in this weird way is so that
if you wanted, you could just paste this into a zone file and have it work
without any changes.</p>

<p>This also explains why there&rsquo;s a <code>.</code> at the end of <code>example.com.</code> &ndash; zone files
require a trailing dot at the end of a domain name (because otherwise they&rsquo;re
interpreted as being relative to the zone). So <code>dig</code> does too.</p>

<p>I really wish dig had a <code>+human</code> flag that printed out all of this information
in a more human readable way, but for now I&rsquo;m too lazy to put in the work to
actually contribute code to do that (and I&rsquo;m a pretty bad C programmer) so I&rsquo;ll
just complain about it on my blog instead :)</p>

<h3 id="the-trailing-in-curl">the trailing <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> in curl</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about another case where the trailing <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> shows up: curl!</p>

<p>One of the computers in my house is called &ldquo;grapefruit&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s running a
webserver. Here&rsquo;s what happens if I run <code>curl grapefruit</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl grapefruit
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works! Cool. But what happens if I add a <code>.</code> at the end? Suddenly it doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl grapefruit.
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: grapefruit.
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on? To understand, we need to learn about search domains:</p>

<h3 id="meet-search-domains">meet search domains</h3>

<p>When I run <code>curl grapefrult</code>, how does that get translated into a DNS request?
You might think that my computer would send a request for the domain
<code>grapefruit</code>, right? But that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use <code>tcpdump</code> to see what domain is actually being looked up:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo tcpdump -i any port 53
[...] A? grapefruit.lan. (32)
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually sending a request for <code>grapefruit.lan</code>. What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p>Well, what&rsquo;s going on is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>To look up <code>grapefruit</code>, <code>curl</code> calls a function called <code>getaddrinfo</code></li>
<li><code>getaddrinfo</code> looks in a file on my computer called <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code></li>
<li><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> contains these 2 lines:
<pre>
nameserver 127.0.0.53
search lan
</pre></li>
<li>Because it sees <code>search lan</code>, <code>getaddrinfo</code> adds a <code>lan</code> at the end of <code>grapefruit</code> and looks up <code>grapefruit.lan</code> instead</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="when-are-search-domains-used">when are search domains used?</h3>

<p>Now we know something weird: that when we look up a domain, sometimes an extra
thing (like <code>lan</code>) will be added to the end. But when does that happen?</p>

<ol>
<li>If we put a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> at the <strong>end</strong> of the domain (like <code>curl grapefruit.</code>, then search domains aren&rsquo;t used</li>
<li>If the domain has an <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> <strong>inside</strong> it (like <code>example.com</code> has a dot in it), then by default search domains aren&rsquo;t used either. But this can be changed with configuration (see this blog post about <a href="https://pracucci.com/kubernetes-dns-resolution-ndots-options-and-why-it-may-affect-application-performances.html">ndots</a> that talks about this more)</li>
</ol>

<p>So now we know why <code>curl grapefruit.</code> has different results than <code>curl grapefruit</code> &ndash; it&rsquo;s because one looks up the domain <code>grapefruit.</code> and the other one looks up <code>grapefruit.lan.</code></p>

<h3 id="how-does-my-computer-know-what-search-domain-to-use">how does my computer know what search domain to use?</h3>

<p>When I connect to my router, it tells me that its search domain is <code>lan</code> with
DHCP &ndash; it&rsquo;s the same way that my computer gets assigned an IP address.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-do-people-put-a-dot-at-the-end-of-domain-names">so why do people put a dot at the end of domain names?</h3>

<p>Now that we know about zone files and search domains, here&rsquo;s why I think people
like to put dots at the end of a domain name.</p>

<p>There are two contexts where domain names are modified and get something else added to the end:</p>

<ul>
<li>in a zone file for <code>example.com</code>, <code>grapefruit</code> get translated to <code>grapefruit.example.com</code></li>
<li>on my local network (with my computer configured to use the search domain <code>lan</code>), <code>grapefruit</code> gets translated to <code>grapefruit.lan</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So because domain names can actually be translated to something else in some
cases, people like to put a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> at the end to communicate &ldquo;THIS IS THE
DOMAIN NAME, NOTHING GETS ADDED AT THE END, THIS IS THE WHOLE THING&rdquo;. Because
otherwise it can get confusing.</p>

<p>The technical term for &ldquo;THIS IS THE WHOLE THING&rdquo; is <strong>&ldquo;fully qualified domain
name&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;FQDN&rdquo;</strong>. So <code>google.com.</code> is a fully qualified domain name, and
<code>google.com</code> isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I always have to remind myself for the reasons for this because I rarely use
zone files or search domains, so I often feel like &ndash; &ldquo;of course I mean
<code>google.com</code> and not <code>google.com.something.else</code>! Why would I mean anything
else?? That&rsquo;s silly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But some people do use zone files and search domains (search domains are used
in Kubernetes, for example!), so the &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end is useful to make it 100%
clear that nothing else should be added.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-put-a-at-the-end">when to put a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end?</h3>

<p>Here are a couple of quick notes about when to put a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end of your domain names:</p>

<p><strong>Yes: when configuring DNS</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never bad to use fully qualified domain names when configuring DNS. You
don&rsquo;t always have to: a non-fully-qualified domain name will often work just
fine as well, but I&rsquo;ve never met a piece of DNS software that wouldn&rsquo;t accept a
fully qualified domain name.</p>

<p>And some DNS software requires it: right now the DNS server I use for <code>jvns.ca</code>
makes me put a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> at the end of domains names (for example in CNAME records)
and warns me otherwise it&rsquo;ll append <code>.jvns.ca</code> to whatever I typed in. I don&rsquo;t
agree with this design decision but it&rsquo;s not a big deal, I just put a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at
the end.</p>

<p><strong>No: in a browser</strong></p>

<p>Confusingly, it often <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> work to put a <code>&quot;.&quot;</code> at the end of a domain name in a
browser! For example, if I type <code>https://twitter.com.</code> into my browser, it
doesn&rsquo;t work! It gives me a 404.</p>

<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on here is that it&rsquo;s setting the HTTP Host header to
<code>Host: twitter.com.</code> and the web server on the other end is expecting <code>Host: twitter.com</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>https://jvns.ca.</code> gives me an SSL error for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="i-think-relative-domain-names-used-to-be-more-common">I think relative domain names used to be more common</h3>

<p>One last thing: I think that &ldquo;relative&rdquo; domain names (like me using
<code>grapefruit</code> to refer to the other computer in my house, <code>grapefruit.lan</code>) used
to be more commonly used, because DNS was developed in the context of
universities or other big institutions which have big internal networks.</p>

<p>On the internet today, it seems like it&rsquo;s more common to use &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; domain
names (like <code>example.com</code>).</p>
