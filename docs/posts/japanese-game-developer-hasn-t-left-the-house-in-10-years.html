</div><section id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">            <p>Staying at home as often as most people have been over the past year or so is relatively new. But Japanese game developer Nito Souri had no such adjustment to make as he&#39;s stayed indoors for the better part of 10 years and didn&#39;t have to be convinced by <a href="https://gamerant.com/japan-super-famicom-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the availability of a free Famicom</a> or various companies <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/square-enix-encouraging-gamers-stay-home-free-games/">hooking gamers up with freebies</a> to get them to remain inside.</p>
        <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->            <p>A hikikomori, which loosely translates to a modern-day hermit, Nito is just one of around one million people in Japan who identify as such. Typically, they isolate at home for six-month periods and don&#39;t go to school, work, or make contact with anyone other than family.</p>
                    
                    <p>Per <a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/game-developer-hasnt-left-home-in-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITK</a>, Nito only leaves his apartment to get a haircut and take out the trash, as well as any other activity that absolutely requires him to step outside of the comfort of his room. He gets all of his groceries and whatever else he needs delivered, eliminating the need to go shopping.</p>
        <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->            <p>Nito became a hikikomori after finding it hard to land a job after college or become a novelist, as he&#39;d aspired to be. He decided to return to his hometown and took up residence at his aunt&#39;s apartment, by himself.</p>
                    <p>Since then, he&#39;s learned English, started up a YouTube channel and learned game development en route to launching his first game with the help of a Kickstarter. The upcoming Pull Stay is, as you would expect, modeled around his principles and requires players to protect their hikikomori master by basically beating people who try entering his house for whatever reason.</p>
                    <p>The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179890/Pull_Stay/#:~:text=Pull%20Stay%20is%20a%20wacky,2022%20April" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases on Steam in 2022</a>.</p>
        <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
            <p>“I had no friends in my hometown and felt rushed to become financially independent as soon as possible, feeling ashamed to go outside. So I became a hikikomori,” he told <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/04/d5183b807f64-feature-what-japans-hikikomori-can-teach-us-about-self-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyodo News</a> last year. “In the last 10 years, I was able to create whatever I wanted to create, so even if there were struggles, I enjoyed it.</p>
                    <p>Nito hopes Pull Stay will make him enough money to get him out of the house once the COVID-19 pandemic is over as he would like to try working away from home. In the meantime, he&#39;s likely going to continue leaving the house to get his hair trimmed.</p>

            <p>Kavan Flavius is a games and sports writer from Saint Lucia who also contributes to other Valnet sites other than TheGamer, including TheSportster, TheRichest and Hotcars. As you can see, he&#39;s trying to get that young Kratos/old Kratos look going but has realized it&#39;s not going to be that easy (head tattoo incoming, in case you were wondering). Kavan is an absolute sucker for NBA basketball, Premier League football and videogames. His all-time favorite videogame, as if you couldn&#39;t already tell, is God of War but FIFA ranks right up there. He&#39;s also got lots of love for those two Destiny titles.
