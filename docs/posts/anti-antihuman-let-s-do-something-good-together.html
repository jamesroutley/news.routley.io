	<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Anton here. As some of you might know I’m originally from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Almost 3 years ago russia launched full scale invasion of my home country. Almost 11 years ago russia started the war annexing Crimea and launching military operation in the east of Ukraine.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s do something good <b>together</b>.</p>
<p><b>Donate money to any Ukrainian nonprofit and I will personally match it.</b></p>
<p>All you need is to make your donation and send me a screenshot and I will do my matching donation(and I will send you my screenshot back and full video later).</p>
<p>Good part is that I can double my donation too. So in reality if you donate 10 USD, I will donate 10 USD personally and will get 10 USD extra match. So your 10 USD will turn into 30 USD.</p>
<p>You can donate to any Ukrainian nonprofit you want. Or it can be your local organization that helps Ukraine.</p>
<p>I personally recommend donating to this organization <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-once"><u>https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-once</u></a>. It’s been active(and very efficient) since 2014 when russia started the war.</p>
<p>Another good option is this <a href="https://prytulafoundation.org/en"><u>https://prytulafoundation.org/en</u></a>.</p>
<p>Or if you are US based you can donate to this organization <a href="https://novaukraine.org/"><u>https://novaukraine.org/</u></a>. It’s proven too and I know them personally and donated many times before.</p>
<p>PS I did a similar donations matching thing on Feb 24, 2022. You can see it here <a href="https://x.com/podviaznikov/status/1497000422774558728"><u>https://x.com/podviaznikov/status/1497000422774558728</u></a>. I will post video of me doing all the matches.</p>
<p>Anton</p>
