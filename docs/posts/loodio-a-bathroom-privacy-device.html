    <h1>Show HN: Loodio – A Bathroom Privacy Device</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hi HN!<p>A few years ago our company moved to a new office. That office has a insufferable bathroom in terms of privacy. You could hear a needle fall on the floor inside of it which made it very uncomfortable to use the bathroom.</p><p>Many people ran the tap water or fake coughed to cover their “noises”, especially doing “no 2”.</p><p>I got sick of not being able to be comfortable in the bathroom and hearing everyone’s toilet business so I decided to make a music player using a Raspberry Pi and soldered on a motion detector that started a white noise and music whenever you entered the bathroom to hide these sounds.</p><p>A lot of people said they wanted one so I thought hey I should try to make this into a product.</p><p>A lot of time and money was wasted hiring consultants until I 13 months ago said “enough of wasting money, I’ll just build it myself”.</p><p>Today I launched a kickstarter and am selling 50 units.</p><p>Link: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loodio/loodio-bathroom-privacy" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loodio/loodio-bathroom-...</a></p><p>I know people in US have loud fans and such to cover for this, and a lot of people just play music on their phones but the problem with that is: when you manually play music in there you indicate you are going to do something embarrassing!</p><p>How else are you solving this problem?</p><p>I tried all existing solutions like the Sound Princess from Japan and other chinese crap on Amazon/Ali but they were not up to the task.</p><p>I think there could be a market for Loodio. 
What do you think?</p></div></div>
