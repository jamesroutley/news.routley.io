    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP Theorem</a> is a
    fundamental theorem in distributed systems that states any distributed
    system can have at most two of the following three properties.

      <li><strong>C</strong>onsistency</li>

    <h2>What is the CAP Theorem?</h2>
    <p>
    The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously be
    consistent, available, and partition tolerant. Sounds simple enough, but
    what does it mean to be consistent? available? partition tolerant? Heck,
    what exactly do you even mean by a distributed system?
    </p>

    <p>
    In this section, we&#39;ll introduce a simple distributed system and explain
    what it means for that system to be available, consistent, and partition
    tolerant.  For a formal description of the system and the three properties,
    please refer to
    <a href="http://lpd.epfl.ch/sgilbert/pubs/BrewersConjecture-SigAct.pdf">
      Gilbert and Lynch&#39;s paper</a>.

    <h2>A Distributed System</h2>
    <p>
    Let&#39;s consider a very simple distributed system. Our system is composed of
    two servers, $G_1$ and $G_2$. Both of these servers are keeping track of
    the same variable, $v$, whose value is initially $v_0$. $G_1$ and $G_2$
    can communicate with each other and can also communicate with external
    clients. Here&#39;s what our system looks like.
    </p>

    </center>

    <p>
    A client can request to write and read from any server. When a server
    receives a request, it performs any computations it wants and then responds
    to the client. For example, here is what a write looks like.

      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap4.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    And here is what a read looks like.
    </p>

    </center>

    <p>
    Now that we&#39;ve gotten our system established, let&#39;s go over what it means
    for the system to be consistent, available, and partition tolerant.
    </p>

    <h2>Consistency</h2>
    <p>
    Here&#39;s how Gilbert and Lynch describe consistency.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    any read operation that begins after a write operation completes must
    return that value, or the result of a later write operation
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In a consistent system, once a client writes a value to any server and gets
    a response, it expects to get that value (or a fresher value) back from any
    server it reads from.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is an example of an <strong>inconsistent</strong> system.
    </p>

      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap8.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap9.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap10.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap11.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    Our client writes $v_1$ to $G_1$ and $G_1$ acknowledges, but when it
    reads from $G_2$, it gets stale data: $v_0$.
    </p>

    <p>
    On the other hand, here is an example of a <strong>consistent</strong>
    system.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap12.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap13.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap14.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap15.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap16.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap17.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap18.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap19.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    In this system, $G_1$ replicates its value to $G_2$ before sending an
    acknowledgement to the client. Thus, when the client reads from $G_2$, it
    gets the most up to date value of $v$: $v_1$.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    Here&#39;s how Gilbert and Lynch describe availability.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a
    response
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In an available system, if our client sends a request to a server and the
    server has not crashed, then the server must eventually respond to the
    client. The server is not allowed to ignore the client&#39;s requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Partition Tolerance</h2>
    <p>
    Here&#39;s how Gilbert and Lynch describe partitions.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    the network will be allowed to lose arbitrarily many messages sent from one
    node to another
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This means that any messages $G_1$ and $G_2$ send to one another can be
    dropped.  If all the messages were being dropped, then our system would
    look like this.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap20.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    Our system has to be able to function correctly despite arbitrary network
    partitions in order to be partition tolerant.
    </p>

    <h2>The Proof</h2>
    <p>
    Now that we&#39;ve acquainted ourselves with the notion of consistency,
    availability, and partition tolerance, we can prove that a system cannot
    simultaneously have all three.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume for contradiction that there does exist a system that is consistent,
    available, and partition tolerant. The first thing we do is partition our
    system. It looks like this.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap21.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    Next, we have our client request that $v_1$ be written to $G_1$. Since
    our system is available, $G_1$ must respond. Since the network is
    partitioned, however, $G_1$ cannot replicate its data to $G_2$. Gilbert
    and Lynch call this phase of execution $\alpha_1$.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap22.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap23.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap24.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    Next, we have our client issue a read request to $G_2$. Again, since our
    system is available, $G_2$ must respond. And since the network is
    partitioned, $G_2$ cannot update its value from $G_1$. It returns $v_0$.
    Gilbert and Lynch call this phase of execution $\alpha_2$.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap25.svg"/>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap26.svg"/>
    </center>

    <p>
    $G_2$ returns $v_0$ to our client after the client had already written
    $v_1$ to $G_1$. This is inconsistent.
    </p>

    <p>
    We assumed a consistent, available, partition tolerant system existed, but
    we just showed that there exists an execution for any such system in which
    the system acts inconsistently. Thus, no such system exists.
