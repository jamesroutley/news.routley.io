        <p>Last month, the UBL announced that it will deselect an extensive collection of foreign dissertations. We are happy to report now that The Internet Archive will be taking over this collection.</p>
        <div>
<p><span><span>The dissertations were originally part of an exchange programme between (mostly European) universities until the year 2004 but were never catalogued on arrival</span></span><span><span>. </span></span><span><span>As Leiden University Libraries has limited space for growth in its stacks</span></span><span><span>, it decided to deselect these dissertations, so that 3.2 km could be freed up for new acquisitions. The universities where these dissertations originally were defended informed UBL that they still have the dissertations and were not interested in receiving back the Leiden copy. The Internet Archive will now take over this collection from the UBL, and will take care of its future preservation and access. The UBL is pleased that The Internet Archive is able to give this collection of foreign dissertations a second life.</span></span></p>    <!-- Image block 1.0 -->
