<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Wrote RC niceties</li>



<li>Reviewed what I’ve done at RC so far and made goals for what I want to work on during my last week of batch and beyond</li>



<li>Read <em>Grokking Algorithms</em></li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>This was my second time writing <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-26-css-translate/">niceties</a> at the Recurse Center, and since this is also the end of my batch, there were many more people I wanted to thank and compliment, people that have encouraged and motivated me over the past three months. I’m grateful for the chance I’ve had to meet and interact with so many incredibly talented people and grateful to RC for bringing us together.</li>
</ul>
