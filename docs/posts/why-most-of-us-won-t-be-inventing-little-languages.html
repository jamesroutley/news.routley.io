<p><a name="little_languages"></a><b>Why most of us won&#39;t be inventing little languages</b></p>

<p>
Sergey Dmitriev (CEO of JetBrains) recently wrote an <a href="http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/articles/04/10/lop/">article</a>
arguing that it should be easier to write computer programs in
domain-specific languages.  I have great respect for the developers of
IntelliJ IDEA and look forward to seeing new tools from them, but I
think his justification for writing these new tools doesn&#39;t really
hold water.
</p>


<p>
Sergey seems to believe that the main barrier preventing the invention
of new computer languages is that it&#39;s too difficult to write
language-specific tools.  While that&#39;s a natural argument for a tools
vendor to make, l think it misses something fundamental about
language.  The real downside of inventing a new language isn&#39;t that
you have to write new editors, compilers, and many other tools.  It&#39;s
that other people won&#39;t understand you.
</p>

<p>
If you&#39;re writing a technical article in a natural language such as
English, you can easily invent new technical terms - your word
processor doesn&#39;t care.  But if you&#39;re the only one who uses those
terms, your writing will be obscure and difficult to read.  Anyone
interested in reading your papers will have to learn your jargon
first.  You have a lot better chance of success if you write clearly
with as little jargon as possible.  Or at least, use the jargon that&#39;s
popular in whatever community you belong to, if you&#39;re not trying for
wider influence.
</p>

<p>
We do invent new terms all the time, sometimes for good reasons.  But
this has to be done slowly because the community needs time to learn
them, or reject them, as the case may be.  Many popular articles are
concerned with introducing just one new concept, such as the recent
Wired article populizing the phrase &#34;the long tail&#34; - or Sergy&#39;s
attempt to popularize &#34;Language Oriented Programming&#34;.
</p>

<p>
Computer languages work similarly; a language becomes more useful when
more people understand it.  No matter how expressive a language is and
how good its compilers are, if your library requires learning a new
language, few will use it, and fewer still will be able to maintain
it.  The difficulty of writing good language-specific IDE&#39;s reinforces
this tendency, but it existed back when we were all using emacs and
vi.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s quite possible that languages like Lisp failed to become popular
(beyond a small community) partially because they encourage
programmers to write domain-specific languages.  This has a tendency
to fragment the community into groups that have trouble communicating
(a &#34;tower of babel&#34; effect).  It&#39;s also self-reinforcing - a language
without many libraries attracts people who are predisposed to reinvent
the wheel in the first place, so the body of actively-used common code
grows very slowly.  Much more code is shared in Java, but there are
still plenty of evolutionary dead ends - we don&#39;t need more reasons to
discourage sharing.
</p>

<p>
Also, Surgey seems to think that basic constructs we use for
object-oriented programming (classes and methods) are a limitation to
be overcome.  While sometimes they can be, they are also a strength,
just like any other widely used standard of communication.  It&#39;s
typical for Java applications to use dozens of separately developed
libraries.  This isn&#39;t something to take for granted, and one reason
it works is that no matter the domain, at the bottom it&#39;s all Java
method calls.  If each of these libraries were written in its own
little language, how would we integrate them?  API&#39;s need to have
something in common and there are few features of Java that don&#39;t have
something to do with an API.
</p>

<p>
I find somewhat strange, then, that Sergey believes that
object-oriented programming&#39;s limitations make libraries <i>more
difficult</i> to learn.  Learning to use the Swing API properly may be
difficult, but would it really be easier if the Swing developers
invented a new language to write it in?  When learning something new,
it&#39;s very helpful to be able to rely on what you already know - making
things more unfamiliar doesn&#39;t seem like much of an improvement.
</p>

<p>
I certainly don&#39;t mean to say that the tools JetBrains will write for
Language-Oriented Programming will be useless.  But they might be used
differently than Surgey imagines.  Web developers are already
maintaining programs that embed many little languages, including XML,
HTML, JavaScript, regular expressions, xpath, and SQL.  Based on this
experience, I expect the population of little languages to increase
slowly, and most teams won&#39;t invent their own.  The most common case
for IDE developers will be to write plugins for little languages that
already exist, not to provide tools for language inventors.
