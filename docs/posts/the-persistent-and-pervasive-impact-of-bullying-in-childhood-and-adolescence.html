children’s and adolescents’ adjustment difficulties and
well-being. In recent years, we have come to recognise that the impact of
childhood bullying victimisation on the development of mental health
problems is more complex. This paper aims to review the evidence for an
independent contribution of childhood bullying victimisation to the
development of poor outcomes throughout the life span, including mental,
physical and socioeconomic outcomes, and discuss the implications for policy
and practice.</p></div><div id="S2"><h3 id="S2title">Findings</h3><p id="P2">Existing research indicates that (a) being bullied in childhood is
associated with distress and symptoms of mental health problems. This large
body of evidence supports actions aimed at reducing the occurrence of
bullying behaviours; (b) the consequences of childhood bullying
victimisation can persist up to midlife and, in addition to mental health,
can impact physical and socioeconomic outcomes. These new findings indicate
that interventions should also focus on supporting victims of bullying and
helping them build resilience; (c) research has identified some factors that
predispose children to be targeted by bullying behaviours. These studies
suggest that public health interventions could aim at preventing children
from becoming the target of bullying behaviours from an early age.</p></div><div id="S3"><h3 id="S3title">Conclusions</h3><p id="P3">It is a truism to emphasise that further work is needed to understand
why and how young people’s aspirations are often cut short by this
all too common adverse social experience. In parallel, we must develop
effective strategies to tackle this form of abuse and its consequences for
the victims. Addressing bullying in childhood could not only reduce
children’s and adolescents’ mental health symptoms but also
prevent psychiatric and socioeconomic difficulties up to adulthood and
reduce considerable costs for society.</p></div></div><p><strong>Keywords: </strong><span>Bullying victimisation, mental health, physical health, socioeconomic outcomes, development, children, adolescents, life course</span></p></div><div id="S4"><h2 id="S4title">Introduction</h2><p id="P4">There is little doubt today that being bullied is an adverse and stressful
experience that casts a shadow on children’s and adolescents’
well-being and development. But this has not always been the view. After several
years of general scepticism about the true impact of bullying victimisation, it is
only recently that researchers, mental health professionals and policy makers have
started to pay attention to the potentially harmful consequences of being bullied in
early life. This change in perception is reflected in different ways. First, the
number of publications on the topic of bullying has grown exponentially since the
early 1990s (see <a href="#R74" rid="R74">Olweus, 2013</a>). This
accumulating evidence indicates that young victims of bullying are at risk of
showing adjustment problems and even developing severe mental health problems.
Second, another important consequence of increasing concerns relating to the impact
of childhood bullying victimisation is the development of intervention programmes
designed specifically to limit bullying behaviours at schools. The efficiency of
those programmes has been reviewed in meta-analytic studies that have reported mixed
results (<a href="#R110" rid="R110">Ttofi &amp; Farrington, 2011</a>).
Third, national policies have also responded to society’s greater awareness
of bullying. In the United Kingdom, all schools have a legal obligation to have
measures in place to prevent and handle forms of bullying among pupils and to inform
teachers, pupils and parents about these measures (<a href="#R34" rid="R34">Department for Education, 2017</a>). In the United States, more than 120
bills related to antibullying policies were adopted between 1999 and 2010 and a
total of 49 states have laws in place to tackle bullying behaviours at school (<a href="#R47" rid="R47">Hatzenbuehler, Schwab-Reese, Ranapurwala, Hertz,
&amp; Ramirez, 2015</a>). However, despite joint efforts to reduce
bullying and understand its consequences for the victims, this behaviour remains
frequent among young people.</p><p id="P5">This review paper aims to summarise findings on the impact of being bullied
from population-based samples with prospective measures of bullying victimisation in
childhood or early adolescence. It emphasises longitudinal studies that examined
mental health and other outcomes up to adulthood, and considers how these findings
may influence policy and practice. It also aims to provide pointers for future
research. This review paper does not report on children who bully others or focus on
the dyadic relationship between them and their victims. It does not focus on
bullying victimisation among specific groups such as children with developmental
disorders or disabilities, for example. This paper considers bullying as a global
form of abuse and does not distinguish specific types of bullying victimisation.
This review paper is timely in light of the emphasis of current policies on youth
mental health. It summarises the body of evidence so far on one of the most
prevalent risk factors for mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. It
also builds upon review papers published recently on the long-term outcomes of being
bullied (<a href="#R22" rid="R22">Brunstein Klomek, Sourander, &amp;
Elonheimo, 2015</a>; <a href="#R67" rid="R67">McDougall &amp;
Vaillancourt, 2015</a>; <a href="#R121" rid="R121">Wolke &amp;
Lereya, 2015</a>) and expands by raising important questions for policy and
practice: are we doing the right thing? Are we doing enough? This review is also
timely as we immerse ourselves in a new digital age which allows harassment and
bullying to be more insidious, as summarised by a previous review paper published in
this journal (<a href="#R64" rid="R64">Livingstone &amp; Smith,
2014</a>).</p></div><div id="S5"><h2 id="S5title">What is bullying?</h2><p id="P6">Bullying victimisation is the repeated occurrence of abuse between people
from the same age group where an imbalance of power makes it difficult for the
victims to defend themselves (<a href="#R72" rid="R72">Olweus, 1993</a>,
<a href="#R74" rid="R74">2013</a>). Bullying, a form of peer
victimisation, can take place between children, between adolescents or between
adults. It is not bullying when a parent or a teacher is abusive towards a child.
While the terms <em>peer victimisation</em> and <em>bullying</em>
are often used interchangeably, peer victimisation is not equivalent to bullying.
For example, it is not bullying when two people of about the same strength quarrel
or fight, but it is peer victimisation. An especially important feature of bullying
is the power imbalance between those who perpetrate bullying behaviours and their
victims. Strength, number or size of those involved can place the victims at a
disadvantage. The power imbalance can also be more subjective and difficult to
capture, involving factors such as popularity, intelligence or disabilities. It can
also be determined by the environment: a child who just joined a new school may be
at risk of being bullied by others, as would a child belonging to a minority group.
Dan Olweus, the founder of research on bullying, argued that the power imbalance is
best determined by the victims themselves (2013). Victims of bullying can also bully
other vulnerable youths. ‘Bully/victims’ represent a small but
distinct group of children who are involved in bullying both as a perpetrator and as
a victim. The distinction between bullying and peer victimisation may appear trivial
or pedantic but it is important when investigating the consequences of this form of
abuse. By definition, victims of bullying represent a group of individuals who, for
various reasons, are less likely to retaliate when confronted with abusive
behaviours from their peers. They constitute a heterogeneous and vulnerable group
who might be likely to experience adversity, adjustment difficulties or even mental
health problems at some point in their lives, despite the experience of bullying. It
is therefore reasonable to question whether the sheer act of being bullied truly
contributes to poor outcomes among the victims, and if so, how.</p><p id="P7">Determining the impact of childhood bullying victimisation on
children’s and adolescents’ mental health and well-being, as well as
reducing the occurrence of bullying behaviours, are important for several reasons.
First, bullying is common world-wide among children and adolescents. A survey of
children in nearly 40 countries indicated that approximately 13% of 11-year-olds
reported being the victims of bullying (<a href="#R125" rid="R125">World
Health Organisation, 2012</a>). Prevalence rates vary greatly across
countries, are commonly higher for boys compared to girls, and decline with age.
Rates across 11 European countries revealed a similar pattern: 20% of youth from 8
to 18 reported being bullied (<a href="#R2" rid="R2">Analitis et al.,
2009</a>); bullying victimisation was more prevalent among boys and tended to
decline with age. In the United Kingdom and in the United States, bullying,
including peer and sibling victimisation, is the most prevalent form of abuse across
all age groups up to 24 years (<a href="#R39" rid="R39">Finkelhor, Ormrod,
&amp; Turner, 2007a</a>; <a href="#R81" rid="R81">Radford, Corral,
Bradley, &amp; Fisher, 2013</a>). These prevalence rates reflect an
increase in bullying awareness which contrasts with early research when bullying was
studied almost exclusively in Scandinavian countries (<a href="#R72" rid="R72">Olweus, 1993</a>). Second, bullying is widespread across different
environments. It most commonly takes place in schools, but bullying can also occur
in other contexts, including in the neighbourhood or at home between siblings (<a href="#R122" rid="R122">Wolke &amp; Skew, 2012a</a>). Third, bullying
can be persistent across time and across settings (<a href="#R98" rid="R98">Sourander, Helstelä, Helenius, &amp; Piha, 2000</a>). Chronic
victimisation is not infrequent, even despite the transition to secondary school
during the early teenage years: of the children who were frequently bullied during
primary school in the United Kingdom, 43.1% of boys and 40.1% of girls remained
frequently bullied during secondary school (<a href="#R17" rid="R17">Bowes et
al., 2013</a>). These findings are in line with a previous study showing that
nearly half of age-11 young victims of bullying (43%) were still victims 3 years
later (<a href="#R87" rid="R87">Scholte, Engels, Overbeek, de Kemp, &amp;
Haselager, 2007</a>). Of the children who were not involved in bullying at
the first assessment, only 7% became victims later on. Lower stability in bullying
victimisation has also been reported (<a href="#R86" rid="R86">Schäfer, Korn, Brodbeck, Wolke, &amp; Schulz, 2005</a>). These
contrasting findings are possibly accounted for by the relatively short reporting
periods covered by the assessments. Fourth, bullying can take various forms. It can
be verbal such as threatening, taunting, spreading rumours or it can refer to
physical actions including pushing and kicking. It can be direct (e.g. verbal and
physical behaviours conducted in the context of face-to-face interactions) or
indirect (e.g. actions that do not necessarily require the bullies and the victims
to be present, like spreading rumours and excluding others). Fifth, bullying has
evolved with time. New technologies and social media platforms, easily accessible
via mobile phones or the Internet, provide countless opportunities for young people
to bully and damage the reputations of their victims, in front of large crowds of
witnesses who may exacerbate the abuse. Cyberbullying has been documented as a new
and harmful form of bullying, especially among adolescents (<a href="#R94" rid="R94">Smith et al., 2008</a>).</p></div><div id="S6"><h2 id="S6title">Adjustment problems associated with bullying victimisation</h2><p id="P8">As with victims of crimes or assaults, children and adolescents are likely to
get upset when targeted by abusive behaviours. Young victims can manifest signs of
psychological distress such as being tearful or irritable, losing motivation and
experiencing sleep problems. These could be considered as temporary reactions to a
stressful event and would normally recede with appropriate support when exposure to
bullying behaviours cease. Documented reactions associated with bullying
victimisation include being unhappy at school, difficulties in school adjustment and
poor school perceptions (<a href="#R5" rid="R5">Arseneault et al.,
2006</a>; <a href="#R46" rid="R46">Glew, Fan, Katon, &amp; Rivara,
2008</a>; <a href="#R53" rid="R53">Juvonen, Graham, &amp; Schuster,
2003</a>; <a href="#R69" rid="R69">Nansel, Craig, Overpeck, Saluja,
&amp; Ruan, 2004</a>), facing social problems such as being isolated and
feeling lonely (<a href="#R53" rid="R53">Juvonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#R55" rid="R55">Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpelä, Rantanen, &amp;
Rimpelä, 2000</a>; <a href="#R70" rid="R70">Nansel et al.,
2001</a>, <a href="#R69" rid="R69">2004</a>; <a href="#R87" rid="R87">Scholte et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#R115" rid="R115">Veenstra
et al., 2005</a>), and academic difficulties (<a href="#R17" rid="R17">Bowes et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#R46" rid="R46">Glew et al.,
2008</a>).</p><p id="P9">Victims of bullying can also manifest symptoms of psychological distress
commonly associated with psychopathology. Studies have found that bullied youth
showed an increased risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation (<a href="#R8" rid="R8">Barker, Arseneault, Brendgen, Fontaine, &amp; Maughan, 2008</a>;
<a href="#R43" rid="R43">Geoffroy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#R61" rid="R61">Lereya, Winsper et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#R89" rid="R89">Sibold, Edwards, Murray-Close, &amp; Hudziak,
2015</a>; <a href="#R111" rid="R111">Turner, Exum, Brame, &amp;
Holt, 2013</a>; <a href="#R119" rid="R119">Winsper, Leraya, Zanarini,
&amp; Wolke, 2012</a>), and especially among those victims who experienced
mental health problems, felt rejected at home or were maltreated by an adult, had
parents with emotional problems, or had a family history of attempted or completed
suicide (<a href="#R42" rid="R42">Fisher et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#R48" rid="R48">Herba et al., 2008</a>). Severe symptoms of
psychological distress are thus concentrated among bullied youth who show a range of
risk factors for mental health problems. While common signs of psychological
distress among victims of bullying may not require clinical interventions, more
severe manifestations including self-harm and suicidal ideation signal a profound
impact among some of those targeted by those who bully others. Such symptoms
necessitate prompt and adequate interventions by mental health professionals. These
also point towards a severe impact of bullying victimisation on mental health
problems in childhood and adolescence.</p></div><div id="S7"><h2 id="S7title">Contribution of bullying victimisation to the development of mental health
problems in childhood and adolescence</h2><p id="P10">Longitudinal study designs are instrumental for establishing the extent to
which being the victim of bullying is a contributing risk factor to the development
of mental health problems. Establishing temporal priority – what come first,
bullying victimisation or poor mental health – is an essential first step.
Indeed, one important alternative hypothesis that must be ruled out is that early
mental health symptoms account for both an increased risk for being targeted by
bullying behaviours and also for later psychopathology. Findings so far have shown
that over and above early signs of poor mental health prior to bullying
victimisation, being bullied in childhood or in adolescence is associated with new
symptoms/diagnoses of mental health problems, and especially with later symptoms of
anxiety and depression (<a href="#R5" rid="R5">Arseneault et al.,
2006</a>; <a href="#R16" rid="R16">Bowes, Joinson, Wolke, &amp;
Lewis, 2015</a>; <a href="#R58" rid="R58">Kim, Leventhal, Koh,
Hubbard, &amp; Boyce, 2006</a>; <a href="#R103" rid="R103">Stapinski
et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#R126" rid="R126">Zwierzynska, Wolke,
&amp; Leraya, 2013</a>). These studies are robust not only because they
controlled for symptoms prior to being bullied but they also controlled for a range
of other potential confounders, including gender, parental socioeconomic status and
low IQ. Bullying victimisation has also been associated with symptoms of rare mental
health problems in adolescence such as psychotic experiences: bullied youth, and
especially those who were frequently or severely bullied, have an increased risk for
reporting psychotic experiences in adolescence (<a href="#R3" rid="R3">Arseneault et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#R32" rid="R32">Cunningham,
Hoy, &amp; Shannon, 2016</a> for a review; <a href="#R57" rid="R57">Kelleher et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#R65" rid="R65">Mackie,
Castellanos-Ryan, &amp; Conrod, 2011</a>; <a href="#R88" rid="R88">Schreier et al., 2009</a>). One exception is a study that reported no
association between bullying victimisation in adolescence and psychotic experiences
after controlling for childhood behavioural problems and other forms of
victimisation (<a href="#R13" rid="R13">Boden, van Stockum, Horwood, &amp;
Fergusson, 2016</a>). This finding is possibly explained by the relatively
small number of youth who were exposed to a ‘high level’ of bullying
in this sample.</p><p id="P11">The extent to which being the victim of bullying contributes to the
development of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence has critical
implications for prevention and intervention efforts. Although these strategies are
important to safeguard the human rights of children, reducing bullying behaviour
could be an expensive and ineffective way of decreasing children’s early
symptoms of poor mental health if being bullied is spuriously associated with poor
outcomes. Strong and robust tests supporting the assumption that being bullied in
childhood can actually contribute to mental health problems remain sparse. One
reason for this is the limits of observational studies most commonly used to examine
the outcomes associated with being bullied in childhood and adolescence. Randomised
controlled trials would allow proper testing for a possible causal role of bullying
victimisation, but randomly assigning children to bullied and nonbullied conditions
is not an option for obvious ethical reasons. Researchers therefore have to resort
to using alternative study designs and statistical methods (<a href="#R51" rid="R51">Jaffee, Strait, &amp; Odgers, 2012</a>; <a href="#R83" rid="R83">Rutter, Pickles, Murray, &amp; Eaves, 2001</a>) to strengthen
the evidence clarifying the role of bullying victimisation for the development of
mental health problems. The discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design offers a
rigorous control for confounders by contrasting genetically identical individuals
drawn from the same family environment but who are exposed to distinct experiences
(<a href="#R117" rid="R117">Vitaro, Brendgen, &amp; Arseneault,
2009</a>). Because many early family experiences are necessarily the same
within pairs of twins who grow up together, shared environmental factors such as
poverty, domestic violence or maternal depression cannot account for the differences
in the outcome variables. Furthermore, because MZ twins are genetically identical,
variation in outcomes cannot be the result of genetic variations between the two
twins either. Therefore, the discordant MZ twin design can be used to test whether
being bullied in childhood has an environmentally mediated impact on the development
of mental health symptoms at a young age, over and above shared environmental and
genetic confounds. When applied to longitudinal data, the discordant MZ twin design
is a powerful methodological tool for investigating the pathway from bullying
victimisation to children’s developmental outcomes.</p><p id="P12">Three longitudinal studies have used the discordant MZ twin design to test
the robustness of the impact of being bullied in childhood on mental health
outcomes. A first study from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study
(<a href="#R68" rid="R68">Moffitt, 2002</a>) showed that MZ twins who
had been bullied by the age of 7 had more emotional problems at age 10 years
compared to their cotwins who had not been bullied (<a href="#R4" rid="R4">Arseneault et al., 2008</a>). This difference remained significant even
after controlling for emotional problems assessed when the twins were 5 years of
age, prior to being bullied. A second study from the Twins Early Development Study
(TEDS; <a href="#R107" rid="R107">Trouton, Spinath, &amp; Plomin,
2002</a>) found similar findings using a measure of peer victimisation in
early adolescence with a larger sample of twins: MZ twin differences in peer
victimisation were associated with differences in anxiety over the course of 2
years, even after controlling for prior anxiety, but became nonsignificant over 5
years (<a href="#R93" rid="R93">Singham et al., 2017</a>). Differences
remained significant, however, for measures of paranoid thoughts and cognitive
disorganisation (without control for prior measures). These findings may be taken to
suggest that the contribution of bullying victimisation to mental health problems is
not long-lasting. However, the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral
Development (<a href="#R35" rid="R35">Eaves et al., 1997</a>) indicated
otherwise, and extended others’ findings by examining mental health outcomes
both in childhood and in young adulthood. Results revealed that compared with their
nonbullied cotwins, bullied MZ twins were nearly twice as likely to have social
anxiety and separation anxiety in childhood and three times more likely to report
suicidal ideation in young adulthood (<a href="#R91" rid="R91">Silberg et
al., 2016</a>). Psychiatric disturbances prior to being bullied did not
differ between the bullied and nonbullied twins in this sample and therefore, could
not account for differences in outcomes. These three studies robustly demonstrate
that bullying victimisation contributes to later mental health outcomes: overall,
associations were not explained by prior symptoms or difficulties, and the
associations survived strict controls for confounders, including both family
background and genetic factors. This evidence suggests that if we eliminate bullying
behaviours, we should be successful at reducing mental health problems in
youths.</p><p id="P13">Despite these strong findings, not all bullied children end up developing
mental health problems. Studies testing the modifying effect of variables on
outcomes associated with bullying victimisation are also important. First, this
research may help disentangle and characterise subgroups of youth who are most
likely to develop problems as a consequence of being bullied. There are a few
examples of such studies focusing on biological factors. One study showed that
variation in the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) gene, involved in mood regulation
and depression, moderates children’s emotional problems in response to
bullying victimisation: frequently bullied children with the SS genotype were at
greater risk for developing emotional problems than were children with the SL or LL
genotypes (<a href="#R104" rid="R104">Sugden et al., 2010</a>). Another
study indicated that peer victimisation predicted symptoms of depression 1 year
later specifically among participants who showed high levels of anticipatory
salivary cortisol response (<a href="#R82" rid="R82">Rudolph, Troop-Gordon,
&amp; Granger, 2011</a>). This heightened anticipatory cortisol response
protected participants from depressive symptoms when they were exposed to low levels
of peer victimisation.</p><p id="P14">Second, studies of social factors can help identify targets for
interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of mental health problems. One study
demonstrated that most bullied young adolescents do not engage in self-harming
behaviours, but those who did were more likely to have a family member who had
attempted/completed suicide, compared to those who did not self-harm (<a href="#R42" rid="R42">Fisher et al., 2012</a>). They were also more
likely to have been physically maltreated by an adult and to present with conduct
disorder, borderline personality characteristics, depression and psychotic symptoms.
Another study reported that while self-blaming was not associated with a general
measure of peer victimisation, children who showed an inclination to blame
themselves also showed higher levels of emotional problems if victimised by their
peers (<a href="#R78" rid="R78">Perren, Ettekal, &amp; Ladd, 2013</a>).
A further study showed that bullied children who had highly supportive families had
fewer emotional and behavioural problems over time compared to those from less
supportive families (<a href="#R18" rid="R18">Bowes, Maughan, Caspi, Moffitt,
&amp; Arseneault, 2010</a>). Although maternal warmth, sibling warmth and
a positive atmosphere at home were associated with positive adjustment for both
bullied and nonbullied children, the effects of these protective family factors were
significantly stronger for bullied children compared to those who had not been
bullied. Findings from these last two studies have especially important implications
for clinical efforts: interventions focusing on negative cognitions and involving
families may have greater chances of tackling symptoms of mental health problems
among bullied children.</p><p id="P15">The evidence reviewed thus far indicates that being bullied in childhood is
not only associated with signs of psychological distress but also with symptoms of
mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. These findings support actions
to stop bullying behaviours in order to reduce suffering in youth and prevent the
development of mental health problems. Such actions are already in place.</p></div><div id="S8"><h2 id="S8title">The persistent effect of childhood bullying victimisation on mental health
problems</h2><p id="P16">To date, relatively little is known about the longterm impact of bullying,
as only a few longitudinal studies with prospective measures of bullying
victimisation in childhood have followed participants into adult life.
‘Long-term’ is characterised here not only by the age of the
participants when outcomes were assessed, but also by the time lag between exposure
to bullying victimisation and mental health problems. So far, four longitudinal
cohorts have documented the adult outcomes of childhood bullying victimisation, at
least 10 years apart, with adequate consideration for childhood mental health
problems and other confounders. The Epidemiologic Multicenter Child Psychiatric
Study is a prospective nationwide birth cohort study from Finland (<a href="#R1" rid="R1">Almqvist et al., 1999</a>). Information on bullying
victimisation was collected from parents, teachers and children themselves in 1989,
when the participants were aged 8 years. Findings from this cohort have indicated
that girls who were frequent victims of childhood bullying had increased rates of
suicide attempts and completed suicides up to age 25 (<a href="#R23" rid="R23">Brunstein Klomek et al., 2009</a>). Male participants who had been
victims of bullying had higher rates of anxiety disorders between ages 18 and 23
years (<a href="#R99" rid="R99">Sourander, Jensen, Rönning,
Niemelä et al., 2007</a>), and increased risk of heavy smoking (<a href="#R71" rid="R71">Niemelä et al., 2011</a>). Most data on
young adult outcomes in these studies were gathered from military call-up, national
psychiatric and hospital discharge registers, and thus may underestimate distress,
especially among females and victims who did not seek treatment.</p><p id="P17">This limitation was addressed in an accelerated population-based study with
outcome measures collected during research-based assessments, the Great Smoky
Mountain Study from North Carolina in the United States (<a href="#R29" rid="R29">Costello et al., 1996</a>). Information on bullying victimisation
was collected on multiple occasions from caregivers and children themselves when the
participants were between the ages of 9 and 16. Compared to those who had not been
bullied in childhood, victims of bullying, and especially bully/victims, had
increased rates of psychiatric disorders including agoraphobia, depression, anxiety
and panic disorders in their early to mid 20s, up to 14 years after exposure (<a href="#R27" rid="R27">Copeland, Wolke, Angold, &amp; Costello,
2013</a>). Participants who had been bullied in childhood also had high rates
of suicidality, but not of antisocial personality or substance use disorders.</p><p id="P18">The long-term impact of childhood bullying victimisation was further
investigated in National Child Development Study (NCDS), or the 1958 British Cohort
Study, a 50-year prospective followup of a UK birth cohort (<a href="#R79" rid="R79">Power &amp; Elliott, 2006</a>). Information on bullying
victimisation was collected from parents when participants were aged 7 and 11, in
1965 and 1969. Analyses were undertaken first to ensure that bullying victimisation
assessed in the mid-1960s referred to the same concept as bullying today:
reassuringly, findings indicated that as shown by other contemporaneous studies,
bullying victimisation was associated with known childhood correlates including low
parental socioeconomic status, low IQ, as well as emotional and behavioural
problems. Supporting the findings from the two other cohorts, but extending them
through the inclusion of outcomes at midlife, the NCDS study showed that victims of
bullying in childhood reported high levels of psychological distress not only at age
23 but also, and most importantly, at age 50, nearly 40 years after exposure (<a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa, Maughan, &amp; Arseneault, 2014</a>).
Participants who had been victims of bullying in childhood had higher prevalence of
psychiatric disorders in midlife, including depression and anxiety, compared to
participants who had not been bullied. The effects were small but similar to those
associated with other adverse childhood exposures measured in this cohort study such
as placement in care or exposure to multiple adversities within the family.
Strikingly similar to findings from the United States, participants in NCDS who had
been bullied in childhood had increased rates of suicidality, but not of alcohol
dependence.</p><p id="P19">The fourth birth cohort study partially corroborates the pattern of findings
observed so far. The Christchurch Child Development Study is a longitudinal
examination of 1265 individuals born in Christchurch New Zealand, in 1977 (<a href="#R38" rid="R38">Fergusson, Horwood, Shannon, &amp; Lawton,
1989</a>). Data on bullying victimisation were collected when participants
were aged 13, 14 and 15 by asking their parents whether they experienced problems at
school including ‘being teased, bullied by other children’.
Participants reported on mental health outcomes at ages of 16–21,
21–25 and 25–30. Bullying victimisation and outcome measures were
pooled across age periods and may blur the longterm impact investigated here.
Findings indicated that victims of bullying had an increased risk for anxiety
disorder in later years (<a href="#R45" rid="R45">Gibb, Horwood, &amp;
Fergusson, 2011</a>). Further tests with other mental health outcomes
including depression, and suicidal thoughts and attempts did not survive controls
for confounders. The small number of participants who had been bullied
(<em>N</em> = 30) and the reporting period covering mostly the
adolescent years, may explain the dissimilarity in the conclusions.</p><p id="P20">The findings reported here are based on observational data and thus do not
allow causal inferences. The consistency of the findings across the four cohorts is,
however, compelling. These studies (a) used prospective measures of bullying
victimisation in childhood and later outcomes in adulthood; (b) controlled for
mental health problems in childhood, indicating that bullying victimisation
contributes either to the onset or worsening of mental health problems in later
years; (c) accounted for a range of confounders that might also explain poor later
outcomes in young victims of bullying, including childhood IQ, parental SES, other
forms of adversities and gender; and (d) are representative of the populations of
four different countries. Conclusions from these studies cannot be ignored. Taken
together, these findings suggest that the impact of bullying on the young victims
may persist once the bullying has long stopped. Tackling bullying behaviours may not
only reduce children’s and adolescents’ mental health symptoms and
adjustment difficulties, but also prevent psychiatric problems in adulthood.
Furthermore, if symptoms persist beyond the childhood and adolescent periods, this
indicates that support to young victims, even after the bullying has stopped, is
necessary to reduce the long-term burden of mental health difficulties among young
victims of bullying.</p></div><div id="S9"><h2 id="S9title">Beyond mental health problems: physical health, criminal and socioeconomic
outcomes</h2><p id="P21">The long-term impact of bullying victimisation explored by the four
longitudinal cohorts described above was not limited to mental health problems.
Focusing on outcomes in the adult years opens up the possibility of examining a
range of life domains more difficult to study in childhood or adolescence. These are
physical health, criminal and socioeconomic domains.</p><p id="P22">Examining physical health outcomes associated with bullying victimisation
among children and adolescents is challenging as most chronic diseases are
relatively rare at this young age and risk indicators may still be latent. With
higher prevalence rates of diseases, the midlife period offers the possibility of
robustly exploring these long-term outcomes. Findings from NCDS indicated that being
bullied in childhood was associated with self-ratings of poor general health at age
50 (<a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa et al., 2014</a>) and this finding
provided the basis for investigating physical health in greater depth and detail. A
follow-up study indicated that men and women who had experienced bullying
victimisation in childhood showed higher inflammation levels than nonbullied peers,
while women who had been bullied were more likely to be obese decades later (<a href="#R105" rid="R105">Takizawa, Danese, Maughan, &amp; Arseneault,
2015</a>). Findings were consistent across two different measures of
inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen) and two different measures of
adiposity (BMI and waist-hip ratio). Findings were independent of the effects of
correlated childhood risks (e.g. parental social class, participants’ BMI and
psychopathology in childhood), and of key adult risk factors targeted by current
preventive interventions for obesity or cardiovascular disease (e.g. not only
smoking, diet and exercise but also adult social class). These markers of poor
physical health among victims of bullying were also observed at a younger age in two
studies. First, participants from the Great Smoky Mountain Study who were bullied in
childhood showed a greater increase in low-grade systemic inflammation (as indexed
with CRP levels) from childhood to adulthood (ages 19 and 21), compared to those
participants who had not been bullied (<a href="#R28" rid="R28">Copeland et
al., 2014</a>). Second, children who were chronically bullied from primary to
secondary schools were nearly twice as likely to be overweight at age 18 than
nonbullied children, independently of co-occurring maltreatment, child socioeconomic
status, food insecurity, mental health, cognition, pubertal development, childhood
weight, and genetic and fetal liability (<a href="#R6" rid="R6">Baldwin et
al., 2016</a>).</p><p id="P23">Criminal outcomes have been associated with bullying victimisation, but more
specifically with bully/victims. Boys who both were frequently bullied by others and
who also bullied others in childhood had an increased risk for repeated offending
when they were aged 16–20 years according to the Finnish National Police
Register data (<a href="#R99" rid="R99">Sourander, Jensen, Rönning,
Elonheimo et al., 2007</a>). This risk was concentrated among those who had
psychiatric problems, indicating that the likelihood of committing criminal
behaviours in later life among victims of bullying was limited to a minority who
also bullied others and who had mental health problems. A follow-up study confirmed
the associations between bullying perpetration and criminal offenses between 23 and
26 years among men, but no increased risk was found for those who were solely
victims of bullying (<a href="#R96" rid="R96">Sourander et al., 2011</a>).
Although bully/victims did not have an increased risk of meeting diagnostic criteria
for antisocial personality disorders in their mid-20s (<a href="#R27" rid="R27">Copeland et al., 2013</a>), they were more likely to have received
felony charges according to courts records (<a href="#R120" rid="R120">Wolke,
Copeland, Angold, &amp; Costello, 2013</a>). Bully/victims were not
examined in the Christchurch cohort, but findings indicated that victims of bullying
had an increased risk of self-reported property offending (<a href="#R45" rid="R45">Gibb et al., 2011</a>). This finding is at odds with those of the
Finnish and the American cohorts which both found that individuals who were solely
victims of bullying were not at increased risk of committing risky or illegal
behaviours in late adolescence or during their adult years.</p><p id="P24">The impact of bullying victimisation has further been found to extend to
economic hardship, social relationships and perceived quality of life in the adult
years. Individuals who had been bullied in childhood had difficulties keeping jobs
in young adulthood (<a href="#R120" rid="R120">Wolke et al., 2013</a>) and
were more likely to be unemployed at midlife (<a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa et al., 2014</a>). These difficulties remaining active on the job
market are not surprising in light of victims’ academic problems. Indeed,
those who were frequently bullied had lower educational levels at midlife (<a href="#R21" rid="R21">Brown &amp; Taylor, 2008</a>; <a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa et al., 2014</a>). Young victims of
bullying also saw their social relationships affected in later years: individuals
who had been bullied in childhood had problems making or keeping friends in their
mid-20s, and had poor relationships with their parents (<a href="#R120" rid="R120">Wolke et al., 2013</a>). They had an increased risk of living
without a spouse or partner at age 50, they were less likely to have met up with
friends in the recent past, and were less likely to have access to social support if
they were sick (<a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa et al., 2014</a>).
Finally, bullying victimisation also affected adult well-being: being bullied was
associated with lower perceived quality of life at age 50 and lower satisfaction
with life so far. Those who had been frequently bullied also anticipated less life
satisfaction in the years to come (<a href="#R106" rid="R106">Takizawa et al.,
2014</a>).</p><p id="P25">The consistency of findings with regard to poor physical and socioeconomic
outcomes observed among victims of bullying, across ages and across cohorts, is
again striking. It is important to note, however, that poor long-term outcomes were
observed especially for those who were frequently or chronically bullied in
childhood, and in the case of criminal outcomes, more often among those who were
bully/victims. Taken together, these findings suggest that childhood bullying
victimisation is not only associated with individual suffering but could also be
linked to considerable costs for society given its pervasive impact on physical,
criminal and socioeconomic outcomes. Some studies have already pointed out the
consequences of childhood bullying victimisation on the health care system. The
Finnish birth cohort showed that participants who were frequently bullied in
childhood were more likely to have received psychiatric hospital treatment and used
psychiatric medications at age 24, over and above psychopathology prior to bullying
(<a href="#R102" rid="R102">Sourander et al., 2009</a>). These effects
on service use were shown to be persistent: being frequently bullied in childhood
was associated with treatment for psychiatric disorders at age 29, over and above
family factors and childhood psychiatric symptoms (<a href="#R97" rid="R97">Sourander, Gyllenberg et al., 2016</a>). Using data from NCDS, a study
reported that compared to participants who were not bullied in childhood, those who
were frequently bullied were more likely to use mental health services in childhood,
adolescence and also in midlife (<a href="#R37" rid="R37">Evans-Lacko et al.,
2016</a>). This disparity in service use associated with childhood bullying
victimisation was explained both by new use of mental health services up to age 33
by a subgroup of participants, and also by persistent use up to midlife.</p><p id="P26">Similar to children and adolescents who suffered from maltreatment, young
victims of bullying may need support to overcome their difficulties facing this
stressful situation. Appropriate interventions may be as simple as schools and
families acknowledging the impact of being bullied to prevent normal reactions of
distress from developing into mental health problems (<a href="#R60" rid="R60">Leff &amp; Waasdorp, 2013</a>). Studies have highlighted the
important role of families in building resilience among bullied victims (<a href="#R15" rid="R15">Bowes et al., 2009</a>, <a href="#R17" rid="R17">2013</a>; for a review see <a href="#R61" rid="R61">Lereya,
Samara, &amp; Wolke, 2013</a>). Increasing families and school awareness
of the damaging impact associated with bullying victimisation is essential to detect
early signs of distress among young victims of bullying. More targeted interventions
by mental health professionals may also be required in instances where symptoms of
mental health problems have emerged. These symptoms should not be overlooked even if
the bullying behaviours have stopped. Interventions in the adult years may also help
with reversing the harmful impact of bullying when the victims enter adulthood.
However, no studies have yet tested this hypothesis.</p></div><div id="S10"><h2 id="S10title">Mechanisms accounting for poor outcomes among young victims of bullying: further
targets for building resilience</h2><p id="P27">The evidence supporting the persistent impact of bullying victimisation on
poor outcomes up to adulthood is intriguing. However, the developmental processes
that translate childhood bullying victimisation into poor outcomes up to adulthood
remain unclear. How can abusive behaviours perpetrated by other pupils and
classmates leave marks observable well into adult life? We need a better
understanding of these interactive processes to identify specific targets for
intervention programmes aimed at reducing the harmful outcomes of being bullied and
building resilience among young victims.</p><p id="P28">Two possible processes that have been examined refer to hypotheses derived
from theories of the biological embedding of stress (<a href="#R33" rid="R33">Danese &amp; McEwen, 2012</a>). One such process relates to variation in
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity, commonly
associated with the neurobiology of stress. A study from the E-Risk cohort using a
group of MZ twins discordant on bullying victimisation showed that bullying
victimisation in childhood was associated with a blunted salivary cortisol response
(<a href="#R75" rid="R75">Ouellet-Morin, Danese et al., 2011</a>),
which in turn, was associated with problems with social interactions and aggressive
behaviours among children who were victims of bullying or physical maltreatment
(<a href="#R75" rid="R75">Ouellet-Morin, Odgers et al., 2011</a>).
These findings are in line with other studies showing an association between
bullying victimisation and daily hyposecretion of cortisol among girls (<a href="#R114" rid="R114">Vaillancourt et al., 2008</a>) and also among
adolescents following laboratoryinduced stressful situation (<a href="#R24" rid="R24">Calhoun et al., 2014</a>). But what processes might activate this
reduction in cortisol level after children have experienced violence repeatedly over
time? Using the same group of discordant MZ twins from the E-Risk cohort, a further
study showed that the bullied twins had higher methylation levels on
<em>5-HTTLPR</em> compared to their nonbullied cotwins (<a href="#R77" rid="R77">Ouellet-Morin et al., 2013</a>). In addition,
findings from this study showed that higher levels of methylation were associated
with lower levels of cortisol response. Effects of this kind may serve as an
interface between childhood bullying victimisation and later vulnerability to stress
and psychopathology. Interventions focussed on teaching coping skills for dealing
with stressful situations and managing stress reactions could have a significant
impact on reducing the risk of mental health problems among young victims of
bullying.</p><p id="P29">Another possibility refers to the fact that poor adult health outcomes are a
function of the persistence of early symptoms that developed at the time of the
bullying exposure. For example, mental health problems like depression and anxiety
are likely to persist, especially when they manifest early in life (<a href="#R30" rid="R30">Costello, Mustillo, Erkanli, Keeler, &amp; Angold,
2003</a>). Furthermore, most adult psychiatric disorders are preceded by a
juvenile history of mental health problems: 75% of adults with a diagnosis for a
psychiatric disorder had met diagnostic criteria before the age of 18, 50% prior to
the age of 15 (<a href="#R59" rid="R59">Kim-Cohen et al., 2003</a>).
Untreated signs of psychological distress that appear early in life could be the
precursors to a life of poor health, both mental and physical. Early interventions
targeting early symptoms of mental health problems could successfully mitigate poor
outcomes among bullied children as these symptoms can become chronic and persist
into adulthood.</p><p id="P30">Although research findings show that being bullied independently contributes
to adjustment problems, it does not operate in isolation. Children who are the
victims of bullying are not only at risk of developing early symptoms of mental
health problems. They enter a cycle of violence and abuse that may perpetuate itself
over time and across settings (<a href="#R40" rid="R40">Finkelhor, Ormrod,
&amp; Turner, 2007b</a>, <a href="#R41" rid="R41">2007c</a>).
Therefore, being bullied in childhood is often preceded by other forms of abuse at
home, and followed by further abuse from peers or adults, forming the first stages
in a cycle of victimisation that perpetuates over time and across situations.
Although empirical evidence indicates that each different form of abuse
independently contributes to poor outcomes, it may be the accumulation of various
types of violence exposure in childhood that is at the source of physical and mental
health problems in later life, more so than only one type alone (<a href="#R39" rid="R39">Finkelhor et al., 2007a</a>, <a href="#R40" rid="R40">2007b</a>).</p><p id="P31">Psychological mechanisms including emotional and social-cognitive processing
have also been associated with peer victimisation and bullying and could account for
the persistence of its associated poor outcomes. For example, appraisals of control
(<a href="#R25" rid="R25">Catterson &amp; Hunter, 2010</a>),
hostile attributions and social perspective awareness (<a href="#R49" rid="R49">Hoglund &amp; Leadbeater, 2007</a>) and coping self-efficacy
(<a href="#R92" rid="R92">Singh &amp; Bussey, 2010</a>) have all
been associated with peer victimisation, and mediation analyses further revealed
that they accounted for various measures of adjustment problems such as loneliness,
social anxiety and withdrawal during adolescence (<a href="#R25" rid="R25">Catterson &amp; Hunter, 2010</a>; <a href="#R49" rid="R49">Hoglund
&amp; Leadbeater, 2007</a>; <a href="#R92" rid="R92">Singh &amp;
Bussey, 2010</a>). Furthermore, poorer emotion recognition abilities have
been observed among victims of relational bullying, and especially for emotions of
anger and fear (<a href="#R124" rid="R124">Woods, Wolke, Nowicki, &amp;
Hall, 2009</a>). These findings suggest that interventions aimed at changing
such cognitive appraisals could be helpful in preventing the development, and
perhaps also the persistence, of mental health problems among victims of
bullying.</p><p id="P32">Being bullied in childhood has a pervasive impact on victims’ lives.
Another process through which bullying may impact later outcomes refers to the
damaging effect of childhood bullying victimisation on several domains and not only
one aspect of individuals’ development. Indeed, being bullied in childhood
has been shown to have a detrimental effect on life opportunities for building the
human and social capital young children need to overcome adversity and live
successful and fulfilling lives. The studies reviewed above show that bullied
children end up lacking social relationships, having poor physical health and
suffering from financial difficulties as adults. These findings indicate that a lack
of resources and support may be a plausible pathway to explain the persistence of
poor health outcomes among young victims of bullying.</p><p id="P33">Although described separately, these processes are likely to operate
together in contributing to atypical development. Multidisciplinary research across
different levels, from biological embedding of stress to poly-victimisation, is
essential to understand the underpinning of mental health difficulties among victims
of bullying. Animal models may also provide useful insight here because they allow
for direct manipulation of bullying exposure (or social defeat) and offer an
opportunity to explore biological mechanisms in more depth. For example, an
experiment on mice demonstrated the role of brain-derived neurotropic factor
(<em>BDNF</em>) in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to explain social
aversion among mice exposed to repeated aggression (<a href="#R12" rid="R12">Berton et al., 2006</a>). Additional studies like this one will guide and
orient future human research aimed at understanding the development of mental health
difficulties in young victims of bullying.</p></div><div id="S11"><h2 id="S11title">Antibullying policy</h2><p id="P34">Considerable efforts are in place to reduce bullying behaviours and limit
its impact on the victims. The UK Government’s approach to bullying is
summarised in a document which outlines the remit of schools for tackling bullying,
their legal obligations, and some effective antibullying strategies (<a href="#R34" rid="R34">Department for Education, 2017</a>). It provides a
definition of bullying, reviews the safeguarding of children and young people and
the underpinnings of criminal law. It also provides advices to teachers and school
staff on how to tackle and prevent bullying. Attention is also given on how to
attend to young victims of bullying. Since the late 90s, all schools in the United
Kingdom must have in place an antibullying policy. These policies include –
among other information – principles and values of the school, a definition
of bullying, and advice on how to record and report bullying incidents. This
document must be presented to and discussed with the pupils as well as shared with
parents and school staff. Each school develops its own policy and framework for
tackling bullying with guidance from the Government. All schools have the ownership
of their policies, and as a consequence, their content and implementation vary
considerably from one school to another. Furthermore, there has not been any
evaluation for determining the impact of this national initiative on reducing
bullying behaviours and their consequences on youth mental health and
well-being.</p><p id="P35">Australia is one of the first countries to have developed a national policy
for the prevention and management of bullying and other aggressive behaviours, the
National Safe Schools Framework (NSSF). This framework lists 11 principles to assist
schools in providing a safe environment to their pupils. These include: promote
care, respect and cooperation and value diversity; recognise the critical importance
of preservice and ongoing professional development in creating a safe and supportive
school environment; focus on policies that are proactive and oriented towards
prevention and intervention; and take action to protect children from all forms of
abuse and neglect. Comparisons of cross-sectional data across 4 years indicate that
rates of bullying have only moderately declined and reports from staff suggest poor
development and implementation of the NSSF strategies (e.g. few received training,
limited funds invested in bullying) (<a href="#R31" rid="R31">Cross et al.,
2011</a>).</p><p id="P36">Findings from the United States are somewhat more encouraging. A recent
study examined the effectiveness of the antibullying legislation using data from 25
different states. Students living in a state complying to at least one guideline
recommended by the Department of Education had a 24% reduction in reporting of being
bullied (<a href="#R47" rid="R47">Hatzenbuehler et al., 2015</a>).
Findings further reported the legal components that were consistently associated
with a reduction in bullying victimisation: statement of scope, description of
prohibited behaviours, and requirements for districts to develop and implement local
policies. In other words, details, specificity and clarity of the legislative
components were all associated with greater success.</p><p id="P37">A study reported on the changes in bullying behaviours, mental health and
mental health service use in Finland (<a href="#R97" rid="R97">Sourander,
Lempinen, &amp; Brunstein Klomek, 2016</a>). A compelling feature of this
study is that it capitalises on data collected before and after the introduction of
a nationwide school-based antibullying programme in 2009 in this country. Findings
indicated no decrease in rates of bullying behaviour between 2005 and 2013, despite
the implementation of antibullying programmes nationwide. The authors also noticed
no increase in mental health problems between 1989 and 2003, but an increase in
mental health service use during that same period. The authors suggest that a
combination of antibullying and mental health interventions may offer better
results. This is an interesting conclusion that deserves further attention.</p></div><div id="S12"><h2 id="S12title">Antibullying interventions in schools</h2><p id="P38">Numerous school-based prevention and intervention programmes have emerged in
recent years with the aim of reducing bullying behaviours. Such programmes vary
widely with regard to their focus and methods of delivery. For example, some
interventions target the implementation of new curriculum. They commonly include
videotapes, lectures and discussions around the topic of bullying with the aim of
promoting attitudes against bullying and prosocial behaviours. They are usually
limited in time and in outreach by involving mostly classrooms for a few weeks.
Instead, a whole-school approach implements rules and sanctions school wide, trains
teachers in methods for handling bullying, teaches conflict resolution strategies
and offers counselling support. It also involves a wide range of people including
all pupils, teachers, school staff, families and when possible, communities.
Examples of such programmes are the well-known Olweus Bullying Prevention Program
(<a href="#R73" rid="R73">Olweus, 1994</a>) and the KiVa Anti-Bullying
Program (<a href="#R85" rid="R85">Salmivalli, Kaukiainen, &amp; Voeten,
2005</a>). The KiVa programme, a whole-school intervention based on
social-cognitive theory, is one of the most widely used interventions and one that
combines several elements offered by other programmes.</p><p id="P39">KiVa was built from two lines of research, one on aggressive and bullying
behaviours and one on the participant roles of bullying (<a href="#R56" rid="R56">Kärnä et al., 2011</a>). This intervention programme
includes a combination of universal and indicated actions to prevent and stop the
occurrences of bullying incidents. The universal actions focus at influencing
youth’s reaction when witnessing bullying instances (bystanders). The idea
here is to change the attitude of the classmates in order to reduce the reward and
the motivation of those who bully others. The emphasis is on empathy, self-efficacy
and antibullying attitudes. The indicated actions focus on the victims and the
bullies more specifically. This programme is not limited to implementing a school
ethos and goes beyond by providing staff practical tools such as video films,
computer games, and Internet forum. This programme has been shown to be effective at
reducing all forms of bullying, including exclusion, cyber and threats, between 21%
up to 63% in older pupils (<a href="#R84" rid="R84">Salmivalli,
Kärnä, &amp; Poskiparta, 2011</a>) and also with younger
pupils, both self- and peer-reported (<a href="#R56" rid="R56">Kärnä et al., 2011</a>).</p><p id="P40">Systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of antibullying
programmes more generally and provide encouraging findings with slightly greater
reduction in bullying behaviours than bullying victimisation and associated poor
outcomes (<a href="#R108" rid="R108">Ttofi &amp; Farrington, 2009a</a>,
<a href="#R110" rid="R110">2011</a>; <a href="#R118" rid="R118">Vreeman &amp; Carroll, 2007</a>). Overall, school-based antibullying
programmes reduced victimisation on average by 17%–20% (<a href="#R110" rid="R110">Ttofi &amp; Farrington, 2011</a>). Greater reduction in
victimisation was found for intensive and holistic approaches involving multiple
groups of people and environments. Factors associated with better results included
parent training, improved playground supervision, disciplinary methods, school
conferences, videos, information for parents, work with peers, classroom rules and
management (<a href="#R109" rid="R109">Ttofi &amp; Farrington,
2009b</a>). Efficient antibullying programmes are important and should be
developed and supported as widely as possible. However, these programmes are likely
to be costly and challenging for schools from deprived areas which deal with several
other important educational challenges. Furthermore, evaluations of antibullying
policies and school programmes tend to suggest that the likelihood of eradicating
bullying behaviour is small and despite such invaluable programmes, a considerable
proportion of young people will not escape this form of abuse in their youth. While
rigorous study designs and methodology are needed to advance the examination of the
efficiency of these important programmes (<a href="#R19" rid="R19">Bradshaw,
2015</a>), efforts and funds should also be invested in interventions focused
on limiting distress and adjustment difficulties among young victims and possibly by
the same token, preventing long-lasting problems in later life.</p></div><div id="S13"><h2 id="S13title">Involving potential victims in prevention programmes</h2><p id="P41">It might be considered controversial to investigate early factors that could
increase the risk of children and adolescents becoming victims of bullying. This
endeavour goes against a general assumption that bullying has nothing to do with the
unfortunate victims, but all to do with the perpetrators of bullying behaviours.
However, the search for these predictors is central to our understanding of the
impact of being bullied in childhood. It is crucial for research to account for
these factors when determining later outcomes associated with being bullied in
childhood. From a prevention perspective, it is also imperative to identify
characteristics that render children vulnerable for bullying victimisation (<a href="#R36" rid="R36">Espelage, 2016</a>).</p><p id="P42">Although prospective longitudinal studies remain the exception in this line
of research, findings indicate that both contextual and individual factors are
associated with youths’ risk of being bullied. A meta-analytic investigation
and empirical studies have reported that being the victim of bullying, including
being a bully/victim, is associated with a range of factors including male gender,
young age, low social competence, difficulties solving social problems and social
rejection/isolation (<a href="#R2" rid="R2">Analitis et al., 2009</a>;
<a href="#R15" rid="R15">Bowes et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#R26" rid="R26">Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, &amp; Sadek, 2010</a>). In line
with the definition of bullying, research has demonstrated that victims of bullying
are a vulnerable group who show difficulties prior to being bullied. Some
longitudinal studies report an increased risk of being bullied in childhood
associated with early emotional problems, such as withdrawal, anxiety or depression
(<a href="#R5" rid="R5">Arseneault et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#R14" rid="R14">Bond, Carlin, Thomas, Rubin, &amp; Patton,
2001</a>; <a href="#R54" rid="R54">Kaltiala-Heino, Fröjd,
&amp; Marttunen, 2010</a>; <a href="#R63" rid="R63">Lester, Dooley,
Cross, &amp; Shaw, 2012</a>; <a href="#R90" rid="R90">Siegel, La
Greca, &amp; Harrison, 2009</a>). In addition, preschoolers who display
aggressive behaviours (<a href="#R8" rid="R8">Barker, Boivin et al.,
2008</a>; <a href="#R52" rid="R52">Jansen, Veenstra, Ormel, Verhulst,
&amp; Reijneveld, 2011</a>; <a href="#R95" rid="R95">Snyder et al.,
2003</a>) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity and oppositional defiant
problems (<a href="#R116" rid="R116">Verlinden et al., 2015</a>) are more
likely to experience peer victimisation and bullying in the school years.</p><p id="P43">The role of families has also been emphasised as an important factor
associated with the risk of being bullied (<a href="#R11" rid="R11">Beran
&amp; Violato, 2004</a>; <a href="#R52" rid="R52">Jansen et al.,
2011</a>; <a href="#R61" rid="R61">Lereya, Samara et al., 2013</a>;
<a href="#R123" rid="R123">Wolke &amp; Skew, 2012b</a>): low
parental educational level, negative parenting such abuse and neglect, poor
communication, material deprivation, parental depression, lack of supervision and
involvement, and low socioeconomic status have all been associated with small to
moderate risks of being a victim of bullying and being a bully/victim. Other
contextual factors associated with bullying victimisation include school
characteristics such as overcrowding and the number of children receiving free
school meals (<a href="#R10" rid="R10">Barnes, Belsky, Broomfield, &amp;
Melhuish, 2006</a>; <a href="#R15" rid="R15">Bowes et al.,
2009</a>).</p><p id="P44">Twins studies have pushed further the search for factors associated with
being bullied by showing it is partly heritable. One study found that genetic
influences accounted for over two-thirds of individual differences in
children’s bullying victimisation during the first 2 years of their formal
schooling (<a href="#R7" rid="R7">Ball et al., 2008</a>). This finding
does not imply there is a gene for being bullied in childhood. Rather, it suggests
that heritable symptoms such as emotional and behavioural problems mediate these
genetic influences. Environmental factors not shared by people in a family accounted
for the remaining variance in bullying victimisation, supporting a study which has
shown that the environment also influences children’s risk of peer
victimisation (<a href="#R20" rid="R20">Brendgen et al., 2008</a>).</p><p id="P45">The mechanisms explaining how specific characteristics and environments
translate into a risk for children being bullied are not fully understood: anxious
and depressed children may be perceived as easy targets who will not retaliate when
other children are abusive towards them. Aggressive children may attract hostility
from other children. Contextual factors may also influence child characteristics,
which in turn affect their risks for being bullied. For example, one study has shown
that individual characteristics including aggressiveness, social isolation, academic
performance, prosocial behaviour and dislikability accounted for the effect of
social circumstances on preadolescents’ risks for being bullied (<a href="#R115" rid="R115">Veenstra et al., 2005</a>). However, another study
indicated that despite control for children’s emotional and behavioural
problems, physical maltreatment and school overcrowding were independently
associated with being bullied (<a href="#R15" rid="R15">Bowes et al.,
2009</a>). Thus, factors in children’s family and school environments
may increase their likelihood of being bullied, over and above their personal
characteristics.</p><p id="P46">There is no such thing as a profile for the typical young victim of
bullying. In addition to contextual and individual factors, circumstances such as
moving to a new school or starting to wear glasses may also put some children at
risk of being bullied. However, evidence indicates that youths from deprived
socioeconomic backgrounds, who have previously experienced violence victimisation
and who already show a vulnerability for developing mental health problems have an
increased risk of being bullied, via both genetic and environmental pathways. This
body of research has identified individual and contextual factors among children and
adolescents that contribute at making them potential victims of bullying. It is
important for prevention strategies to consider these factors because they could
become targets of fruitful early interventions to stop some children from being
bullied in the first place.</p><p id="P47">A public health approach aimed at preventing vulnerable children from
becoming the targets of bullying may be an effective strategy to reduce
society’s burden related to bullying. For example, instructing young children
(and especially those at risk of becoming the target of bullying) skills for facing
adversity and standing up to bullying may contribute to reducing this form of abuse.
Prevention programmes aimed at building resilience could also benefit young children
likely to be exposed to this form of abuse. Providing children with tips on how to
make and keep friends may be an example of such intervention (<a href="#R113" rid="R113">van Harmelen et al., 2017</a>) and this may be especially
important in this era of digital age when children and adolescents are spending more
time on mobile devices. Involving families could also be an additional asset of such
programmes (<a href="#R18" rid="R18">Bowes et al., 2010</a>). However, it
is important to remember at this point that young children who are victims of
bullying already show signs of vulnerability and are possibly at risk for developing
difficulties despite their experience with bullying. While prevention and
intervention programmes may improve the lives of young victims by reducing the
likelihood of one form of abuse, it is unlikely that alone, they will solve all
youths’ problems.</p></div><div id="S14"><h2 id="S14title">What next?</h2><p id="P48">The evidence reviewed above provides strong and robust support for an
independent contribution of childhood bullying victimisation to the development of
poor outcomes throughout the life span, including mental, physical and socioeconomic
outcomes. However, several important questions remain unanswered. Here are a
few.</p><p id="P49">First, there are increasing concerns about the impact of cyberbullying and
Internet harassment. This form of abuse deserves careful attention given the
widespread use of social media by young people today. While it is not clear whether
harassment on the Internet and social media is a true form of bullying (the
perpetrator being sometimes anonymous, it may not always be a form of peer
victimisation where power imbalance exist), it has been associated with symptoms of
mental health problems (for a review see <a href="#R44" rid="R44">George
&amp; Odgers, 2015</a>) and has even been found to be more strongly
associated with suicide ideation compared to traditional forms of bullying by some
(<a href="#R112" rid="R112">van Geel, Vedder, &amp; Tanilon,
2014</a>) but not others (<a href="#R80" rid="R80">Przybylski &amp;
Bowes, 2017</a>). The anonymity conferred by online interactions may further
empower the perpetrators because they know they are less likely to face the
consequences of their actions. Cyberbullying remains, however, a less frequent form
of harassment compared to other types of bullying (<a href="#R74" rid="R74">Olweus, 2013</a>; <a href="#R80" rid="R80">Przybylski &amp; Bowes,
2017</a>; <a href="#R94" rid="R94">Smith et al., 2008</a>) and
needs to be examined in the context of other forms of victimisation to ensure its
independent contribution to poor outcomes.</p><p id="P50">Second, considerable attention has been focused on bullying in the childhood
and adolescent years. Bullying also takes place among adults with potentially
damaging consequences, domestic violence potentially being one such example. Some
research has been conducted among specific groups such as prisoners (<a href="#R50" rid="R50">Ireland, 2011</a>) but this line of work could be
extended to representative population of adults. For example, bullying in the
workplace has gained considerable interest recently. Institutional bullying operates
within an organisation’s rules and policies and takes place, typically but
not exclusively, during the adult years. There are suggestions that this form of
bullying affect workers’ morale and productivity. Research should determine
whether it also contributes to mental health problems among adults, as this would
also have an important economic impact.</p><p id="P51">Third, the role of genetic factors has been neglected when it comes to
understanding the impact of being bullied in childhood. It is important to consider
genetic influences to fully recognise the extent to which bullying affects poor
outcomes in later years and identify most at-risk groups. It is also important to
explore the genetic influences that contribute to the risk of being bullied. This
may provide fruitful avenues for preventing young children from being bullied in the
first place. As an example, the use of polygenic risk scores could help identify
heritable characteristics associated with the risk of being bullied at a young
age.</p><p id="P52">Fourth, the examination of the outcomes associated with childhood bullying
victimisation should not be limited to individual consequences and could be extended
to societal impacts, including institutions and systems. Emerging studies on the
mental health service use are good examples. Research could include measures of the
consequences of bullying victimisation on health institutions, social services and
the education system. In addition, studies could also include measures of economic
impact.</p><p id="P53">Fifth, developing new innovative and rigorous research designs remains
crucial despite the strong evidence reviewed above showing that being bullied in
childhood can have a significant harmful impact. The use of natural experiments and
other innovative study designs to support causal inferences of the role of bullying
victimisation could strengthen current evidence. The use of animal models, where
researchers can exercise greater control over the environment, can help unravel the
mechanisms behind poor outcomes associated with being bullied. Modifications in
animal social hierarchies are well suited to examine the impact of bullying
victimisation and easily allow the observation of associations between changes in
social status and changes in outcomes. Natural experiments such as the discordant
monozygotic twin design also have the potential to strengthen conclusions by
controlling for a wide range of confounding factors including genetic influences.
Better control of confounding variables and especially other forms of victimisation
is also crucial. The use of propensity score models (<a href="#R51" rid="R51">Jaffee et al., 2012</a>) could help strengthening the evidence accumulated
thus far.</p><p id="P54">Sixth, there is a lack of neuroimaging findings on structural and functional
brain differences among children and adolescents’ victims of bullying. Based
on recent review of studies in youths who experienced maltreatment (<a href="#R66" rid="R66">McCrory, De Brito, &amp; Viding, 2010</a>), we
would expect an effect of bullying on some brain structures and/or functioning.
Seventh, intervention programmes should be systematically evaluated to inform on the
effectiveness of what we are currently doing to stop bullying, what works and what
we need to change.</p></div><div id="S15"><h2 id="S15title">Conclusions</h2><p id="P55">Based on existing evidence thus far, bullying should be considered as
another form of childhood abuse alongside physical maltreatment and neglect. Several
rigorous studies reviewed above provide strong and robust support for an independent
contribution of childhood bullying victimisation to the development of poor outcomes
throughout the life span, including mental, physical and socioeconomic outcomes.
Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms explaining the
emergence and the persistence of these poor outcomes. In the meantime, efforts
focusing on stopping bullying behaviours should not only be supported but also be
widened to provide appropriate help to the young victims and prevent children and
adolescents from becoming the target of bullying.</p></div><div id="unreferenced-ft"><div><p>​
