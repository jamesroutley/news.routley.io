    <h1>Your website should work without JavaScript (2021)</h1>

        <main>

            <p>Recently I started a site of <a href="https://missingdice.com/">tools for boardgames players</a>. Simple tools like dice and spinners.</p>
<p>I wanted the site to be as accessible as possible. So I challenged myself with some rules on how it would work.</p>
<p>One rule was that <strong>every tool must work without javascript.</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot by doing it, and started to write posts about building tools without <code>js</code>. But before I write any more I wanted to answer the question:</p>
<p><strong>Why in 2021 would you bother making a website without <code>js</code>?</strong></p>
<p><em>While researching this post I found two really great sources of information. So, most of this is going to be stolen from <a href="https://adamsilver.io/blog/javascript-isnt-always-available-and-its-not-the-users-fault/">this article by Adam Silver</a> and <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">this post from gov.uk.</a></em></p>
<p>But I&#39;m going to go a little deeper into why some people <strong>block</strong> <code>js</code>.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to why you should build a website that doesn&#39;t need <code>js</code> is… because some people don&#39;t use <code>js</code>. But how many?!</p>
<h2 id="how-many-visitors-dont-use-javascript">How many visitors don&#39;t use javascript?<a href="#how-many-visitors-dont-use-javascript"> #</a></h2>
<p>The answer to this question is <strong>roughly <code>1%</code>.</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s not a lot of information on this but here&#39;s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2010 study by <em>yahoo</em> suggests <code>1.3%</code> – <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131127063017/https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/many-users-JavaScript-disabled-14121.html">web.archive</a></li>
<li>A 2013 study by <em>gov.uk</em> suggests <code>1.1%</code> — <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">gov.uk</a></li>
<li>For <em>buzzfeed</em> in 2018 it was <code>1%</code> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-XLKxIiSvU">youtube</a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>1%</code> sounds like a lot! is it really possible 1 in 100 people block <code>javascript</code>? <strong>well...no</strong></p>
<p>The <code>1%</code> from these studies is <code>1%</code> of visits where javascript has failed for <strong>any reason</strong>.</p>
<p>According to <code>gov.uk</code> the number of people who actively block <code>js</code> (or use a really really old browser) is <code>0.2%</code> — 1 in 500.</p>
<p>Those <code>0.2%</code> have their reasons, but first let&#39;s look at the <code>0.8%</code> of visits where the <code>js</code> fails.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-javascript-fail">Why does javascript fail?<a href="#why-does-javascript-fail"> #</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of reasons your site&#39;s javascript might fail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your javascript is broken!</strong> It happens.</li>
<li><strong>A feature you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t work on an older browser.</strong> e.g. <code>ES6</code> on an old version of <code>internet explorer</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Inteference from a browser extension.</strong> Some web-extensions alter your site&#39;s code - with negative effects.</li>
<li><strong>Network Errors.</strong> Sometimes things just break.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile users losing signal</strong> - <em>e.g. from being in a rural area, going through a tunnel, falling down a manhole, etc</em></li>
<li><strong>Some browsers block javsacript on slow connections.</strong> — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-android-disable-javascript-2g-connections/">Android does this</a></li>
<li><strong>CDN going down.</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/03/518322734/amazon-and-the-150-million-typo">in 2017 AWS went down for 3 hours</a></li>
<li><strong>Corporate or local blocking or stripping of Javascript.</strong> Sometimes organizations block javascript for security reasons.</li>
<li><strong>ISPs accidentally blocking your CDN</strong> — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">Sky Broadband once blocked jQuery</a></li>
<li><strong>mobile networks altering your content</strong> and breaking it — <a href="https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10637">T-mobile and Orange also broke jQuery!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s probably other reasons too.</p>
<p>That accounts for about <code>0.8%</code> of visitors not using <code>Javascript</code></p>
<p>But what about the <code>0.2%</code> who block <code>js</code>?</p>
<h2 id="why-do-people-block-javascript">Why do people block javascript?<a href="#why-do-people-block-javascript"> #</a></h2>
<p>Some people block javascript in their browser. Some people choose a browser that doesn&#39;t support javascript. There are a number of reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>Battery</li>
<li>are stuck with or prefer an very old or text-based browser</li>
<li>they just like the web without javascript.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility<a href="#accessibility"> #</a></h3>
<p>Some people find it easier to navigate the web with javascript switched off. There&#39;s less distractions.</p>
<p>Others choose text-to-speech browsers that don&#39;t support <code>js</code>.</p>
<p><em>Text-to-speech can work fine with javascript. For instance <code>voiceOver</code> on <code>MacOS</code> works within any browser.</em></p>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security"> #</a></h3>
<p>Many people disable <code>js</code> for security reasons, both professional and personal. No javascript means no malicious javscript too.</p>
<p><strong>Who does this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People who work with sensitive or valuable data.</li>
<li>Journalists and whistleblowers. <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2475978/snowden-at-sxsw--we-need-better-encryption-to-save-us-from-the-surveillance-state.html">Edward Snowden recommends switching off js</a></li>
<li>Cautious people who don&#39;t want to get their credit cards stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy<a href="#privacy"> #</a></h3>
<p>Lots of people don&#39;t like corporations collecting their personal data. You might block ads, and tracking scripts.</p>
<p>Some people take that a step further and block all javascript. Then, if they trust a site, they&#39;ll allow it to run.</p>
<h3 id="cost-&amp;-bandwidth">Cost &amp; Bandwidth<a href="#cost-&amp;-bandwidth"> #</a></h3>
<p>Blocking javascript can save a lot of money.</p>
<p>Downloading <code>d3.js</code> (a popular graphing library) <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/test/210315_Ai1V_d64dac022c060cc2ebfe8f3301b605dd#usdCost">costs <code>1 cent</code> in Canada. In Mauritania it costs <code>0.06%</code> of the average daily income.</a></p>
<p>That&#39;s may not seem like a lot. But <code>d3.js</code> is only <code>90kB</code> — and only one of many scripts someone may have to download to use a site.</p>
<p>Then javascript can request all kinds of data, images, video, and it adds up fast. Once you&#39;ve visited a few sites you may find yourself over budget.</p>
<p>The same logic applies for people with limited bandwidth.</p>
<p><a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/test/210317_XiBD_85e51d4bdb1e7cb5901b7fad12e7a196#pppCost"><code>dev.to</code> costs 24 cents to visit on mobile in canada!</a></p>
<h3 id="cpu-and-battery">CPU and Battery<a href="#cpu-and-battery"> #</a></h3>
<p>Some people switch off javascript to save CPU and Battery.</p>
<p>Users of low-powered devices — or one that&#39;s doing more important tasks in the background — may want to take pressure off their CPU.</p>
<p>People without easy access to a power supply may want to save battery.</p>
<h3 id="out-dated-browsers-&amp;-text-based-browsers">Out-dated Browsers &amp; Text-based browsers<a href="#out-dated-browsers-&amp;-text-based-browsers"> #</a></h3>
<p>Very old browsers like <code>IE &lt; 3</code>, <code>Netscape 1</code>, <code>Mosaic</code>, and others don&#39;t support javascript. Almost nobody uses these browsers anymore — but you can bet somebody is.</p>
<p>Some text-based browsers like <code>Lynx</code> don&#39;t support <code>js</code>. <code>Lynx</code> is a browser that runs in terminal applications. So someone browsing the web on a computer without a <code>GUI</code> may well be using it.</p>
<p><code>Lynx</code> has been around since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">1992</a> and is <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/current/CHANGES.html">still updated today.</a> So people are definitely using it.</p>
<h3 id="some-people-just-prefer-the-web-without-js">Some people just prefer the web without js.<a href="#some-people-just-prefer-the-web-without-js"> #</a></h3>
<p>Some people think the web is better browsed with javascript off. It&#39;s faster and reduces distractions. <em>See <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/11/i-turned-off-javascript-for-a-whole-week-and-it-was-glorious/">I Turned Off JavaScript for a Whole Week and It Was Glorious - Wired 2015</a></em></p>
<h2 id="should-you-cater-to-02">Should you cater to <code>0.2%</code>?<a href="#should-you-cater-to-02"> #</a></h2>
<p>Yes and no. Personally, I enjoy going out of my way to make things work. I find all this stuff fascinating. But making sure a site works for the <code>0.2%</code> of people who disable javascript isn&#39;t really the point.</p>
<h3 id="the-curb-cut-effect">The Curb Cut Effect<a href="#the-curb-cut-effect"> #</a></h3>
<p>An analogy that comes up often when talking about web accessibility is curb cuts. <em>Curb cuts are the small concrete ramps on the side of the road.</em></p>
<p>Curb cuts we&#39;re added to sidewalks after a long campaign from disability rights activists. Their purpose was to give wheel-chair users the same freedoms non-disabled people enjoy.</p>
<p>Now that curb cuts are everywhere — everyone benefits from them. People with strollers, skateboarders, people delvering packages, and more.</p>
<p>The point? Making the world more accessible for one group of people benefits everyone. That&#39;s the <strong>curb cut effect</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/"><em>Here&#39;s a great episode of 99% invisible about curb cuts.</em></a></p>
<p>Building sites that function well without javascript doesn&#39;t just benefit the <code>0.2%</code> of people who disable it.</p>
<p>It improves the <code>0.8%</code> of vists where javascript fails too.</p>
<p>Building everything you can without <code>js</code> will make your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>faster</strong></li>
<li><strong>smaller</strong> – (most of the time)</li>
<li><strong>more reliable</strong></li>
<li><strong>more accessible</strong></li>
<li><strong>have smoother animations</strong></li>
<li><strong>easier to index by search engines</strong></li>
<li><strong>less vulnerable to hacks</strong></li>
<li><strong>easier to develop</strong> – personal opinion</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d prefer to write <code>js</code> all day — but finding <code>html</code> and <code>css</code> only solutions has made me a better developer.</p>
<p>It&#39;s forced me to find creative ways of solving problems — and to learn new <code>html</code> and <code>css</code> features.</p>
<p>Then when I do add javascript, it&#39;s ends up being a lot smaller and easier to manage.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-disable-javascript">How to disable Javascript<a href="#how-to-disable-javascript"> #</a></h3>
<p>If you&#39;re going to build sites without <code>js</code> you&#39;re going to need to test them.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular way of disabling javascript is with the browser extension <a href="https://noscript.net/"><code>NoScript</code></a> — it&#39;s available on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">Firefox</a> and elsewhere too.</p>
<p>As of writing this <code>noScript</code> has:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>100,000+</code> users on Google Chrome</li>
<li><code>404,376</code> users on Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s at least half a million people who use that specific app. There are many more apps and other methods of disabling <code>js</code>.</p>
<h3 id="anyway">Anyway<a href="#anyway"> #</a></h3>
<p>Give browsing the web without <code>js</code> a try, or maybe even have a go at using <code>Lynx</code>. Let me know what you think.</p>
