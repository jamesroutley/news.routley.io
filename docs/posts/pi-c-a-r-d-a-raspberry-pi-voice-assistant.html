<p dir="auto">Pi-card is an AI powered voice assistant running entirely on a Raspberry Pi. It is capable of doing anything a standard LLM (like ChatGPT) can do in a conversational setting.
In addition, if there is a camera equipped, you can also ask Pi-card to take a photo, describe what it sees, and then ask questions about that image.</p>

<p dir="auto">Please submit an issue or pull request if you can think of a better way to force this acronym.</p>

<p dir="auto">Pi-card runs entirely on your Raspberry Pi. Once the main program is run, the system will listen for your wake word. Once your wake word has been said, you are officially in a conversation. Within this conversation you do not need to constantly repeat the wake word. The system will continue to listen for your commands until you say something like &#34;stop&#34;, &#34;exit&#34;, or &#34;goodbye&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">The system has a memory of the conversation while you have it, meaning if you want the assistant to repeat something it said, or elaborate on a previous topic, you can do so.</p>
<p dir="auto">While the system is designed to be entirely local, it is also possible to easily connect it to some external APIs or services if you want to enhance the conversation, or give it control to some external devices. To do so is something I am open to improving, but for now it will be done based on specific keywords to trigger the external service. A good example of this is that for camera purposes, the system will activate the camera if you say &#34;take a photo&#34; or &#34;what do you see&#34;.</p>

<p dir="auto">The system is designed to be a fun project that can be a <em>somewhat</em> helpful AI assistant. Since everything is done locally, the system will not be as capable, or as fast, as cloud based systems. However, the system is still capable of a lot of improvements to be made.</p>

<p dir="auto">The main reason for this is that I wanted to create a voice assistant that is completely offline and doesn&#39;t require any internet connection. This is because I wanted to ensure that the user&#39;s privacy is protected and that the user&#39;s data is not being sent to any third party servers.</p>

<p dir="auto">After downloading the repository, installing the requirements, and following the other setup instructions, you can run the main program by running the following command:</p>

<p dir="auto">Once the program is running, you can start a conversation with the assistant by saying the wake word. The default wake word is &#34;hey assistant&#34;, but you can change this in the <code>config.py</code> file.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Raspberry Pi 5 Model B</li>
<li>USB Microphone</li>
<li>Speaker</li>
<li>Camera</li>
</ul>


<p dir="auto">To keep this system as fast and lean as possible, we use cpp implementations of the audio transcription and vision language models. These are done with the wonderful libraries <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">whipser.cpp</a> for the audio transcription and <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> for the vision language model.</p>
<p dir="auto">In both cases, please clone these repositories wherever you like, and add their paths to the <code>config.py</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once cloned, please go to each repository, and follow the setup instructions to get the models running. Some pointers are given below:</p>
<p dir="auto">For llama.cpp, we are using the vision language model capabilities, which are slightly different from the standard setup. You will need to follow the setup instructions for <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/llava/README.md">LlaVA</a>, but update the model to be used to be one better suited for this device, <a href="https://moondream.ai" rel="nofollow">Moondream2</a></p>
<p dir="auto">To install Moondream, you&#39;ll need to go to HuggingFace model hub, and download the model. I did so using python, with the following commands. Once again, make sure the vision model path is added to the <code>config.py</code> file.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
model_id=&#34;vikhyatk/moondream2&#34;
snapshot_download(repo_id=model_id, local_dir=your/local/path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, revision=&#34;main&#34;)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>huggingface_hub</span> <span>import</span> <span>snapshot_download</span>
<span>model_id</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;vikhyatk/moondream2&#34;</span>

<p dir="auto">For whisper.cpp, you will need to follow the quick-start guide in the <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start">README</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The hardware setup is quite simple. You will need a Raspberry Pi 5 Model B, a USB microphone, a speaker, and a camera.</p>
<p dir="auto">The USB microphone and speaker can be plugged into the Raspberry Pi&#39;s USB ports. The camera can be connected to the camera port on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p dir="auto">I used the following hardware for my setup:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRSNCJ6Y?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi 5 Kit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087PTH787?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" rel="nofollow">USB Microphone</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075M7FHM1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1" rel="nofollow">Speaker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012V1HEP4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1" rel="nofollow">Camera</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0716TB6X3?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" rel="nofollow">Camera Connector</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please note Pi 5&#39;s have a new camera port, hence the new camera connector.</p>
<p dir="auto">Feel free to use your own, this is what worked for me.</p>
