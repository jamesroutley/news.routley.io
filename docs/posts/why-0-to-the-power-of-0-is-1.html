  <p>A set/category theoretic interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="encoding-0-and-1-as-sets">Encoding 0 and 1 as sets</h2>

<p>The standard encoding of the natural numbers as sets gives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 is the empty set \(\{\}\).</li>
  <li>1 is a set that contains 0. In set notation, it’s \(\{0\}\). Unfolding the definition further, it’s a set
that contains the empty set, \(\{\{\}\}\).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="counting-functions-with-exponents">Counting functions with exponents</h2>

<p><code>Target^Source</code> can be interpreted as the set of all functions from Source to
Target. This is seen in the powerset notation \(2^X\), where we can identify
subsets of \(X\) with maps into a 2 element set, where 1 element indicates “yes
this is in the subset” and the other indicates no.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Let</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source := \(\{1, 2\}\)</li>
  <li>Target := \(\{3\}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is exactly 1 function between these sets, which sends both 1 and 2 to 3.
The exponential formula predicts \(1^2 = 1\) possible functions, which checks out.</p>

<p>Let</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source := \(\{\}\)</li>
  <li>Target := \(\{1\}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is exactly 1 function between them, the empty set.</p>

<p>The empty set can be interpreted as a function because functions are subsets of
the Cartesian product <code>Source x Target</code>. An empty set meets this criteria.</p>

<p>Let</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source := \(\{1\}\)</li>
  <li>Target := \(\{\}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no functions between them because all elements of Source must be
mapped to something, but there’s nothing to map to. The exponential formula
gives \(0^1 = 0\) total functions.</p>

<p>Finally, let</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source := \(\{\}\)</li>
  <li>Target := \(\{\}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s nothing in Target to map to, but there’s also nothing that needs mapping
from since Source is empty too. So the empty set is a valid function between them.</p>

<p>Therefore, the set of all functions between empty sets (aka 0) is a set that
contains the empty set. Which is 1, by the standard encoding given above.</p>

<p>A nice confluence.</p>
