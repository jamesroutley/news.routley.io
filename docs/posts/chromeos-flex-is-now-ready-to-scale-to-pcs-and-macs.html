Just like too much sun, software bloat, clunky hardware, and security vulnerabilities can cause unwanted damage. Thankfully, ChromeOS Flex is just the sunscreen your legacy devices need. And thanks to everyone who has participated in our early access program, we&amp;#8217;ve been able to significantly improve the product in many areas while continuously certifying devices to run ChromeOS Flex. You can now experience modern computing at scale with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive security&lt;/b&gt;: ChromeOS Flex provides much needed protection from growing threats, including ransomware, malware, and employee errors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast deployment &amp;amp; easy management:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ChromeOS Flex can be rapidly deployed via USB or through your company network. With Chrome Enterprise Upgrade, you can manage apps and policies from anywhere, even the beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast, modern work experiences:&lt;/b&gt; Devices don&amp;#8217;t slow down over time. Background updates reduce device downtime and improve productivity, so you can spend extra time relaxing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sustainable for your business and planet:&lt;/b&gt; Breathe new life into existing hardware to reduce e-waste, energy consumption, and maintain clear blue skies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better for your business - and the beach - with 19% less power consumption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we all should be enjoying the summer heat, it&amp;#8217;s also a reminder that we need to take care of our planet. By installing ChromeOS Flex on your existing hardware, you&amp;#8217;re not only getting a great experience, you&amp;#8217;re also contributing to an important cause. Worldwide, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/helping-communities-manage-electronic-waste#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Global%20E,discarded%20in%20landfills%20or%20incinerated.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;40 million tons of e-waste is generated every year&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s like throwing away 800 laptops per second. Upgrading devices to ChromeOS Flex rather than replacing them altogether is an impactful way to reduce waste and prevent this growing problem. And if you really need the fans running to stay cool, you can feel better knowing that devices that run ChromeOS Flex consume 19% less energy on average&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; than other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ChromeOS Flex helps businesses when it matters most&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ransomware attack shut down operations, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/nordic-choice-hotels-bounces-back-ransomware-attack-chromeos-flex&#34;&gt;Nordic Choice Hotels&lt;/a&gt; chose ChromeOS Flex to quickly replace the OS on compromised devices and get them back online. ChromeOS Flex enabled Nordic Choice Hotels to turn a disaster into an upgrade. With a one-page guide and a USB drive, employees across 200 Nordic Choice hotels in Scandinavia were able to convert 2,000 computers in under 48 hours, protecting their business from a costly shutdown. And by switching to ChromeOS Flex, Nordic Choice Hotels will save up to 1.5 million kilos of CO2 over the next eight years - the equivalent of what 2,000 acres of mature forest would save.
