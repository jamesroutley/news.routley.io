<p>A year ago, Databricks acquired Lilac, the startup where I had been
first engineer. I thought there might be some years of stability after
<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/new_mountains">two years of tumult</a>, but strangely
enough, I found myself longing for the startup days at Lilac. I’d only
been at Lilac for six months, and we were acquired pre-seed – a very
early stage to be acquired – and felt like I’d missed out on some part
of the journey. So I’m leaving to do a startup. This time, though - I’m
putting myself in the driver’s seat as the founder, rather than as an
employee.</p>
<h2 id="my-year-at-databricks">My year at Databricks</h2>
<p>Databricks’s core business is data management, with origins in
providing managed Spark pipelines for data scientists and engineers. In
this business, Databricks excels as a second-mover, with product
development/release processes and customer support expectations measured
in years and not months. A “public preview” implies that Databricks has
thought through issues like API stability and compatibility, object
lifecycle management, data ownership and ACLs, compliance, and
multi-cloud support, while “general availability” adds full platform
support for specialized customer classes (gov, on-prem, healthcare,
financial, etc.) and stricter reliability/uptime. Databricks is quite
successful in this market, rapidly converting customers from other data
management vendors.</p>
<p>From the inside, Databricks has some of the strongest colleagues I’ve
ever worked with. The environment is intense, fast-paced, and the AI
division works extremely hard to try and keep up with the fast-changing
world of LLMs. Leadership is incredibly involved, far-sighted, and
exudes founder-in-charge energy. The organization is dynamic and core
developer infrastructure is being reinvented monthly as Databricks hits
the scaling point where it makes sense to dedicate engineers purely to
internal productivity.</p>
<p>Databricks is moving into the “Data + AI” space - a natural fit,
given that AI thrives when built atop the right business context and
data. When Lilac was acquired, Daniel and Nikhil (the Lilac founders)
and I joined the Agent Quality team to help Databricks customers iterate
on and improve their agents. Unfortunately, our team struggled to
balance enterprise product quality and a quickly evolving competitive
landscape (foundation model/finetuning -&gt; RAG -&gt; tool/function
calling -&gt; MCP -&gt; ???). We thrashed, trying to reach Public
Preview readiness while not quite sure that we’d found product-market
fit. Much work was wasted productionizing half-baked ideas that were
discarded in the final release, and much work continues to be wasted
maintaining backwards-compatibility with outdated approaches to working
with LLMs.</p>
<p>To their credit, once the Databricks leadership’s Eye of Sauron
turned to this problem, a new Beta process was rapidly created to
address these issues. But process was only part of the mismatch. We also
struggled to find team-product fit: the type of <em>infrastructure</em>
our team specialized at building was a category error with respect to
the <em>product</em> that we needed to build. We eventually found a good
fit - our team most recently released a <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/monitoring-agent-framework">Beta
for trace logging and agent monitoring</a>, which I think is the right
project for the Agent Quality team, for Databricks, for the LLM
space.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-databricks">Leaving Databricks</h2>
<p>My 1-year cliff makes for a natural point to ask whether I should
stay at Databricks. It finally feels like the team is hitting its
stride, after a year of seeking company-team-product-market fit. Still,
the year has been emotionally expensive for me. Frequent changes in
product direction, developer infrastructure, combined with cultural
mismatch have prevented me from performing at my best. I recently read
an essay on <a href="https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2025/02/09/2025-skunks.html">skunkwork
teams and projects</a> which describes a team culture that I would
strongly appreciate - and yet, the polar opposite of the culture I
experienced at Databricks. As a Databricks shareholder, I remain
extremely bullish on its prospects, but as a Databricks employee, I felt
like I was trying to cast myself into an employee mold that I didn’t fit
into.</p>
<p>The opportunity cost is high – there is very obviously a revolution
happening with LLMs, and in the same way that software-first companies
ate human-first companies, I anticipate that LLM-first companies will
eat software-first companies. The AI quality infrastructure I was
building at Databricks is important, but in the end it’s just
software.</p>
<h2 id="towards-an-llm-first-future">Towards an LLM-first future</h2>
<p>Over the next 3-6 months, I’m going to prototype, release, and see if
I can find some sort of product-market fit with an LLM wrapper product.
I believe there are profitable niches that won’t be swallowed by the
rising tide of foundation model capabilities, as <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/llm_predictions">discussed in a recent essay on LLM value
chains</a>, and I’ll see if I can claim one of those for myself.</p>
<p>Finding a profitable LLM-wrapper niche is my primary goal. Along the
way, I hope to explore LLM augmentation and delegation patterns - most
obviously in coding, but also in functions like marketing, sales,
support, and management. For example, I’m tinkering around with a
startup advisory board consisting of LLMs, to which I will submit weekly
progress updates for feedback, mentorship, and new ideas. I’m heavily
inspired by Manfred’s glasses from the now nearly 20-year old <a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html">Accelerando</a>.</p>
<p>Even if I fail at building a company, I anticipate that what I learn
about LLM-first companies will prepare me well for the coming decade.
The world is more fragile today, and nobody is safe from change. An
essay I wrote about <a href="http://localhost:8888/essays/homeostasis_volatility/">homeostasis
and volatility</a> four years ago now feels oddly prescient. In that
essay, I mention stress-induced mutagenesis as an adaptation to volatile
times. Success requires embracing risk, not just adapting to
changes.</p>
<h2 id="stay-in-touch">Stay in touch</h2>
<p>I have a private friends-and-family mailing list for weekly updates;
if you haven’t already gotten an invitation from me and are interested
in weekly updates, send me an email. I also plan to condense the weekly
updates into monthly updates for public consumption on my blog.</p>
