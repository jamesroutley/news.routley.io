    <h1>The dark forest and the cozy web (2020)</h1>

<p>It&#39;s the “high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.” The informal, untracked, messily human space that the bots and algorithms haven&#39;t infiltrated yet.</p>
<p>Venkat first proposed the term in one of his <em>Breaking Smart</em> emails on <!-- -->. He builds off Yancey Strickler&#39;s companion idea of
<!-- --> theory of the web. The “dark forest” is a place that <em>seems</em> eerily quiet and devoid of life. All the living creatures within it are hiding. Because “night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.”</p>
<p>The predators here are the advertisers, tracking bots, clickbait creators, attention-hungry influencers, reply guys, and trolls. It&#39;s unsafe to reveal yourself to them in any authentic way. So we retreat into private spaces. We hide in the cozy web.</p>

<p>Loving both of these notions, I felt compelled to bring them together into an illustrated diagram of our current social internet situation.</p>
