      These are just a handful of the threats and abuse sent to meteorologists at AEMET, Spain’s national weather agency, in recent months. They come via social media, its website, letters, phone calls – even in the form of graffiti sprayed across one of its buildings.

      Abuse and harassment<strong> </strong>“have always happened” against the agency’s scientists, Estrella Gutiérrez-Marco, spokesperson for AEMET, told CNN.

      But there has been a rapid rise recently, coinciding with extreme weather in Spain. A severe drought has shrunk water levels <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/europe/spain-drought-catalonia-heat-wave-climate-intl/index.html" target="_blank">to alarming lows</a>, exacerbated by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/europe/spain-high-temperature-heat-climate-intl/index.html" target="_blank">record-breaking April temperatures</a>.

      The abuse got so bad that in April, AEMET <a href="https://twitter.com/Aemet_Corpora/status/1648219308366114817?" target="_blank" target="_blank">posted a video</a> on Twitter calling for an end to the harassment, and asking for respect. Even the government intervened. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for the ecological transition, <a href="https://twitter.com/Teresaribera/status/1654374183655165953" target="_blank" target="_blank">posted on Twitter</a> in support of the agency: “Lying, giving wings to conspiracy and fear, insulting … It is time to say enough.”

      Under many of the agency’s Twitter posts, especially those that refer to more extreme weather, users have posted images of blue skies, crisscrossed with wispy, white trails.

      In April, meteorologist Isabel Moreno <a href="https://twitter.com/IsabelIsamoren/status/1644979822194487301" target="_blank" target="_blank">wrote a tweet</a> saying “rain skips Spain,” with an image of a band of rain stretching across Europe but missing Spain almost entirely.

      “It was one of the hardest experiences in social media in my life,” said Moreno, who appears on the Spanish TV channel RTVE. “I received HUNDREDS of responses to an (apparently) inoffensive tweet,” she told CNN in an email.

      While there were plenty of supportive messages, too, it was scary, Moreno said. “I have never seen either that amount of responses nor that level of aggression.” It took days for her to be able to go onto Twitter again without feeling anxious or stressed.

      The role meteorologists have in explaining how climate change affects the weather, especially extreme weather, is a particular flashpoint.

      Conspiracy theories feed on this fear by offering a simple, enticing explanation, said López-Borrull. It’s easier to believe climate change is fake, or a manipulation by powerful people, than get your head around the complex problem and what it means for society.

      It’s difficult to combat conspiracy theories when they bubble up. Some experts say they offer simple charts and rebuttals when they can, but try to ignore those who come in bad faith.

      Doug McNeall, a climate scientist and statistician at the Met Office Hadley Centre, a UK research center, said that, as a scientist, he welcomes being challenged. “If people come with better evidence, and you change your mind, that’s good,” he told CNN.

      Moreno echoed this. “I find it very difficult to change the minds of people that really have strong beliefs in these conspiracies,” she said. It’s easier to prevent the ideas from taking hold in people in the first place by tackling the myths and explaining how the atmosphere works, she added.

      This kind of communication can really help, said King. Some of the best initiatives are “when media outlets or scientific institutions really try to demystify the process of how they produce public interest data,” she said.
