    <h1>Top Russian rocket scientist dies from ‘mushroom poisoning’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="cadmus-article_195724">
<p>A Russian rocket scientist has died after mysteriously being poisoned – with Russian state media saying that he ate edible mushrooms.</p>
<p>Professor Vitaly Melnikov, 77, had headed the Department of Rocket and Space Systems at RSC Energia before becoming suddenly seriously ill days before he died.</p>
<p>A Moscow newspaper claimed that inedible mushrooms were the reason for his sudden downturn in health.</p>
<p>Russian doctors were unable to save Melkinov from the “severe poisoning” that he suffered – as he battled against his fate for more than two weeks after he fell ill.</p>

<p>Melkinov had worked with the Russian state space agency Roscosmos – including times when he cooperated with foreign counterparts including at NASA.</p>
<p>Melkinov is the latest in a series of unusual deaths in Russia since the outbreak of the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>From a sausage tycoon found dead in a hotel, to a toad-venom shaman hangover cure gone wrong, a series of individuals who have met a bizarre demise.</p>
<p>Fears of assassination have increased since the Wagner group’s attempted mutiny last month with the private military company’s chief Yevgeny Prigozhin killed in an apparent assassination attempt weeks after the aborted coup.</p>
<p>The Vice-President of a Russian bank, Kristina Baikova, fell to her death from a window in her Moscow apartment earlier this week. Loko Bank is a commercial bank headquartered in Moscow with “reputable foreign investors” in its share capital.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of other high-profile Russians who have died in suspicious circumstances since the war began.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristina Baikova – 23rd June 2023</strong></p>
<p>The Vice-President of a Russian bank, Kristina Baikova, fell to her death from a window in her 11th-floor-apartment in Moscow.
