    <h1>Funtoo Linux is shutting down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>
	All good things must come to an end. I&#39;ve decided to end the Funtoo Linux project. Funtoo started as a philosophy to create a fun community of contributors building something great together. For me, it&#39;s no longer that so I need to move on to other things. There is not a successor BDFL for Funtoo nor am I interested in trying to find one, or hand the project off to someone else. You can expect the project to wind down through August. If you have a Funtoo container, it will continue to be online through the end of August so you have time to find another hosting solution if you need one.
