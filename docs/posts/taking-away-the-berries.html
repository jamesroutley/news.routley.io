    <h1>Taking away the berries</h1>
    
    
<p>
I sometimes write the beginnings of posts but don't post them.  I still 
save them in case conditions change or other things happen and make me 
want to follow up on the topic.  In this case, I wrote something about 
offices before the whole COVID lockdown thing happened and people 
largely stopped going to offices every day.  With that in mind, let's 
proceed.
</p><p>
Offices tend to have break rooms.  If you're lucky, it'll have a clean 
source of water and a safe place to stash your bagged lunch.  If you're 
of the coffee-drinking persuasion, then maybe it'll have a coffee pot 
that's kept somewhat clean and never violated by really evil disgruntled 
people.  There might even be a place to sit down for a while if you 
normally stand all day, or walk around if you normally sit.
</p><p>
However, tech companies decided to go past this at some point and 
brought about this whole notion of "microkitchens".  This is where 
they'd put their branding on the coolers (instead of "Coca-Cola" or 
"Pepsi") and would load it up with every kind of fizzy sugary liquid 
they could get their hands on.  They'd have racks and racks of shelving 
packed with all sorts of interesting crunchy, sugary and carb-loaded 
snacks.  They'd also have professional coffee and espresso machines so 
that people could serenade the whole office with their steaming skills.
</p><p>
Invariably, conditions change, and the company wants to recoup some of 
the dollars they are spending on this stuff.  Some of the micro kitchens 
go away and others shrink, and people complain.  I certainly did... the 
first time it happened.  They had claimed that those benefits were part 
of my salary and are why they offered me what they did.  I wrote about 
this a few years later, and was taken to task for it by the Internet.
</p><p>
By the time my next Big Tech job happened, I had no delusions about 
the food situation.  It would be there for a while, and then it would 
shrink, and indeed, over the next four and a half years, it did in fact 
do exactly that.  I just smiled at the people who were going through it 
for the first time.  
</p><p>
Every single thing that happened at company G then happened at company 
F.  It just took a while, and didn't always happen in the same order.  
</p><p>
Long after that, I foolishly signed up to do this sort of thing again, 
but this time I had planned to handle these things myself.  People would 
occasionally rope me into having lunch on site, but I tried to get OUT 
of the office as much as possible.  This company's office was in the 
middle of a real (if troubled) big city and was therefore walkable to a 
great many things.  I could get pizza, fried chicken, a bar burger, 
soup and a salad with a cookie, another kind of pizza, soul food... all 
on foot.  There was also a Philz Coffee right across the street for 
those afternoons when things really 
<a href="/w/2020/05/22/boarded/">sucked</a>
and I just wanted to get away for a while and recharge before trying 
again.
</p><p>
So, what did I write back in 2019, while in that gig, then?  This:
</p><p>
...
</p><p>
The best time to take away the free berries in the break room (or free 
sodas, or snacks, or candy, or kombucha on tap, or ...) is yesterday.  
This is always true.
</p><p>
The sooner you take it away, the sooner it will "age out" of the company 
history, and go from a sore point, to a joke (the "no-berry" all-hands 
meeting room), to a legend ("why is it named that?"), and then finally 
"those people were just entitled and stupid".
</p><p>
This is because most of the people who were around for it leave, and 
many more people join.  Look at the average tenure of the employees in 
your company to get an idea of what the "half-life" is for the 
population.  The people don't miss it because they never had it in the 
first place.
</p><p>
So, my take on kitchens and break rooms?  Have fresh water available, 
preferably both cold and not-cold (not necessarily hot).
</p><p>
Pay your employees enough so they can buy snacks and not feel bad about 
it.  Don't put your company in a f'in 
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/01/02/facebook-staffers-sentenced-to-sun-quentin/"><em>mud flat</em></a>
so they can actually LEAVE THE OFFICE to spend that money... on snacks.  
Or lunch.  Or coffee.
</p><p>
Don't
<a href="/w/2018/04/17/company/">pack employees in so tightly</a>
that you can't drive away for lunch because there will be nowhere to 
park when you return.
</p><p>
Appreciate the fact that giving them a chance to shift gears may just 
bring the kinds of fresh perspectives you're not going to get from 
having wage slaves who don't leave the building once in nine hours.
</p><p>
Of course, if you WANT assembly-line workers who just glue things 
together and don't build lovely things or solve hard problems by using 
their innate tool-using capacity they have as healthy, happy people, 
then don't do any of what I said.  Instead, build the hell out of those 
mud flats and keep 'em locked up all day long, then take away the stuff 
when they don't act appreciative.
</p><p>
Before long, you'll have washed out anyone who cares about that kind of 
thing and will be left with the nice, sort of "grey goo" that can be 
molded to do whatever you want, you lovely little sociopath, you.
</p><p>
Have fun with that.
