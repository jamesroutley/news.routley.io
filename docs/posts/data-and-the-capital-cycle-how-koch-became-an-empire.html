    <h1>Data and the Capital Cycle: How Koch Became an Empire</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/11/data_capital_cycle_koch.jpg" alt="Data and the Capital Cycle: How Koch Became an Empire"><p>One of the more interesting things that we can do now that the <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/">Commoncog Case Library</a> is up is to experiment with post formats. The following essay draws from a handful of cases about Koch Industries &#x2014; examples that would make this essay too long if all I could do was to write up each case in full within the text of the essay. With the Case Library, however, I can now selectively quote snippets from each case, and offload the full context to the library itself. (This is a fancy way of saying that I expect you to read the cases after reading this synthesis, heh.)</p><p>What makes this particularly fun is that these cases bring together concepts from the two series that we&#x2019;ve been covering over the past few months. These are:</p><ol><li><a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">The Data Driven Series</a> &#x2014; in particular, the idea that the purpose of data is <em>knowledge</em> (&#x201C;theories or models that help you better predict the outcomes of your business actions.&#x201D;)</li><li><a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-expertise-in-business-series/">The Capital Expertise Series</a> &#x2014; in particular, the ideas about <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-allocation-antidote-to-business-luck/">growth</a> through <a href="https://commoncog.com/build-valuable-business-how-you-spend-it/">capital allocation</a>, about tapping capital for expansion through <a href="https://commoncog.com/fundraising-without-investors/">retained earnings</a>, and about manoeuvring through the <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-capital-cycle/">capital cycle</a>. </li></ol><p>This essay brings <em>all of these concepts together</em>, through the lens of one company: Koch Industries.</p><h2 id="deming-at-the-start-of-the-flywheel">Deming at the Start of the Flywheel</h2><p>In 1968, Charles Koch took over his father&#x2019;s company, a small engineering firm named the Rock Island Oil &amp; Refining Company. Charles renamed it to &#x2018;Koch Industries&#x2019; shortly after taking over. At the time, Rock Island was primarily an engineering concern; it also owned a 35% interest in the Great Northern Oil Company, which in turned owned three major things: first, the Pine Bend refinery in Minnesota, second, a crude oil-gathering system in Oklahoma, and third, a handful of cattle ranches. From this odd collection of assets, Koch grew the company into a privately held, diversified, global empire.</p><p>How did he do so? </p><p>Shortly after Koch took over, the entire oil industry &#x2014; and the US economy along with it &#x2014; took a turn for the worse:</p>
