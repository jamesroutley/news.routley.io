<p>Alright, so you might think that there are better ways to spend your Easter break than sitting all of your evenings customizing <em>Neovim</em> with no prior knowledge. Youâ€™re probably right. Sceptics may also say that Iâ€™ve reproduced <em>VSCode</em> instead of simply using it. They are also probably right. Or are they? ðŸ¤”</p>



<h3>First of all, why learn <em>Vim</em>?</h3>



<p>I am a big lover of keyboard and a great hater of a mouse or touchpad. The major reason for those extreme emotions is mainly caused by my (maybe superstitious) need to work as effective as possible. I feel like moving your hand from the keyboard to the mouse every time you want to move the cursor a few words back or forth, to create a new file, split the window or whatever, is a major waste of time. The problem with VSCode or any other graphical editor is that the necessity to use a mouse is encoded in the design of those applications. I tried using this<em> Vim</em> extension for <em>VSCode</em>, but it felt clunky and I couldnâ€™t get used to it (the same goes for <em>Vim</em> browser extensions, but thatâ€™s a different story).</p>



<p>My frustration with GUI IDEs had grown for some time. I used<em> Vim</em> only for some small, fast changes, but I did know only a couple of hotkeys, so I didnâ€™t use it in any serious coding sessions. <strong>I had been scared of learning <em>Vim</em> for a long time, but one day I decided to just use it and learn it on the fly.</strong> And that was a hecking good idea.</p>



<h3>How did I learn <em>Vim</em>?</h3>



<p>I think that <em>vimtutor</em> was a major drawback for me in learning <em>Vim</em>. That kind of learning feels artificial and I didnâ€™t feel I got any value after completing it. My method was more organic in a sense. Iâ€™ve found some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vim.rtorr.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vim.rtorr.com/" target="_blank">nice site with a nicely formatted cheat sheet of <em>Vim</em> shortcuts</a>, printed it and hung it over my computer screen and just used <em>Vim</em> all the time. If I wanted to perform some action that I thought can be done neatly using some keyboard shortcut, I just scanned the list searching for an appropriate hotkey. I think that this approach is great. Iâ€™ve quickly memorized the shortcuts that were frequently needed and then it was quite easy to get used to some other, not so often, but equally helpful commands.</p>



<p>If youâ€™ve also thought about trying <em>Vim</em> but felt like the entry-level is too high, then I seriously recommend trying this approach. If you restrain yourself to use it then Iâ€™m pretty sure that after a few days youâ€™re gonna love <em>Vim</em> and appreciate it even more. Now, Iâ€™m not an expert, but still, I feel that with the basic knowledge I can do magic that was impossible for me in <em>VSCode</em> or any other GUI editor I used.</p>

<h2><em>Neovim</em> takes it to another level</h2>



<p>I must admit, bare <em>Vim</em> with only the basic options it offers is still inferior to a GUI editor like <em>VSCode</em> (but I know some people that disagree). I like the idea of a  file-searching engine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">language server</a>, session and project management, drop-down windows, file tree and many other features. Fortunately, those concepts are very well suited to a text-based editor like <em>Vim</em>. Theyâ€™re just not there out of the box. This is where <em>Neovim</em> comes to play.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s important to note, that Iâ€™m no expert. Some <em>Vim</em> veterans may argue that <em>Neovim</em> is redundant bloatware and they may have some point. However, I feel that <em>Neovim</em> have some significant advantages over <em>Vim</em>:</p>



<ul><li>Itâ€™s developed by many contributors, whereas <em>Vim</em> is in hands of one person (itâ€™s not entirely true, but just look at the commit history for both of those editors, it speaks for itself)</li><li><em>Neovim</em> is an implementation of <em>Vim</em> focused on performance and customizability and you can feel it,</li><li>Customization can be done entirely in Lua, which feels like a great alternative for Vimscript (which is ugly IMHO),</li><li><em>Neovim</em> is great out of the box.</li></ul>



<p>The only place where N<em>eovim</em> loses with <em>Vim</em> is remote access â€“ thereâ€™s only <em>Vim</em> available on a remote server in most cases, but thatâ€™s a minor disadvantage in my case.</p>



<p>Searching for some cool plugins and tweaking them was a very cheerful time and I run into almost no problems during the whole process. And, to be honest, <strong>20 hours for creating a virtually full IDE from scratch customized entirely for your personal needs does not seem that much time at all</strong>. Lua is an easy and pretty language for configuration code, I think Iâ€™ve learnt it pretty well just by reading pluginsâ€™ code. Iâ€™ve also followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&amp;list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ&amp;ab_channel=chris%40machine" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&amp;list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ&amp;ab_channel=chris%40machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this awesome tutorial</a>. It is great, modular and easy to follow.</p>

<h3><em>Sounds great, but I donâ€™t have time for this</em></h3>



<p>Bullshit. Seriously, you probably have time to watch some junk content on YouTube or whatever you like to waste your time on (I do it too, but still, itâ€™s most often a waste of time, one can rest better), but donâ€™t have time to work a little bit longer for a couple of days? Just try it out, learning <em>Vim</em> is not as scary as it may look at the first glance. After you learn to use the shortcuts for some time you can move to <em>Neovim</em> and try configuring it. And if you feel like itâ€™s too much of a bother for you, then maybe try <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim" target="_blank">LunarVim</a></em> or <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/neovide/neovide" target="_blank">Neovide</a></em>, which are some prepared <em>Neovim</em> configurations. I havenâ€™t use them, but they look sensible. I still recommend taking your time to configure it yourself though. Youâ€™re gonna have full control over your configuration and after some practice, itâ€™s going to be ridiculously simple to tweak it further. If you want to look at my configuration, then <a href="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/">head to my </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/" target="_blank">git</a><a href="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://git.framal.xyz/nvim-configs.git/"> page</a>.</p>



<h2>Plan of action â€“ switching to <em>Neovim</em> as your primary editor</h2>



<ol><li>Try learning <em>Vim</em> shortcuts first. Donâ€™t use any custom installation, just bare <em>vim</em> with a sensible <em>.vimrc</em>, like this one:  <pre><code>&#34;sets line numbering and relative line numbering 
set number relativenumber  

set shiftwidth=4 
set tabstop=4                

&#34;expands tabs to spaces set 
set expandtab                

&#34;highlight current line 
set cursorline    

&#34;ignore case in searching 
set ignorecase 

&#34;if mixed case in search then don&#39;t ignore it 
set smartcase  

&#34;scrolling begins at 5th line from top or bottom  
set scrolloff=5 

&#34;sets syntax highlighting on 
syntax on 
encoding=utf-8 

&#34;Saves the position of screen at exit 
autocmd BufWinLeave *.* mkview 

&#34;Restores screen last position 
autocmd BufWinEnter *.* silent loadview</code></pre>
</li><li>Have the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://vim.rtorr.com" data-type="URL" data-id="vim.rtorr.com" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> close. Try using <em>hjkl</em> instead of arrows. <strong>Donâ€™t use your mouse</strong>. Learn how to search and replace text. Abuse <em>w, e, b</em>. Use &lt;<em>number&gt;&lt;action&gt;</em> to perform an action number of times, for example, <em>5j</em> moves the cursor 5 lines down. Use every visual mode. Learn how to copy and paste.</li><li>Move to <em>Neovim</em>. Install packer, try configuring it. Install some basic plugins. I recommend following this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&amp;list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ&amp;ab_channel=chris%40machine" data-type="URL" target="_blank">tutorial by crhis@machine</a>.</li></ol>



<p>Whatâ€™s your view on <em>Vim</em> or <em>Neovim</em>? Did you try it and still prefer a graphical editor? Do you have a strong opinion that <em>Emacs</em> is superior to <em>Vim</em>? If you have any thoughts, donâ€™t hesitate and comment under this post. Iâ€™ll be more than happy to hear your opinion.</p>
