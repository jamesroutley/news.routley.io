Last week, his company announced the authorization of a $70 billion stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/google-authorizes-70-billion-buyback.html">buyback</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet has been aggressively cutting costs, including the elimination of 12,000 jobs, in response to slowing revenue growth.</p><p>That confluence of events has raised the ire of Google&#39;s workforce. In the weeks since Pichai&#39;s annual compensation was made public, internal Google platforms have filled with conversations and memes slamming the CEO for taking a pay bump while slashing costs elsewhere. Some employees also criticized the share repurchase, which equaled its 2022 buyback.</p><p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000130817923000736/lgoog2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank">SEC filings</a> showed Pichai was paid a total of $226 million last year, mostly through a $218 million stock award, which he receives every three years. The last time he received the award, in 2019, it was for $276.6 million and total compensation was $280.6 million.</p><p>His 2022 package included nearly $6 million for personal security and a $2 million base salary. In 2021, Pichai received a total of $6.3 million, consisting of a $2 million salary and $4.3 million in other compensation.</p><p>Memes began circulating comparing Pichai to <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/quotes/AAPL/">Apple</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, who in January received over a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/apple-ceo-tim-cook-receives-a-40percent-pay-cut-after-shareholder-vote.html">40% cut</a> from his 2022 target total compensation.

One meme with more than 1,200 likes referred to comments from finance chief Ruth Porat, who wrote last month in a rare companywide email that the company is making &#34;multi-year&#34; cuts to employee services. CNBC found <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/google-to-cut-down-on-employee-laptops-services-and-staplers-to-save.html">cuts ranged</a> from employee laptops and expenses to fitness classes and cafe items. </p><p>&#34;Ruth&#39;s cost savings applied to everyone… except our hardworking VPS and CEO,&#34; the meme said.</p><p>Google didn&#39;t provide an on-the-record comment for this story. </p><p>It&#39;s not the first time Pichai has been under fire for his recent decision making. In January, PIchai said he took &#34;full responsibility&#34; for conditions that led to the companywide layoffs.</p><p>At an<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html"> all-hands</a> meeting, employees asked Pichai why executives are getting pay cuts if he&#39;s taking responsibility. Pichai responded by saying that senior vice presidents are taking &#34;significant reductions to their bonuses&#34; and that he was forgoing his bonus.</p><p>Another popular meme showed an image of Shrek character Lord Farquaad with the text &#34;Sundar accepting $226 million while laying off 12k Googlers, cutting perks, and destroying morale and culture.&#34; A quote from the character read, &#34;some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.&#34;</p><p>In the computer-animated fantasy from 2001, Lord Farquaad is the ruler of Duloc who exiles many fairytale creatures to the swamp.</p><p>The topic of Pichai and money has been a controversial one dating back to late last year, when the CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html">said at a companywide meeting</a> that &#34;we shouldn&#39;t always equate fun with money.&#34; At the time, he was responding to certain perks the company was eliminating, but he dodged employee questions about cutting executive compensation.</p><p>Some of the frustration is being directed at Google&#39;s plan to repurchase $70 billion in stock, a sign the company has more than enough cash to cover its operations and investments. A recent meme that was liked more than 700 times read, &#34;$70 billion in buybacks shows we respect external shareholders more than Googlers.&#34;</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/04/17/a-i-may-ruin-alphabets-only-real-business-google-search-says-cic-wealths-malcom-ethridge.html">A.I. may ruin Alphabet&#39;s only real business</a></p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107226517"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107226517" data-vilynx-id="7000295108" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107226518-16817604501681760446-29062636688-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1681761886&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="A.I. may ruin Alphabet&#39;s only real business: Google Search, says CIC Wealth&#39;s Malcolm Ethridge"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
