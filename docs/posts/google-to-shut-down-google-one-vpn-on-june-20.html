In a <a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/14806901" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Google One help page</a> and in the Google One app, the company revealed that the VPN feature will no longer be available starting June 20, 2024.</p><p>When asked why Google is retiring the VPN service, a company spokesperson previously told ZDNET: &#34;We&#39;re refocusing our efforts to support more in-demand features with Google One. To keep our subscription service fresh, we&#39;re discontinuing the VPN feature, as we found people simply weren&#39;t using it.&#34; </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" rel="follow">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed</a></strong></p><p>Introduced in 2018, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-google-one-and-is-it-worth-it/" rel="follow">Google One is a subscription-based plan</a> that bundles a variety of features across tiers ranging from $1.99 per month to $19.99 per month. The basic levels offer cloud storage, dark web monitoring, Google Photos editing tools, and for now, the VPN. The more expensive tiers include 10% back in the Google Store, Google Workspace premium features, Gemini Advanced, and Gemini in Gmail and Docs.</p><!----><p>Added in October 2020, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/browsing-from-the-coffee-shop-you-might-want-to-try-googles-new-vpn-service/" rel="follow">VPN was initially only available with certain paid plans</a> and only on Android devices. Over time, Google <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-one-brings-vpn-feature-to-more-plans-adds-dark-web-monitoring-for-personal-info/" rel="follow">expanded the feature</a> to cover all paid Google One plans and kicked in support for iOS, Windows, and MacOS.</p><p>Designed to protect multiple devices, the VPN is especially effective if you&#39;re using unsecured Wi-Fi networks in public places. In a <a href="https://one.google.com/about/vpn/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white paper</a>, Google explains exactly how the VPN works and how it secures your internet connections.</p><p>All the above reasons are why many Google One users will likely lament the loss of such a useful security tool. Unfortunately, Google has a history of killing products and services that it feels are no longer worth its time and effort. Thankfully, people who need a new VPN have other options. </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/security-researchers-say-this-scary-exploit-could-render-all-vpns-useless/" rel="follow">Security researchers say this scary exploit could render all VPNs useless</a></strong></p><p>Google offers a VPN through its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/google-fi-gets-a-new-name-tweaked-pricing-and-a-new-focus-on-family-plans/" rel="follow">Fi wireless subscription</a>, which spans monthly data plans ranging from $35 to $110.
