    <h1>What&#39;s making me happy 2024-01-14</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Week 2 of 2024&#39;s<a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy"> #happy</a> posts. Two times makes a successfully cemented habit, right?</p>
<p>TV &amp; Movies</p>
<ul>
<li>In anime watching, I watched this weeks episodes of <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/153518/Delicious-in-Dungeon/">Delicious in Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Solo-Leveling/">Solo Leveling</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/161645/The-Apothecary-Diaries/">The Apothecary Diaries</a> and <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Frieren-Beyond-Journeys-End/">Frieren</a>. In anime watching, I&#39;ve been thinking about picking up <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/154116/Undead-Unluck/">Undead Unluck</a> and <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/163151/HIGH-CARD-Season-2/">High Card S2</a> but haven&#39;t yet.</li>
<li>We rewatched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge!">Moulin Rouge</a>. I probably last saw it twenty years ago. I had forgetten how weird this movie is.</li>
<li>This weeks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers">Bob&#39;s Burgers</a> was fantastic.</li>
<li>The finale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)">For All Mankind</a> was a bit trippy. I didn&#39;t quite expect Margo&#39;s or Miles&#39;s outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Music</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve been listening to some favorite older albums on repeat: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5MoaDbFw4nrm2P7Om1on3b?si=qN9HAFPWQymN0KLTXesBlg">Give Up by The Postal Service</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2yNhqBKfZPzrxRJqGMbSz9?si=ikLTfFVGTzuEal-LWj4nJw">So Jealous by Tegan and Sara</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read</p>
<ul>
<li>Been thinking about moving the postgres server I have on GCP to my home lab. So I&#39;ve been reading a few articles on self-hosting postgres.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ryan-schachte.com/blog/ha_postgres_zolando/">Self-hosting a high-availability Postgres cluster on Kubernetes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://geshan.com.np/blog/2021/12/docker-postgres/">Postgres with Docker and Docker compose</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Played the boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/311900/votes-women">Votes for Women</a> and it was a delight. Lots of fun, and learned a ton of history. A bit complicated to setup, but once it&#39;s going makes total sense. We played with three people, but could see it being a lot of fun with two or four as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s it! I hope you have a great week.</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
