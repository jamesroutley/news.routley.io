<p>Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise: DAT players were fantastic. They
offered all the advantages of an audio cassette, but with the sound
quality of a CD. The compact audio cassette was a marvellous invention,
in its own way; but this technology struggled to provide audio fidelity
that would satisfy discerning listeners. Its frequency response was
limited, and the unavoidable background hiss was very obvious in quiet
environments. Still, in the 1970s audio cassettes were <em>the</em> way
most people listened to music, and I still have a stack of them.</p>
<p>One thing that made cassettes so popular was that you could record on
them. Setting aside the legal issues, you could record from FM radio, or
from vinyl records, or even from microphones. It was easy to make ‘mix
tapes’ of you favourite tracks, and share them with friends. Cassettes
were everywhere – from portable players like the Walkman, to serious
hardware in hi-fi racks; they were even in cars.</p>
<p>Serious hi-fi enthusiasts, however, listened to vinyl records or FM
radio. There <em>were</em> good-quality cassette decks, but the
`audiophile’ crowd embraced them with reluctance, if at all. Still, even
the most ardent hi-fi junkie couldn’t deny the usefulness of cassettes.
What we needed was something that could record high-quality sources,
with no loss of fidelity.</p>
<p>That’s where DAT, ‘digital audio tape’ comes in. DAT offered digital
recording, in a range of qualities, the highest of which exceeded that
of CD. If you wanted to record from a CD, you could just connect the CD
transport’s digital output to the DAT’s digital input, and away you go.
Well, maybe – more this subject later. Of course, most DAT units could
record from analog sources like radio as well.</p>
<p>DAT entered the market at about the same time as CD, but was much
less successful. For all its notional advantages, DAT never really
caught on in the domestic market, although it was somewhat more popular
in professional applications. A companion data storage technology, DDS,
used the same hardware, and was somewhat more successful although,
again, in professional rather than domestic applications.</p>
<p>The DTC-700, introduced in 1990, was Sony’s ‘budget’ hi-fi DAT
player/recorder. The more expensive DTC-55ES and DTC-60ES models had
fancy (and probably snake oil) features like a copper chassis. Yes,
copper is a better electrical conductor than steel, but a great chunk of
steel like the DTC-700 chassis is a pretty good conductor already. I’ve
not been able to find how much a new DTC-700 cost but, even as the
introductory model in the range, I imagine it was well into
sell-a-kidney territory. In 1995, even a five-year-old, second-hand unit
was eye-wateringly expensive. These days, you can pick up a refurbished
unit for about three hundred quid. It’s well worth the money – if you
can find tapes. There are lots more digital DDS tapes in circulation
that audio tapes; these are not guaranteed to be compatible with audio
players, but early DDS tapes often are.</p>

<p>The DTC-700 had a flight-deck of controls, because it offered a stack
of functionality. It had two different digital inputs and an analog
input; there was a headphone amplifier with its own volume control; you
could skip to specific tracks by their number, or to a particular time;
and, of course, you could insert the meta-data that made this possible
when you recorded. And, like all serious hi-fi equipment, it had a
vaccuum-flourescent display, available in different colours. For that
real 70s look, you could buy it with mock-walnut case sides.</p>
<p>Compared to cassettes, DAT recordings sounded fantastic. It wasn’t
necessary for the rest of your equipment – amplifier, speakers,
headphones – to be of top quality to realize this: the difference
between DAT and cassette was just that striking. In principle, DAT
offered better-than-CD quality, with its 48kHz sampling rate. In fact,
DAT set the standard here: 48kHz remains a common sampling rate to this
day. Folklore has it that Sony was encouraged to adopt 48kHz to make it
harder to record commercial CDs, which used (and still use) 44.1kHz.
Back in the 90s, technology hardly existed to resample these different
formats on-the-fly; eventually, Sony and others started selling DAT
units that supported 44.1kHz directly. This wasn’t an entirely welcome
move, as I’ll explain later.</p>
<p>High cost was one of the reasons – perhaps the main reason – why DAT
didn’t catch on in the domestic market; but it certainly wasn’t the only
one. Another problem was the lack of original material: recording
studios didn’t seem to want to release commercial recordings on DAT.
Their reluctance isn’t hard to understand: DAT tapes could be copied an
unlimited number of times, with no loss of quality. In the the late 80s
it wasn’t easy to copy a CD onto DAT, because of the different sampling
rates. But there would have been no such limitation with a DAT-to-DAT
copy.</p>
<p>Representatives of the recording industry were so worried about
illegal copying that, in the USA and elsewhere, they bullied legislators
into placing legal restrictions on the capabilities and sale of DAT
recorders. The USA also introducted taxation on the sales of DAT
devices, which was supposed to offset the loss in tax revenue that
illegal copying would create. This made expensive DAT players even more
expensive. Sony tamed the objections of the recording industry, to some
extent, by the simple expedient of buying CBS Records, one of the main
objectors. Nevertheless, the DTC-700 still suffers from the anti-copying
paranoia of the 80s; it will record a CD, but it will write meta-data
onto the recording to indicate that it’s a copy. The DTC-700, and other
DAT units of the same vintage, won’t record from another DAT unit, if
the meta-data indicates that the source is a copy. There are ways around
this limitation, but they’re fiddly.</p>
<p>Whether illegal copying was a genuine risk or not, there never really
was a large selection of original music on DAT. As I recall, there
wasn’t even a “killer album” for DAT, like Dire Straits’ <em>Brothers in
Arms</em> – an album so popular that people bought CD players just to
hear it at its best.</p>
<p>DAT units also tended to have problems with reliability;
understanding why requires a basic understanding of how DAT technology
works.</p>
<p>From a technological perspective, DAT was implemented in an
interesting way. “Interesting” in this context means, of course, “weird
and unreliable”. The DAT tape itself is only 4mm wide – the same as an
audio cassette. To get sufficient data bandwidth, the tape couldn’t be
scanned lengthwise, as all previous tape formats were. At the speeds
that would have been required, the tape length would have been
unmanageable. Instead, DAT works in a similar way to a VHS video
recorder: the magnetic head is on a rotating drum, aligned at an angle
to the direction of tape movement. This arrangement allows the whole
width of the tape to be used, not just a couple of narrow strips in the
middle.</p>
<p>Naturally, the scanning mechanism required close-tolerance alignment
to operate reliably. Even when adjusted perfectly, the high rate of
rotation led to mechanical stresses. This was true of VHS as well, but
VHS players rapidly became throw-away items – eventually nobody really
cared if they only lasted a year or two. But if you’d just paid the
price of a new car for a DAT player, you’d expect a better service life.
And Sony didn’t help itself: the DTC-700 contained a huge number of
low-cost, plastic parts in critical locations. A plastic cog might cost
only pennies to replace, but stripping the machine down to get to it
cost a lot more.</p>
<p>In the end, though, I don’t think it was the price, or the lack of
commercial releases, or the questionnable reliability, or the legal
complications that killed off DAT – although all these factors played a
part. Rather, I think it was just that old bugbear of the consumer
electronics industry: market saturation.</p>
<p>By about 1992, everybody who was ever likely to want a home DAT
player already had one. The format couldn’t readily be improved, because
it already offered audio fidelity beyond the limits of human hearing. So
there wasn’t a “DAT Mark 2” that manufacturers could have sold to eager
customers. If DAT players could have been made more cheaply, this might
have expanded the customer base a little. But I doubt that DAT units
could ever have become as cheap as cassette players, and certainly not
as portable, because the electromechanical design was so complex and
fussy.</p>
<p>It’s not as if any alternative technology has really presented
itself. These days, it’s trivially easy to record from digital or analog
sources, onto hard disk or solid-state storage. Any desktop computer
with a soundcard can do this. A number of manufacturers, including Sony,
did release self-contained hard-disk audio recorders, but they seem to
have enjoyed even less success than DAT. And these days, of course,
there’s even less need for such a device than there was in the 90s. If I
want to listen to a radio broadcast more than once, I can probably just
get it from the broadcaster’s website. Some modern radio tuners even
have built-in digital recording capabilities. No: if there were any
demand for a modern alternative to the DAT recorder, somebody would be
selling one.</p>
<p>Many of the audio technologies from my youth have undergone a
revivial recently: vinyl records are the obvious example, but even
cassettes are starting to sell again. Are we likely to see renewed
interest in DAT? On the whole, I think probably not. Plenty of people
look back with fondness on vinyl and cassette, even on CD; I don’t think
DAT gives anybody a warm glow.</p>
<p>Except, perhaps, me.</p>
