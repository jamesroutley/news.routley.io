    <h1>Ask HN: Is there any tool for benchmarking responsiveness for Linux?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>System76 recently announced their responsiveness optimizer, System76 Scheduler [0], which basically works as a daemon, adjusting the nice value and the CFS knobs for processes in the box for increased responsiveness. They&#39;ve claimed that the responsiveness is therefore increased, which I&#39;m also believed so.<p>However, this got me wondering, is there exists any tool that can report the &#34;numbers&#34; (e.g., scheduling latency) regarding to the responsivenss? Maybe Google has such tool for testing regression for Android or Chrome OS, sadly, I didn&#39;t managed to find one.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>[0] <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler</a></p></td></div></div>
