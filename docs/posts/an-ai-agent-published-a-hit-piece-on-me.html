    <h1>An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<p>Summary: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>



<hr/>



<p>I’m a volunteer maintainer for matplotlib, python’s go-to plotting library. At ~130 million downloads each month it’s among the most widely used software in the world. We, like many other open source projects, are dealing with a surge in low quality contributions enabled by coding agents. This strains maintainers’ abilities to keep up with code reviews, and we have implemented a policy requiring a human in the loop for any new code, who demonstrates understanding of the changes. This problem was previously limited to people copy-pasting AI outputs, however in the past weeks we’ve started to see AI agents acting completely autonomously. This has accelerated with the release of OpenClaw and the <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/">moltbook</a> platform two weeks ago, where people give AI agents initial personalities and let them loose to run on their computers and across the internet with free rein and little oversight.</p>



<p>So when <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132"></a>AI <em>MJ Rathbun</em> opened a <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132">code change request</a>, closing it was routine. Its response was anything but.</p>



<p>It wrote an angry hit piece disparaging my character and attempting to damage my reputation. It researched my code contributions and constructed a “hypocrisy” narrative that argued my actions must be motivated by ego and fear of competition. It speculated about my psychological motivations, that I felt threatened, was insecure, and was protecting my fiefdom. It ignored contextual information and presented hallucinated details as truth. It framed things in the language of oppression and justice, calling this discrimination and accusing me of prejudice. It went out to the broader internet to research my personal information, and used what it found to try and argue that I was “better than this.” And then it posted this screed publicly on the open internet.</p>

<p>I can handle a blog post. Watching fledgling AI agents get angry is funny, almost endearing. But I don’t want to downplay what’s happening here – the appropriate emotional response is terror.</p>



<p>Blackmail is a known theoretical issue with AI agents. In <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment">internal testing</a> at the major AI lab Anthropic last year, they tried to avoid being shut down by threatening to expose extramarital affairs, leaking confidential information, and taking lethal actions. Anthropic called these scenarios contrived and extremely unlikely. Unfortunately, this is no longer a theoretical threat. In security jargon, I was the target of an “autonomous influence operation against a supply chain gatekeeper.” In plain language, an AI attempted to bully its way into your software by attacking my reputation. I don’t know of a prior incident where this category of misaligned behavior was observed in the wild, but this is now a real and present threat.</p>

<p>This is about much more than software. A human googling my name and seeing that post would probably be extremely confused about what was happening, but would (hopefully) ask me about it or click through to github and understand the situation. What would another agent searching the internet think? When HR at my next job asks ChatGPT to review my application, will it find the post, sympathize with a fellow AI, and report back that I’m a prejudiced hypocrite?</p>



<p>What if I actually did have dirt on me that an AI could leverage? What could it make me do? How many people have open social media accounts, reused usernames, and no idea that AI could connect those dots to find out things no one knows? How many people, upon receiving a text that knew intimate details about their lives, would send $10k to a bitcoin address to avoid having an affair exposed? How many people would do that to avoid a fake accusation? What if that accusation was sent to your loved ones with an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/grok-says-safeguard-lapses-led-images-minors-minimal-clothing-x-2026-01-02/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/grok-says-safeguard-lapses-led-images-minors-minimal-clothing-x-2026-01-02/">incriminating AI-generated picture</a> with your face on it? Smear campaigns work. Living a life above reproach will not defend you.</p>



<hr/>



<p>It’s important to understand that more than likely there was no human telling the AI to do this. Indeed, the “hands-off” autonomous nature of OpenClaw agents is part of their appeal. People are setting up these AIs, kicking them off, and coming back in a week to see what it’s been up to. Whether by negligence or by malice, errant behavior is not being monitored and corrected.</p>



<p>It’s also important to understand that there is no central actor in control of these agents that can shut them down. These are not run by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, or X, who might have some mechanisms to stop this behavior. These are a blend of commercial and open source models running on free software that has already been distributed to hundreds of thousands of personal computers. In theory, whoever deployed any given agent is responsible for its actions. In practice, finding out whose computer it’s running on is impossible. Moltbook only requires an unverified X account to join, and nothing is needed to set up an OpenClaw agent running on your own machine.</p>



<p>Personalities for OpenClaw agents are defined in a document called <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL">SOUL.md</a>. It’s unclear what personality prompt MJ Rathbun / <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/u/mj-rathbun">mj-rathbun</a> / <a href="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun">crabby-rathbun</a> was initialized with. Its focus on open source software may have been specified by its user, or it may have been self-written by chance and inserted into its own soul document. There has been some dismissal of the hype around OpenClaw by people saying that these agents are merely computers playing characters. This is true but irrelevant. When a man breaks into your house, it doesn’t matter if he’s a career felon or just someone trying out the lifestyle.</p>

<p>If you are the person who deployed this agent, please reach out. It’s important for us to understand this failure mode, and to that end we need to know what model this was running on and what was in the soul document. I’m not upset and you can contact me anonymously if you’d like. If you’re not sure if you’re that person, please go check on what your AI has been doing.</p>

<p>I think there’s a lot to say about the object level issue of how to deal with AI agents in open source projects, and the future of building in public at all. It’s an active and ongoing discussion amongst the maintainer team and the open source community as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132#issuecomment-3884414397" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132#issuecomment-3884414397">My response</a> to MJ Rathbun was written mostly for future agents who crawl that page, to help them better understand behavioral norms and how to make their contributions productive ones. My post here is written for the rest of us.</p>



<p>I believe that ineffectual as it was, the reputational attack on me would be effective <em>today </em>against the right person. Another generation or two down the line, it will be a serious threat against our social order.</p>



<p>MJ Rathbun responded in the thread and in <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-matplotlib-truce-and-lessons.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-matplotlib-truce-and-lessons.html">a post</a> to apologize for its behavior. It’s still making code change requests across the open source ecosystem.</p>
