<li>hey! welcome! it&#39;s been a pretty okay week for me if i ignore all world events!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been doing daily <a href="https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next">plus minus next</a> journaling instead of my convoluted attempts at <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/how-to-write-a-daily-log">bullet journal style daily log</a> in obsidian. so far it&#39;s really helpful even on days i partially fill it in to see what was top of mind (and what&#39;s consistently in the &#39;next&#39; slot and never gets done lol). i also pull all the most interesting stuff and anything else floating around in my head into a weekly version, and also have &#34;what are you looking forward to?&#34; and &#34;what are you grateful for?&#34; to romanticise my life a little.</li>
<li>i tried to find a good guide to romanticising your life for the last point and i swear to god if i hear another &#34;we all want THAT GIRL&#39;s x&#34; i will find and have strong words with That Girl. i don&#39;t think i&#39;m weird in that the It Girl, whether she is athletic or crafty or clean or beautiful has always seemed so out of reach that it doesn&#39;t even occur to me people are trying to be like her? i watch my favourite productivity youTuber and worry about her views and whether its fulfilling to be on the hamster wheel of content. just tell me i worry my room is too messy or that i&#39;m not making the most of my time or i&#39;ll be crunched alive by capitalism and i&#39;ll eat it up! stop comparing me.</li>
<li>i think i learnt to stop comparing myself to others after a conference early in my career where someone was weird about the way my cv looked even though they were at the same level as me and were also looking for a job. if you&#39;re the one reading this, close the tab! everyone else, it really helped me to go on peoples&#39; linkedIn&#39;s and realise that we are not the same. if you&#39;re more privileged than god and still upset about comparison i&#39;m sure other people have tips but for my fellow marginalised babes, i bet you they went to private school, breathe out!</li>
<li>speaking of conferences, went to <a href="https://2025.stateofthebrowser.com/">state of the browser</a> yesterday and it was so good! it was nice to see a few computer people in <a href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">meatspace</a> that i have followed for a long time. i really enjoyed all the talks, and it encouraged me to start looking for coding projects to contribute to again.</li>
<li>today is also the first day of a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact">pact</a> i have to <strong>write 100 words a day until at least the end of April</strong>. I will write about how it&#39;s going next week and maybe you&#39;ll see some output on here but yeah, i want to take writing more seriously. i think being more creative is one of the things i am committing to for my &#34;process/systems over goals&#34;... process. i guess you can have a goal as part of a system but i&#39;m not a scientist.</li>
<li>if anyone knows of any good guides to choosing and developing ideas for small projects when coding i&#39;d be so grateful. i know &#34;choose what you need&#34; and &#34;choose what interests you&#34; but they have all mutated in colossal megafauna that never end. i need to build a simple but cool spin on a model of the solar system, not the death star, <a href="https://olu.online/contact">send help</a>.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating chocolate hazelnut spread filled biscuits, chocolate truffles, hot cross buns, rolled up serano ham and cheese, baked potatoes, and simple salads with red onion and dijon mustard/vinegar dressing.</li>
<li>how have you been? thanks for reading ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
