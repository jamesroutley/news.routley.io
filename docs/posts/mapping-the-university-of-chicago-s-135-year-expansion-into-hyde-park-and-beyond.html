                            Mapping the University of Chicago’s 135-Year
                            Expansion into Hyde Park and Beyond

                        Drawing from University archives, campus maps, academic
                        literature, and news clippings, the
                        <i>Maroon</i> charted the University’s contentious
                        property acquisitions from its charter in 1890 to the
                        present.

                        As the University of Chicago has expanded its property
                        footprint on the South Side, conflicting priorities,
                        land use disputes, and racial tension have characterized
                        a historically fraught “town and gown” relationship with
                        the surrounding neighborhoods. Setting the stage for
                        others to follow, the University was the first higher
                        education institution to embark on an urban renewal
                        campaign of its kind, a topic University scholars and
                        students have written on extensively.

                        The following narration is not an exhaustive history;
                        rather, it traces the contours of shifting values and
                        priorities that have contributed to the University’s
                        current institutional identity.
