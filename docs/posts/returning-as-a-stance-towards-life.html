    <h1>Returning as a stance towards life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There&#39;s an idea that success requires constant effort applied over decades. In some areas, that&#39;s probably true. There&#39;s a saying that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/07/the-cheating-problem-in-professional-bridge#:~:text=Successful%20young%20players%20stand%20out%20for%20another%20reason%2C%20too%3A%20bridge%2C%20unlike%20chess%2C%20has%20never%20been%20dominated%20by%20prodigies%2E">there are no prodigies in bridge</a>: players have to plays thousands of hands to learn what works. Almost every soloist for a major orchestra has dedicated their life to the instrument. More mundanely, there are plenty of jobs which reward constant effort: few major CEOs work thirty hours a week.</p>
<p>But not every success demands dedication. I want to write music I am proud of, but do not want music to be my main project in life. There are plenty of friendships I have where I&#39;d rather talk every three months than every day.</p>
<p>For such things, I don&#39;t think constant dedication is the right mindset. Of course, it would be nice to write music every day, but sometimes it will have to slip through the cracks. This week, I&#39;ve been doing contract work on top of my daily job as a journalist; I don&#39;t have the energy to also be writing music. Other times, I&#39;ve gone months without composing. If I hold myself to a standard of constant dedication, it become more difficult to bounce back from breaks. Then, I must both overcome my disappointment that I did not continue — and my anxiety that it&#39;s too late to succeed.</p>
<p>A better inclination, I think, is to focus on returning. If I don&#39;t compose for a day, or six months, can I return to the craft without shame? If I haven&#39;t talked to a friend in a year, can I remember to reach out? If I&#39;ve spent the past hour scrolling the internet, can I go back to the project I was working on before that? Can I return to the people and the things that I love, over and over, even if I stumble along the way?</p>
<p>How to gracefully resume has a been a persistent theme of on this blog. Early on, I <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/blog/journaling-hiatus-self-prompting/">proposed</a> a way to return from a journaling absence. The piece I&#39;m proudest of — <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/blog/correspondence-texting/">Correspondence texting </a> — is all about how to gracefully add space into my texting conversations. Even the <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/blog/the-noticing-game/">Noticing Game</a> is about returning to the world around me after I&#39;ve been caught up in my own head.</p>
<p>This idea feels a lot like basic mediation. Notice I have fallen off from something and come back to it. Notice I have a thought and let go of it.</p>
<p>Or it&#39;s like the aphorism that &#34;the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago; the second best time is today.&#34; I do believe it&#39;s important for me to write music consistently for me to become as good a composer I want to be. Ditto for friendships. For this blog. For exercise. For being moral. Yet I can&#39;t be perfect. For each of these, I would have loved to do it yesterday, but the best I can do is to do it today.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So I will try, I hope, to stick to this philosophy: return to the things I care about in life, over and over. To be kind to myself when I err. And to live the words of a poem I heard in a workshop in high school: &#34;we are always going home.&#34;</p>
