	To all C64 fans and most especially to the people who had gotten used to reading my blog 
	posts and getting news and updates on my progress, it is an exciting time.
</p>
<p>
	C64 OS version 1.0 has been released and is <a href="https://www.c64os.com/c64os/#order">available for order</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Although it seemed quiet, on the blog, here at C64os.com for &#39;lo these many months with only a 
	brief update back in May on what&#39;s going on, I&#39;ve had the petal to the metal. For those who 
	follow me on Twitter I was still giving updates there about things that were brewing. And then in
	June, exactly one year after the June 2021 presentation that I gave for Commodore Users Europe,
	I had the privilege of giving another demo.
</p>
<p>
	The 2021 demo video has, as of this writing, had 32,000 views and the more recent 2022 demo
	video has had 6,700 views. By some margin, the C64 OS demos have been the most popular videos
	on the Commodore User&#39;s Europe channel so far. Some of those views were helped by C64 OS getting 
	featured on Hacker News and Hackaday. It is super exciting when this happens because I get to 
	see neat little blips like this in my analytics.
