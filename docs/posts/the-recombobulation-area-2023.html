    <h1>The Recombobulation Area (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>This article originally ran in 2023.</em>

</p><p>Traveling, especially during the holidays, can be stressful. In particular: security checkpoints. Although absolutely necessary, they take time and patience – neither of which are abundant when you have four minutes to make it to the gate and you stupidly wore shoes with laces. 

</p><p>But Barry Bateman, the former Mitchell Airport director, understood this. So much so, that 15 years ago he invented a word for exactly what needs to happen after you&#39;ve removed everything from your pockets, put your laptop in a separate bin (why?), stepped into a straight-outta-sci-fi scanner, raised your hands above your head and nervously waited for your belongings to roll through the X-Ray machine even though you packed nothing to be nervous about. (Then again, there is that bottle of saline solution that may or may not exceed 3.4 ounces... Crap.)

</p><p>After all that, Bateman knew travelers needed to recombobulate. And needed a designated area to do it.

</p><p>So in 2008, the wise and good-humored manager (who retired in 2014), did what no other airport manager in the world thought to do: he invented a word and a concept, &#34;recombobulation.&#34; Then he somehow got the TSA to approve the creation of &#34;Recombobulation Area&#34; signs and get them installed just past the two security checkpoints in designated spaces with benches and chairs.

</p><p>&#34;He understood that traveling can be stressful and the signs are intended to put a smile on people’s faces,&#34; says Harold Mester, the airport’s public relations manager.

</p><p>In 2009, the American Dialect Society named &#34;recombobulation&#34; the most creative word of the year. Eventually, the word made it into dictionaries meaning the opposite of discombobulating or &#34;putting back in order.&#34;

</p><p>And surprisingly, prior to its inclusion in dictionaries, not a single grammarian complained about the signs.
</p>
      

<p>&#34;Whether it’s a word or not, I think we can all agree we all feel discombobulated after going through a security checkpoint and need a minute to recombobulate,&#34; says Mester. &#34;People find the word creative, but also understand why it makes sense to have it in an airport.&#34;

</p><p>Batemen&#39;s creation did more than bring a little lightness to a serious place. The signs have become a part of our city&#39;s culture, bolster our already-affable personality and make the short-list of uniquely Milwaukee endearments like Bloody Mary chasers and the Milverine.

</p><p>Plus, thousands of people have posted selfies in front of the recombobulation signs on social media, elevating them to a traveler&#39;s quirky rite-of-passage like grabbing a &#34;Wall Drug&#34; bumpersticker when passing through South Dakota.

</p><p>&#34;Recombobulation Area&#34; is not just for airports anymore, either. It&#39;s also the name of a popular <a href="https://www.therecombobulationarea.news/" target="_blank">online opinion column</a> by Milwaukee journalist Dan Shafer; a best-selling T-shirt for legendary apparel company &#34;Too Much Metal&#34;; the name of <a href="https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/recombobulation-beer">a local beer</a>; a <a href="https://cbs58.com/news/mitchell-international-airports-recombobulation-area-featured-in-jeopardy-question" target="_blank">question on &#34;Jeopardy&#34;</a>and even <a href="https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/recombobulation-area-skyglider">popped up at Summerfest</a>. 

</p><p>The most interesting aspect of these signs is that they are so effective in their absurdity. Humor isn&#39;t always popular in airports. They are sometimes solemn and emotional places. But the Milwaukee Mitchell Airport&#39;s &#34;Recombobulation Area&#34; signs offer the perfect amount of levity.

</p><p>&#34;We have a number of amenities here to help take the stress out of traveling,&#34; says Mester. &#34;We want people to feel comfortable – even have fun here.&#34;
