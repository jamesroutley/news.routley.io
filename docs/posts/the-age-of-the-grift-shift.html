    <h1>The age of the grift shift</h1>

			<p>For a book proposal I am currently working on (German, no proposal isn’t done yet because I keep reworking stuff, my agent hates me) I am thinking a lot about late stage capitalism and technologies, about how the kinda terminal economic system shapes the technologies it brings forward etc. And there are of course a lot of ways one can tackle that topic: You can do very abstract theoretical approaches or rather argue from examples or mix and match etc.</p>



<p>So a few weeks ago while going through my “to read pile” I stumbled on <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2c4fad0w6irk838pca3gg/portfolio/money-is-pouring-into-ai-skeptics-say-its-a-grift-shift">an article</a> that itself isn’t super relevant or special but it gave me a very useful phrase to chew on for the last weeks: The “grift shift”. In that article the term is used in reference to a whole bunch of VC firms who – after crypto/web3 had imploded – seamlessly rebranded themselves as “AI” firms. And if you’ve heard me speak in the last few months you know me often opening with jokingly referencing the same dynamic on Linkedin where the crypto influencers turned into Metaverse influencers and now have turned into “AI” influencers.</p>



<p>Very obviously I agree with the analysis: There is a massive amount of people and institutions jumping from one grift to the next to the next. But that’s not necessarily new: Especially when it comes to investments it’s just natural to follow the hype, to try to ride the wave wherever it leads you to get the next payday. </p>



<p>But I think there’s more going on here. Because it’s not just investors or their little helpers from the consulting firms: The whole tech discourse has shifted a bit in my subjective observation. So let’s try to define the “Grift Shift” in a more structural way. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Grift Shift is a new paradigm of debating technologies within a society that is based a lot less on the actual realistic use cases or properties of a certain technology but a surface level fascination with technologies but even more their narratives of future deliverance. Within the Grift Shift paradigm the topics and technologies addressed are mere material for public personalities to continuously claim expertise and “thought leadership” in every cycle of the shift regardless of what specific technologies are being talked about.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everybody can probably name a few people who have embraced that paradigm fully. People who effortlessly shift from “web3 is the future” to “I will explain to you why ‘AI’ will replace you”, people who get fame by talking about self driving cars and jump to superconductors the next week depending on whatever is sticky in the news. Again, it’s not like we never had these people but their relevance, their position of power, their influence has changed.</p>



<p>So I kept thinking about why that is. Like: Are these people just willing or clueless PR people for whatever capital wants to push on people (usually through their employers or sometimes even governments)? But while that is a function they have, I think that’s not the “why”. And I think the “why” is to a certain degree YouTube’s fault.</p>



<h3>Content</h3>



<p>A few years ago YouTube (of course others joined in and followed but I think YouTube was a leading force here) established the term “content”. It was no longer about the actual qualities of the medium, not about videos or music or stories or essays etc. Everything one made was just <em>content</em>.</p>



<p>This was an interesting development that underlined how strong our culture is already shaped by technological terminology: “Content” is an absolute abstraction, shedding everything specific about the objects it references. All meaning (and everything that goes beyond the most literal output, the most simplistic view on a created artifact) is stripped. No longer are people writers or filmmakers or musicians or whatever: They are “content creators”. Lumped together in spite of having radically different processes, subcultures, communities, values, traditions, etc. </p>



<p>“Content” is how programmers think about media when designing software systems to manage it. WordPress, the system I use to write and publish this website, is a so-called “content management system”. Which is technically correct but strips all the process of writing, editing, formatting from the narrative. But that is how you build a system to manage “articles”. You don’t care too much about how articles emerge from experience, thinking and sometimes pure accident. You care about the words and paragraphs. The long string of characters you need to store in a database. And that string could also be the binary representation of an image or a movie or whatnot. Who gives a shit?</p>



<p>“Content” is less about the creation. It’s about delivery and managing audience attention. YouTube’s algorithms reward certain behaviors (and when we look at how YouTube works, that seems to be mostly “be a right wing shithead yelling in the microphone about trans people”) and certain formal structures (as in length, structure of the preview image, title) but they don’t really care about anything. Just that whenever a person is on the site they get something to look at. And something else afterwards. And something else afterwards. It doesn’t matter. Just don’t leave or at least let the tab open so whe can autoplay some more ads.</p>



<p>There was a somewhat big scandal recently about a popular YouTube tech show doing shoddy work, abusing their workers and after trying to ignore it one excuse was the murderous schedule: “We can’t do good work because we need to put out a video every day.” Whether that explanation holds any water (in my experience people who abuse their workers and coworkers do that regardless of the stress) it’s telling how putting anything out every day has priority over what it is or means. “I need to say something every day, but I don’t have something to say every day” is a shitty position that pretty mush crushes a human soul after a while but the millions that channel made probably help to dry some tears. </p>



<p>Why am I talking about YouTube when we were talking about the grift shift? It’s not because everyone on YouTube is a grifter or that it is worse than many other platforms (TBH I feel like Linkedin is a bit worse and let’s not even talk about Twitter), it is because YouTube’s way of thinking about “content” has reshaped our tech discourse structurally. Which is a bit of the problem given how especially in western countries we basically outsourced “Future” to tech instead of also thinking about maybe for example political visions.</p>



<p>I think the Grift Shift is a symptom of the shift from actual media to content.</p>



<h3>Why so unserious?</h3>



<p>Our lives, our economies everything is increasingly shaped by digital technologies. Even activities within the physical realm require digital tools to participate. So talking about technology, explaining new technologies to the public who needs to form an opinion on them is gravely important. </p>



<p>But we’ve seemingly lost a bit of our ability to be  serious. Now I don’t mean that talking about technology (or politics or social issues for that matter) cannot be entertaining or have entertaining aspects to it. But we are not taking the subject matter at hand serious. </p>



<p>Technological development, potential innovations are published through advertising / PR into the world and as soon as a bit of momentum forms they get reduced to materials to generate content. Because there needs to be a video every day. And everyone else says that <s>crypto</s> <s>metaverse</s> AI is the future and you need to ride that wave. Click subscribe please.</p>



<p>The Grift Shift keeps going because we are not taking technological developments seriously as political forces. Which they are or are at least very aligned with. You can’t talk about “AI” and the wonders of whatever the newest paper or startup promises without looking at environmental impacts, about deskilling, about how these tools affect the real economy that we’re relying on to get people the money to pay for food and housing (granted: I don’t think that that basic idea is kinda dumb because every human being has a right to food, shelter, healthcare, community and participation, has a right to have their needs met in order for them to thrive but that is a whole different article I guess).</p>



<p>And that is what is so sad about it. The grift shift and all the people and organizations who embody it are just a sign that we’ve all developed “morbus contentcreatoris” or “content creator brain”. And that is very depressing.</p>



<p>Because basically nobody doing anything interesting is “creating content”. The things we write, the paintings we draw, the music we play isn’t just about what the <em>output </em>is. Every creative activity is in itself a value, with the output sometimes being almost secondary. This article isn’t about the words I typed or even the process of typing them. It’s about me thinking through things I see in the world through the lense of my understanding of it, my values, my feelings and wishes. This isn’t content.</p>



<p>I keep thinking about the grift shifters. But maybe I shouldn’t. Maybe even that is taking them to seriously. And why should I? Because they surely don’t seem to be very serious about anything. </p>
