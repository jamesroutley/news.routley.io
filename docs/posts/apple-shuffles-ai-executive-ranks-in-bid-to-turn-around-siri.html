In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven’t been announced.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea’s command. Apple announced the changes to employees on Thursday following Bloomberg News’ initial report.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The iPhone maker’s senior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a secretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the company. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit, Bloomberg has reported.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The moves underscore the plight facing Apple: Its AI technology is severely lagging industry rivals, and the company has shown little sign of catching up. The Apple Intelligence platform was late to arrive and largely a flop, despite being the main selling point for the iPhone 16.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>    <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple’s headset. As part of the changes, he’ll be leaving that team, though the Vision Pro software groups will follow him to Federighi’s software engineering group. The hardware team will remain under John Ternus and report to Paul Meade, a hardware engineering executive who worked on the Vision Pro.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The need to rescue Siri is especially urgent. The company has struggled to release new features that were announced last June, including the ability to tap into a user’s data to fulfill queries. Despite the technology not being ready, Apple advertised the enhancements for months on TV in order to sell the iPhone 16. Following development snags, the company further delayed the features earlier this month.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div>       </div></div> </div>     <section><header> </header>   </section></div></article> </section></section></section>    </div></div>
