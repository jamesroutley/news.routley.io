    </p><div><p>Printer manufacturer Dymo is facing backlash after it debuted new label printers that feature digital rights management embedded in their paper.
</p><p>The latest Dymo label printers sport RFID readers that can authenticate the labels that customers place within the printers. According to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, this allows Dymo to distinguish between first-party labels and cheaper alternatives.
</p><p>Dymo touts the benefits of the chipped label paper in <a href="https://www.dymo.com/label-makers-printers/labelwriter-label-printers/dymo-labelwriter-550-label-printer/SAP_2112552.html">its sales literature</a>, including auto-detection and remaining label counts. However, the chipping also forces Dymo customers to purchase first-party labels that are more expensive than many of their competitors.
</p><p>Some label makers are already <a href="https://www.ilabmalta.com/dymo-labelwriter-550-2112552-2112722">adding warnings</a> about the lock-in, advising users that the new label printers won&#39;t work if they don&#39;t detect the chipped paper.
</p><p>The move has courted controversy, and many users are already coming up with ways to bypass the paper-baseD DRM. However, third-party labels manufacturers and others may have solid legal reasons to not offer a workaround.
</p><p>According to the EFF, under U.S. copyright law, rivals that distribute tools for bypassing an &#34;access control&#34; for a copyrighted work can be subject to up to $500,000 in fines and five years in prison. The firmware on a Dymo printer can fall under copyrighted work.
</p><p>&#34;Dymo is trying something unprecedented here,&#34; the EFF wrote. &#34;DRM in paper is such an abysmal, abusive idea that we should all recoil from it.&#34;</p></div></div>
