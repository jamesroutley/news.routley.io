<p>Acerbis is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a unique achievement. The manufacturer has snatched its first Guinness World Record Record for the greatest distance ridden on a single tank of fuel by a gas-powered motorcycle. The total distance covered? An impressive 4,183.8 kilometers (2,599.7 miles) without refueling.</p>







<p>To achieve this feat, the technical team at Acerbis engineered the largest motorcycle tank ever used, designed and built in-house with a whopping capacity of 108 liters (28.5 gallons). The record-breaking journey started in Albino, the home of Acerbis, and then headed through the Brenner Pass, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway to finally reach the North Cape.</p>



<hr/>
		
		<hr/><p>The Acerbis team chose the 125cc Honda Monkey for the challenge due to its simple design and claimed fuel economy of 169 mpg. Equipped with a 1.5 gallon in stock form, engineers at Acerbis knew they had to think ‘outside the box’ to turn the mini moto into a record-breaking machine. </p>

<p>The AC50 project, which has been in the works for two years, started with meticulous 3D scans of the stock Monkey bike. After endless hours of work, modeling tests and many calculations of tank volumes needed to achieve the world record, the team came up with their first prototype design — a 114-liter (30 gallons) tank. </p>



<p>To test the bike’s dynamics with different amounts of fuel in the large tank, the team put the modified Monkey bike through a 1.9 km circuit. After a grueling 304-lap test, Acerbis found they needed to use sponges to combat the sloshing inside the tank at the expense of losing some volume. The final tank weighed 15.2 kg (33.5 lbs) and could hold 108 liters.</p>

<p>For the record-breaking journey, three riders took turns at the helm of the bike: Alicia Sornosa, Andrea Rastrelli and Maurizio Vettor — all riding at an average speed of around 70 kph (43 mph). To maximize the amount of miles covered, the Monkey bike was ridden through a specific route which enhanced fuel saving. </p>

<p>Guido Acerbis, CEO of Acerbis, said of the challenge: “As a child, I admired the Guinness World Records book that my grandparents had given me and dreamed of entering it. Today, thanks to a determined and motivated team, the dream has become reality. Thanks to all of you who made it possible, and there are many of you”.</p>

<p>After arriving at their final destination of North Cape, Norway and breaking the record, the Acerbis team reported there was still a bit of fuel left in the tank. The final mileage will be tallied up and the record will be updated after every drop of fuel is used up.</p>
