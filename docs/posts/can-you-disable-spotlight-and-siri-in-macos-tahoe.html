		<p>For some, Spotlight and even Siri are indispensable, for others they’re just a waste of CPU and storage space. If you want to disable them, how is that best achieved?</p>
<h4>Siri</h4>
<p>The only documented way to turn Siri off is in its section in System Settings, where you should disable <strong>Siri Requests</strong>.</p>
<p>Although Siri will then be essentially inactive, it still doesn’t disappear. During startup, <code>siriactionsd</code> runs, and <code>siriknowledged</code> and some other of its services remain listed in Activity Monitor.</p>
<h4>Spotlight</h4>
<p>If you disable every item in Spotlight’s section in System Settings, that doesn’t disable Spotlight, nor stop it from indexing mounted volumes. Indeed, you may find it slows some Finder operations. Traditionally there have been two commands used in Terminal to try to disable Spotlight, depending on which of its features you want to stop.</p>
<p>The most common recommendation is to use</p>
<p>This might be related to previously reported problems disabling just the Data volume, which could require use of the explicit path /System/Volumes/Data.</p>

<p>The alternative is to use</p>
<p>Look carefully, though, and Spotlight hasn’t gone anywhere, and is still present in Activity Monitor’s list of processes. During startup you’ll still see its related daemons <code>mediaanalysisd</code> and <code>photoanalysisd</code> run briefly, and <code>mds</code>, Spotlight and <code>spotlightknowledged</code> are still present in the list of processes. Volumes will also have their hidden .Spotlight-V100 folder, although after <code>mdutil -a -d</code> its Store-V2 folder should remain completely empty.</p>
<p>Should you wish to enable Spotlighting indexing again, regardless of which command was used to disable it, use</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>It’s not possible in macOS Tahoe to completely disable either Siri or Spotlight, not without resorting to system surgery and running with SIP disabled. However, you can reduce them to an absolute minimum by:</p>
<ul>
<li>turning <strong>Siri Requests</strong> off in Siri settings;</li>
<li>running the command <code>sudo mdutil -a -d</code> in Terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>But using <code>sudo mdutil -a -i off</code> isn’t as thorough or reliable.</p>
