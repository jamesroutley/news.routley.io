    HP-42S Scientific Programmable Calculator and HP-82240 Printer.

You must select "iPhone Only" in the selector in the top left corner.
<p>
Yes, this is highly misleading, because Free42 is not "iPhone only," at least
not in the sense that it only runs on iPhones. What Apple means by "iPhone only"
are apps that are not designed to take advantage of the iPad's larger screen.
Free42 is "iPhone only" in that sense: it runs on iPads, but it acts just like
it does on iPhones.
