Amazon is introducing </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlefamily"><span>an entirely new lineup of Kindle devices</span></a><span>, including the first-ever color Kindle, a reimagined Kindle Scribe, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever, and a new entry Kindle in a fun, new Matcha color.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Let’s get to know the newest Kindle devices.</span><br/></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Introducing Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</h2></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft displaying book cover and highlighted text" height="431" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/f002870/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/767x431!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fcb%2F768e417f48e3975ce7f13a6dfe2a%2Faa-oct24-kindlecolorsoft-standard-inline-v1-400kb-1600x900.jpg" width="767"/><span></span></p></div></div><div><p><span><p><span>The all-new </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlecolorsoft"><span>Kindle Colorsoft</span></a><span> brings color to Kindle without compromise. It has everything customers love about Kindle today—high contrast, fast page turns, an auto-adjusting front light, and weeks of battery life. It adds color that is vibrant yet easy on the eyes. Now, you can browse covers in color in your Kindle Library or Store; see book photos and images in color; or add color highlights that you can easily search later.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Everything about Kindle Colorsoft was meticulously designed to deliver rich, paper-like color. It uses an oxide backplane with custom waveforms for fast performance and a higher contrast on both color and black-and-white content. Its custom Colorsoft display includes a new light-guide with nitride LEDs that, when combined with our custom algorithms, enhances color and increases brightness, all without washing out details. You can zoom in on images without worrying about pixelation, and you can choose between standard or vibrant color styles. Kindle Colorsoft comes with wireless charging, up to eight weeks of battery life, and is waterproof so you can bring it with you in the bath or take it to the beach without having to worry.</span><br/></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>The new Kindle Scribe, with in-book writing and an AI-powered notebook</h2></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="Notes written on Kindle Scribe" height="431" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/8802301/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/767x431!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2F3f%2F05ac92204002b0f11c46f8e5c183%2Faa-oct24-kindlescribe-standard-inline-v2-400kb-1600x900.jpg" width="767"/><span></span></p></div></div><div><p><span><p><span>The all-new </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?th=1"><span>Kindle Scribe</span></a><span> combines all the benefits of Kindle with a powerful notetaking device. The display has new white borders, and the screen has a smooth, paper-like texture that makes it look and feel like you’re writing on a sheet of paper. Plus, at 300 ppi, text looks crisp and clear when you’re writing or reading. The Premium Pen is finely crafted to deliver just the right heft and balance, so it feels like holding an actual pen, and the new soft-tipped eraser feels like a pencil—you’ll think you have to brush the screen clean after erasing.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Kindle Scribe offers a first-of-its-kind in-book writing experience and a more powerful notetaking experience. With Active Canvas, you can write your thoughts directly in the book when inspiration strikes. Your note becomes part of the page, and the book text dynamically flows around it—if you increase the font size, change the font style, or the book layout changes, the note remains visible exactly where you want it so you never lose any meaning or context. Coming soon, you’ll also be able to write your notes in the side panel and easily hide them when you are done. The all-new, built-in AI-powered notebook enables you to quickly summarize pages and pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can be easily shared directly from the notebook tab. You can also refine your notes into a script font, so it becomes legible while maintaining the look and feel of handwriting.</span><br/></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>The fastest Kindle ever: The all-new Kindle Paperwhite</h2></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="Woman relaxing with Kindle and coffee, Kindle e-reader, colorful Kindle cases" height="431" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/1e32613/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/767x431!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2Fee%2Fe9a43a714bd3a7d572f2883eabca%2Faa-oct24-kindlepaperwhite-standard-inline-v2-400kb-1600x900.jpg" width="767"/><span></span></p></div></div><div><p><span><p><span>Since its debut in 2012, customers have made Kindle Paperwhite our best-selling Kindle—and the all-new </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlepaperwhite "><span>Kindle Paperwhite</span></a><span> is our fastest yet. Scrolling through your Kindle Library or Store is snappy and responsive with 25% faster page turns. The display uses an oxide thin-film transistor, which gives it the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle, so text and images pop off the screen. A larger, 7-inch display is a first for Kindle Paperwhite—and yet, it is also the thinnest Kindle Paperwhite ever with up to three months of battery life.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Kindle Paperwhite is waterproof with 16 GB of storage for thousands of books, and comes in Raspberry, Jade, and Black. </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlepaperwhitesignature"><span>Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</span></a><span>, which comes with 32 GB of storage, optional wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light, comes in Metallic Raspberry, Metallic Jade, and Metallic Black.</span><br/></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>The new Kindle—our most compact Kindle, now in Matcha</h2></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="Amazon Kindle e-reader device in matcha color" height="431" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/7ccf710/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/767x431!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbd%2Fa9%2Fd591291f4fe5bb449cba44c356f6%2Faa-oct24-kindlematcha-standard-inline-v1-1600x900.jpg" width="767"/><span></span></p></div></div><div><p><span><p><span>Weighing in at just 158g, the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle"><span>new entry-level Kindle</span></a><span> is small enough to fit in your hand or carry in your back pocket—and it’s packed with premium Kindle features.
