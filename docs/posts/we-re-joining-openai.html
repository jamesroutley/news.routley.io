<p>I&#39;m excited to announce that we&#39;re joining OpenAI’s Codex team!</p>
<p>When we started out, Xcode had no AI. Building a &#34;Cursor for Xcode&#34; sounded crazy, but we managed to do it anyway. And, over time, we built the best coding agent for iOS &amp; MacOS apps.</p>
<p>I&#39;m extremely proud of what we accomplished with Alex. Seeing people build software with our work was surreal. It is an honor to continue that work at a much bigger scale at OpenAI, along with the incredibly talented Codex team. Our mission is to help people create, and today that is more possible than ever.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to Alex:</strong></p>
<p>We plan to continue service for existing users, but will stop new downloads of the app on October 1st. As long as you have the app installed, our plan is to continue serving you. But there won’t be any new features released.</p>
<p>Thank you all -- our day 1 beta users, our customers, our amazing investors, and the entire Apple Dev community for helping us Make Something Wonderful ❤️</p>
