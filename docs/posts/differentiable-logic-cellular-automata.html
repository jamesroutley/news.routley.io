This challenge has inspired researchers and enthusiasts that work with cellular automata for decades.  In cellular automata, we generally approach things from the bottom-up. We choose local rules, then investigate the resulting emergent patterns. What if we could create systems that, given some complex desired pattern, can, in a fully differentiable fashion, learn the local rules that generate it, while preserving the inherent discrete nature of cellular automata? This is what we&#39;ll  explore with you today.</p><div id="17c0a320-00ae-8050-84d9-eed83c749260"><div id="9f03a6f1-88e6-40f7-addb-635001c9dac0"><figure id="17c0a320-00ae-8051-b45b-f1e017e41857"><figcaption>Zoomed view of learned circuit</figcaption></figure></div><div id="078f6020-e34b-49ff-ac61-550d1722c0df"><figure id="17c0a320-00ae-80cd-a191-f479ea5492f4"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/google_logo.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/google_logo.gif"/></a><figcaption>&#34;G&#34; being generated by learned circuit</figcaption></figure></div></div><p id="1910a320-00ae-80c4-a7d4-ee00e98e6b47">Prior work has explored learning transition rules using non-differentiable techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of evolving local rules for specific computation<d-cite key="Mitchell1994-mi"></d-cite>. Likewise prior exploration of making one-dimensional cellular automata differentiable exist<d-cite key="Martin2017-dx"></d-cite>. We propose a novel, fully end-to-end differentiable approach, combining two interesting concepts from the world of artificial intelligence: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) <d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite> and Differentiable Logic Gates Networks <d-cite key="Petersen2022-ai"></d-cite><d-cite key="Petersen2024-rr"></d-cite>. NCA exhibit the ability to learn arbitrary patterns and behaviors, however, they do not inherently operate within a discrete state space. This makes interpretability more challenging, and leaves them stuck in a regime where current hardware must perform costly matrix multiplications to gradually update their continuous internal states. Differentiable Logic Gates Networks, meanwhile, have been used to discover combinatorial logic circuits, blending discrete states with differentiable training signals. But they haven&#39;t yet been shown to work  in recurrent settings. NCA, as it were, are recurrent in both space, and time.  Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80b3-8af8-f8d7b98ddb34">Zooming out, we believe the integration of differentiable logic gates and neural cellular automata is a potential step towards programmable matter - <em>Computronium</em>  <d-cite key="Amato1991-ck"></d-cite> - a theoretical physical substance capable of performing arbitrary computation. Toffoli and Margolus pioneered this direction with  CAM-8, a cellular automata based computing architecture <d-cite key="Margolus1995-hg"></d-cite><d-cite key="Toffoli1991-do"></d-cite>, in theory capable of immense, horizontally scalable computation. However, they faced a fundamental challenge: actually crafting the local rules needed to achieve a desired macroscopic computation, with Amato et al. noting that “other researchers [...] still worry about the difficulty of finding local rules that correspond to real natural systems” <d-cite key="Amato1991-ck"></d-cite>.  What if we could directly learn these local rules, and create models that combine binary logic, the flexibility of neural networks, and the local processing of cellular automata?  We believe our prototypes  offer a glimpse into the future of computing: learnable, local, and discrete.</p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-8046-8ed4-e7cb4deb6da4">This article will walk you through implementing cellular automata using differentiable logic gates, and demonstrate some key results along the way.</p><p id="1820a320-00ae-8036-b527-f6da83547f0a">We&#39;re faced with two fundamental questions.<em>                                      </em> </p><figure id="1820a320-00ae-800f-a24a-ec0ee8f611ec"><p><span>❓</span></p><p id="1820a320-00ae-80b1-9312-cf2feaaf9f38"><em>Can a Differentiable Logic CA learn at all?   </em></p></figure><p id="1820a320-00ae-804b-bef7-d0f44f912fad">To answer this, we&#39;ll start by attacking Conway&#39;s Game of Life - perhaps the most iconic cellular automata,  having captivated researchers for decades. While this first experiment might seem overly simplistic (functionally equivalent to learning a truth table), it will prove the basic learning capability of our setup.

This powerful paradigm, pioneered by Mordvintsev et al. <d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite>, represents a fundamental shift in how we think about computational systems that can grow, adapt, and self-organize.</p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-8058-837d-d64466738811">Traditional cellular automata have long captivated researchers with their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules. Neural Cellular Automata take this concept further by making these rules learnable through gradient descent. Instead of hand-designing update rules, the system discovers them automatically, opening up entirely new possibilities for self-organizing computational systems.</p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80ce-a251-c52dd6986d31">What makes this approach particularly elegant is how it preserves the core principles of cellular automata - locality, parallelism, and state-based computation - while introducing the adaptability of neural networks. </p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-802b-b083-ddbd44add2b7">In the following sections, we will summarize the main concepts from the “<strong>Growing Neural Cellular Automata”</strong> work <d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite>, which presents a Neural Cellular Automata developed for morphogenesis. If you are already familiar with it, feel free to skip it.</p><h3 id="17b0a320-00ae-8015-91a4-e90b65fe9a6c">The Structure: A 2D Grid of Intelligent Cells</h3><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80ef-923a-d9cc324efe92">At the heart of the system is a 2D grid, much like classic cellular automata. Each cell contains an <strong>n-dimensional vector</strong> of information which is called the cell&#39;s <strong>state (or channels)</strong> and for the specific case of Growing-NCA it is composed by these elements:</p><ul id="17b0a320-00ae-8070-92fb-c1b3f696df56"><li><strong>RGB Colors</strong> (3 channels): These represent the visible properties of the cell, essentially its color.</li></ul><ul id="17b0a320-00ae-80ab-bdc9-f15b1fe22d1d"><li><strong>Alpha (α) Channel</strong> (1 channel): This indicates cell vitality. If the alpha value is greater than 0.1, the cell is considered “alive.”</li></ul><ul id="17b0a320-00ae-8001-88e8-eb07b7d7db40"><li><strong>Hidden Channels</strong> (n minus 4 channels): These allow cells to communicate more complex information about their environment, making interactions richer and more dynamic.</li></ul><p id="17b0a320-00ae-8053-886b-ddf0aadc026e">But the magic doesn’t stop here. What really sets this system apart is how the cells interact and evolve through a two-stage process.</p><h3 id="17b0a320-00ae-80cb-9108-d89841539c77">The Two-Stage Update Mechanism: Perception and Update</h3><ol type="1" id="17b0a320-00ae-804c-a4a8-d1b14e54e541" start="1"><li><strong>The Perception Stage</strong><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80db-bdc0-f7258a4a6278">In the first stage, each cell perceives its environment. Think of it as a cell sensing the world around it. To do this, it uses <strong>Sobel filters</strong>, mathematical tools designed to numerically approximate spatial gradients - &#34;changes across its surroundings&#34;. The filters are applied channel-wise, and the result is termed the <strong>perception vector</strong>, which combines the cell’s current state with the information it gathers about its environment. A bit like how biological cells use chemical gradients to sense and react to their surroundings.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="17b0a320-00ae-8088-acd2-c653be5101a3" start="2"><li><strong>The Update Stage</strong><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80de-9206-f48a8894d617">Next, the neural network steps in. Each cell uses its perception vector as input to a neural network, which performs identical operations on every cell in the grid. Using around ~<strong>8,000 parameters</strong>, the neural network determines how each cell should change based on the information it has gathered. It’s here that the system evolves, with the cells adapting and responding to environmental changes.</p><figure id="17b0a320-00ae-8098-80a0-e69315e4c00b"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/model.svg"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/model.svg"/></a><figcaption>Learning process for Growing NCA, image by Mordvintsev et al.<d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite> </figcaption></figure></li></ol><h3 id="17b0a320-00ae-80d5-9c81-ca1b38c6eef5">The Power of Differentiability</h3><p id="17b0a320-00ae-803f-b0f6-e2eb73004110">What makes this system truly powerful is its <strong>differentiability</strong>. Every operation, from perceiving the environment to updating its state, is fully differentiable. This means we can optimize the entire system through <strong>gradient descent</strong>, just like how neural networks learn from data. As a result, the system isn’t statically pre-defined with some arbitrary rules — it can actually <strong>learn</strong> to grow specific patterns or behaviors, making it a powerful tool for modeling complex systems.</p><figure id="1910a320-00ae-8027-a1a6-db5e3610fa63"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/regen2.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/regen2.gif"/></a><figcaption>NCA Growing process, credit to <d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite> </figcaption></figure><p id="17b0a320-00ae-80c0-98fe-e15f2925d588">While the individual components of the system (like Sobel filters and neural networks) are relatively simple, their combination creates something much more sophisticated. It’s a balance between simplicity and complexity, much like biological systems in nature, where local interactions lead to the emergence of surprising, intricate behaviors.</p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-8054-80ce-d80770602c35">This approach doesn’t just push the boundaries of what cellular automata can do, it opens up a world of possibilities for learning, growth, and pattern formation through local interactions alone. Whether you’re a researcher, a developer, or simply someone fascinated by the intersection of AI and complexity, there’s a lot to explore here.  </p><p id="17b0a320-00ae-800a-87f3-f2bfda7a56e3">Other applications of Neural Cellular Automata include Image Segmentation <d-cite key="Sandler2020-nx"></d-cite>, Image classification <d-cite key="Randazzo2020-mh"></d-cite> and many more. </p><div id="17c0a320-00ae-8082-9fe2-d7ba3a948c55"><p id="d21df3d1-8bd1-4991-a135-4d7a1ff782ee"><h2 id="3c1f6714-1e60-4811-a242-1890db2faa19">Recap - Differentiable Logic Gate Networks</h2></p></div><p id="17b0a320-00ae-8032-afd2-d1679ae2ad41">What if we could take the basic building blocks of computation (logic gates like AND, OR, and XOR) and combine them in a learned fashion, to solve some task ?

We encourage readers to interact with the circuit below <d-cite key="MaterzokUnknown-wb"></d-cite>, clicking on and off inputs on the left to observe the effect on the outputs.</p><figure>

However, during training, we only employed one fixed size of the grid. Naturally, we should investigate what happens if we change the grid size: is the rule we learned truly an iterative, procedural solution, or is it overfit to one particular grid size? Let&#39;s scale up both the spatial and temporal dimensions by a factor of four—using a grid four times larger and running it for four times as many steps.</p><figure id="1900a320-00ae-80e2-a164-f1c5a41da8f5"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/checker_board_large.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/checker_board_large.gif"/></a><figcaption>Generalization Test: Learned Rules Applied to 4x Larger Grid</figcaption></figure><p id="1900a320-00ae-8012-8000-d24e45e6528c">Success! The circuit works just as well in this new setting. This raises an interesting question as to the inductive biases of this model. In the NCA setting, it was possible to coax behavior invariant to grid size and time, but this required either special spatially invariant loss functions <d-cite key="Niklasson2021-vb"></d-cite> , and in the case of the growing lizard a special &#34;alive/dead&#34;<d-cite key="Mordvintsev2020-oh"></d-cite> regime to prevent overfitting to boundary conditions. Here, our boundary conditions are also fixed, yet the model has learned a &#34;boundary-size-invariant&#34; way to produce the pattern. Could the discretization and minimal circuit size be finding some minimal procedural description for generating patterns of interest? </p><p id="1910a320-00ae-80b6-9642-fda8db6a59db">Given our setting, we tested the system&#39;s resilience to damage and its recovery capabilities through two experiments. In the first test (left), we evaluated pattern reconstruction when a large portion of cells were permanently disabled, simulating faulty components. In the second test (right), the disabled cells were reactivated after a set number of steps. The system demonstrated robust behavior in both scenarios: maintaining pattern integrity despite permanent cell damage in the first case, and successfully self-repairing to produce the correct pattern once damaged cells came back online in the second case.</p><h3 id="1980a320-00ae-800d-bdc1-e5bf455b1d0e">DiffLogic CA as new paradigm for robust computing </h3><p id="1980a320-00ae-80f4-a198-c9d7fa195e69">Robust computing <d-cite key="Ackley2013-im"></d-cite> represents a fundamental shift in system design, prioritizing reliable operation under real-world conditions. In contrast to traditional computing, which relies on precise, error-free components, robust systems are designed to remain functional even in the face of hardware failures, environmental interference, unexpected inputs, or manufacturing variations. While contemporary computing, especially distributed computing, has some affordances around robustness to certain types of failures, it&#39;s generally still far more brittle than any similarly complex system in the natural world, and those affordances are usually designed around very specific failure cases that we are unable to control for by other means (think cosmic ray-induced bit flips in RAM). In the example reported above, we observed how the DiffLogic CA learned rules that exhibit both fault tolerance and self-healing behavior, without explicitly designing around these conditions. When some cells fail, the damage is contained, and the system continues to function with a gradual decline rather than experiencing catastrophic failure. This mirrors how biological systems achieve reliability through networks of imperfect components, suggesting a powerful approach for future computing systems that can maintain functionality even under imperfect conditions.</p><h3 id="1930a320-00ae-8016-8dd7-d421f595e190">Asynchronicity </h3><p id="1960a320-00ae-8082-a939-e7211db1d6ed">Inspired by the approach used in traditional NCA training <d-cite key="Niklasson2021-ft"></d-cite>, we explored asynchronous updates. Instead of updating all cells simultaneously (which can be likened to a global clock), we randomly select a subset of cells to update in each step. This simulates a scenario where each cell operates with its own internal clock. Within this framework, each cell can be conceptualized as a tiny computational unit operating independently of other cells, making its own decisions.</p><p id="19c0a320-00ae-8002-b441-cebc9f9c150c">We proceeded directly to introducing asynchronicity to training, expecting this to be markedly more difficult than in traditional NCAs. Firstly, the updates at every step must output the full new state, and not just an incremental update. Secondly, a cell must now be able to account for surrounding cells being in any combination of desynchronization. Any given neighbour could be one, two, three, or more steps &#34;behind&#34; or &#34;ahead&#34;. This combinatorially increases the possible transitions rules the cell has to effectively learn to deal with. To our surprise -  successful asynchronous training was relatively easy to achieve in the simplest pattern - the checkerboard. Below, we demonstrate three different, unique, reconstructions of the pattern , all starting  from the same initial state but with distinct random seeds to determine the cell update order. Despite the asynchronous nature of these updates and a more complex resulting update rule, the cells correctly reconstruct the target pattern in 50 steps, compared to the original 20.</p><figure id="1980a320-00ae-80be-b66e-d6355a0280ab"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/async__.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/async__.gif"/></a><figcaption>Asynchronous trained patterns.</figcaption></figure><p id="1980a320-00ae-80ff-8aca-ea0fc5505fa0">Furthermore, the learned circuit demonstrated generalization capabilities, exhibiting successful reconstruction on larger grids and resilience to errors -  a self-healing checkerboard..</p><div id="1980a320-00ae-805c-8eb1-e3f89fc9fe84"><div id="1980a320-00ae-805e-a10a-fc53a3247820"><figure id="1980a320-00ae-805b-a87d-fc94afd8ee18"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/generalization.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/generalization.gif"/></a><figcaption>Generalization with asynchronous training</figcaption></figure></div><div id="1980a320-00ae-80d3-a34b-ded90815deca"><figure id="1980a320-00ae-8016-a53b-d2c9818b2441"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/self_healing.gif"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/self_healing.gif"/></a><figcaption>Self-healing behaviour with asynchronous training</figcaption></figure></div></div><p id="1a80a320-00ae-807e-aecd-d610a20882b2">The biggest surprise came when sanity checking the original synchronously trained rule, but using asynchronous inference. It works! This is surprising and further speaks to the robustness of the circuit originally discovered. </p><p id="1a80a320-00ae-8095-900a-f90ff269de71">This unexpected success with asynchronous inference led us to hypothesize that models trained directly with asynchronous updates would exhibit even greater robustness. To test this, we randomly deactivate a 10x10 pixel square within the image domain at each inference time-step, as shown in the simulations below.    </p><p id="1a80a320-00ae-80ea-a82e-f52164befdcd">The images hint at the difference in resilience to noise - the asynchronous cells recover from the damage slightly more quickly, while the synchronously trained rule appears to be more impacted. By measuring the error as the sum of the absolute difference between the target and reconstructed images, we found that asynchronous training improves robustness considering these perturbations. </p><figure id="1a80a320-00ae-80c5-a841-ddf938cd000c"><p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>−</mo><msub><mover accent="true"><mi>y</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>t</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Error_t = \sum_{i,j}^N |y - \tilde{y}_t|  </annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>E</span><span>rro</span><span><span>r</span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span>t</span></span></span></span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span></span><span>=</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span><span>i</span><span>,</span><span>j</span></span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>∑</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>N</span></span></span></span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><span></span><span>∣</span><span>y</span><span></span><span>−</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span>y</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>~</span></span></span></span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span>t</span></span></span></span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span>∣</span></span></span></span></span></p></figure><figure id="1a80a320-00ae-8069-9429-cbb1d0946770"><a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/async_sync.svg"><img src="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/images/async_sync.svg"/></a></figure><h2 id="1900a320-00ae-801c-9a12-c65e03e9b6e5">Experiment 3: Growing a Lizard</h2><p id="1900a320-00ae-80e5-b44f-e35e162e2266">For the next experiment, we tested DiffLogic CA&#39;s ability to learn arbitrary shapes by training it on the outline of a lizard, in an homage to the original NCA work.

We replace the neural network components with Deep Differentiable Logic Networks, which bring the flexibility of differentiable training to discrete logic gates. The successful application of differentiable logic gates to cellular automata is demonstrated through two key results: replicating the rules of Conway&#39;s Game of Life and generating patterns via learned discrete dynamics. These findings highlights the significant potential of integrating discrete logic within the framework of neural cellular automata and prove that differentiable logic gate networks can be effectively learned in recurrent architectures.  While the current model exhibits promising results in learning patterns, training it to generate more complex shapes and structures presents ongoing challenges. Potential directions for improvement include the exploration of hierarchical NCA architectures and the incorporation of specialized gates designed to facilitate state forgetting. For instance, integrating LSTM-like gating mechanisms into the state update process could enable a richer and diverse combination of past and newly computed candidate states, potentially enhancing the model&#39;s dynamics and expressiveness.</p><h3 id="17c0a320-00ae-8098-b773-d5d0c2587283">Acknowledgments</h3><p id="1a00a320-00ae-809b-b46a-cb16a2bdf0f3">We thank Blaise Aguera y Arcas for his support and the Paradigm of Intelligence Team for the fruitful and inspiring discussions.
