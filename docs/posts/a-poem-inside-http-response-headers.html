    <h1>Show HN: A poem inside HTTP response headers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>(a poem)</h3><p><i>Jacob Evelyn</i></p><p>“HTTP/2 204” is a poem that lives entirely within the headers of an HTTP response.</p><details><summary>What does that mean?</summary><p>When you visit any website, that site’s servers send your device an HTTP response containing the website data. This response also contains metadata in various “header” fields which help your browser to fetch and display the content correctly.</p><p>For example, the response from <code><a href="https://poets.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>https://poets.org</span></a></code> contains seventeen different headers—some standard (such as <code>date</code> or <code>content-type</code>) and some non-standard (such as <code>cf-ray</code> or <code>expect-ct</code>). Non-standard headers are typically for informational purposes or behavior not supported by every browser.</p></details><h2>The poem</h2><p>I composed this poem entirely from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Standard_response_fields" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard HTTP response headers</a>. When the poem’s URL is requested, my server sends a “no content” HTTP response (status code 204, using the HTTP/2 protocol) whose headers form the poem. You can view the poem in your computer’s built-in terminal by running the following command:</p><pre><span>curl</span> <span>--head</span> <span>https://ja.cob.land/http2-204</span>
