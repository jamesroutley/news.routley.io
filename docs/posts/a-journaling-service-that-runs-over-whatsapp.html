    <h1>Show HN: A journaling service that runs over WhatsApp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>And, to help you remember whatâ€™s happened in your life, we also show you a journal 
entry from the past everyday - right there in WhatsApp!</p><div data-id="27"><div data-id="28"><a data-id="29" href="https://wa.me/919910807891"></a><p>14-day Free trial.

organised in an online journal that&#39;s accessible only to you. </p><p>
You can send your messages anytime of the day, multiple times a day - kind of 
like your <em>stream of consciousness</em>. All your entries are neatly organised in 
a day-wise view.</p></div><div data-id="44"><div data-id="45"><div data-id="46"><p><img data-id="47" src="https://todayhasbeen.com/-/todayhasbeen-ui.fifthtry.site/assets/thb-web.png"/></p><comment data-id="48"></comment></div><comment data-id="49"></comment></div></div><p>We do send you a daily notification at around 8pm. We&#39;ve found that a little 
nudge goes a long way, but you can also choose to disable it.</p><a data-id="53" href="https://wa.me/919910807891"></a><div data-id="57"><p>14-day Free trial. No Credit Card Required.</p></div><div data-id="60"><p>A journal that you&#39;ll love!</p><comment data-id="62"></comment></div><div data-id="63"><p><strong>It&#39;s private:</strong> Only you can read what you write. When you want to see your 
online journal, we create a unique and temporary link only for you on WhatsApp 
(i.e., there is no password required for you to remember)</p>
<p><strong>Write when and as much you want:</strong> We send you a daily nudge; however, you 
can just send a text, any time of the day, to our WhatsApp number and we&#39;ll
store that as a journal entry for you. THB supports multiple entries for a day.
And, feel free to write a single sentence, or a few or just send a photo. 
It&#39;s your journal!</p>
<p><strong>Peek into your past:</strong> Each time you send us a new journal entry, we reply
with a random entry from your past. There&#39;s a hard-to-explain yet definite
joy in reading the old entries from your journal. If you&#39;re like me, then most
of the time it&#39;s a factual record of the day, but every once in a while, I&#39;d 
receive an entry where I&#39;d poured my heart out!</p></div><div data-id="64"><p>14-Day Free Trial (No Credit Card Required)</p><comment data-id="66"></comment></div><div data-id="67"><p>You can try THB out for 14 days for absolutely free. At the end of the trial 
period, you can choose between our monthly ($5 per month) or annual ($48 per 
year) subscription plans. </p><p>
You&#39;ll get the Stripe payment link in WhatsApp. Cancel anytime. No questions asked.</p></div><div data-id="69"><a data-id="70" href="https://wa.me/919910807891"></a><p>14-day Free trial.
