    <h1>Japanese explained to programmers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Being born in France, I was immersed in Japanese culture from a very young age. Whether it was some imported Yu-Gi-Oh card found in a local store that taught me my first kanji (ideogram) at 11 (水), to a constant stream of Anime culture and video games.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the language, learning it during recess at school, in some class in university, and more recently with the help of <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a>, a pretty neat SRS (spaced repetition system) app that teaches you kanji and vocabulary.</p>
<p>But as a programmer, something about Japanese has always felt natural. Whereas English and French can feel a bit chaotic, there is a sense of order in the Japanese language that reminds me of functional programming of all things. Let&#39;s examine this.</p>
<p><strong>Note : this is not a lesson in Japanese, but an introduction to how different language can be as different as Haskell and C. I&#39;ll purposedely focus on the most idiomatic parts of the language</strong></p>
<p>If japanese was a programming language, it would feature the following concepts:</p>
<h2 id="1-primitive-types-hiragana-katakana-and-kanji">1. Primitive types: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji</h2>
<pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>const </span><span>ha</span><span>:Hiragana = &#34;</span><span>は</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>ha2</span><span>:Katakana = &#34;</span><span>ハ</span><span>&#34;; </span><span>// same sound as hiragana version
</span><span>const </span><span>day</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>日</span><span>&#34;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Hiraganas and Katakanas are a phonetic alphabet, that allow to represent sound. Kanjis are logograms, that represent concepts.</p>
<h2 id="2-japanese-standard-library">2. Japanese Standard Library</h2>
<p>The japanese standard library offers a bunch of chainable functions to add meaning to your primitive types.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>const </span><span>me</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>私</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>eat</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>食</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>cow</span><span>: Kanji = &#34;</span><span>牛</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>meat</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>肉</span><span>&#34;;

</span><span>const </span><span>iEatBeef </span><span>= </span><span>word</span><span>(</span><span>me</span><span>)
    .</span><span>setRole</span><span>(&#34;</span><span>subject</span><span>&#34;)
    .</span><span>add</span><span>(
        </span><span>combinedWord</span><span>(</span><span>cow</span><span>, </span><span>meat</span><span>)  </span><span>// combining cow and meat you get beef
        </span><span>.</span><span>setRole</span><span>(&#34;</span><span>object</span><span>&#34;)
    ),
    .</span><span>add</span><span>(
        </span><span>word</span><span>(</span><span>eat</span><span>)
        .</span><span>transform</span><span>(&#34;</span><span>polite-present-verb</span><span>&#34;)
    );
</span></code></pre>
<p>In actual japanese, that looks like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>私 (me) + は (set role of subject) + (牛 (cow) + 肉 (meat)) + を (set role of object) + 食 (eat) + ます (transform to polite present tense)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The order does matter, it is quite different to english but very similar to functional programming.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>//You would not do the english order &#34;Send the request to the server&#34;
  </span><span>send</span><span>().</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>setURL</span><span>(&#34;</span><span>serverurl</span><span>&#34;)

  </span><span>// you would do the japanese order &#34;For this request, with the URL xxx, send it to the server&#34;
  </span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>setURL</span><span>(&#34;</span><span>serverurl</span><span>&#34;).</span><span>send</span><span>()
</span></code></pre>
<p>The neat thing about the japanese standard library is that it is very consistent. You can always expect the same result from the same input. It&#39;s a very predictable language. Verbs conjugate in a very predictable way (which coming from French is a breath of fresh air).</p>
<h2 id="3-even-kanjis-themselves-can-be-functions">3: Even Kanjis themselves can be functions</h2>
<p>It&#39;s not immediately obvious to our western eyes, but Kanjis are offten composed of multiple components. A pretty neat exemple are the types of fish.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>const </span><span>fish</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>魚</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>blue</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>青</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>mackerel</span><span>:Kanji = </span><span>composeKanji</span><span>(</span><span>fish</span><span>, </span><span>blue</span><span>); </span><span>//&#34;鯖&#34;

</span><span>const </span><span>salmon</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>鮭</span><span>&#34;;
</span><span>const </span><span>tuna</span><span>:Kanji = &#34;</span><span>鮪</span><span>&#34;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can see here as an example that all the kanjis for the various type of fish are composed of the kanji for fish, and a secondary kanji stuck together. This is a very common pattern in japanese. For instance here, Mackerel is <strong>鯖</strong>, composed of 魚 + 青, aka the &#34;blue fish&#34;.</p>
<h2 id="4-this-extends-to-other-parts-of-the-language">4: This extends to other parts of the language</h2>
<p>I won&#39;t go into detail (although depending on the receiption of this I might do a part 2), but similar parallels can be made for prepositions, adjectives, adverbs... I did not go into the pronounciation of Kanji as that&#39;s a whole other conversation. </p>
<p>I hope this triggered your curiosity for the language. Of course might have gotten stuff wrong, if so feel free to send me a message, tweet, comment on HackerNews or whatever you prefer. I&#39;m always happy to learn more about Japanese and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making more mistakes in the future.</p>
