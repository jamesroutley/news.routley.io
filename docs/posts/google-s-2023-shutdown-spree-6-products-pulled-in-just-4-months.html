</div>
<p>Google is notorious for its habit of killing off products,
and 2023 has been no exception. In just the first four months
of the year, the tech giant has already pulled the plug on
six products, leaving users scrambling for alternatives.
Let&#39;s take a closer look at each of the products that have
been shut down in 2023 so far:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-codejam.png" alt="Google Code Jam" width="400px"/></p><p>Google Code Jam</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Code Jam</strong>: This international
programming competition was hosted and administered by
Google. It consisted of multiple rounds of online and
onsite contests, where participants had to solve
challenging problems using their preferred programming
language. The top 25 finalists got to compete for the title
of Code Jam Champion and a prize of 15,000 USD at the
Google headquarters. However, Google has decided to shut it
down in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-currents.jpeg" alt="Google Currents" width="400px"/></p><p>Google Currents</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Currents</strong>: This service provided
social media features similar to Google+ for Workspace
users. It was launched in July 2020 as a rebrand of the
now-defunct Google+ platform. However, it was shut down in
April 2023, and people using it were pushed to Spaces,
Google&#39;s equivalent of a Slack channel.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-street-view.png" alt="Google Street View" width="400px"/></p><p>Google Street View</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Street View app</strong>: This app was
available on Android and iOS and enabled people to get a
360-degree view of locations around the world. It was over
12 years old but was shut down in March 2023. While the app
is now gone, its functionality still exists on Google Maps
and Street View Studio.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-jacquard.png" alt="Google Jacquard" width="400px"/></p><p>Google Jacquard</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Jacquard</strong>: This small tag could be
embedded into clothing and paired with a smartphone,
allowing people to perform certain customizable actions
on their phones without actually touching them. For
example, a double-tap could play/pause music, brushing
the fabric could change tracks, and covering the sensor
would mute/unmute notifications. It was first unveiled
back in 2015 by <a href="https://atap.google.com">Google
Advanced Technology &amp; Projects (ATAP)</a>, but was killed
in March 2023.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-stadia.jpeg" alt="Google Stadia" width="400px"/></p><p>Google Stadia</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Stadia</strong>: Google&#39;s cloud gaming
service allowed gamers to run AAA titles on cheaper
hardware, including phones, laptops, and TVs. However, it
was shut down on January 18 due to low user adoption.
Google refunded all Stadia hardware purchased through the
Google Store along with the games and add-ons purchased
from the Stadia Store.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://toolhub.tech/blog/assets/google-onehub.jpeg" alt="Google OnHub" width="400px"/></p><p>Google OnHub</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google OnHub</strong>: This wireless router was
powered by Google software and managed by Google apps. It
offered special features like Google Assistant and was sold
in two versions, manufactured by either Asus or TP-Link. In
2021, Google announced that the OnHub routers would no
longer receive any software updates. Then in January 2023,
the company rendered the product almost completely useless
by disabling most of its features.</li>
</ul>
