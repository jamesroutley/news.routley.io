    <h1>My portable ergonomic setup</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2022, I developed nerve pain in my arms.
It came on quickly, and it was bad: I couldn&#39;t drive, I couldn&#39;t type, and at the worst I couldn&#39;t pick up our kids.
That episode spontaneously resolved after a couple of months, but flareups happen occasionally.
One guaranteed trigger is my laptop: if I use it as, well, <em>a laptop</em>, then I&#39;ll have pain for a few days from less than half an hour of usage.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I&#39;m more confident than ever that I&#39;ll be productive as a programmer for decades to come.
That confidence comes <em>from</em> having to deal with these issues.
They&#39;ve forced me to learn some accessibility tech and get/create some equipment so that I can program without pain.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my setup, as of 2024.
This is a snapshot, as it will surely change over time as my needs and abilities change.
I hope that this can be useful for folks out there struggling with the same things I did.
There&#39;s some background to go through first, then a rundown of how I made it portable.</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-4.5d50c794ee6562b8.jpg"/></p>
<p>I love mechanical keyboards.
The tactility of the switches, the sounds, it&#39;s a wonderful part of interfacing with a computer.
I got about half a year of that after my nerve issues resolved before the pain returned.</p>
<p>When it returned, I did some research on different ergonomic options.
There are a lot of good options out there, and they&#39;re all expensive to experiment with!
I ended up choosing the <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-100">Keyboardio Model 100</a> for a few reasons.
It was highly recommended by folks with similar issues, it is a split keyboard, it supports tenting, and the keys are column-staggered to better match how your fingers actually work.</p>
<p>This keyboard has been a joy.
The palm keys and thumb clusters are wonderful, and using my palm/thumb for layer switching is really intuitive and allows me to avoid far stretches.
I have a lot of special characters (like some of the programmers&#39; punctuation, <code>{}[]</code>) on that layer, plus mouse functionality and arrow keys.
The thumb cluster is all easily accessible with a sweeping motion of my thumb.
Using it with a small degree of tenting from the default kit resolved my pain again!
(Yes, my toe is getting sore from kicking that can a lot.)</p>
<p>I oscillated between using it split or together for a while.
Now I exclusively use it split, but I have a picture from early on where it&#39;s not split.
I like having it split, especially since a coffee cup fits between them, but when I was still figuring out portability, clipping them together seemed appealing.</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-1.a6f56449baa9881b.jpg"/></p><p>I take this keyboard with me when I travel.
It&#39;s flown from Philadelphia to Seattle, it&#39;s driven across multiple states, and it took a train to NYC.
It&#39;s wonderful—and it takes up a <em>lot</em> of space in my luggage.</p>
<p>I kept relapsing by using my laptop as a laptop because it&#39;s so convenient, and I don&#39;t want to <em>always</em> be at my desk.
So I had to figure out how to use this keyboard portably if I want to be able to type for decades more.</p>

<p>I made a lapdesk of sorts for my keyboard, with a laptop riser on it.
It was big and bulky, but I could use my laptop in our living room, which was a minor success.
But since it was so heavy and bulky, I couldn&#39;t leave the house with it.</p>
<p>This came to a head with Never Graduate Week, the annual alumni event for <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a>.
It&#39;s a gathering of computer nerds, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to take my laptop up and use it?
No, no, it was time to fix that.
And I realized this a week before my train to NYC.
<em>Tick tock.</em></p>
<p>My design goals were to make something that:</p>
<ul>
<li>fits in my backpack</li>
<li>supports tenting my split keyboard</li>
<li>holds my laptop screen at a reasonable height</li>
<li>takes moments to setup</li>
</ul>
<p>I started by revisiting some posts about other people&#39;s ergonomic setups.
In particular, I found a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://peterlyons.com/problog/2020/09/ergothink-t420-laptop-tray/">Peter Lyon&#39;s laptop tray</a> and from <a href="https://www.lauralangdon.io/blog/my-ultra-ergo-keyboard-setup/">Laura Langdon&#39;s keyboard setup</a>.
Peter&#39;s post showed a clever way to get the screen height up: with a 180-degree laptop hinge, you can stick the laptop in a vertical slot and it is its own riser to a decent ergonomic height.
This comes with big weight savings, since you need a couple of ounces of wood instead of much more material for a &#34;real&#34; laptop riser.
Laura&#39;s post showed me a clever way to mount the keyboards themselves using Z tripod mounts!</p>
<p>My design here was not sophisticated, and I took an approach of figuring it out as I went (as I do with many practical workshop projects).
I went in with basically just the constraint of dimensions, since it had to fit in my backpack, and available material.
I purchased some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQS7FPKX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">Z tripod mounts</a> for tenting the keyboards, and the rest of the hardware was scrap wood I had in my workshop from other projects.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was get the base cut down to the largest size that would fit in my backpack.
It&#39;s harder to put wood back together than to cut off more later on.
Then I used a router and straight edge to cut some slots for the tripod mounts to attach to.
There are two sets of these, because I forgot to account for the keyboard&#39;s USB cable the first time... or maybe it was just a clever way to get the whole thing lighter.
Who knows!</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-2.b03b323ba1e86fa8.jpg"/></p><p>After that, I attached some wood for the back half of the laptop slot.
I didn&#39;t want to plan and iterate as much as Peter did, so I opted to make an adjustable slot rather than go for a precise fit.
There&#39;s a fixed piece of wood across the back, a wood strap on the front, and some bolts allow tightening or loosening it to put in and take out the laptop.
It&#39;s reasonably easy to get the laptop out—under 15 seconds in either direction—and the laptop is <em>very</em> secure in there when it&#39;s tightened in.</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-5.65bb1499ce6b9ed7.jpg"/></p><p>The nice-to-have thing I added was a USB hub with power pass-through, so I can use one cable to attach all my peripherals to my laptop (currently, a mouse that I rarely use and my keyboard).
I can also use one cable to attach all my desk peripherals, like my webcam and monitor, when I sit there.
And because the tray is so small and pretty light, I just use it at my desk, too.
I switch up the position I use it in, so sometimes it sits on my desk and sometimes I have it in my lap.</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-3.e1480955e781412e.jpg"/>

<img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-4.5d50c794ee6562b8.jpg"/></p><p>And it <em>did</em> achieve the primary design goal of being portable.
I&#39;ve used it on an Amtrak train, in a church basement for a chess tournament, and all around my house.
It&#39;s going to get a lot of miles traveling around with me.
The weight is a potential snag: fully loaded it&#39;s about 8 pounds.
2.8 pounds for my laptop, 2.8 pounds for the keyboard, a pound for the Z mounts and hardware, and about 1.5 pounds of wood.
There&#39;s not a lot to shave off here and it&#39;s doable, but it&#39;s still not as light as a laptop alone!</p>

<p><img src="http://tom7.org/processed_images/keyboard-6.8002646770a52aeb.jpg"/></p><p>Not bad for a three hour prototype!
Of course, it&#39;s still &#34;just a prototype,&#34; so like all prototypes, it&#39;s going to be used as the production model for <em>far</em> too long.</p>
<p>As an added bonus: social interactions!
Most people completely ignore the lady with the weird contraption in public, so you don&#39;t have to worry about your Amtrak neighbor talking to you.
Unless you happen to sit next to a Recurser, or another computer nerd.
Because let me tell you, there is no better conversation starter than this thing among RC folks.
The whole time I was up there, I would hear variations on &#34;oooh what is this, tell me about it!&#34;
It was wonderful.</p>

<p>Of course, my arms gave out so totally in the past that I&#39;m not assuming they&#39;ll always be here to write code for me.
What&#39;s a girl to do?
Find other input mechanisms, that&#39;s what!</p>
<p>During my first major round of RSI pain, I learned how to use <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon</a>, software for controlling your computer entirely by voice.
It&#39;s pretty <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/voice-control-talon/">amazing software</a>, and it gives me so much confidence knowing that it&#39;s available when I need it.
During that first round of pain, I got back to where I could &#34;type&#34; at about half my previous keyboard speed.
That made it not really a limiting factor, though the cognitive overhead of it was still high.</p>
<p>The thing is, my arms send warning shots sometimes.
&#34;Nicole, remember that we can hurt or fall asleep <em>whenever we want</em>.&#34;
So Talon is coming back into my workflow.
I&#39;m not going to code by voice all the time, but I&#39;m going to work up to quarter- to half-time Talon usage.
I want to hedge and have more input mechanisms.</p>
<p>Besides, a microphone is a lot more portable than my whole contraption here.</p>
<p>Right now as I get back into it, I&#39;m experimenting with using a bluetooth IEM that has a microphone in it.
It&#39;s not really the recommended setup, but so far it&#39;s been having good accuracy for me, so I&#39;ll go with it for now!
A wireless mic is <em>really</em> nice to have with Talon, because you can move around freely, away from your computer even, and continue to enter text.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll never forget the first time I wrote code with my whole desk empty in front of me, available for coffee and notebooks... &lt;3</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you have a rad portable ergonomic setup, I&#39;d love to hear about it!
And if you see any obvious improvements to my setup, please let me know.
I want to be writing code as long as I am alive, and that means either dying young or coding into late life.
I&#39;d much prefer the latter.</p>
