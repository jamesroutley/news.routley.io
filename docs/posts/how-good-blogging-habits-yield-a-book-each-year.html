    <h1>How Good Blogging Habits Yield a Book Each Year</h1>

<p>I recently read this post and it got me thinking about my own writing habits and inspired me to build a simple <a href="https://bvisness.me/stats">stats page</a> for my blog.</p>

<p>The author makes the case that the average book is ~80k words. So if you write a 1k word post twice each week for 50 of the 52 weeks each year, you get 100k words which is basically a book each year.</p>
<p>The author published 3 books (so far) and mentions they&#39;re often aligned with the blog posts they&#39;ve been writing.</p>
<p>They also make a distinction between blog posts and books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogs - less edited, more fun, often more readership</li>
<li>Books - more edited, more work, some monetary gains via sales</li>
</ul>

<p>For the past couples years I&#39;ve been writing &gt;100 posts at around 1k words per post netting me a cool ~100k words per year. (see <a href="https://bvisness.me/stats">site stats</a>)</p>
<h2 id="productionalizing-blog-posts-to-books">Productionalizing blog posts to books</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve not yet written a book but it certainly seems like I&#39;m pumping out enough words to do so. I&#39;ve had the idea of writing minibooks in the back of my head for the past few years but never actually executed.</p>
<p>Minibooks are like atomic books - focused on a very specific, typically non-fiction subject. When people say &#34;that book could&#39;ve been 100 pages shorter&#34;, minibooks try to be that length - just the length you need to get the idea across.</p>
<p>Typically this can be done in 100 pages or less which is ab 50k words at 500 words per page. This number isn&#39;t a hard limit as length doesn&#39;t really matter, it&#39;s however long it takes to get across that one idea.</p>
<p><em>For more on minibooks, I liked <a href="https://amzn.to/4q26Ncs">Mini Book Model by Chris Stanley</a>.</em></p>
<p>So at 50k words per minibook, I&#39;m currently writing ~2 of them but my blog post writing doesn&#39;t directly align to creating a book - there&#39;s lots of different subjects I write about, many of which wouldn&#39;t make sense in the same book.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve been considering a strategy to more align these ideas - blogging and book writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/iamhamy-static/labs/posts/2026/2026-01_blogging-a-book-a-year/2026-01_blogging-a-book-a-year_black.png" alt="Blogging to books"/></p>
<p>My current theoretical strategy is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a few themes / areas I&#39;m interested in and people want - typically technical themes I&#39;m into like Ansible self hosting, functional C#, and F#</li>
<li>Write blog posts in those areas</li>
<li>Outline minibooks with each chapter being a ~post</li>
<li>Eventually compile those posts into a minibook</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#39;t done this yet but it seems workable. Just probably requires a bit more discipline on my part for posting schedules and themes to post around.</p>
