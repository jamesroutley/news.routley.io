          Glamorous Toolkit is a multi-language notebook.
          A fancy code editor.
          A software analysis platform.
          A visualization engine.
          A knowledge management system.
          All programmable. Free and open-source.

            <a href="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">Developers spend 50% or more of their time figuring systems out</a>. It&#39;s the single most expensive activity in software development. We reimagine it from the ground up by means of custom tools and with it we reshape the whole development experience. We call it Moldable Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every single development problem includes a data science problem, and data problems are best dealt with custom tools.
            Glamorous Toolkit makes this practical through a platform that makes the creation of tools inexpensive.

        <p>Glamorous Toolkit can be molded in many ways to support a variety of situations in a uniform manner.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <h2>Executable specifications &amp; domain discovery</h2>
        <p>Specifications tend to get a bad name because they are expensive and often wrong. There is a better way. Model them explicitly. Explore scenarios through executable examples. View the results through custom views.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <h2>Software assessment</h2>
        <p>Code reading is the single most expensive development activity. Much of reading is actually about finding interesting places. Finding the root cause, finding where to add a new feature. Those are search activities. Or visualization ones.</p>

        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <h2>Iterative API &amp; data exploration</h2>
        <p>To reason about data, we first need to qualitatively understand its structure. The inspection tools together with the ability of refining the data model and of visualizing in place are directly usable in these contexts.</p>

        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <h2>Pharo development</h2>
        <p>Glamorous Toolkit is implemented in Pharo, the pure object-oriented language. Of course, it brings a moldable environment for developers working with Pharo. And yes, Glamorous Toolkit is developed using Glamorous Toolkit, too.</p>

            Moldable development has many implications both technically and economically. And it can make you smile when you work, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figuring systems out is expensive and pervasive. Not doing it well ends up creating black boxes that pile up on top of each other. As the world we build is based on software, we cannot let it remain a black box. It&#39;s a large problem that can only change if we deal with it explicitly. We need a conversation.</p>
          <p>
            We created Glamorous Toolkit to have a concrete conversation about how we figure systems out. <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">Join us</a>.

        <p>GT is a point of light in the darkness. I have my reservations of course, but it is by far the best example I&#39;ve seen of a live literate programming environment.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s impossible to explain the feeling of #GToolkit&#39;s &#34;new world&#34; where, in a one-liner, you can compose queries VS. traditional context switching to a stovepiped tool with its own domain and limitations. You&#39;ll just have to try for yourself... </p>

        <p>One of the most impressive tools I&#39;ve seen in the last ten years. The Glamorous Toolkit extends Pharo IDE capabilities to support live creation of inspectors/visualizers and editors for objects.</p>
        <p>It makes every other IDE obsolete.</p>

        <p>Glamorous Toolkit is implemented in <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/docs/gt-and-pharo">Pharo</a>, but it&#39;s made to work for many languages. It presently offers support for JavaScript, Python, and Gemstone.</p>
        <p>Every part of a software system, be it an algorithm, a domain-driven design, or the architecture, can be made explainable through custom tools. 
          Glamorous Toolkit makes this possible by treating the interface as a set of visual and interactive operators that can be combined in many ways. </p>

        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Moldable</h2>
        <p>Every part can be molded to the context. Every object can specify how it can be viewed or searched. Every method can specify how it can be edited. Every exception can define how it can be debugged. And all can be molded directly from the environment, often in minutes.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Exploratory flow</h2>
        <p>Understanding software requires continuous exploration. We capture that flow explicitly. In true moldable fashion, each step can be adapted dynamically. Together with the various tools this leads to an ever extensible experience.</p>

        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Live</h2>
        <p>Live programming is programming in the presence of living objects. It can start with a code snippet. Or with a form. Or another visual that creates the living objects.</p>
      </div>
      <p><img src="https://gtoolkit.com/assets/pictures/feature-playground.png"/>

      <div>
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>On demand editors</h2>
        <p>We have a beautifully flexible editor. You just do not have go to it. The editor comes to you. You get to code, but you can do that after you find the right place.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Notebooks</h2>
        <p>Writing and consuming documentation must be enjoyable. And maintainable. So, we made the whole environment host a giant interactive, visual wiki.</p>
      </div>
      <p><img src="https://gtoolkit.com/assets/pictures/feature-livenotebooks.png"/>
      </p>
    </div> <!-- row -->
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Analyses for many languages</h2>
        <p>Parsing a new language. Querying and visualizing code. Connecting sources from different languages like Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, C# or Delphi. Or perhaps integrating that XML descriptor file. They are all accessible.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
    <!-- <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>Example-driven</h2>
        <p class="lead">Examples are like tests that return an object. A small change that impacts how we compose examples, how we use them to guide development, and how, when combined with interactive narratives, we can explain our systems.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <h2>One rendering tree</h2>
        <p class="lead">Ok, this is rather ... geeky, but we are really proud of how we draw all scenes through exactly one rendering tree. That includes the editor or visualizations. We built a whole new graphical stack to make this possible. And now we can build new interesting visualizations and interactions.</p>
