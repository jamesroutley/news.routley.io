<p>Two lawsuits filed by a civil rights group allege that county jails in Michigan banned in-person visits in order to maximize revenue from voice and video calls as part of a &#34;quid pro quo kickback scheme&#34; with prison phone companies.</p>
<p>Civil Rights Corps filed the lawsuits on March 15 against the county governments, two county sheriffs, and two prison phone companies. The suits filed in county courts seek class-action status on behalf of people unable to visit family members detained in the local jails, including children who have been unable to visit their parents.</p>
<p>Defendants in <a href="https://civilrightscorps.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/St.ClairCounty-Complaint.pdf">one lawsuit</a> include St. Clair County Sheriff Mat King, prison phone company Securus Technologies, and Securus owner Platinum Equity. In the <a href="https://civilrightscorps.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GeneseeCounty-Complaint.pdf">other lawsuit</a>, defendants include Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson and prison phone company ViaPath Technologies. ViaPath was formerly called Global Tel*Link Corporation (GTL), and the lawsuit primarily refers to the company as GTL.</p>
<p>Each year, thousands of people spend months in the county jails, the lawsuit said. Many of the detainees have not been convicted of any crime and are awaiting trial; if they are convicted and receive long sentences, they are transferred to the Michigan Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>The named plaintiffs in both cases include family members, including children identified by their initials.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>“Hundreds of jails” eliminated visits</h2>
<p>The Michigan counties are far from alone in implementing visitation bans, Civil Rights Corps <a href="https://civilrightscorps.org/case/port-huron-michigan-right2hug/">said in a lawsuit announcement</a>. &#34;Across the United States, hundreds of jails have eliminated in-person family visits over the last decade,&#34; the group said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why has this happened? The answer highlights a profound flaw in how decisions too often get made in our legal system: for-profit jail telecom companies realized that they could earn more profit from phone and video calls if jails eliminated free in-person visits for families. So the companies offered sheriffs and county jails across the country a deal: if you eliminate family visits, we&#39;ll give you a cut of the increased profits from the larger number of calls. This led to a wave across the country, as local jails sought to supplement their budgets with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash from some of the poorest families in our society.</p></blockquote>
<p>St. Clair County implemented its family visitation ban in September 2017, &#34;prohibiting people from visiting their family members detained inside the county jail,&#34; Civil Rights Corps alleged. This &#34;decision was part of a quid pro quo kickback scheme with Securus Technologies, a for-profit company that contracts with jails to charge the families of incarcerated persons exorbitant rates to communicate with one another through &#39;services&#39; such as low-quality phone and video calls,&#34; the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Under the contract, &#34;Securus pays the County 50 percent of the $12.99 price tag for every 20-minute video call and 78 percent of the $0.21 per minute cost of every phone call,&#34; the lawsuit said. The contract has &#34;a guarantee that Securus would pay the County at least $190,000 each year,&#34; the St. Clair County lawsuit said.</p>
