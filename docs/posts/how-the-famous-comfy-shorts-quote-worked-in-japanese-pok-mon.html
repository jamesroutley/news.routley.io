    <h1>How the famous “comfy shorts” quote worked in Japanese Pokémon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-585"><p>The <cite>Pokémon</cite> series has lots of quotable lines, and one particularly famous line comes from the original Game Boy Gen. 1 releases:</p><figure><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pokemon-comfy-shorts-english-2.png" data-fancybox="group1" data-caption="&#34;Hi! I like shorts! They&#39;re comfy and easy to wear!&#34;"><img src="" data-src="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pokemon-comfy-shorts-english-2.png" alt="" title="&#34;Hi! I like shorts! They&#39;re comfy and easy to wear!&#34;"/></a><figcaption>&#34;Hi! I like shorts! They&#39;re comfy and easy to wear!&#34;</figcaption></figure><p>I barely know anything about <cite>Pokémon</cite> myself, yet even I still remember this line 20 years after playing the original games. I remember it felt like such a weird, random thing for an NPC to say, and apparently I wasn’t alone. It’s become a meme and has been kept in many <cite>Pokémon</cite> games since then.</p><p>So this got me wondering: what does the original Japanese text say? And is it as popular of a quote in Japan? Let’s take a look!</p><h2 id="original-line"><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/a-look-at-pokemon-and-comfy-shorts/#original-line" title="Link to this part">Original Line <span></span></a></h2><p>Here’s the actual quote in question, as seen in <cite>Pokémon Red</cite>:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Japanese Version (basic translation)</td><td>English Translation</td></tr><tr><td>Shorts are nice and easy to move around in! Why don’t you wear some too?</td><td>Hi! I like shorts! They’re comfy and easy to wear!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The first thing I notice is that the Japanese shorts line feels like a self-observation and a suggestion directed at the main character. The Japanese line also mentions that shorts are easy to move around in, which fits the character and the setting. He’s a Pokémon trainer and has to go around training and fighting and catching stuff in the wilderness, so being properly clothed <em>is</em> important.</p><p>In contrast, the English line feels more like a random statement that comes out of nowhere and has little relevance to anything. It reminds me a bit of Ralph Wiggum from <em>The Simpsons</em> and all his weird, random lines too – stuff like “my cat’s breath smells like cat food” and “my parents won’t let me use scissors”. Now that I think about it, those quotes have a very similar and beloved reputation too.</p><h2 id="in-context"><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/a-look-at-pokemon-and-comfy-shorts/#in-context" title="Link to this part">In Context <span></span></a></h2><p>The topic of shorts also makes more sense in the Japanese version because these male trainers are called <span><ruby lang="ja">たんパンこぞう</ruby> <span>(<span>tanpan kozō</span>)</span></span>, which means something like “Shorts Rascal” or “Shorts Kid”. But in the English text, they’re called “Youngster”.</p><p>So of course it makes sense for a “Shorts Rascal” to talk about shorts – the connection is obvious. A random “Youngster” talking about shorts, on the other hand, makes it seem like he brought up the topic out of nowhere. Sure, you can <em>see</em> that he’s wearing shorts in battle, but the text connection helps link everything more clearly in Japanese.</p><h2 id="popularity"><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/a-look-at-pokemon-and-comfy-shorts/#popularity" title="Link to this part">Popularity <span></span></a></h2><p>If you do a Google search or YouTube search for “comfy and easy to wear” in English, you’ll get an avalanche of results from <cite>Pokémon</cite>-related content. Here’s what comes up in a simple Google Image search:</p><figure><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/comfysearch-1.jpg" data-fancybox="group1" data-caption="English search results for &#34;comfy and easy to wear&#34; (without quotes)"><img src="" data-src="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/comfysearch-1.jpg" alt="" title="English search results for &#34;comfy and easy to wear&#34; (without quotes)"/></a><figcaption>English search results for &#34;comfy and easy to wear&#34; (without quotes)</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see, it’s almost entirely <cite>Pokémon</cite>-related stuff. But if you try the Japanese quote or any of its variations, the results aren’t quite as intense:</p><div><div><div><p><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jpn1.jpg" data-fancybox="group1" data-caption="Japanese search results for　うごきやすくっていいぜ (there were even fewer results if I used quotes and/or added the spaces found in the original line)"><img src="" data-src="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jpn1-1280x591.jpg" title="Japanese search results for　うごきやすくっていいぜ (there were even fewer results if I used quotes and/or added the spaces found in the original line)" alt="Japanese search results for　うごきやすくっていいぜ (there were even fewer results if I used quotes and/or added the spaces found in the original line)"/></a></p><p>Japanese search results for　うごきやすくっていいぜ (there were even fewer results if I used quotes and/or added the spaces found in the original line)</p></div><div><p><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jpn2.jpg" data-fancybox="group1" data-caption="Japanese search results using a variation of the original line that uses kanji - I also tried many other variations but with even fewer results"><img src="" data-src="https://legendsoflocalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jpn2-1280x622.jpg" title="Japanese search results using a variation of the original line that uses kanji - I also tried many other variations but with even fewer results" alt="Japanese search results using a variation of the original line that uses kanji - I also tried many other variations but with even fewer results"/></a></p><p>Japanese search results using a variation of the original line that uses kanji - I also tried many other variations but with even fewer results</p></div></div></div><p>Of course, search result comparisons don’t exactly prove how popular or beloved stuff can be among fans, but I thought I’d share my results anyway just for curiosity’s sake. Again, I’m not much of a <cite>Pokémon</cite> guru, so if anyone out there can shed more light on the popularity of this quote in Japan and in other countries, let me know in the comments or on Twitter!</p><h2 id="summary"><a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/a-look-at-pokemon-and-comfy-shorts/#summary" title="Link to this part">Summary <span></span></a></h2><p>For Japanese <cite>Pokémon</cite> players, this trainer’s line was a quirky yet logical statement, while the perceived randomness and phrasing of the translated line made it quirky and memorable for those who played the English version.</p><hr/><p>If you enjoyed this quick look at <em>Pokémon</em> translation differences, check out <a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/tag/pokemon-series/">all these other articles</a> I&#39;ve written too!</p></div></div>
