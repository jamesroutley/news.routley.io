    <h1>WriteFreely: Open source federated microblogging platform</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<h2>Create a minimalist blog</h2>
				<p>WriteFreely is built around writing. There&#39;s no news feed, notifications, or unnecessary <em>likes</em> or <em>claps</em> to take you away from your train of thought. You get a <a href="https://write.as/new" target="editor">distraction-free writing environment</a>, and readers can enjoy a <a href="https://blog.writefreely.org/" target="reading">clean reading experience</a>.</p>

				<h2>Publish to the fediverse</h2>
				<p>Reach outside your own site with federation via ActivityPub. WriteFreely lets anyone on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, Pleroma, or any ActivityPub-enabled service follow your blog, bookmark your posts, and share them with their followers. <a href="https://video.writeas.org/videos/watch/cc55e615-d204-417c-9575-7b57674cc6f3" onclick="showDemo(); return false;">See how it works</a>.</p>

				<h2>Easy on the eyes (and your server)</h2>
				<p>WriteFreely is written in Go (golang), so it runs anywhere and takes up very few resources â€” you can even run it on a Raspberry Pi! Installation is as easy as downloading a binary and a few supporting files, no other dependencies required.</p>
