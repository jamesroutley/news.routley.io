      <p>We&#39;ve barely scratched the surface of the Pi Zero 2&#39;s capabilities. [<a href="https://www.briandorey.com/post/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-external-antenna-mod" target="_blank" title="Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W external antenna mod" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brian Dorey</strong></a>] shows us how to hack your Pi&#39;s WiFi and improve its performance. A <strong>u.FL footprint</strong> can be discovered in line with the <span><strong>onboard WiFi antenna</strong></span>, implying that someone had to <span>connect an external antenna</span>. This is where [Brian] comes in, with a photo-rich article and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZqaKZLIqFg&amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video instruction</a> that will have you modifying your own Zero in no time.
