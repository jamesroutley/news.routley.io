          <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <!-- <br><br> -->
          <p> Creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars has always been a research hotspot, but there remains a great challenge under lightweight sparse view setups.
            In this paper, we propose Gaussian Head Avatar represented by controllable 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity head avatar modeling.
            We optimize the neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. 
            The two parts benefit each other, thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. 
            Furthermore, we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure.
            Experiments show our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods, achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions.
