    <h1>Fake CV lands top &#39;engineer&#39; in jail for 15 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>The man who had been chief engineer at South Africa’s state-owned passenger rail company has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for faking his qualifications.<!-- --></p><p>Once hailed for his successful career, Daniel Mthimkhulu was head of engineering at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) for five years - earning an annual salary of about 2.8m rand ($156,000; £119,000).<!-- --></p><p>On his CV, the 49-year-old claimed to have had several mechanical engineering qualifications, including a degree from South Africa’s respected Witwatersrand University as well as a doctorate from a German university.<!-- --></p><p>However, the court in Johannesburg heard that he had only completed his high-school education.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>“The sentence sends a strong message that the perpetrators of white-collar crime will not go unpunished,&#34; said Phindi Mjonondwane, spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).<!-- --></p><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61912737">Damning report exposes rampant SA corruption<!-- --></a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65671718">Load-shedding, poor management, corruption and sabotage<!-- --></a></li></ul><p>Mthimkhulu was arrested in July 2015 shortly after his web of lies began to unravel.<!-- --></p><p>He had started working at Prasa 15 years earlier, shooting up the ranks to become chief engineer, thanks to his fake qualifications.<!-- --></p><p>The court also heard how he had forged a job offer letter from a German company, which encouraged Prasa to increase his salary so the agency would not lose him.<!-- --></p><p>He was also at the forefront of a 600m rand deal to buy dozens of new trains from Spain, but they could not be used in South Africa as they were too high.<!-- --></p><p>“The court took into account the seriousness and prevalence of fraud, the significant financial loss to Prasa and Mthimkhulu’s betrayal of his employer’s trust,&#34; Ms Mjonondwane said.<!-- --></p><p>In an interview from 2019 with local broadcaster <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60SVjRO1O4">eNCA<!-- --></a>, Mthimkhulu admitted that he did not have a PhD.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;I failed to correct the perception that I have it.
