    <h1>Tom Davies has become a beloved icon of GeoGuessr</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>In April, 2013, a Swedish software engineer named Anton Wallén posted to Reddit. “Was fiddling around with backbone and Google maps API v3 and decided to make a small application,” he wrote. “Would appreciate your feedback/suggestions?” Wallén had just made GeoGuessr, a game that drops you at a random place in Google Street View and challenges you to guess where you are. The rules are simple: the closer the guess, the more points you get. You’re faced with a “seed” of five locations, each worth five thousand points, for a maximum possible prize of twenty-five thousand points and pub-quiz satisfaction.</p><p>GeoGuessr exerts a strange, slow-burning charm, turning aimless Google Earth globe-spinning into something halfway between a treasure hunt and a crossword. It exploded in popularity soon after release, and then once again last year, when many of us were trapped at home. The game’s appeal was correlated, or maybe in part caused, by the viral phenomenon of the GeoGuessr playthrough, in which a streamer would narrate their guesses and strategies, often reacting to the absurdity of a location (say, a comically featureless stretch of prairie) or the preternatural accuracy, or catastrophic failure, of a guess (nope, not Mongolia). One performance stood out: <a data-offer-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4guW7aYXc" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4guW7aYXc&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4guW7aYXc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a record-setting run</a> by a thirty-one-year-old Englishman named Tom Davies, better known as GeoWizard, who would become the one of Internet’s most famous GeoGuessr players.</p><p>Davies’s game begins with an image of a bustling urban street, with red dust spilling out from the sidewalks onto the pavement. The sky is overcast. Women are walking, loads balanced on their heads, and someone is selling household goods—umbrellas, a kettle—by the side of the road. Nearby fences are decked out with colorful signs. “Again in Ghana, I believe,” Davies says within seconds. In his soft West Midlands accent (he was born in Oxford, but grew up near Birmingham), Davies mentions a car seemingly Frankensteined from different-colored spare parts that’s turning through the intersection, apparently typical of Ghana. He also notes the yellow license plates, and, in one of his rare allusions to the inside baseball of GeoGuessr, the kind of clues that guessers call “meta,”  he notes the black tape wrapped around the roof rack of the Google Street View truck. He zooms in on the signs—he’s playing without moving up or down the street, to increase the difficulty—and finds one that mentions “Gyinyase, KSI.” “Does KSI stand for . . . Kumasi?” Davies wonders, in what, to the average viewer, will likely seem to be an astonishingly well-informed guess. “I think so.” He undercuts his own deftness by adding, “I’m not sure about that, by the way, but I think it’s worth looking for.” In the lower left corner, you can see that he’s got a perplexed look on his face; his brow is furrowed, and he’s biting his lower lip. He homes in on a street that seems right. “I’m gonna go for it,” he says. But then he holds himself back. “No, that’s the wrong attitude.” After a bit more looking, he gets it nearly right—2.2 miles away from the precise location. An impressive outing, for sure, but the next round is absurd. “Wow, wow—for God’s sake, wow!” Davies blurts out, admiring the scenic beachside village he’s landed in, using one his typically folksy exclamations (which alternate in his videos with earthy cursing). “I think this is Montenegro. I can’t help but think that,” he says, with laughable precision. “I’m going to go straight into a place in Montenegro that I think that this could be,” a little town called Risan. This time, he gets within just five yards.</p><p>Davies freely admits that he is no longer anything like the world’s best GeoGuessr. There’s a whole generation that came up after him and adopted a ruthlessly technical approach to the game, memorizing the varying morphology of <a data-offer-url="https://imgur.com/AJsiZF4" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://imgur.com/AJsiZF4&#34;}" href="https://imgur.com/AJsiZF4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baltic power poles</a>; <a data-offer-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFS_LjA6okQ" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFS_LjA6okQ&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFS_LjA6okQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">different cuts of men’s trousers</a> (helpful for distinguishing between India, where, one user says, they’re usually tight, and Pakistan, where they’re more likely to be baggy); or that slightly dubious-feeling “meta”—<a data-offer-url="https://geohints.com/Cars.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://geohints.com/Cars.html&#34;}" href="https://geohints.com/Cars.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the ghostly trace Google’s imaging equipment</a> leaves in each picture (you might scroll down to see the team of oxen that drew the camera on a cart in Madagascar, for example, or the silhouette of the camel that bore the technician on the desert sand in the U.A.E.); and even the varying resolutions, and orientations, of the different generations of Street View cameras (footage taken from a lower point-of-view, for example, usually means Japan or Switzerland). Over time, the game has evolved to challenge these “Moneyball”-style players, with speed runs and “blink” rounds that test a guesser’s ability to recognize a country after an <a data-offer-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-kIPKy3tJ4" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-kIPKy3tJ4&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-kIPKy3tJ4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">exposure</a> lasting just a second or a fraction of a second.</p><p>Davies is now old-school: he prefers to work with “vibes,” he told me. “Obviously, knowing some stuff like license plates, Southern Hemisphere sun versus Northern Hemisphere—things like that become obvious to you over time,” he explained. “But I think my learning process was a very slow one.” As opposed to the laser-like technical perfection of the very best players, such as ItsRC (a college student in Georgia who told me that a GeoWizard video was what turned him on to the game in 2018), Davies frequently shows himself making mistakes. Sometimes he gets the vibe all wrong.</p><p>Imperfection just within the bounds of relatability is part of what makes a GeoWizard video so appealing. Despite the seemingly rarified nature of the game, Davies is far from a geography expert. When he discovered GeoGuessr, he was working odd jobs—delivery driver, butcher, fishmonger, bartender—as he had since finishing high school with middling grades and little in the way of ambition. His younger brother’s friend sent him the game. “I played it and I was, like, ‘Oh, my god, this is—excuse the pun—right up my street!” It’s hard to resist the coincidence: the lost guy finds himself playing GeoGuessr.</p><p>What appears to be the <a data-offer-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNc5TOEAOEY" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNc5TOEAOEY&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNc5TOEAOEY" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">first GeoGuessr video</a> was uploaded to YouTube the month the game was officially released, and more or less predicted the genre: screen-shared detective work, with a commentary that explains decisions as they’re made, and responses when a guess is wildly off or perfectly right. Quickly, though, the GeoGuessr video became about high scores—somewhere between a brag and, for a passionate and skeptical online community, proof. (Videos are required to make it on <a data-offer-url="https://geotips.net/world-records/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://geotips.net/world-records/&#34;}" href="https://geotips.net/world-records/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the world leaderboard</a> for the game, hosted by the fan site GeoTips.) Davies, obsessed with GeoGuessr and eager for something new, noticed a “gap in the market” for GeoGuessr videos that showed perfect scores achieved in a “decent”—and comfortably watchable—time. And so he decided to fill it. In 2015, using the moniker GeoguessrWizard, Davies uploaded <a data-offer-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXcWb3ecouI" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXcWb3ecouI&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXcWb3ecouI" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a video of a perfect-score run</a> to YouTube, the GeoGuessr equivalent of a home run—but he narrated it like a geographical Jeremy Clarkson (an explicit influence, particularly later on), riffing on the “big, girthy junction” that starts off his seed, and, at once point, even letting out a laddish belch. Davies offered top flight play, but produced it in such a way as to be entertaining, not just forensic. The video gained him a small but respectable following, which only grew when he repeated the feat on the worldwide map the following year.</p></div></div></div></div>
