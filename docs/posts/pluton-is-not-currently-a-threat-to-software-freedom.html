    <h1>Pluton is not currently a threat to software freedom</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At CES this week, Lenovo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/01/pluton-microsofts-new-security-chip-will-finally-be-put-to-the-test/">announced</a> that their new Z-series laptops would ship with AMD processors that incorporate Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/11/17/meet-the-microsoft-pluton-processor-the-security-chip-designed-for-the-future-of-windows-pcs/">Pluton</a> security chip. There&#39;s a fair degree of cynicism around whether Microsoft have the interests of the industry as a whole at heart or not, so unsurprisingly people have voiced concerns about Pluton allowing for platform lock-in and future devices no longer booting non-Windows operating systems. Based on what we currently know, I think those concerns are understandable but misplaced.</p></div></div>
