<p data-block-key="3f0gd"><i>Sometimes different participant groups want different project velocities and rhythms. That’s cadence shear. Like when:</i></p><ul><li data-block-key="kod"><i>Most of your team is volunteer, but there’s a Google Summer of Code intern who’s working 35-40 hours per week for 3 months, and who needs faster turnaround on code reviews.</i></li><li data-block-key="fnjq9"><i>Some of your contributors are tied to the release cycle for a related organization/project (such as Debian releases), but some are not.</i></li><li data-block-key="2majd"><i>A few different companies, nonprofits, government agencies, or academic teams are maintaining and improving a tool together – but one of them is working way slower or way faster than everyone else.</i></li></ul><p data-block-key="dpler"><i>In general, cadence shear is a problem where different subsets of the team are attuned to different deadlines, or have different levels of urgency for project progress.</i></p><p data-block-key="a4117"><i>This is a problem of success. Congratulations: your open source project includes contributors with genuinely different incentives and from genuinely different contexts!</i></p><p data-block-key="d1eci"><i>Let’s talk about some of the participant configurations that you see in this situation – paid plus volunteers, volunteers plus time-limited paid, paid teams in a consortium, and volunteers with disparate deadline affiliations – and some approaches to learning and addressing everyone’s expectations.</i></p><p data-block-key="1sc88">The talk is prerecorded, and I&#39;ll be posting the text of the talk on my blog tomorrow; attend live to participate in Q&amp;A. Hope to see you there!</p>
