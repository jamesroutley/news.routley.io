    <h1>Map of Pontypandy in Fireman Sam</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
I want to introduce my children (small single digit ages) to tabletop-style role
playing games, but they’re a little too young for the full deal. Instead, we
have experimented with creating interactive stories where I give the children an
objective, I narrate but pause frequently to let them make choices, and then I
come up with consequences of those choices.
</p>

<p>
To keep it interesting, I’m trying to use settings they know from books and <abbr>tv</abbr>
shows. One of the settings we have been returning to frequently is the town of
Pontypandy from Fireman Sam.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, either I’m a terrible narrator, or my children still don’t have
enough verbal skills and short-term memory to engage with the adventure. They
grow bored and don’t really remember their earlier choices, so any long-term
consequences are meaningless.
</p>

<p>
I have been considering adding a map as a visual aid, but there are no maps
online of Pontypandy in its modern shape! So on a rainy day recently, we pulled
up a bunch of episodes of Fireman Sam on a laptop, took screenshots of the
in-show map segments, and stitched them together into a larger map. It had to be
a very sloppy job in order to not lose the interest of the children, but they
enjoyed most of the process.

</p>

<p>
As you can tell, we have not figured out how the northern parts of the country
connect to the town. We also discovered a few inconsistencies where magnified
helicopter views disagree with the satellite-style imagery we’ve used for the
above image.<span><sup>1</sup> For exampe, the road branching northwest from the northern road
away from the main fire station seems to take a different path – and be
surrounded with buildings – in one of the detail maps we found.</span>
</p>

<p>
But we took some liberties and converted this into a paper map.<span><sup>2</sup> The grid is
not meaningful; it was just to make it easier to copy the map faithfully from
Gimp. In the stitched image, we configured the Gimp grid lines to be 100 pixels
apart. This, in combination with the A4 paper size, happened to perfectly match
one of the scales on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_ruler#Architect&#39;s_scale">architect’s scale</a>, which made the job easier.</span>
</p>

</p>

<p>
There are some details remaining, and we will need labels to remember what some
of the more generic locations are. Maybe to help the children we can even print
out screenshots of each location as it is rendered in the show? But that is for
later. This we’re sharing just in case someone else in the world has had the
same idea but does not want to do all of the stitching work.
</p>

<p>
Or, better yet, if someone has done the stitching work and done it better than
us, and want to share their results with us.
