<p>TfL has released a batch of documents that show almost every underground station in glorious 3D format.</p>
<p>They are technically axonometric diagrams, which is 3D-like, but not to scale, which becomes obvious when you see some of the vertiginous descents offered on some stairs and escalators.</p>
<p>In total, some 120 stations with underground tunnels are represented in this motherlode of tube and map geekery. Iâ€™ve removed the redacted black blobs that are scatted over the originals, and generally cleaned them up a bit</p>
<p>To make displaying 124 large maps easier, I have broken them down into 5 pages.</p>
<p>Click on the drawings to enlarge them.</p>
<p>Note, the diagrams are indicative of layouts, and are not updated with changes (temporary or permanent).</p>

<p>SUPPORT THIS WEBSITE</p>

<div>

<p>This website has been running now for over a decade, and while advertising revenue contributes to funding the website, it doesn&#39;t cover the costs. That is why I have set up a facility with <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide">DonorBox</a> where you can contribute to the costs of the website and time invested in writing and research for the news articles.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very similar to the way The Guardian and many smaller websites are now seeking to generate an income in the face of rising costs and declining advertising.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s a one-off donation or a regular giver, every additional support goes a long way to covering the running costs of this website, and keeping you regularly topped up doses of Londony news and facts.</p>

<p>If you like what you read on here, then please support the website <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
