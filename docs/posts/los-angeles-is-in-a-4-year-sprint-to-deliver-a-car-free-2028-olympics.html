    <h1>Los Angeles is in a 4-year sprint to deliver a car-free 2028 Olympics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>With the Olympic torch <a href="https://swimswam.com/leon-marchand-extinguishes-olympic-cauldron-at-closing-ceremony-in-paris/">extinguished in Paris</a>, all eyes are turning to <a href="https://la28.org/en.html">Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympics</a>. </p>

<p>The host city has promised that the next Summer Games will be “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/los-angeles-olympics-traffic-transport.html">car-free</a>.” </p>

<p>For people who know Los Angeles, this seems overly optimistic. The <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/labarometer-mobility-in-los-angeles-survey/">car remains king</a> in LA, despite growing public transit options.</p>

<p>When LA hosted the Games in 1932, it had <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2024-08-14/l-a-promises-a-car-free-olympics-ill-believe-it-when-i-see-it-essential-california">an extensive public transportation system</a>, with buses and an <a href="https://ladot.lacity.gov/sites/default/files/documents/transportation-topics-and-tales-milestones-in-transportation-history-in-southern-california.pdf">extensive network of electric streetcars</a>. Today, the trolleys are long gone; riders say city buses <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2022/09/23/report-on-dirty-bus-stops-and-unreliable-service-draws-reactions-from-la-metro-board-members/">don’t come on schedule, and bus stops are dirty</a>. What happened? </p>

<p>This question fascinates me because I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-zagorsky-58a90825a">business professor</a> who studies why society abandons and then sometimes returns to certain technologies, such as <a href="https://theconversation.com/vinyl-record-sales-keep-spinning-and-spinning-with-no-end-in-sight-201444">vinyl records</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/rise-and-fall-of-the-landline-143-years-of-telephones-becoming-more-accessible-and-smart-113295">landline phones</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/americans-leave-a-huge-chunk-of-change-at-airport-security-checkpoints-heres-what-it-means-for-the-debate-over-getting-rid-of-pennies-229958">metal coins</a>. The demise of electric streetcars in Los Angeles and attempts to bring them back today vividly demonstrate the costs and challenges of such revivals.</p>

<h2>Riding the Red and Yellow Cars</h2>

<p>Transportation is a critical priority in any city, but especially so in Los Angeles, which has been a sprawling metropolis from the start. </p>

<p>In the early 1900s, railroad magnate <a href="https://huntington.org/verso/huntington-futurist">Henry Huntington</a>, who owned vast tracts of land around LA, started subdividing his holdings into small plots and building homes. In order to attract buyers, he also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/25/story-cities-los-angeles-great-american-streetcar-scandal">built a trolley system</a> that whisked residents from outlying areas to jobs and shopping downtown.</p>

<p>By the 1930s, Los Angeles had a vibrant public transportation network, with over 1,000 miles of electric streetcar routes, operated by two companies: <a href="https://www.pacificelectric.org/pacific-electric/pacific-electric-maps/">Pacific Electric Railway</a>, with its “Red Cars,” and <a href="https://hdl.huntington.org/digital/collection/p15150coll4/id/16360/">Los Angeles Railway</a>, with its “Yellow Cars.”</p>

<p>The system wasn’t perfect by any means. Many people felt that streetcars were inconvenient and also unhealthy when they were jammed with riders. Moreover, streetcars were slow because they had to share the road with automobiles. As auto usage climbed and roads became congested, travel times increased. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, many Angelenos rode the streetcars – especially during World War II, when gasoline was rationed and automobile plants shifted to producing military vehicles.</p>

<h2>Demise of public transit</h2>

<p>The end of the war marked the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8562007/streetcar-history-demise">end of the line for streetcars</a>. The war effort had transformed oil, tire and car companies into behemoths, and these industries <a href="https://www.history.com/news/post-world-war-ii-boom-economy">needed new buyers</a> for goods from the massive factories they had built for military production. Civilians and returning soldiers were tired of rationing and war privations, and they wanted to spend money on goods such as cars.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/trafficplans/1948_passenger_loading_standards_analysis_effect_rail_motor_coach_lines.pdf">years of heavy usage</a> during the war, Los Angeles’ streetcar system needed an expensive capital upgrade. But in the mid-1940s, most of the system was sold to a company called National City Lines, which was <a href="https://www.electricvehiclesnews.com/Footer/History/Companies/National_City_Lines.html">partly owned by the carmaker General Motors</a>, the oil companies Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum, and the Firestone tire company.</p>

<p>These powerful forces had no incentive to maintain or improve the old electric streetcar system. National City ripped up tracks and replaced the streetcars with buses that were built by General Motors, used Firestone tires and ran on gasoline. </p>

<p>There is a long-running academic debate over whether <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/%7Ebrusso/Snell1974_645.rtf">self-serving corporate interests</a> purposely <a href="https://doi.org/10.30845/ijbht">killed LA’s streetcar system</a>. Some researchers argue that the system <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp0kb">would have died on its own</a>, like many <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015047411684&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=368">other streetcar networks around the world</a>. </p>

<p>The controversy even <a href="https://laist.com/shows/take-two/who-killed-las-streetcars-according-to-who-framed-roger-rabbit">spilled over into pop culture</a> in the 1988 movie “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>,” which came down firmly on the conspiracy side.</p>

<p>What’s undisputed is that, starting in the mid-1940s, powerful social forces transformed Los Angeles so that commuters had only two choices: drive or take a public bus. As a result, LA became so choked with traffic that it often took hours to cross the city. </p>

<p>In 1990, the Los Angeles Times reported that people were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-17-mn-278-story.html">putting refrigerators, desks and televisions in their cars</a> to cope with getting stuck in horrendous traffic. A swath of movies, from “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/">Falling Down</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rked3iy4k-w">Clueless</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CVfTd-_qbc">La La Land</a>,” have featured the next-level challenge of driving in LA.</p>



<p>Traffic was also a concern when LA hosted the 1984 Summer Games, but the <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/19m6d5m4">Games went off smoothly</a>. Organizers convinced over 1 million people to ride buses, and they <a href="https://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/sr/sr212/sr212-017.pdf">got many trucks to drive during off-peak</a> hours. The 2028 games, however, <a href="https://www.teamgb.com/competitions/los-angeles-2028/5bdTP5OlgfIYQMzy7UsC9g">will have roughly 50% more</a> <a href="https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/los-angeles-1984">athletes competing</a>, which means thousands more coaches, family, friends and spectators. So simply dusting off plans from 40 years ago won’t work.</p>

<h2>Olympic transportation plans</h2>

<p>Today, Los Angeles is slowly rebuilding a more robust public transportation system. In addition to buses, it now has <a href="https://www.metro.net/about/facts-glance/">four light-rail lines</a> – the new name for electric streetcars – and two subways. Many follow <a href="https://thesource.metro.net/2013/08/16/then-now-streetcars-along-the-crenshawlax-line-alignment-in-the-mid-1950s-compared-to-those-places-today/">the same routes that electric trolleys once traveled</a>. Rebuilding this network is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-10-26/los-angeles-is-on-a-subway-building-tear-will-riders-follow">costing the public billions</a>, since the old system was completely dismantled.</p>

<p>Three key improvements are planned for the Olympics. First, LA’s airport terminals will be <a href="https://www.metro.net/projects/airport-metro-connector/">connected to the rail system</a>. Second, the Los Angeles organizing committee is planning heavily on using buses to move people. It will do this by reassigning some lanes away from cars and <a href="https://abc7.com/post/2028-olympics-los-angeles-car-free-zones-remote-work-being-explored-ways-address-traffic/15186778/">making them available for 3,000 more buses</a>, which will be borrowed from other locales.</p>

<p>Finally, there are plans to permanently increase bicycle lanes around the city. However, one major initiative, <a href="https://www.metro.net/projects/lariverpath/">a bike path along the Los Angeles River</a>, is still under an environmental review that may not be completed by 2028. </p>



<h2>Car-free for 17 days</h2>

<p>I expect that <a href="https://la28.org/en/faqs/what-will-transportation-look-like-for-the-olympic-and-paralympi.html#articleIntro">organizers will pull off a car-free Olympics</a>, simply by making driving and parking conditions so awful during the Games that people are forced to take public transportation to sports venues around the city. After the Games end, however, most of LA is likely to quickly revert to its car-centric ways. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://abc7.com/post/2028-olympics-los-angeles-car-free-zones-remote-work-being-explored-ways-address-traffic/15186778/">Casey Wasserman</a>, chair of the <a href="https://la28.org/en.html">LA 2028</a> organizing committee, recently put it: “The unique thing about Olympic Games is for 17 days you can fix a lot of problems when you can set the rules – for traffic, for fans, for commerce – than you do on a normal day in Los Angeles.”</p>
