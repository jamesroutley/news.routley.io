    <h1>What’s in a name?</h1>
    
    <img src="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/02/IMG_9943_VSCO.JPG" alt="What&#x2019;s in a name?"><p>Good evening, defenders of soup, chili historians, bean aficionados, stew lovers everywhere. Welcome to A Newsletter (after dark). I hope you&#x2019;re staying warm and that the two-weeks worth of trash is being collected from on top of the ice mountain outside your apartment (this is a cry for help).</p><p>Sometimes, the name of a recipe comes to be before I&#x2019;ve ever even made it. The title occupying a very clear space in my brain, where I think of nothing else until I actually make it and find out if it&#x2019;s as good as I think it will be.&#xA0;</p><p>Such is the case with...Brothy Chili.&#xA0;</p><p><em>*dramatic music*</em></p><p>But before the recipe, in case you care about the inner workings of my little brain and why things happen the way they do (not much happens by accident, I&#x2019;ll say that), a little bit about the name here*.</p><p><em>*This was not what today&#x2019;s newsletter was originally going to be about, but I got&#x2026;let&#x2019;s call it&#x2026;&#x201C;inspired.&#x201D;&#xA0;</em></p><p>If you&#x2019;re like me, maybe you&#x2019;ve spent a disproportionate amount of your tender existence wondering aloud and to others: When does a stew become a chili? When is a soup thick enough to become a stew? What are brothy beans if not bean soup?&#xA0;</p><p>While of course I have answers to all of these questions and would happily face anyone on a debate stage to defend my positions, I&#x2019;m not sure even my most definitive, ironclad answer would appease any contrarian hell-bent on disagreeing with me. Public arguments are, after all, simply grist for the mill.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-a5fe60b5-7c6e-4cfc-95bc-e1152b56d127.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="What&#x2019;s in a name?" loading="lazy" width="491" height="271"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Me, defending my honor. </em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Naming recipes is important (I know this more than most). It describes the recipe,  lets the reader know what to expect and, hopefully, entices them to make it. Not unlike a dish on a menu at a restaurant, it also, ideally, is accurately representative of what you end up getting. 8 times out of 10, if I&#x2019;m disappointed at a restaurant, it&#x2019;s rarely because the thing doesn&#x2019;t taste good&#x2013; it&#x2019;s that the advertised expectation does not meet my reality. I imagine someone making a recipe at home would feel the same way if something described as &#x201C;lemony,&#x201D; has an average amount of lemon in it. Not so &#x201C;lemony,&#x201D; I guess!</p><p>Naming recipes is also personal. Sure, it&#x2019;s marketing, but in a perfect world it also conveys perspective, personality and intent.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-3686b180-d18c-45cf-aaca-83b34dab779f.png" class="kg-image" alt="What&#x2019;s in a name?" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="690" srcset="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/data-src-image-3686b180-d18c-45cf-aaca-83b34dab779f.png 600w, https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/data-src-image-3686b180-d18c-45cf-aaca-83b34dab779f.png 1000w, https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/02/data-src-image-3686b180-d18c-45cf-aaca-83b34dab779f.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From a ChatGPT commercial demonstrating in real time why I should be nervous for my job, although I&#x2019;m trying to think of what someone would &#x201C;marinate something in saffron&#x201D; for three days. One day I&#x2019;ll tell you about the guy who brined me a pork chop overnight for our second date. It said: &#x201C;I like you enough to sleep with you, but not enough to ever see you again.&#x201D; </em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Let&#x2019;s take this one: <strong>Brothy Chili with Tomatillo and Greens</strong>.&#xA0;</p><p>Every day, thanks to our generous overlords at Meta, someone new on the internet discovers me on Instagram (hi guys). This means someone stumbles upon a photo or video I post without knowing (or caring) who I am, which is fine. They see a photo of a bowl of stuff. Yum! And then they see the caption: Brothy Chili? BOO! Commence unpleasant infighting about what a soup is, what a chili is, accusations that this is not one or the other (meanwhile, the recipe hasn&apos;t even been published yet...). What a beautiful expression of free speech and expansion of community! Sort of!&#xA0;</p><p>Anyway, I did feel the need to devote my afternoon explaining how I got there, lest anyone accuse me of flippantly naming things without cause or reason. Whoever said it&#x2019;s not cool to care has never met a Virgo with a few hours to spare. I care! I care SO MUCH you wouldn&#x2019;t believe, and sadly now that means you have to read all this STUFF.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>OTHER THINGS I COULD HAVE NAMED THIS RECIPE AND WHY I DIDN&#x2019;T, FOLLOWED BY WHAT I NAMED THIS RECIPE AND WHY I DID</strong></p><p><strong>Chicken Soup with Tomatillo and Beans&#xA0;</strong></p><p>If you read this recipe name you&#x2019;d probably think &quot;Chicken Soup, yum, I love Chicken Soup.&quot; Then, if you make this, I think you&apos;d be at best confused and at worst, very disappointed. Is there chicken? As-written, yes (but you can use a different meat). Is it soup? That seems to be a personal question, but okay, let&#x2019;s say yes. But &#x201C;Chicken Soup&#x201D; it is not. Try again.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Bean Stew with Chicken and Tomatillos&#xA0;</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s not really thick enough to be a stew IMO, and there aren&#x2019;t enough beans to qualify as the lead here. Also &#x201C;with chicken&#x201D; sounds bad to me? Next.</p><p><strong>Spicy Bean Soup with Tomatillo&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Objectively a boring says-nothing name. &#x201C;Spicy&#x201D; also a little performative here. No thanks!&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Quick Chicken Chili with Tomatillo and Greens</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Quick Chicken Chili&#x201D; alliteration sending a shiver down my spine. It&#x2019;s giving Southern Living 2012 (no shade to SL, more shade to 2012).&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Green Chili with Chicken</strong></p><p>Goes to New Mexico once! Just kidding, I&#x2019;ve been a bunch of times. Green chiles from New Mexico are a thing, and so is Green Chili. It&#x2019;s a very specific dish, and even though IMO, yes, this is a (brothy) chili that is green, it&#x2019;s <em>not</em> Green Chili, and I don&#x2019;t need that kind of heat. Pass.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Brothy Chili with Tomatillo and Greens</strong></p><p>Brothy = sets you up from the very start that it will be brothy, so you don&#x2019;t panic and think &#x201C;wait, why is my chili so&#x2026;.brothy&#x2026;&#x201D;. Okay, I&#x2019;m listening&#x2026;</p><p>Chili = indicates it will have both beans and meat, so neither has to be mentioned specifically. Also, hints at spiciness and a bit of cumin perhaps. Both true! Nice.&#xA0;</p><p>Tomatillo &amp; Greens = the predominant other two ingredients you need to know are present, as they make up the bulk of the pot. This recipe would not be as good without either so it&#x2019;s important to mention up front. We did it, Joe!&#xA0;</p><p><strong>BONUS ROUND: ANOTHER THING THAT HAS OF COURSE CROSSED MY MIND</strong></p><p>Given the two ways I could see this going:</p><ol><li>I call this chili or use the word chili (minus the word brothy)&#xA0;<ol><li>Someone says THAT&#x2019;S NOT CHILI, IT&apos;S TOO BROTHY</li><li>Someone says THAT&#x2019;S NOT CHILI, CHILI DOESN&#x2019;T HAVE BEANS</li><li>Someone says THAT&#x2019;S NOT CHILI, [INSERT IMPASSIONED YET EASILY INVALIDATED REASON HERE]</li></ol></li><li>I don&#x2019;t use the word chili at all in the title&#xA0;<ol><li>Someone says THAT&#x2019;S JUST CHILI BUT BROTHY</li><li>Someone says THAT&#x2019;S JUST A GREEN CHILI</li></ol></li></ol><p>I choose:</p><ol start="3"><li>NAMING THE DISH WHAT I THINK IS BEST BECAUSE WHO CARES AND ULTIMATELY, IT DOESN&apos;T MATTER WHAT YOU CALL IT AS LONG AS YOU MAKE IT, SINCE IT&#x2019;S VERY DELICIOUS AND I THINK YOU&#x2019;LL ENJOY IT<ol><li>I spend the afternoon writing this ridiculous thing which might lead someone to ask: Are you okay?<ol><li>I&#x2019;m good, I promise!!&#xA0;</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular" data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/media/2026/02/IMG_9946_VSCO_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail>
