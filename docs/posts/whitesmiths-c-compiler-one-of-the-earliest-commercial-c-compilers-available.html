    <h1>Whitesmiths C compiler: One of the earliest commercial C compilers available</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">

<p dir="auto">The original Whitesmiths compiler was released in 1978 and compiled a version of C similar
to that accepted by Version 6 Unix. It was an entirely new implementation, borrowing no code from Unix.</p>
<p dir="auto">When Whitesmiths released version 3.0 of its C compiler in 1985 it supported the emerging ANSI C standard.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Whitesmiths compiler had code generators for DEC PDP-11, Intel 8080/Zilog Z80, Intel 8086, Motorola MC68000,
DEC VAX-11, IBM System/370 and IBM System/36. It was commonly used as a cross compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">The company&#39;s president from 1978 to 1988 was P. J. Plauger.</p>

<p dir="auto">As the Whitesmiths C compilers are a very important contribution to
the development of the use of the C language, I think that it is important
that this software is not lost for the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">I recieved an e-mail reply from P.J. Plauger on 3 Apr 2021 where he is positive to
making the compiler available for download.</p>
<p dir="auto">&lt;pjp&gt;</p>
<p dir="auto">I own all rights to the Whitesmiths C compiler. if you want to go to the trouble
to package it so that it can be downloaded from such a site, II&#39;ll be happy to
supply you with a letter giving limited rights to use it at no cost, at least for
non-commerecial purposes, provided you supply me with a copy of the
package you make.</p>
<p dir="auto">Glad you&#39;re still active after all these decades. I am too, but definitely slowed
down by age.</p>
<p dir="auto">Best regards,</p>
<p dir="auto">P.J. Plauger</p>
<p dir="auto">&lt;/pjp&gt;</p>
<p dir="auto">I have tried to get in contact with him to confirm that it is ok to put the
C compiler in a public repository, but unfortunately I have not got any answer yet.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Whitesmiths C Compiler for CP/M-80 Edition 2.2 in binary format is in the &#34;ccpm80_v22_bin&#34; directory.
The manuals for Edition 2.2 compilers are in the &#34;compiler_v22_doc&#34; directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Whitesmiths C Cross Compiler an a MS-DOS host for IBM Systerm/36 Version 3.1 in binary format is in the &#34;cx36_v31_bin&#34; directory. A QEMU disk image with MS-DOS where thw compiler is installed is also in this directory.
The manuals for this compiler are in the &#34;compiler_s36_v31_doc&#34; directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">The source code for the CP/M-80 Compiler Edition 2.2 and Makefiles to build it are available in the &#34;c_compiler_v22_src&#34; directory. The source should be for edition 2.2 but there might be some source coming from other releases. The intention is to add more hosts and targets to this build environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Manuals for the Whitesmiths/COSMIC C Cross Compiler Version 3.32 for target Z80 is in the &#34;compiler_z80_v332_doc&#34; directory. Eventually also the compiler will be added to this repository.</p>
