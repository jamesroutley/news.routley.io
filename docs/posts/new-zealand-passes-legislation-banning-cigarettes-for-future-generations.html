By 2050, for example, 40-year-olds will be too young to buy cigarettes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Health Minister Ayesha Verrall, who introduced the bill, said it was a step &#34;towards a smoke-free future&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Thousands of people will live longer, healthier lives and the health system will be NZ$5 billion (US$3.2 billion) better off from not needing to treat the illnesses caused by smoking,&#34; Dr Verrall said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>New Zealand&#39;s smoking rate is already at historic lows, with just 8% of adults smoking daily according to <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/annual-update-key-results-2021-22-new-zealand-health-survey">government statistic released in November</a> - down from 9.4% last year.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is hoped that the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_125245/smokefree-environments-and-regulated-products-smoked-tobacco">Smokefree Environments Bill</a> will reduce that number to less than 5% by 2025, with the eventual aim of eliminating the practice altogether.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The bill is also designed to limit the number of retailers able to sell smoked tobacco products to 600 nationwide - down from 6,000 currently - and reduce nicotine levels in products to make them less addictive.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It means nicotine will be reduced to non-addictive levels and communities will be free from the proliferation and clustering of retailers who target and sell tobacco products in certain areas,&#34; Dr Verrall said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She added that the legislation could close the life expectancy between Maori and non-Maori citizens. The overall smoking rate for Maori citizens is at 19.9% - down from last year&#39;s figure of 22.3%.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The new legislation does not ban vape products, which have become far more popular among younger generations than cigarettes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Critics of the bill - including the ACT party which holds 10 seats in parliament - have warned that the policy could fuel a black market in tobacco products and kill off small shops.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;No one wants to see people smoke, but the reality is, some will and Labour&#39;s nanny state prohibition is going to cause problems,&#34; said ACT Deputy Leader Brooke van Velden.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
