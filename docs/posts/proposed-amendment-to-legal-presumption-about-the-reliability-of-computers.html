<p>I am grateful to the journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-webb-8b2b783a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Webb</a>, who specialises in data protection, for alerting me to <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill</a>, currently going through the House of Lords.</p>



<p>It concerns the legal presumption that “mechanical instruments” (which seems to be taken to include computer networks) are working properly if they look to the user like they’re working properly. This has come in for quite a kicking in recent years. I was <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first alerted to it in 2013</a> by the barrister Stephen Mason. </p>



<p>Mason has spent longer than a decade telling anyone who will listen it is a deeply flawed legal presumption. <a href="https://read.uolpress.co.uk/read/3a219939-14d3-45c9-9fe0-9b42298ac587/section/0f113452-78ad-4c82-b28f-08cff1877036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here he sets out his reasoning</a>. Mason has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/update-law-on-computer-evidence-to-avoid-horizon-repeat-ministers-urged" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won some influential supporters</a> along the way, including Lord (James) Arbuthnot who has also spent longer than a decade campaigning on behalf of Subpostmasters affected by the Post Office scandal.</p>



<p>Although the “mechanical instruments” presumption has never, to the best of my knowledge, been quoted in any civil or criminal proceedings involving a Subpostmaster, it has been said to effectively reverse the burden of proof on anyone who might be convicted using digital evidence. </p>



<p>The logic being if the courts are going to assume a computer was working fine at the time an offence allegedly occurred because it looked like it was working fine, it is then down to the defendant to prove that it was <em>not</em> working fine. This can be extremely difficult to do (per the Seema Misra/Lee Castleton cases).  </p>



<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the amendment proposed</a> by Lord Arbuthnot and others. I am grateful to Tom for bringing it to my attention. It says:</p>



<p>After Clause 132, insert the following new Clause – </p>



<p>“<strong>Reliability of computer-based evidence</strong></p>



<p>(1) Electronic evidence produced by or derived from a computer, device or computer system (separately or together “system”) is admissible as evidence in any proceedings –</p>



<p>(a) where that electronic evidence and the reliability of the system that produced it or from which it is derived are not challenged;</p>

<p>(2) Rules of Court must provide that electronic evidence sought to be relied upon by a party in any proceedings may be challenged by another party as to its admissibility.</p>



<p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), Rules of Court must provide for the circumstances in which the Court may be satisfied that the admissibility of electronic evidence cannot reasonably be challenged.</p>



<p>(4) When determining whether a system is reliable for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) the matters that may be taken into account include –</p>



<p>(a) any instructions or rules of the system that apply to its operation;</p>



<p>(5) For the purposes of this section – </p>



<p>“<em>computer</em>” means any device capable of performing mathematical or logical instructions;</p>
