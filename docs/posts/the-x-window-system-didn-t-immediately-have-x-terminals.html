    <h1>The X Window System didn&#39;t immediately have X terminals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The X Window System didn&#39;t immediately have X terminals</h2>

</div><div><p>For a while, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_terminal">X terminals</a>
were a reasonably popular way to give people comparatively inexpensive
X desktops. These X terminals relied on X&#39;s network transparency
so that only the X server had to run on the X terminal itself, with
all of your terminal windows and other programs running on a server
somewhere and just displaying on the X terminal. For a long time,
using a big server and a lab full of X terminals was significantly
cheaper than setting up a lab full of actual workstations (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/MarchOfTheCheap">until
inexpensive and capable PCs showed up</a>).
Given that X started with network transparency and X terminals are
so obvious, you might be surprised to find out that X didn&#39;t start
with them.</p>

<p>In the early days, X ran on workstations. Some of them were diskless
workstations, and on some of them (especially the diskless ones),
you would log in to a server somewhere to do a lot of your more
heavy duty work. But they were full workstations, with a full local
Unix environment and you expected to run your window manager and
other programs locally even if you did your real work on servers.
Although probably some people who had underpowered workstations
sitting around experimented with only running the X server locally,
with everything else done remotely (except perhaps the window
manager).</p>

<p>The first X terminals arrived only once X was reasonably well
established as the successful cross-vendor Unix windowing system.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Computing_Devices">NCD</a>,
who I suspect were among the first people to make an X terminal,
was founded only in 1987 and of course didn&#39;t immediately ship a
product (it may have shipped its first product in <a href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/NCD_NCD19">1989</a>).  One
indication of the delay in X terminals is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDM_(display_manager)">XDM</a> was only
released with X11R3, in October of 1988. You technically didn&#39;t
need XDM to have an X terminal, but it made life much easier, so
its late arrival is a sign that X terminals didn&#39;t arrive much
before then.</p>

<p>(It&#39;s quite possible that the possibility for an &#39;X terminal&#39; was
on people&#39;s minds even in the early days of X. The Bell Labs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> was a
&#39;graphical terminal&#39; that had papers written and published about
it sometime in 1983 or 1984, and the Blit was definitely known in
various universities and so on. Bell Labs even gave people a few
of them, which is part of how I wound up using one for a while.
Sadly I&#39;m not sure what happened to it in the end, although by now
it would probably be a historical artifact.)</p>

<p>(This entry was prompted by <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAndGNOMESystemdThoughts">a comment on a recent entry of
mine</a>.)</p>

<p>PS: <a href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Category:1989">A number of people seem to have introduced X terminals
in 1989</a>;
I didn&#39;t spot any in 1988 or earlier.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: Using an X terminal without XDM</h3>

<p>If you didn&#39;t have XDM available or didn&#39;t want to have to rely on
it, you could give your X terminal the ability to open up a local
terminal window that ran a telnet client. To start up an X environment,
people would telnet into their local server, set $DISPLAY (or have
it automatically set by the site&#39;s login scripts), and start at
least their window manager by hand. This required your X terminal
to not use any access control (at least when you were doing the
telnet thing), but strong access control wasn&#39;t exactly an X terminal
feature in the first place.</p>
