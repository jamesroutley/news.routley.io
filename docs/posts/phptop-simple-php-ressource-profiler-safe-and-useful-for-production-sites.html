  <p>Over at Michael Atkins’ blog, he’s released a <a href="https://allthingsatkins.com/blog/2025/06/01/calendar-of-song-statement/">lovely artist’s statement on Calendar of Song</a>, a new (and old) project I’ve helped to get working over the years. Through various tech stacks, the basic premise has stayed the same: Michael picks a song of the day, usually highlighting some lyrical relevance or historical coincidence, and some Parker tech “publishes” it.</p>

<p>I’ve helped Michael build and maintain his site over the years because I love reading his writing, and the short captions that accompany these songs are no different. And besides, he pulls from such a wide variety of music, the playlist itself is a great tour across genres, styles, and traditions.</p>

<p>Since we deployed the <a href="https://allthingsatkins.com/calendar">Calendar of Song</a>, I’ve added it to my phone’s home screen, and tune in each day when I’ve got a quiet moment. It’s been nice.</p>

<p>His statement really captures the project better than I can, but I want to drill down just a bit on his use of the word “site-specific,” which is (both) a great pun and a pithy distillation of the some of the motivation behind my implementation decisions.</p>

<p>The first iteration of the Calendar of Song was (what else?) a Twitter bot, where its atomic unit was an individual post, in a format designed to obliterate context. For the viewer, a Calendar of Song update in that era appeared under a headline, over a shitpost, between selfies and memes and reaction gifs. As the algorithmic timeline gained purchase, it lost even the excuse of simultaneity.</p>

<p>Today’s Calendar of Song is a different beast altogether. Like a tear-off desk calendar, the only context is: today. There is no “previous post” or “see more” or “index,” just the song Michael has picked, and a few words about it. It was fun to build to that spec, especially within the constraints of his (static) site and the delightfully janky CMS I’ve set up for him.</p>

<p>You might describe it as eschewing the promise of the massively parallel for a more serial experience. In that way, from a user experience perspective, it’s as influenced by Wordle as it is the more erudite art antecedents that Michael highlights.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://allthingsatkins.com/calendar">go give it a listen</a>. And if you like what you hear, see you again tomorrow.</p>
