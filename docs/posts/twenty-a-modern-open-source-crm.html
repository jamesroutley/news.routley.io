    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I built &amp; deployed <a href="https://covid.alangerber.us/">my first useful webapp</a> over the past week. A friend in with a background in public health teed up a perfectly-sized intro project, a tool to check extended COVID test expiration dates without <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list">trawling through PDFs on the FDA website</a>. I’ve been a software engineer for years and have wanted to learn how to build frontend UIs for a while, after realizing the relative chaos and churn in that field during the early 2010s seems to have been resolved and the toolchain seems pretty mature.</p><h2 id="starting-the-project">Starting the project</h2><p>I had heard good things about the <a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js framework</a>, and digging a little deeper indicated it supported static websites and server-side rendering, perfect for a tool that provides a UI to filter through into data exported from a spreadsheet.</p><p>I started by working through the <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app">tutorial project</a> with the hope that I could adapt it to build a single-page form, but it turned out to be a blog without Typescript support, and thus not easy to adapt to my purposes. I still learned a lot of useful concepts about <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/pre-rendering">pre-rendering and static generation</a> that helped me decide where in the framework to do my CSV processing at build-time.</p><p>Since I realized my project would be form-based, I went looking for a useful component library that offered a ‘combobox’ component useful for filtering data. I found <a href="https://mantine.dev/">Mantine</a>, an open-source project with good Next.js and Typescript support and nice combobox options and datepickers.</p><h2 id="building-the-project">Building the project</h2><p>I <a href="https://mantine.dev/guides/next/">started a new project from scratch per the Mantine instructions</a>, even though they advised me to use their template. I should have used their template, because it came with a lot of useful features like testing prebuilt for me that I ended up laboriously porting from the template into my project. Whoops. I learned a decent amount about Next.js configuration conventions from that process, however.</p><p>I wrote a function code to process COVID test data from a CSV export from a spreadsheet compiled by my friend, and called it in <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props"><code>getStaticProps</code></a> to populate the index page with the test data.</p><p>Then I browsed Mantine components and found that <a href="https://mantine.dev/core/select/"><code>Select</code></a> seemed like a good fit to dig into the test data, because it has a searchable mode that allows users to filter a big dropdown by typing in parts of the term they’re looking for.</p><p>I also tried &amp; abandoned the <a href="https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/">Datepicker</a> for expiration dates after realizing that Select was a better match for that too, but it’s a very nice component.</p><p>Then I used the <code>onChange</code> prop of Mantine components &amp; React’s <a href="https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory"><code>useState</code> hook</a> to implement filtration logic as the form is filled, and to provide an updated expiration dat upon form completion.</p><h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2><p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/deploying-a-static-site-with-netlify">Netlify</a> to deploy at the advice of another friend and because it has a generous free tier. It has an extensive &amp; simple GitHub integration that provides a ton of useful CI/CD features like automatic preview deployments for PRs. Good job to them, the tool is a pleasure to use.</p><h2 id="challenges-overcome">Challenges overcome</h2><p>I’d done a bit of frontend at various jobs before to pitch in, so I know a bit about Javascript and Typescript and React. I also spent some time learning Typescript better via <a href="https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics">Execute Program</a>. So my main challenge was navigating the huge Javascript/Typescript ecosystem, and building something useful, and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react">internalizing React’s programming model</a> well enough to be able to troubleshoot my application effectively.</p></div></div>
