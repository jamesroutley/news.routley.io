               <p>Ten times stronger than steel, nearly half the weight of aluminum, far stiffer than
                  fiberglass—carbon fiber carries a package of advantages, making it a preferred material
                  for use in luxury sedans and Formula One racecars alike.
               </p>
               
               <p>But it still needs perfecting to become economical for mass market vehicles, according
                  to National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) scientist Nicholas Rorrer. &#34;Carbon
                  fiber is expensive,&#34; he explained. &#34;It is also energy intensive to make, so it is
                  not exactly greenhouse gas (GHG) friendly. Making carbon fiber readily recyclable
                  could help in both these regards.&#34;
               </p>
               
               <p>Thanks to recent advances in bio-based material design, recycling carbon fiber at
                  an industrial scale could already be close at hand.
               </p>
               
               <p>Through a project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s Vehicle Technologies
                  Office, under the Composites Core Program, Rorrer and other NREL researchers have
                  shown that making carbon fiber composites with bio-based epoxies and an anhydride
                  hardener makes the material fully recyclable by introducing linkages that are more
                  easily degraded. In fact, the recycling process—called methanolysis—can be selectively
                  triggered at room temperature without degrading the quality or orientation of the
                  fibers. That could represent a strong step toward a circular material, which can make
                  carbon fiber cheaper and greener when used across multiple lives.

               <h2>A Close Look at Carbon Fiber</h2>

                        <figcaption>Strong, Featherweight, and Not Recyclable—Today’s carbon fiber is made by setting
                           woven carbon filaments in glue-like epoxy, yielding a material that can improve car
                           performance but cannot be effectively recycled.
                        </figcaption>
                     </figure>
                  </div> 
                  
               </div>
               
               <p>At once strong and featherweight, carbon fiber&#39;s advantages come from its layered
                  design. It is a composite material of both long filaments of pure carbon and a glue-like
                  epoxy coating known as a &#34;thermoset.&#34; When curing, molecules in the liquid resin bind
                  with each other and around the woven carbon filaments, hardening into a strong and
                  rigid lattice.
               </p>
               
               <p>When produced with a mold, the material can take a range of shapes for a variety of
                  applications, from car bumpers to wind turbine blades and more.
               </p>
               
               <p>However, the thermoset-nature of the cured epoxy makes those superior products difficult
                  to break apart, especially without severely damaging the carbon filaments. Products
                  made from carbon fiber—despite their premium price—often head to the landfill at the
                  end of their lives, along with any efficiency benefits they may have earned.
               </p>
               
               <p>Indeed, although carbon fiber could cut the weight of a typical passenger car in half—boosting
                  its fuel efficiency by as much as 35%—any efficiency benefits are effectively offset
                  by the GHG-intensive energy used to manufacture it. Synthesizing carbon fiber involves
                  temperatures of more than 1,000°C.
               </p>
               
               <p>That reality got Rorrer thinking: &#34;Is there a way to reuse carbon fiber over multiple
                  material lives to reclaim that fiber and get more value and environmental benefits?&#34;
               </p>
               
               <h2>Making Epoxy Recyclable by Design</h2>
               
               <p>Rorrer and teammates began experimenting with the chemistry of biomass to understand
                  if it could enable a new epoxy designed for recyclability. Compared to the hydrocarbons
                  in petroleum, biomass contains higher levels of oxygen and nitrogen, offering a different
                  set of chemical possibilities.
               </p>
               
               <p>&#34;We essentially redesigned the epoxy amines resins—today&#39;s thermosets in carbon fiber—with
                  epoxy and anhydrides synthesized from biomass, predominantly from the biological and
                  chemical conversion of sugars,&#34; Rorrer explained. &#34;We have shown that that reformulated
                  resin can maintain and/or exceed all the same properties as in today&#39;s epoxy amine
                  resins, but also make them recyclable by design—and at room temperature.&#34;
               </p>
               
               <p>Using a special catalyst, the NREL team was able to break down the bio-based resin
                  at room temperature, a process known as &#34;depolymerization.&#34; That allowed them to recover
                  the carbon filaments while maintaining their quality and alignment.
               </p>
               
               <p>&#34;We can actually maintain the fiber quality over at least three material lives,&#34; Rorrer
                  said. &#34;So not only are we able to recycle it; we are able to recycle it without any
                  detriment to properties. We are not downcycling the material at all.&#34;
               </p>
               
               <p>Combined with NREL&#39;s research into <a href="https://blog.aaryanporwal.com/news/features/2018/nrel-shifts-carbon-fiber-research-into-second-gear.html">low-cost, bio-based acrylonitrile as a carbon fiber precursor</a>—which earned an R&amp;D 100 award in 2018—the breakthrough in epoxy could go a long way
                  in making carbon fiber composites more cost effective and environmentally friendly.
               </p>
               
               <p>Being able to extract and recycle the carbon fiber could make the material more economical
                  for mass market electric vehicles, freeing up weight and space for batteries. It would
                  also lower the material&#39;s GHG footprint by 20%–40%. Better yet, it could achieve all
                  that without increasing manufacturing costs, as Rorrer estimates NREL&#39;s epoxy could
                  be produced for roughly the same price as today&#39;s petroleum-based epoxy-amine resins.
               </p>
               
               <p>&#34;By using bio-based feedstocks instead of petrochemical feedstocks, we don&#39;t have
                  to use extra energy to dramatically retool their chemistries,&#34; Rorrer added. &#34;That
                  allows us to more precisely, cheaply, and effectively design advanced materials with
                  performance and environmental advantages.&#34;
