    <h1>No one is disrupting banks – at least not the big ones</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>Hey!</p><p><span>The largest U.S. banks just reported their fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. And you know what? Banks are doing really well. This made me realize that, unfortunately, </span><strong>despite almost 30 years of trying, Fintech companies have not disrupted banks</strong><span>. At least, not the big ones.</span></p><p><span>Yes, there are examples of Fintech companies challenging banks in some areas, but </span><strong>they hardly challenged the key banking model - taking deposits and issuing loans</strong><span>. Until these functions are not disrupted, we cannot talk about Fintech disrupting banks.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps, disrupting big banks takes more time or even a change in generations of consumers. Or, maybe, </span><strong>banks and Fintech companies will need to learn how to co-exist</strong><span>. In any case, I don’t think the future of the Fintech industry will be boring.</span></p><p>Jevgenijs</p><p><em><span>p.s. if you have feedback just reply to this email or ping me </span><a href="https://x.com/jevgenijs" rel="">on X/Twitter</a></em></p><p><span>Let’s talk about deposits first. </span><strong>The money center banks survived the “deposit flight”</strong><span>. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi all reported, small, but nevertheless growth in retail deposits (consumers and small businesses). Regional banks did well too.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png" width="1456" height="1150" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1150,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:176174,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e094ec-5d10-4219-89ba-6851fc3a95e3_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em><span>“Firm-wide deposits have stabilized, and </span><strong>we expect to see a more visible growth trend</strong><span> assert itself in the second half of 2025. It&#39;s notable that </span><strong>we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits</strong><span>.”</span></em></p><p><em>Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The last few years seemed like </span><strong>a perfect time for Fintech companies to get deposits</strong><span>. First, stimulus money hit bank accounts, with limited ways for people to spend it. Then the Federal Reserve hiked the interest rates, so one could just park deposits in treasuries and still offer an attractive yield to depositors.</span></p><p><span>SoFi and LendingClub started offering </span><strong>high-yield savings accounts to make people move their money from the incumbents</strong><span> who paid nothing. And the incumbents couldn’t do much about it, as repricing their existing portfolio would have been far more costly than simply letting some depositors leave.</span></p><p><span>Even more exciting was Cash App teaming up with Wells Fargo (and Wise with Chase) to offer high-yield savings accounts to their customers. The message was “</span><strong>These customers want to bank with us now</strong><span>, so if you want access to their deposits, you will have to pay.” Wells Fargo and Chase needed deposits and paid 4%+ rates (without running a risk of their own customers demanding the same rate).</span></p><p><span>However…Bank of America still pays 64bps on $942 billion in deposits. Deposits are up, and the rates that the banks pay for these deposits are down. So </span><strong>for how long will Wells Fargo keep paying 4% to Cash App customers?</strong><span> Perhaps, they won’t need deposits from Cash App clients at all?</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“The biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits because </span><strong>these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise</strong><span>. And in the last 6 months, we believe we&#39;ve seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline. Consumer Banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August at around $928 billion and ended the year at $952 billion on an ending basis.”</span></em></p><p><em>Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>And what about LendingClub and SoFi? </span><strong>At the end of Q3 2024, LendingClub had $9.5 billion in deposits, and SoFi had $24.4 billion</strong><span>. This is impressive growth, but clearly not a disruption level. Fintech companies had a chance, and they kind of blew it.</span></p><p><span>But what’s more disappointing is that </span><strong>Fintechs haven’t managed to challenge banks in lending. </strong><span>Again, at least not the big ones. Let’s take credit card lending, which, in my opinion, is the product that should have been disrupted a long time ago.</span></p><p><span>In 2023, Affirm launched its Affirm Card. This card combines the function of a debit card with BNPL lending, and in theory, could be a challenger to traditional credit cards. </span><strong>Affirm quickly got to 1.4 million Affirm Card cardholders</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Robinhood also launched its Gold card last year offering 3% cash back. </span><strong>Robinhood claims that 2 million people are on the waitlist</strong><span> for this card.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“Meanwhile, </span><strong>Robinhood Gold credit card crossed 2 million on the waitlist and is adding roughly 200,000 waitlist sign-ups per month</strong><span>. So at that rate, we won&#39;t have to worry about customer acquisition or credit card users for at least the next few years.”</span></em></p><p><em>Vlad Tenev, Robinhood 2024 Investor Day</em></p></blockquote><p><span>However, </span><strong>in 2024, Amex opened 13 million new card accounts, Chase opened 10 million</strong><span>, Bank of America opened 4 million, and Wells Fargo opened 2.4 million. </span></p><p><strong>JPMorgan finished 2024 with $233 billion in credit card loans</strong><span> (up from $152 billion three years ago), Citigroup with $171 billion (up from $130 billion), and Capital One with $156 billion (up from $108 billion).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png" width="1456" height="1150" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1150,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:210761,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em><strong>We expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024</strong><span>, as tailwinds from revolver normalization are largely behind us.</span></em></p><p><em>Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Again, the </span><strong>last few years were ideal for building a credit card business as loan balances exploded</strong><span>.
