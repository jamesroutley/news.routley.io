    <h1>Getting a Computer Science PhD in the USA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>(Thanks for feedback to
Amy Ko,
Ben Shapiro,
Florian Tramèr,
Sam Tobin-Hochstadt,
Talia Ringer,
Titus Barik.)</p><p>The following article is written from a purely personal perspective. As of this
writing (in 2021), I have read thousands of application folders and
participated heavily in admissions. Still, my opinion is heavily by my own
environments, experiences, and beliefs. Therefore, these opinions should not be
viewed as universal, nor will following them definitely get you into a PhD
program of your choice. My main goal is to fill the gap of information, and
dispel the significant misinformation, that hurts applicants.</p><p>Two things, in particular, can significantly alter some of these answers.</p><p>First, there are (to my mind) three to four major “tiers” of
universities. There’s the extremely-competitive tier (places like MIT,
Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, and perhaps some others) where nothing short of being
absolutely outstanding will suffice. There’s the highly-competitive tier (which
includes places like Brown) where the majority of applicants do not get
admitted, but you can get in without being absolutely outstanding. There are
competitive places where being a solid applicant will suffice, and in
particular, professors in some areas may be much more willing than those in
other to admit students who have notable weaknesses. And finally there are
probably some not-very-competitive places where many students can get in. To
get into the extremely-competitive tier, it’s somewhat obvious you need to be
outstanding. I think there’s much more ambiguity about the next two tiers, so
that’s where I’m focusing my answers: especially at the highly-competitive
places.</p><p>Second, as this time, the AI-related fields (such as machine learning) seem to
be absolutely flooded with applicants. I think the simplest way to understand
it is that faculty in this area are admitting as if they are at an institution
one tier up. (The students from Brown I see going to the extremely-competitive
tier in AI-related fields seem to be just “off the charts”.) So in some
sense, if you’re applying in those areas, what follows still applies: you just
have to perform that shift in your head.</p><h3>1<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Context)"></a>Context</h3><h4>1.1<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Are_you_providing_standardized_information_)"></a>Are you providing standardized information?</h4><p>There is no standardized information. It’s important to understand that the US
system is almost completely decentralized.</p><p>There are some common rules imposed by government agencies on aspects like
funding and visas. But <span>everything</span> else is delegated to the universities,
who in turn may delegate things further to individual departments.</p><p>Thus, almost any sufficiently unambiguous statement will cough up several
counter-examples. I’m doing my best to abstract; in some cases, I am stating a
personal opinion (which I will make clear).</p><h4>1.2<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Why_do_you_keep_using_the_word__school___.I_finished_school_a_long_time_ago_)"></a>Why do you keep using the word “school”? I finished school a long
time ago!</h4><p>The great thing about English is that there are so many Englishes to choose
from. In many parts of the world, “school” is a place where you (typically)
finish your education at age 16 or 18. In America, “school” is any place
where you get schooling, i.e., an education. Thus you can have “middle
school” but also “trade school” and “graduate school”.</p><h4>1.3<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_s_the_difference_between_a_master_s_and_a_.Ph.D_)"></a>What’s the difference between a master’s and a PhD?</h4><p>A master’s degree has a clear end in sight: usually you take about eight
courses over the course of one to two years.</p><p>A PhD does not have a clear end in sight: you only graduate if you complete and
scucessfully defend a dissertation. More below.</p><p>The master’s is typically a <span>professional</span> degree: it’s meant to prepare
you to work in industry. Some master’s programs have a research option (or
perhaps even a research requirement), but the research here is usually rather
modest because the student will not stay indefinitely.</p><p>A PhD’s main job is <span>research</span> preparation. That takes a while. The goal
is that when you graduate, you have the skills to conceive an execute a
research project by yourself.</p><p>A master’s is typically not funded (see why: <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Funding-CS-Grad-School/">How CS Master’s Funding Works</a>).</p><h4>1.4<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Should_.I_apply_for_a_.Ph.D_directly_)"></a>Should I apply for a PhD directly?</h4><p>In many countries, you are expected to have a master’s before you apply for a
PhD. Not so in the USA: you can apply directly out of a bachelor’s
degree. However, that assumes a four-year bachelor’s degree (which is the
standard in the USA). In some countries the bachelor’s is only three years
long. It is not standard to transition from that to a US PhD program; in fact,
some institutions may even require you to have finished more than three years
of undergraduate study.</p><p>That said, even if you have a four-year bachelor’s, some reasons to apply for a
master’s first are:
</p><div><ul><li><p>You have a weak background in computer science and want more
preparation.</p></li><li><p>You aren’t sure whether you will like advanced study, and want to test it
out first.</p></li><li><p>You want to get a taste of research. (Make sure you apply to a master’s
program that has a research track!)</p></li><li><p>You want to strengthen your application to get into a better program.</p></li></ul></div><p>These are all good reasons to get a master’s first.</p><p>One thing a master’s won’t help with <span>much</span> is reducing time spent in your
PhD, unless you stay at the same institution. When you switch institutions the
requirements change, you have to forge new relationships, etc. So sometimes, a
master’s followed by a PhD elsewhere can take just as long and maybe even
longer than a PhD at the latter institution from the beginning. Therefore, make
sure you apply for a master’s for the right reason.</p><p>One thing to note is that you will usually get a master’s along the way to your
PhD, in return for meeting some requirements. Of course, to get this master’s
you will have to fill out some routine paperwork. I forgot to, so I didn’t get
one…</p><h4>1.5<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Do_.I_have_to_be_22_years_old_)"></a>Do I have to be 22 years old?</h4><p>No, you can even be
<a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-11-12/steiner">89 years old</a>.</p><p>Some people spend time in industry or doing other things before starting a
PhD. Some people may also be “grown up” and start later in life. Of course,
if you have a family to support, you have to think about how you can do that on
a graduate student stipend (somewhat unlikely; you may need a partner who is
better paid).</p><p>If you have spent a considerable time away from academia (e.g., a long stint in
industry), it’s especially important to follow advice in this document on your
statement of purpose, etc. At some point your course grades become less and
less meaningful, and other things you have done become a stand-in for what you
are capable of doing.</p><h4>1.6<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Do_.I_need_to_go_for_a_.Ph.D_to_do_research__.Can_.I_do_it_in_industry_)"></a>Do I need to go for a PhD to do research? Can I do it in industry?</h4><p>Most industrial research is done by people who already have a PhD. It’s not a
strict rule, and I know a small number of people in industry who do research
without having earned a PhD; but the exceptions almost make the rule.</p><p>A PhD program also offers you a unique ability to work on a project for many
years without worrying about immediate commercial impact and changing corporate
priorities. Furthermore, you aren’t subject to a management structure where
political and business decisions that have nothing to do with science can
significantly alter or even drop your project. For these reasons, I think a PhD
program is effectively unparalleled if you want to truly pursue research.</p><h3>2<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Before_.Applying)"></a>Before Applying</h3><h4>2.1<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Will_.I_be_funded_for_a_.Ph.D_)"></a>Will I be funded for a PhD?</h4><p>Yes, you will. There may be some fine-print about having to be doing reasonably
well (you can’t do nothing, goof off completely, and expect to be paid
indefinitely), but in summary: yes.</p><p>The exact amount you make varies by institution, with stipends reflecting some
regional variation in the cost of living. You can expect to make about USD
30,000 (before taxes) for the academic year. During the summer you may work
with your research group, or you may take an industrial internship, or do
something else. The details of that are something you work out with your
advisor.</p><p>If you are offered an unfunded position, you should not take it.</p><h4>2.2<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_long_does_a_.Ph.D_take_)"></a>How long does a PhD take?</h4><p>In some countries, there’s a pre-defined bound on the length of a PhD. Not so
in the US. Your PhD program will expect you to pass various
milestones—<wbr/>courses, exams, research qualifiers, etc.—<wbr/>followed by, of
course, a thesis, its dissertation, and its defense.</p><p>How long all this takes depends on many things: your background, your topic,
your progress, and your luck. It is typical for students to finish in about 6
years. In the US, however, it is quite common for students to enter a PhD
program directly after a bachelor’s degree. Students who enter with a master’s
can quite likely reduce the time they take, but the total time may still be the
same (and may even be a bit longer, if they change institutions).</p><h4>2.3<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Is_a_thesis_different_from_a_dissertation_)"></a>Is a thesis different from a dissertation?</h4><p>Even though people use the terms interchangeably, they really are different
terms that refer to two related but distinct concepts. Read and understand
<a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/diss-advice.html">Olin Shivers’ Dissertation Advice</a>. Re-read it every few years
until you finish your PhD.</p><h4>2.4<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_do_.I_know_if_.I_m_ready_for_a_.Ph.D_)"></a>How do I know if I’m ready for a PhD?</h4><p>I can tell you when you should <span>not</span> apply for a PhD: when the only reason
is because you don’t know what else to do. A few years into your PhD, when
nothing is working and you feel miserable, you need a strong, affirmative
reason for having gone there in the first place: that’s what powers you through
the negative moments.</p><p>You might go to a PhD program because you have an advisor who says that’s the
right path for you. There’s nothing wrong with that; I have several students
who have gone directly to a PhD.</p><p>But the generic advice I give students is to <span>not</span> go directly to a
PhD. Instead, go work in industry (or “industry”: anything that isn’t taking
more courses). Get your hands dirty. Get some real experience with the
world. This has two advantages.</p><p>First, you can earn real money. You may use it to help people (e.g., family) or
pay off loans. Or you can just save it. As a computer scientist, you know how
exponential functions work; the compound interest formula is an exponential
function. If you save for retirement at 22, even if you don’t touch your money
for 8 years, it has the potential to quietly compound in the background. And
some spare cash can make graduate student life more comfortable.</p><p>Second, you’ll know why you are applying. I tell students, <span>Wait until
you’re frustrated about something</span>. I don’t mean being frustrated at your boss;
then you just need a different boss. But if you are frustrated by something
<span>technical</span>,<span><span><span>I will use the term “technical” repeatedly. This
should be interpreted broadly. It does not mean only, say, related to
mathematics or systems. It can just as well be related to humans. It just needs
to be the kind of problems that computer science departments solve.</span></span></span>
now you have your motivation. You know what problem you want
to solve. You can start to find papers on it. Papers you previously could not
have understood will start to make sense. You’ll start probing the purported
solutions. You’ll find who else works in this area. You can see which people
are doing work that fits your tastes. And now you have: (a) a clear problem
area, (b) concrete motivation for working on it, (c) a sense of what kind of
solution will and won’t work in the original domain, (d) a list of people to
apply to, and (e) a great outline of your statement of purpose.</p><p>Let’s say you never get frustrated. That means you’re well-paid and happy. Over
95% of humanity does not reach this state. Revel in it. Skip the PhD.</p><h4>2.5<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_is_the__.Valley_model__)"></a>What is the “Valley model”?</h4><p>When I was a new international student, my foreign student advisor (Ann
Quillen) talked to us about the phenomenon of “homesickness”. Right now, she
said, you all feel euphoric about your new setting and think it won’t happen to
you. Then she drew the following graph:</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/us-cs-phd-faq/mood.png" alt="" width="353" height="180"/></p></blockquote><p>Her point was that every student goes through a similar swing. They start out
euphoric; then reality sets in; then, when things get hard, they start to miss
home. But then they eventually work things out, recover, and return to some
state well above the trough; whether it’s at the same level as that initial
euphoria, lower, or even higher, depends on the student. And of course this
cycle could repeat.</p><p>That picture always stayed in my mind, especially when I found that it neatly
matched my own experiences. (“Around October”, she had said, the decline
would begin, and it did. Was it causal? I don’t think so.)</p><p>Many years later, I realized, something similar happens in a PhD program as
well. You start out euphoric: new program, new people, new-found freedom, a
stipend, and so on. Then you get into the rut of courses and projects, and the
initial buzz wears off. Then your papers start getting rejected. First it seems
program committees don’t care; then that other professors in your department
don’t care; then even your advisor; and finally maybe even you.</p><p>When you reach this nadir, it’s essential to know <span>why you came to the PhD
program in the first place</span>. If you came because it was the default option,
this is the point where you decide to leave—<wbr/>except, perhaps, after having
squandered a few years of your life. If, on the other hand, you have a clear
sense of what you’re trying to accomplish, you can power through this
phase. You realize that the problem is not with you but with the world not
being able to appreciate what you do, and you redouble your efforts—<wbr/>improving
your resarch, writing, and organization to help them see what you already
see. And eventually they do. My guess is that most successful PhD students go
through this curve.</p><h4>2.6<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_do_.I_find_the_best_professors_programs_~e2~80~a6_)"></a>How do I find the best professors/programs/…?</h4><p>This is the wrong question. Instead, I will give you a surefire way to figure
out whom you should apply to.</p><p>First, how do you find the people who are doing things that are interesting to
you? For that, you crack open conference proceedings. These days you can find
just about all (especially recent) publications online, and very often you can
get a free copy from an unofficial site. Read lots of papers.  See which ones
interest you.</p><p>You may, of course, be quite unable to read the technical heart of the
paper. But you should be able to read and make some sense of the abstract and
introduction. You should also see whether the kind of technical detail the
paper has—<wbr/>which you may not understand—<wbr/>is the sort of work you might one
day want to do. For instance, if the heart of the paper is about control
theory, but you’d rather do purely experimental measurement, or vice versa,
then this paper isn’t a good fit for your plans.</p><p>Then, once you’ve narrowed down a list of papers, look at who wrote them. Find
the professors. Also locate the students, who may now themselves be junior
professors.</p><p>These are the people you want to apply to.</p><p>You can, if you wish, “rank” them by whatever other criterion you want to use
(location, prestige of the university, two-body constraints, etc.). How you do
that is up to you. But this is the set you want to work from.</p><p>Yes, all of this takes a lot of work. But this is the rest of your life we’re
talking about. If you’d rather delegate all the work to a rankings site, you’re
welcome to, but don’t say you weren’t warned.</p><h4>2.7<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_areas_are_currently_hot_)"></a>What areas are currently hot?</h4><p>“Hot” things in computer science—<wbr/>hot areas, hot programming languages, hot
platforms, etc.—<wbr/>rarely stay hot for more than five to seven years. This is
almost exactly the duration of a PhD program. So if you pursue what is hot
right now, you’re almost guaranteed that it will be at best lukewarm—<wbr/>or,
cold, or boring, or yawn-inducing—<wbr/>when you graduate.</p><p>If you still want to pursue what’s hot, go ahead! You’ll have to find an answer
to your question elsewhere.</p><h4>2.8<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_do_.I_do_if_.I_m_interested_in_multidisciplinary_research_)"></a>What do I do if I’m interested in multidisciplinary research?</h4><p>It depends on the institution and the particular multidisciplinary perspective.</p><p>Given whatever your perspective is, see whether there is an entity at each
university of interest that focuses on it. You may find a “Center for” or
“Program in” or something of that sort. Sometimes these will admit students
directly; quite often they will have a collection of affiliated departments and
you will be expected to meet the admissions and PhD process of one of those
departments.</p><p>The details vary significantly, and there is no shortcut to studying the
counterparts at each institution. The advantage to this diversity is that each
place is free to have its own program, and will have differences (some big,
some subtle) that reflect that institution’s view of the field you’re
interested in. You may find some of these programs are much more to your liking
than others.</p><h4>2.9<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Are_there_services_that_will_evaluate_my_application_s_chances_)"></a>Are there services that will evaluate my application’s chances?</h4><p>There may very well be; the question is whether they are any <span>good</span>. I
would <span>not trust</span> standard applicant evaluation serivces. Even if they are
good at evaluating undergraduate applications (which is itself a big “if”),
they are very unlikely to have the expertise to evaluate graduate
applications. If they claim they do, ask them how they are able to anticipate
how research university professors would read a dossier.</p><p>Even if they can perform a preliminary evaluation, they are unlikely to know
about the spatial and temporal pecularities of particular departments: What
kind of applicant does this department like? What is the funding situation like
this year? Things like that.</p><h4>2.10<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Are_the_expectations_different_for_students_with_a_master_s_)"></a>Are the expectations different for students with a master’s?</h4><p>Somewhat. Often, applicants may have a bachelor’s degree from a more obscure
(to the reader) institution and a master’s from a less obscure one. The
performance in the master’s then gives the reader a better sense of quality. In
addition, the letters writers may be better known, and may hence be more
trust-worthy. Finally, if the applicant did some research during the master’s,
then what the research advisors say will matter a lot.</p><h4>2.11<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Do_.I_need_to_know_what_area_.I_m_interested_in_when_applying_for_the_.Ph.D_)"></a>Do I need to know what area I’m interested in when applying for the PhD?</h4><p>At many institutions, it really helps. Unless you are somehow an extraordinary
generalist, many programs would prefer to see applicants who have at least some
idea of what they want to do. If you have no idea about areas, one can also
wonder whether you really are ready for a PhD yet. (That’s not entirely fair,
but some people might wonder that anyway.)</p><p>Of course, you will hopefully be exposed to whole new areas during your PhD,
and may find yourself migrating to them. But it still helps to have some clear
direction to give your statement of purpose some real purpose. And in many
departments, you probably won’t get admitted at all without a clear area.</p><h4>2.12<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_is_the_application_timeline_)"></a>What is the application timeline?</h4><p>Suppose you want to start your PhD in year <span>Y</span>. Then applications will be
due sometime between October of <span>Y - 1</span> and January of <span>Y</span>.</p><p>You should start preparing your application a lot sooner. You should work on
your statements starting in the summer of <span>Y - 1</span>. If the universities you
are applying to require you to take a standardized test, you’ll need to prepare
for that and also set up the logistics of taking it.</p><p>You will need recommendation letter writers. Don’t spring requests on them at
the last minute—<wbr/>if they do a poor job, the person who loses is not them but
you. If you think they might need it and will be responsive to it, consider
pointing them to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/">Graduate School Recommendations Advice</a>. Here is the kind of information
that I find useful from my students: <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Reco-From-Me/">Recommendation Letter from Me</a>.</p><p>You will also have to arrange for the institution to receive other materials,
such as your grade transcripts.</p><p>After everything goes in, you wait! You will usually be notified about
admission sometime during February, though March is not unheard of. At some
place, you may end up a waitlist (and not be told about it), which means you
may only hear later.</p><p>With your admission, you will be given information about financial aid and
also be invited to learn more about the department. Often you will be given an
offer to fly out to visit (you should be reimbursed at least partially, with
the expectation that you combine visits to multiple universities and the
collective reimbursement covers all your costs).</p><p>Usually, when you’re invited to visit, you have already been
admitted. Sometimes, you be asked over for an <span>interview</span> instead. Make
sure you know which it is; if in doubt, ask! But even if you’ve been admitted,
remember that you’re making the first acquaintance with the person who may be
your PhD advisor, a relationship for life. Approach it professionally. And
remember, now the shoe’s on the other foot: <span>they</span> are trying to convince
<span>you</span> to come there!</p><p>In the US, universities have an agreement to give you until April 15 (of year
<span>Y</span>) to require a decision. A university should not pressure you to make a
decision sooner than that. Unfortunately, universities in some other countries
have seized on this “weakness”; I have seen cases of students being forced
(or at least strongly nudged) to make a decision before that date. While this
is not illegal, and I can understand why they may want to do this, it’s a
terrible way to treat students who are trying to make one of the most important
decisions of their life. Shame on you if you do this; stop doing it!</p><p>PhD programs usually do not get into “bidding wars”. However, if you got a
particularly nice perk from one place, there’s no harm in asking another place
whether they can match it in some way. Note that salaries are the least
flexible (they are set by the Graduate School, and differences may be due to
the cost of living: Manhattan costs are very different from those of the
Midwest). But remember, the person you’re negotiating with is someone you want
as your PhD advisor; you can negotiate hard, but don’t make them regret
admitting you!</p><p>One you have accepted an offer from one institution, decline the offers from
the others. Don’t try to play games. It rarely ends well.</p><h4>2.13<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Can_.I_do_a_computer_science_.Ph.D_with_prior_degrees_in_a_different_subject_)"></a>Can I do a computer science PhD with prior degrees in a
different subject?</h4><p>Quite possibly. It depends on a few things:
</p><div><ul><li><p>How close your previous degree was to computer science.</p></li><li><p>What you plan to study. The previous degree may actually help you: e.g.,
if you want to do computational biology and your previous degree is in biology,
that can be to your advantage.</p></li><li><p>Whether you demonstrate the ability to do basic computer science. In
particular, PhD programs often have coursework and distribution requirements;
if you are not going to pass those, that would be problematic. One way you can
demonstrate your ability, if you did not take computing courses in your prior
degree, is through informal venues such as projects and MOOCs.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2.14<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Can_.I_do_a_.Ph.D_in_computer_science_if_.I_already_have_one_in_something_else_)"></a>Can I do a PhD in computer science if I already have one in something
else?</h4><p>Quite likely. Some institutions may have rules against a second PhD, so
double-check. But many people have done this.</p><h3>3<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Ph.D_.Application)"></a>PhD Application</h3><h4>3.1<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_is_the___300_000_model__)"></a>What is the “$300,000 model”?</h4><p>A common mistake applicants make is to ask a potential advisor, “Will you
accept me?”, or “Can you fund me?” Here’s why these are not good questions.</p><p>I tell students to follow the “$300,000 model”. That is, when you approach a
potential advisor about being an advisee, what they see is not only a human
being; they also see, floating above that person, a number like this:</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/us-cs-phd-faq/person-300.png" alt="" width="178" height="242"/></p></blockquote><p>$300,000 is’s roughly what it takes to fund one PhD student for about 5
years. (You don’t get all of it, though!) So you’re asking them whether they
are willing to raise that much money. You are <span>also</span> asking whether
they’re willing to undergo the opportunity cost of having taken you instead of
some other student for that duration.</p><p>Now, it is <span>extremely</span> easy to read this the wrong way, especially if you
are a little low in confidence for any reason. Do <span>not</span> read this as “Am
I worth $300,000?” Rather, read it as, “How do I demonstrate that I am worth
$300,000?” You do not have to have a perfect response. You just need to be
aware of what may go through an advisor’s mind, and craft your approach
accordingly.</p><p>Most of all, do not read this and talk yourself out of applying! Too often I
see people make decisions that it’s others’ job to make. Deciding whether or
not to admit you is the job of the PhD admissions committee, not you! You do
your job (apply well); let them do their job. Don’t do their job for them.</p><h4>3.2<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Who_reads_application_folders__.Is_it_the__.Graduate_.School__)"></a>Who reads application folders? Is it the “Graduate School”?</h4><p>The reality is this. Technically, you are admitted by some formal entity like a
Graduate School. However, your admissions decisions are actually made by
professors in the department. That is, your folder is usually read by professors
who will eventually work with you, not entities abstracted from the day-to-day
execution of research. This plays into how you write: you are not writing for
administrators, you are communicating directly with your intended advisors and
people like them.</p><p>Within a department, responsibility is usually divided between an admissions
committee and individual faculty members. The details vary a lot between
institutions and over time. However, in general, the committee is responsible
for general oversight, maintaining standards across the board, managing the
number of admits relative to funding, etc. But very often, individual faculty
members or groups will make decisions about “their” applicants (though this
is not universally true). Those who don’t fall to any particular group or
groups will likely be decided on by the admissions committee.</p><h4>3.3<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Is_the_.G.R.E_important_)"></a>Is the GRE important?</h4><p>Universities are increasingly de-emphasizing standardized testing scores like
the GRE. Therefore, this question is increasingly moot.</p><p>My personal view is that for some students, the GRE cannot help, only hurt; for
others, it can help.</p><p>If you come with a prior record that we can “understand” (e.g., we recognize
the institution, understand its grading standards, etc.), then we already have
a ton of information about you. If your grades are poor, one GRE score is not
going to reverse that. If your grades are good, a good GRE gives us no new
information, while a poor GRE only casts some doubt. So there’s no real point
to taking the GRE.</p><p>If you come from an unrecognized environment, then we have no calibration for
how good you are. The value of a <span>standardized</span> test is that it give sus
some calibration. Thus, a good GRE performance can help you (slightly). It’s
unlikely on its own to make the difference between admission and rejection, but
if you are close to the line and people want reassurance, it can provide them
that reassurance.</p><h4>3.4<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Does_the_.G.P.A__grade_point_average__matter_)"></a>Does the GPA (grade point average) matter?</h4><p>What do you think?</p><p>Of course it matters…for the most part.</p><p>Your GPA gives us several useful cues. It tells us that you are competent at
the relevant disciplines. It tells us that you can do steady work. It tells us
that you’ve picked up various skills. A poor GPA can suggest that one or more
of these is not true.</p><p>However, there are five caveats.</p><p>First, we are primarily interested in your grades in <span>relevant</span>
courses. If you do well at math and poorly at underwater basket weaving, unless
the latter is deeply relevant to your specific academic interest, we don’t
care. In that sense we’re more interested in your subject/major GPA than
overall GPA, though if you do poorly at all writing-related courses, some
professors (like me) would be worried, because ultimately you have to do a fair
bit of (paper) writing as a PhD student.</p><p>Second, we are interested in your trend. If you start out poorly, then hit your
high gear, and end on a high note in your last year or two, that’s great, and
that can forgive a lot of poor early grades. If you do the opposite, that’s
really worrisome.</p><p>Third, we’ve all screwed up now and then. (Please don’t ask me about
<span>that</span> semester…) A glitch here and there is unlikely to be a big
deal. It’s more worrisome if you flubbed courses that are directly tied to the
very thing you seem to be passionate aobut working on, less so otherwise.</p><p>Fourth, we can all suffer from some mishaps. You may have had an illness, had a
family member with an illness, had to support someone, etc.</p><p>Finally, you may be someone who’s just not very good with the conventional
academic system but actually an outstanding researcher.</p><p>Especially in the latter categories, your application needs some explantion:
what’s on paper is not the whole story. There are three main sources of
explanation.</p><p>The first is yourself. You can tell us about it in your statement of
purpose. The second is your letter-writers. Especially in the last (“tortured
genius”) category, they can tell us to disregard your grades by marshalling
other evidence about you. The third is your accomplishments: you may have built
projects that better showcase your abilities than your coursework does. These
you can document through a dossier and a reference in your statement of
purpose.</p><h4>3.5<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Does_prior_research_experience_matter__.What_if_.I_haven_t_any_)"></a>Does prior research experience matter? What if I haven’t any?</h4><p>Yes, it can. The more competitive the university, the more it can matter.</p><p>In principle, a PhD program exists to teach you how to do research. But if a
professor can get a student who already has some experience doing it, wouldn’t
(all else being equal) they prefer such a student? <span>Any</span> skill they can
get you with some prior preparation on is a skill they can spend that much less
time teaching you, letting you progress farther and deeper.</p><p>However, the <span>worst</span> thing you can do in response to this is to rush to
“publish a paper”. There are far too many <span>predatory publishers</span> who
will glaldy let you have “a paper” in return for some money. These papers are
not worth the bits they are stored on. They won’t fool any admissions
committee. You won’t get in just by publishing at a bunch of no-name
conferences: there’s no algorithmic filter that you’re fooling. You’re just
wasting your time, enriching scoundrels, and deluding yourself (as you will
find out a few months later, when the rejections arrive). <span>Do not fall for
this</span>.</p><p>If you can get a “real” paper—<wbr/>i.e., a non-trivial result at a serious,
peer-reviewed venue—<wbr/>that definitely helps. (How do you know it’s a serious
venue? Easy, see who else is publishing at it. Do the other authors seem more
like the professors you are applying to or more like applicants like yourself?
You want the former, not the latter.) But two things to note:
</p><div><ol><li><p>Publishing as an undergraduate is very hard. You may not have the subject
background, you may not know the research methods, and you probably don’t know
how to present it even if you get past the other two obstacles. Simply writing
up something and sending it to a prestigious venue wastes everyone’s time. Most
undergraduates, if they publish major results at all, do so working closely
with faculty, PhD students, and post-docs who already know the ropes.</p></li><li><p>Simply being “published”, even at a legitimate venue, may not mean
much. What a professor will want to know is what your role was. Were you an
intellectual leader? Or did you simply write some scripts? There is absolutely
nothing at all with the latter, but it makes your “publication” count a lot
less.</p></li></ol></div><p>So, we come to the crux: most undergraduates will not have a meaningful
research publication. What else can you do to demonstrate your skill?</p><p>Well, ask yourself: what can <span>you</span> do? Perhaps you can create a blog of
the papers you have read with good summaries of each paper. Perhaps you can
reimplement an algorithm from an interesting paper and benchmark it. Perhaps
you can create a neat project that showcases your abilities. Perhaps you can
generate interesting follow-up questions on a paper that itrigued you. Perhaps
you can even prototype some follow-ups and see where they lead. Perhaps you can
complete some MOOCs on subjects you were missing.</p><p>In the end, the more competitive the place, the more professors are looking for
students to have some “fire in the belly”. A student who simply did well in
all their courses but took no further initiative often suggests that they are
good at following rules, but may not become a leader. Are you just a
rule-follower or do you have a burning passion to advance the field?
Demonstrate that passion in a technical way!</p><h4>3.6<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_do_.I_think_about_my_letters_of_recommendation_)"></a>How do I think about my letters of recommendation?</h4><p>The most important thing to understand is that, collectively, your letters have
to tell a story about you. Therefore, think about the different facets you want
to highlight and find people who can address each one.</p><p>Your letters do not all have to come from professors. Letters from others can
also be very useful, and a quality non-professor letter can be much more useful
than a perfunctory one from a professor. Others usually includes post-docs you
may have done research with or bosses in industry. This comes back to
documenting your facets.</p><p>Normally, we care about your <span>technical</span> facets, not (for instance) about
your volunteer work. However, it depends on what you’re applying for. if you
want to do research in villages in the developing world, then time you spent
with a non-profit actually making a difference in villages is much more useful
than a routine professor letter.</p><p>Unfortunately, many people (professors included, but especially non-professors)
do not know how to write very good letters. This is true of younger researchers
(like post-docs), people in industry (where a letter serves a very different
purpose), people in non-profits (ditto), etc. Therefore, if you can, please try
to have your letter-writers read <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/">Graduate School Recommendations Advice</a>.</p><p>Finally, don’t worry if not all of your letter-writers can write about you in
depth. We understand that you may not be able to make three deep contacts,
especially at large institutions. The more the better, but a primary letter
that will talk about you in depth, along with supporting letters, is fine. This
is why it’s important to think about the <span>collective</span> story, not focus on
each letter independently.</p><h4>3.7<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_does_industry_experience_translate_)"></a>How does industry experience translate?</h4><p>Industry experience is virtually never bad. At worst, it’s neutral (unless you
did something horrible). Often, it’s a tiny boost: it suggests you have some
skills (working with large systems, working in teams, being organized, etc.)
that many students coming directly out of an undergrad degree don’t
have. Sometimes, it can be a big boost, if your industrial work is directly
tied to your application goals. It is then especially important to highlight
your industrial work in your statement of purpose.</p><h4>3.8<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Should_.I_contact_professors_and__if_so__how_)"></a>Should I contact professors and, if so, how?</h4><p>Ah yes, a vexing question.</p><p>In the grand sum of things, contacting professors will largely make no
difference. It can help a little, and it can hurt a little. Professors are
busy, and they want to spend their time on the students already at their
university. For some professors, if they were to reply to every inquiry, that’s
literally all they would do all day, and they wouldn’t be able to do their
job. Think of it this way: if you were someone’s PhD student, would you want
them spending time on you or on applicants? So don’t get offended if you don’t
hear back. Email overload is a real thing.</p><p>Why can contacting be helpful? If you get on a professor’s radar—<wbr/>which is a
big “if”!—<wbr/>it can save your application from being “lost” in the
system. Especially if you have something exciting to offer, you can have the
professor pursuing you rather than you pursuing them!</p><p>The extent to which it can help depends to some extent on two factors: one is
the seniority of the professor and the other is the tier of the
institution. The better-known the professor and institution, the more
high-quality applicants they have, and the less they need to look for
students. But the less either one is true, the more likely they are to be open
to students contacting them.</p><p>However, make sure you have something of value to say. Keep in mind the
$300,000 model. Keep it short. Be concrete. Don’t tack on lazy questions at the
end that you think make you sound inquisitive but are actually really vague and
will take a long time to respond to. It’s exciting when someone has clearly
read your work and asks hard, probing questions; but if all you do is ask
perfunctory questions, you’ll give the impression of either not being able to
read the papers or not caring to, and neither is going to elevate you.</p><p>In particular: <span>if your message looks like a form letter, it will be
ignored</span>. And believe me, professors have gotten very good at spotting (what
they think are) form letters. Your one or two lines of customization, using
text copied from the Web, won’t fool them. And anyway, it doesn’t matter
whether or not they were right: if it <span>looks</span> like a form letter to them,
you have failed to meet your objective.</p><p>Finally, see whether the professor even provides instructions on the Web about
contacting them. If they do, <span>follow the instructions</span>! If you don’t, you
will certainly not help, and may hurt, your application.</p><p>It is also perfectly fine to not contact any professors. In principle, just
applying should suffice. However, (a) check their page: if they <span>want</span> you
to contact them, then you definitely should; (b) the one place it does help, as
noted above, is to make sure your application is brought to their attention.</p><p>Much of what I’ve written above is for highly- and more competitive places. At
less competitive places, professors probably get fewer inquiries and student
quality may be weaker, so they may be much more interested in hearing from
applicants. But keep in mind they too are busy and have lots of email, so the
same general principles apply.</p><h4>3.9<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_makes_for_a_good_and_bad_statement_of_purpose_)"></a>What makes for a good and bad statement of purpose?</h4><p>Remember who’s reading your folder: your potential PhD advisor and people like
them. So you are writing for a technical audience. They are also busy, reading
lots of folders and trying to triage which ones need more attention. Apply the
<span>one minute test</span>: if a person spent one minute reading my statement,
would they feel intrigued enough to keep reading?</p><p>It’s easy to say what you should <span>not</span> do. Here are several tips:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Don’t start off with a story about how you got your first computer when
you were five. I don’t care. If anything, I most certainly did not, so you had
a huge head start on me; I expect to see you have done a lot more than I did
when I applied to graduate school!</p></li><li><p>Don’t tell me about your family’s devotion to education and so forth. It
doesn’t matter. If they are devoted, that’s great. If they are not, kudos to
you for aspiring for one anyway. But either way, it doesn’t help me determine
why you should be admitted.</p></li><li><p>Avoid buzz-words and trendy marketing-speak. You aren’t trying to sell us
a database or cloud service. You’re trying to convince us you have enough
technical depth to do a PhD.</p></li><li><p>Don’t italicize and bold-face every buzz-word and trendy
marketing-speak. It makes the previous problem exponentially worse.</p></li><li><p>Don’t tell us how wonderful we are. We know! That’s why you’re
applying. But that’s also why lots of other people are applying. You want to
convince us to admit you over them.</p></li><li><p>Don’t spend a lot of space on personal tales of woe. We want to
understand you the person. But within limits.</p></li></ul></div><p>Okay, with that out of the way: what <span>should</span> you do?</p><p>Open with a clear statement of your interest.</p><p>Tell us about relevant background. If you have a mix of academic and
non-academic background, summarize both. If you think we wouldn’t have heard of
your institution, tell us a bit about it (e.g., does it have any designation of
merit in your country?).</p><p>Tell us about moments of epiphany. What in computer science sparked joy in you?
Why? And what did you do about it?</p><p>If you have prior research or project experience (whether published or not),
tell us about it. Anything that is interesting, difficult, and compelling can
fit here. Focus on what you contributed to it. If it was done under someone’s
supervision, we would expect to see a letter from the person who supervised it,
and hopefully the letter confirms what you claim—<wbr/>it’s always a bit worrisome
when the applicant has a vastly inflated sense of what they did than the
supervisor does. But independent projects are also fine, and indeed can be
evidence of a real spark!</p><p>Most of all, tell us why you’re applying to us and what you want to do
here. State your <span>purpose</span>. This is where you describe faculty who you
find interesting; tell us <span>why</span> they interest you. The more depth you can
provide here, the better. If it looks like you just looked at the Web page and
picked off everyone in an area, that is not very persuasive; if you can say
something of substance, that makes clear you have actually bothered to
understand a person’s work, you are much more likely to get their attention.</p><p>Finally, if you have any mitigating issues, you can mention them briefly. For
instance, if you had an illness that hurt your performance in one semester, you
can tell the reader that. You don’t have to reveal private details; also, keep
this portion relatively short. People want to give you a fair chance, but they
don’t need to read an entire saga.</p><h4>3.10<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Should_.I_have_a_backup_school_)"></a>Should I have a backup school?</h4><p>What’s your goal? If your goal is to get into some PhD program, you may very
well be able to. That’s not a very good goal. If your goal is learning, then
the notion of a “backup” doesn’t quite make sense. Of course, once you’ve
identified professors of interest, they may well be at universities at
different levels of competitiveness, and the less competitive ones may feel
like a “backup”. Not only is that not a “backup” in the generic sense, you
may also be surprised after visiting all the places you get into to find that
the “backup” is actually the most pleasant of the lot, and where you want to
go!</p><h4>3.11<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.If_.I_m_asked_to_interview_with_a_group__how_do_.I_prepare_for_it_)"></a>If I’m asked to interview with a group, how do I prepare for it?</h4><p>It’s not common for groups to interview, but you may find that individual
professors call you to chat with you before they make a decision about your
folder. The reasons could be manifold. They may want to learn more about things
that weren’t covered in your application. They may be confirming things you did
cover in your application. They may have a specific question about a particular
project you did or a skill they want to confirm you have. Or they may just want
to confirm that you are indeed as amazing as you seem on paper!</p><p>The two things you can do to prepare are:
</p><div><ol><li><p>Remind yourself of what the professor does. If indeed it’s a true
interview, coming across as unprepared will not help.</p></li><li><p>Remind yourself of what you wrote in your application. Sometimes
applicants literally just forget what they said: they may have read something
recently and been excited about it and said it in their statement, and then
forgotten all about it. Your caller should not know more about your application
(excepting, of course, the confidential parts, like recommendations) than you!</p></li></ol></div><h3>4<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.After_.Admission)"></a>After Admission</h3><h4>4.1<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.What_are_the_stages_of_a_.Ph.D_program_)"></a>What are the stages of a PhD program?</h4><p>Every institution is somewhat different. Once you’re admitted to a program, you
can learn more from them directly.</p><h4>4.2<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Should_.I_work_with_a_junior_or_senior_faculty_member_)"></a>Should I work with a junior or senior faculty member?</h4><p>There’s no single good answer to this. Stereotypically, junior faculty may
spend more time with you and have more cycles to devote to you; senior faculty
may be a little less hungry for success and may have more demands on their
time. Which you prefer is up to you. Of course, junior faculty have less job
stability; but senior faculty also move voluntarily, so you shouldn’t assume
that a person will forever be at the same place. Usually, when people move,
they and the current and new departments will work to make arrangements for
students.</p><p>Ultimately, what matters is not whether a person is junior or senior; it’s the
person themself. Ignore superficial markers and stereotypes. Get to know the
person.</p><h4>4.3<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.How_can_.I_expand_the_network_of_people_.I_know_in_the_field_)"></a>How can I expand the network of people I know in the field?</h4><p>There are numerous ways to build up your professional network. In a field that
I know well, programming languages, here are at least four good ways:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Regional conferences like NJPLS and NEPLS. They are very cheap to attend
and you’ll form friendships with fellow students at other institutions. Then,
when you all attend a major conference for the first time, you won’t know
<span>nobody</span> in the room; you’ll at least have each other for moral support!</p></li><li><p>The SIGPLAN-Mentoring program.</p></li><li><p>The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop.</p></li><li><p>The PLTea student group.</p></li></ul></div><p>and quite possibly many more. Find similar events in your area.</p><h4>4.4<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Who_can_help_if_.I_have_problems_)"></a>Who can help if I have problems?</h4><p>If it’s internal to your department, you are best off finding support within
the university. There are whole support structures available at US
universities.</p><p>If you have an unfortunate incident at a conference, look to see whether your
community has a CARES group, which now exist for many areas. People in CARES
can help you navigate the ropes. Technically CARES groups are run by ACM SIGs,
so they can be of only limited help at non-ACM events, but CARES members are
senior and know a lot of people in the community, so let them try to help you.</p><h4>4.5<tt> </tt><a name="(part._.Is_the_.Ph.D_really_as_miserable_as_people_make_it_out_to_be_on_.Twitter_)"></a>Is the PhD really as miserable as people make it out to be on
Twitter?</h4><p>Not at all. Social media are highly performative. They also also not a
representative cross-section of life.</p><p>Are there issues with PhD programs? Sure. Are all of them getting the attention
they deserve? Probably not. But there are also lots of well-run programs, happy
students, and professors and institutions who are doing their best (with
various constraints, not always visible on the outside) to run things well and
make things better. Don’t let social media destroy your optimism and joy about
further learning.</p></div></div></div>
