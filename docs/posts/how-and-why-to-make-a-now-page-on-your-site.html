<h2>
	Background
</h2>
<p>
	I used to wonder what my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Lewis">Benny Lewis</a> was doing.
	He has <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/">a website</a> and social media accounts, but neither gave <strong>an overview of what he’s doing now</strong>.
</p><p>
	Then I realized some people might wonder the same about me.
	So in 2015, I made <a href="https://sive.rs/now">a /now page</a> on my website, saying <strong>what I’d tell a friend I hadn’t seen in a year</strong>.
</p><p>
	It has a nice side-effect of being a public declaration of priorities.
	It’s a good link to give people when <a href="https://sive.rs/n">saying no</a> to invitations and distractions.
</p><p>
	Word spread, and soon <strong><a href="https://nownownow.com/">hundreds of people</a> had a /now page on their personal website</strong>.
	So I made a site to showcase them all: <strong><a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a></strong> — (a static site generated by <a href="https://sive.rs/pg2">PostgreSQL functions</a>.)
	It currently has over <a href="https://nownownow.com/">2300 people</a> worldwide.
	This week I added browse by location and search.
</p>
<h2>
	Got a personal website? Add a /now page
</h2>
<p>
	The three main ingredients are:
</p>
<ol><li>
	a page, usually at URL /now, linked from your main menu, usually alongside /about
</li><li>
	an overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year
</li><li>
	the date it was last updated
</li></ol>
<h2>
	WordPress instructions:
</h2>
<p>
	In the left menu, under “<strong>Pages</strong>”, click “<strong>Add New Page</strong>”.
	Then, where it says “Add title”, replace that with just three letters: <strong>now</strong>.
	That will ensure the URL is /now, and after it’s posted, you can change the title to “What I’m doing now” or whatever.
