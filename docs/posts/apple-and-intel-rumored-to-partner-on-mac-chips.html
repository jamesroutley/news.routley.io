    <h1>Apple and Intel Rumored to Partner on Mac Chips</h1>

<p>Kuo said Apple plans to utilize Intel&#39;s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/process/18a.html">18A process</a>, which is the &#34;earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America.&#34;</p>
<p>If this rumor proves to be accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.</p>
<p>TSMC would continue to supply the majority of Apple&#39;s M-series chips.</p>
<p>Kuo said that Apple choosing to have Intel supply its lowest-end M-series chip would appease the Trump administration&#39;s desire for &#34;Made in USA&#34; products, and it would also help Apple to diversify its supply chain for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020, and its own M-series chips continue to provide industry-leading performance per watt.</p>
<p>Apple previously announced that macOS Tahoe will be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/intel-macs-no-more-updates/">final major macOS release that supports Intel-based Macs</a> with x86 architecture.</p>
