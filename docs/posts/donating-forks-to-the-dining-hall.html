    <h1>Donating forks to the dining hall</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div> <p> May 29, 2024 </p><div> <p>A year and a half ago, the dining hall would run out of forks every evening. My roommates and I would inevitably have to eat with spoons.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to do something about it: I bought 180 forks.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.coc0o44.preview.ben.page/posts/forks/confirmation.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>But I had to make sure that my altruism would be commemorated. So I bought metal letter stamps on Amazon, and my roommate and I stamped our initials onto the back of every fork: a “B” for Ben, or an “H” for Henry.</p>

<p>Then, I had to quietly enter my forks into circulation.</p>
<p>For months, I would bring packs of 12 forks to the dining hall and spread them across my friends’ plates at the end of the meal before the dishes were returned.</p>
<p>But with the end of the year fast-approaching, and over 100 forks left, I went with the nuclear option: bringing all the remaining forks at once, and depositing them into a fresh bucket at the silverware station when no one was looking.</p>
<p>For the months that followed, I would look around and every once in a while see someone eating with one of my forks. (The design is a little different, so you can spot it from a distance.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I would even look down while eating and realize that I had by chance grabbed one of my forks for myself.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether I can take all the credit, but Dewick stopped having fork shortages. They did start running out of knives soon thereafter, but I decided that my generosity could only go so far.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Since I no longer live on-campus, I haven’t gone to a dining hall in a year.</p>
<p>But a few months ago, while eating at my girlfriend’s apartment, I flipped over my fork and found this:</p>
<p><img src="https://1.coc0o44.preview.ben.page/posts/forks/trisha.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The tenants who lived there the year before must have gone to Dewick and stolen some of the university’s silverware for themselves.</p>
