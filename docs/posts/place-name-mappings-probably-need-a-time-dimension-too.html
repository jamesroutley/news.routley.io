    <h1>Place name mappings probably need a time dimension too</h1>
    
    
<p>
I used to work at Facebook.  That was both the name of the service
with all of the cat pictures and the name of the company that paid me
every two weeks.  The cat picture part still has the same name, but the
parent company does not.  It&#39;s called Meta now.  I left well before any 
of that renaming happened.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I have plenty of pictures that predate that change on my 
Macs and other Apple devices.  They&#39;re mostly geotagged, but something
curious has happened to them: the name of the place has shifted.  It&#39;s
no longer &#34;Facebook HQ&#34;.  It&#39;s now &#34;Meta - Headquarters&#34;.  This is what
it looks like in the Apple photos app:
</p>
<img src="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/06/15/places/meta.png" width="500" height="263" alt="macOS photos app showing a photo of the &#34;MPK classic&#34; building map on the ground, taken at FB in 2014 but it&#39;s labeled &#34;Meta - Headquarters&#34; at top"/>
<p>
Given that this picture was taken in 2014, it was clearly not Meta
back then.  I know, the usual &#34;well actually&#34; people are warming up
their keyboards right about now: &#34;it used to be called that, and it&#39;s
the same company, so it&#39;s fine&#34; and so on and so forth.   I don&#39;t like 
that, but okay, whatever, let&#39;s say we accept that for the moment 
because it IS the same company with a different name.  Companies 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_(company)">do that</a>
all the time.
</p>
<p>
What if that picture of the ground had been taken in that same spot in
2004?  Would it still make sense to call it &#34;Meta - Headquarters&#34;?  I
hope you wouldn&#39;t say that.  Back then, that space was inhabited by Sun
Microsystems, a company that very much is not the same as Facebook.
(This is well before Oracle ate them - that was 2009-2010.)
</p>
<p>
What happens in another couple of years when Meta is the next smoking
crater in the tech landscape and then some other company tries to become 
the next unicorn in the mud flats of Menlo Park?  Or how about a couple
of decades past then when that whole area is underwater?  Will my
pictures say something like &#34;San Francisco Bay&#34;?
</p>
<p>
This why I would say that perhaps we need some time bounding on these
hyperlocal place names.  Now, I realize this is no small thing.  It&#39;s
one of those big-O blowup factors, and that&#39;s annoying for all involved.
Still, if you take the very long view on these things, something is
going to have to happen eventually.  Otherwise, our grandkids will have
pictures that we took that make no sense at all.
</p>
<p>
There should also be some actual humanity applied here.  Place names are
non-trivial, and many of them have captured a large amount of hateful
and just plain ignorant behavior.  That&#39;s why you can&#39;t just
automatically build up a list of &#34;this place was called this at this
time&#34;.  It needs people in the loop to make thoughtful decisions about
how to handle the more interesting ones.
</p>
<p>
Case in point:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Tahoe">Palisades Tahoe</a>.
I also have pictures that I took there many years ago.  I am
<em>more than fine</em> with them being rendered with its current name.  I 
know it wasn&#39;t called that when I was there.  Give it an asterisk if you 
must, but really, even that probably isn&#39;t needed.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what I mean when I say that we should be careful about this.
