    <h1>PSA II</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A bit later than <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/PSA_I.html">previously announced</a> I found some time to add a RSS feed to the blog. It&#39;s still experimental but is supposed to work.</p>
<p>Let me talk about the implementation, because I&#39;ve never written anything using RSS before. I wrote the feed generator in Python, because why not, and insisted on using tools that are not part of the Python standard distribution. I am famously opposed to drawing in external dependencies unless the project really requires that. Maybe that&#39;s just my Go experience leaking into other languages or me being surrounded by conservative IXP devops types, I don&#39;t really know. I am relatively happy with the code, though. It&#39;s fairly simple and kind of pretty for what it is. I just see it as another step towards my goal of making software braindead and simple. I would like to say “making it simple again”, but I&#39;m not even sure software ever was simple, so I&#39;m just leaving a footnote here that <em>maybe</em> software used to be simple.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to leave you with that. If you&#39;re interested in a more in-depth discussion on how I implemented this generator, feel free to either contact me through the usual channels (Github, e-mail, Gitter) or read through the source. It&#39;s far from scary and only around seventy lines of code. Have a beautiful weekend!</p>
