<p>I’m going through a phase of figuring out what I can get out of the cloud and “own”. Particularly with regard to streaming services.</p>



<p>I’ve never paid for Spotify. But I’ve had iTunes Match so that I can take all of the weird, not-on-streaming music that I have (I <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2013/06/going-digital-music/">wrote about this</a> back in 2013!!!!), and we have an Apple One family plan that gets us all Apple Music – this was the best deal for us as a family when we signed up.</p>



<p>But now I’m wanting to own my music again.</p>



<p>For a while I’ve been trying to get <strong><em>my</em></strong> music out of the cloud. The Apple Music app is really bad. I find doing the simplest things in it stupidly difficult. And I’m not about to switch to something else. Storage is easily cheap enough now that I can carry my whole library with me – this just wasn’t true 10 years ago and it changes the game a lot.</p>



<h2>A standalone, unconnected music device!</h2>



<p>For my birthday I got a <a href="https://www.fiio.com/echomini">Snowsky Echo Mini</a>, which is cute and has great sound quality and REAL BUTTONS (!) but a truly awful interface (they’re releasing pretty regular firmware updates though so hopefully it will improve).</p>



<p>This currently powers the speakers in my office, and it’s perfect for that. If the user interface improves enough, I’ll almost certainly take it out and about with me too.</p>



<h2>Laptop and Phone music</h2>



<p>And then I’ve been looking at software for my phone and computer to use. Today I’ve finally landed on a setup I’m happy with that gets my music out of the cloud, removes subscriptions, and lets me take it with me on my devices.</p>



<p><strong>MacOS</strong>: I recently found <a href="https://github.com/kushalpandya/Petrichor">Petrichor</a> (nice name!) – a free, open-source MacOS music player that is simple, effective and just works. It’s great!</p>



<p><strong>iOS</strong>: For iOS I’ve settled on <a href="https://brushedtype.co/doppler/">Doppler</a>. It’s a one-off £9 purchase, and you can sync songs to the phone over USB or Wirelessly using the free <a href="https://brushedtype.co/doppler-transfer/">Doppler Transfer</a> utility. Again, this setup is simple, effective, and makes complete sense to my last-century brain.</p>



<p>(Note that Doppler has a MacOS app too, but it’s £30 that I don’t want to spend right now, and, well, Petrichor is great!)</p>



<h2>Getting music</h2>



<p>Of course, I need to get music and get it onto these devices. For that I’ll either buy the DRM-free downloads from Apple or Bandcamp.</p>



<p>Or… much to the annoyance of my kids… I’m gonna scour every charity shop I pass looking for my tunes second-hand on CD. I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01G33IRYS">Hitachi-LG GP60</a> USB CD/DVD player for ripping.</p>



<p>This. Is. GREAT!</p>



<p>My music will be mine. I can delete it from the cloud. It won’t go away when I stop playing. I can have the best of both worlds as the family keeps the Apple Music subscription and I can tap into that for discovery. And I don’t have to use the horrible “Music” app any more.</p>



<p>Now… to instill into my kids the idea that you can <em>own</em> media. Oh, and to buy a BluRay player! Any recommendations?</p>
