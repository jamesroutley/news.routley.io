<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>



<p>The union — which secured 80% support before recognition — represents approximately 10 eligible editorial staff members. </p>



<p>With recognition, the Guild will begin the collective bargaining process to develop a contract. Employees are organizing to ensure job security, transparency, modern work practices and fair compensation and benefits. </p>



<p>“We welcome management’s decision to voluntarily recognize the Snopes Guild,” the Snopes Guild organizing committee said. “This is a great step toward creating a fairer workplace for all and we appreciate management’s willingness to engage with us. We look forward to meeting them at the bargaining table.” </p>



<p>Snopes was founded in 1994 and began with investigations into urban legends, hoaxes and folklore. As the publication grew, it became a <a href="https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories">signatory</a> of the International Fact Checking Network in compliance with the organization’s highest standards. Now, Snopes reporters produce complex explainers on celebrity rumors, scientific discoveries and political news — all while combating the day-to-day onslaught of misinformation online.  </p>



<p>The Snopes Guild <a href="https://newsguild.org/snopes-workers-announce-intent-to-unionize-citing-majority-support/" title="">went public on June 30</a> and is represented by Media Guild of the West, Local 39213 of The NewsGuild-CWA. </p>
