The program is expected to reduce traffic and raise $1 billion annually for public transit improvements.</p><p>It was a historic moment for New York’s leaders and transportation advocates after decades of failed attempts to advance congestion pricing even as other gridlocked cities around the world, including London, Stockholm and Singapore, proved that similar programs could reduce traffic and pollution.</p><p>While other American cities have introduced related concepts by establishing toll roads or closing streets to traffic, the plan in New York is unmatched in ambition and scale.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Congestion pricing is expected to reduce the number of vehicles that enter Lower Manhattan by about 17 percent, <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/127761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a November study</a> by an advisory committee reporting to the M.T.A. The report also said that the total number of miles driven in 28 counties across the region would be reduced.</p><p>“This was the right thing to do,” Janno Lieber, the authority’s chairman and chief executive, said after the vote. “New York has more traffic than any place in the United States, and now we’re doing something about it.”</p><p>Congestion pricing has long been a hard sell in New York, where many people commute by car from the boroughs outside of Manhattan and the suburbs, in part because some of them do not have access to public transit.</p><p>New York State legislators finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">approved congestion pricing in 2019</a> after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo helped push it through. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html" title="">series of recent breakdowns in the city’s subway system</a> had underscored the need for billions of dollars to update its aging infrastructure.</p><p>It has taken another five years to reach the starting line. Before the tolling program can begin, it must be reviewed by the Federal Highway Administration, which is expected to approve it.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Congestion pricing also faces legal challenges from six lawsuits that have been brought by elected officials and residents from across the New York region. Opponents have increasingly mobilized against the program in recent months, citing the cost of the tolls and the potential environmental effects from shifting traffic and pollution to other areas as drivers avoid the tolls.</p><p>A court hearing is scheduled for April 3 and 4 on a lawsuit brought by the State of New Jersey, which is seen as the most serious legal challenge. The mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., Mark J. Sokolich, has filed a related lawsuit.</p><p>Four more lawsuits have been brought in New York: by Ed Day, the Rockland County executive; by Vito Fossella, the Staten Island borough president, and the United Federation of Teachers; and by two separate groups of city residents.</p><p>Amid the litigation, M.T.A. officials have <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2024/02/16/mta-halts-contracts-amid-congestion-pricing-litigation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended some capital construction projects</a> that were to be paid for by the program, and they said at a committee meeting on Monday that crucial work to modernize subway signals on the A and C lines had been delayed.</p><p>Nearly all the toll readers have been installed, and will automatically charge drivers for entering the designated congestion zone at 60th Street or below. There is no toll for leaving the zone or driving around in it. Through traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the West Side Highway will not be tolled.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Under the final tolling structure, which was based on <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/127761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommendations</a> by the advisory panel, most passenger vehicles will be charged $15 a day from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. The toll will be $24 for small trucks and charter buses, and will rise to $36 for large trucks and tour buses. It will be $7.50 for motorcycles.</p><p>Those tolls will be discounted by 75 percent at night, dropping the cost for a passenger vehicle to $3.75.</p><p>Fares will go up by $1.25 for taxis and black car services, and by $2.50 for Uber and Lyft. Passengers will be responsible for paying the new fees, and they will be added to every ride that begins, ends or occurs within the congestion zone. There will be no nighttime discounts. (The new fees come on top of an existing congestion surcharge that was imposed on for-hire vehicles in 2019.)</p><p>The tolls will mostly be collected using the E-ZPass system. Electronic detection points have been placed at entrances and exits to the tolling zone. Drivers who do not use an E-ZPass will pay significantly higher fees — for instance, $22.50 instead of $15 during peak hours for passenger vehicles.</p><p>Emergency vehicles like fire trucks, ambulances and police cars, as well as vehicles carrying people with disabilities, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/nyregion/confused-about-congestion-pricing-heres-what-we-know.html" title="">exempted from the new tolls</a> under the state’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">congestion pricing legislation</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>As for discounts, low-income drivers who make less than $50,000 annually can apply to receive half off the daytime toll after their first 10 trips in a calendar month. In addition, low-income residents of the congestion zone who make less than $60,000 a year can apply for a state tax credit.</p><p>All drivers entering the zone directly from four tolled tunnels — the Lincoln, Holland, Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown — will receive a “crossing credit” that will be applied against the daytime toll. The credit will be $5 round-trip for passenger vehicles, $12 for small trucks and intercity and charter buses, $20 for large trucks and tour buses, and $2.50 for motorcycles. No credits will be offered at night.</p><p>Grace Ashford<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">Ana Ley</a></span> is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>New York Congestion Plan Is Approved, but Suits Await<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
