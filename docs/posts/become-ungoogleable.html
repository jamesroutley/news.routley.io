<p>I&#39;ve <a href="https://joeyh.name/robots.txt">removed my website from indexing by Google</a>.
The proximate cause is Google&#39;s new effort to
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">DRM the web</a>,
but there is of course so much more.</p>

<p>This is a unique time, when it&#39;s actually feasible to become ungoogleable
without losing much. Nobody really expects to be able to find anything of
value in a Google search now, so if they&#39;re looking for me or something I&#39;ve
made and don&#39;t find it, they&#39;ll use some other approach.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked over the kind of traffic that Google refers to my website, and
it will not be a significant loss even if those people fail to find me by
some other means. Over 30% of the traffic to this website is rss feeds.
Google just doesn&#39;t matter on the modern web.</p>

<p>The web will end one day. But let&#39;s not let Google kill it.</p>
