<p>This is the pilot version of a particle physics course for high-school students – a research-based product of CERN’s <a href="https://per.web.cern.ch" target="_blank">Physics Education Research</a> team. It contains 16 chapters with videos and quizzes and covers a core curriculum that introduces you to fundamental questions, such as “What is a particle?” or “What are charges and interactions?”, leading to more applied questions, such as “What is a particle accelerator?” and “What is a particle detector?”.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The total length of the pilot version of the course videos is close to 4 hours.</li>
	<li>The course features instructions for DIY experiments that you can try out at home.</li>
	<li>You can complete chapters in any order you like, so feel free to jump around and explore the full content of the course!</li>
	<li>If you complete all chapters by answering the corresponding quiz questions correctly, you qualify for a digital certificate!</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, we want to further develop this particle physics course. That’s why we have also included feedback questions for every chapter to collect your feedback on the content of the course and its design. <span>Indeed, we need you to tell us how to improve this course and which topics to add in the future! </span>Your feedback will, of course, be collected anonymously, and your responses will have no impact on your completion of the course! Here’s a trailer to give you an idea of what this course is all about:</p>

<div><p><span>Chapter 01</span>   What is a particle? <span>(10:17)</span></p></div>
<div><p>The development of this particle physics course for high-school students was based on a thorough review of educational theory, empirical research, and years of experience in particle physics education. Below, we provide insights into the rationale behind specific content decisions and how they can support student learning.</p></div>





<p>We’re excited to get you started! To access the particle physics course, you just need to create a <a href="https://users-portal.web.cern.ch/guest-registration" target="_blank">CERN guest account</a>.</p>

<p><label for="myCheckOver16"> I am 16 years old or above. </label></p>



<p><label for="myCheckUnder16"> I am younger than 16 years. </label></p>



<p>Once you have created a CERN guest account:</p>
