<p><em>What kind of a blight­ed soci­ety turns the word “snowflake” into an insult?</em>, I some­times catch myself think­ing, but then again, I’ve nev­er under­stood why “tree­hug­ger” should offend. All irony aside, being known as a per­son who loves nature or resem­bles one of its most ele­gant cre­ations should be a mark of dis­tinc­tion, no? At least that’s what <a href="http://snowflakebentley.com/WBresources.htm">Wil­son “Snowflake” Bent­ley</a> sure­ly thought.</p>

<p>The Ver­mont farmer, self-edu­cat­ed nat­u­ral­ist, and avid pho­tog­ra­ph­er, was the first per­son to offer the fol­low­ing wis­dom on the record, then illus­trate it with <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/wilson-bentley-pioneering-photographer-snowflakes/image-gallery-snowflakes">hun­dreds upon hun­dreds of pic­tures of snowflakes</a>, 5,000 in all:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I found that snowflakes were mir­a­cles of beau­ty; and it seemed a shame that this beau­ty should not be seen and appre­ci­at­ed by oth­ers. Every crys­tal was a mas­ter­piece of design and no one design was ever repeat­ed. When a snowflake melt­ed, that design was for­ev­er lost. Just that much beau­ty was gone, with­out leav­ing any record behind.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bent­ley left a con­sid­er­able record—though still an insignif­i­cant sam­ple size giv­en the scope of the object of study. But his pho­tographs give the impres­sion of an infi­nite vari­ety of dif­fer­ent types, each with the same basic crys­talline lat­tice­work struc­ture. He took his first pho­to­graph of a snowflake, the first ever tak­en, in 1885, by adapt­ing a micro­scope to a bel­lows cam­era, after years of mak­ing sketch­es and much tri­al and error.</p>

<p>Some great por­tion of this work must have been tedious and frustrating—Bentley had to hold his breath for each expo­sure lest he destroy the pho­to­graph­ic sub­ject. But it was worth the effort. Bent­ley, <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/wilson-bentley-pioneering-photographer-snowflakes">the Smith­son­ian</a> informs us, “was a pio­neer in ‘pho­tomi­crog­ra­phy,’ the pho­tograph­ing of very small objects.” Five hun­dred of his pho­tographs now reside at the Smith­son­ian Insti­tu­tion Archives, “offered by Bent­ley in 1903 to pro­tect against ‘all pos­si­bil­i­ty of loss and destruc­tion, through fire or acci­dent.” You can see a <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/wilson-bentley-pioneering-photographer-snowflakes/image-gallery-snowflakes">huge dig­i­tal gallery of those hun­dreds of pho­tos here</a>.</p>

<p>Along with U.S. Weath­er Bureau physi­cist William J. Humphreys, he pub­lished 2300 of his snowflake pho­tographs in a mono­graph titled <a href="http://amzn.to/2BofZU2"><em>Snow Crys­tals</em></a>. Bent­ley also pub­lished over 60 arti­cles on the sub­ject (<a href="http://snowflakebentley.com/WBresources.htm">read two of them here</a>). Despite his con­tri­bu­tions, he receives no men­tion in most <a href="https://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artmar10/history_photomicrography_ed3.pdf">his­to­ries of pho­tomi­crog­ra­phy</a>. This may be due to his provin­cial loca­tion (he nev­er left Jeri­cho, VT) or his lack of sci­en­tif­ic train­ing and cre­den­tials, or a lack of inter­est in pho­tos of snowflakes on the part of most pho­tomi­crog­ra­phy his­to­ri­ans.</p>

<p>Or it may be because Bent­ley was thought to be a fraud. When a Ger­man mete­o­rol­o­gist com­mis­sioned some images of his own and got some very dif­fer­ent results, he accused the farmer of retouch­ing. Bent­ley read­i­ly admit­ted it, say­ing, “a true sci­en­tist wish­es above all to have his pho­tographs as true to nature as pos­si­ble, and if retouch­ing will help in this respect, then it is ful­ly jus­ti­fied.”</p>

<p>The defense is a good one. Although the “nature” Bentley’s pho­tos show us may be a the­o­ret­i­cal ide­al­iza­tion, so too are the hand-ren­dered illus­tra­tions of most sci­en­tists through­out his­to­ry (and near­ly every med­ical dia­gram today). Take, for exam­ple, the <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/11/ernst-haeckels-sublime-drawings-of-flora-and-fauna.html">psy­che­del­ic, bright­ly col­ored pat­terns of accom­plished biol­o­gist Ernst Haeck­el</a>, who turned the micro- and macro­scop­ic world into sur­re­al­ly sym­met­ri­cal art in his draw­ings. Though he might not have said so direct­ly, Bent­ley was doing some­thing sim­i­lar with a cam­era. Just lis­ten to him describe his process in a 1900 issue of <em>Harper’s</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Quick, the first flakes are com­ing; the couri­ers of the com­ing snow storm. Open the sky­light, and direct­ly under it place the care­ful­ly pre­pared black­board, on whose ebony sur­face the most minute form of frozen beau­ty may be wel­come from cloud-land. The mys­ter­ies of the upper air are about to reveal them­selves, if our hands are deft and our eyes quick enough.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In the “qui­et fren­zy of his winter’s quest,”<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/341446/the-first-snowflake-photographs/"> writes Alli­son Meier at Hyper­al­ler­gic</a>, he pro­duced images of “beau­ti­ful ghosts from a win­ter that bris­tled the air over a cen­tu­ry ago.” Learn more about Bentley’s life, work, and the <a href="http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?view=&amp;date.slider=&amp;q=Wilson+A.+Bentley+snowflake+smithsonian+archives&amp;dsort=">Smith­son­ian col­lec­tion</a> in the short doc­u­men­tary fur­ther up, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/videonational/health-science/this-vermont-farmers-snowflake-photos-were-a-lifelong-passion/2017/01/11/5c4a63e2-d776-11e6-a0e6-d502d6751bc8_video.html?utm_term=.f8da2ce45c48"><em>Wash­ing­ton Post</em> video</a> above, and the <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/257203-snowflakes/">Radi­o­lab episode</a> below, in which a breath­less Latif Nass­er takes us into the heart of Bentley’s ori­gin sto­ry, and “snowflake expert and pho­tog­ra­ph­er <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/people/ken-libbrecht/">Ken Lib­brecht</a> helps set the record straight.”</p>

<p>Real snowflakes have many imper­fec­tions, and per­haps Bent­ley did snow a dis­ser­vice to so stren­u­ous­ly sug­gest oth­er­wise. But the record he left us, Meier notes, “is appre­ci­at­ed as much as an artis­tic archive as a mete­o­ro­log­i­cal one.” He might have been a sci­en­tist when it came to tech­nique, but Bent­ley was a roman­tic when it came to snow. His sto­ry is as fas­ci­nat­ing as his pho­tographs. Maybe a delight­ful alter­na­tive to the usu­al Christ­mas fare. There’s even a chil­dren’s book called… what else?…  <a href="http://amzn.to/2Br5IXi"><em>Snowflake Bent­ley</em></a>.</p>
