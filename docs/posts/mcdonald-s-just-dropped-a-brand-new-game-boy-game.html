<p>McDonald’s has just released a brand new Game Boy Color game that plays on actual hardware in 2023. Yes, you read that correctly.</p>
<p>Twenty five years after the release of the Game Boy Color, McDonald’s is still attempting to deliver a worthwhile Micky D’s video game.</p>
<p>This is quite a surprise to many of us hardcore Game Boy enthusiasts.</p>
<p>But with McDonald’s having just released an official <a href="https://retrododo.com/mcdonalds-tetris-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetris handheld</a> in China, it seems that they are really showing the retro scene some love.</p>
<p>We do know that the creation of this game coincides with Grimace’s fictional birthday of June 12th. And McDonald’s has also released a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/grimace-purple-mascot-big-mac-birthday-meal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited edition meal</a> as part of this celebration.</p>
<p>Perhaps somebody internally was not happy with the infamous <em>McDonaldland</em> game for the monochrome Game Boy (1992). And they hoped to offer something redeeming before their retirement.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason McDonald’s decided to commission an official Game Boy Color game now, we are happy they did!</p>
<h2>Grimace’s Birthday</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-1160x653.jpg" alt="McDonald&#39;s Grimace&#39;s Birthday" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-1160x653.jpg 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-50x28.jpg 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-320x180.jpg 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1-560x315.jpg 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday2-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"/></figure>
<p>The new Game Boy Color title, <a href="https://grimacesbirthday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grimace’s Birthday</a>, was produced by <a href="https://krooltoys.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krool Toys</a>.</p>
<p>And it was developed using GB Studio, a really wonderful program that makes Game Boy development much easier in 2023.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that the game was developed by somebody in our small niche community: <a href="https://www.gumpyfunction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumpy Function</a>.</p>
<p>Tom Lockwood (aka Gumpy Function) is the developer behind one of the absolute best homebrew Game Boy games, <a href="https://benjelter.itch.io/unearthed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unearthed</a>.</p>
<p>It is very cool to see that they helped bring us this new McDonald’s game.</p>

<p>From the moment you start Grimace’s Birthday, you can tell that this is a top notch game for the Game Boy Color.</p>
<p>Grimace’s Birthday is a fun little platforming experience with really cool graphics and simple but effective game play.</p>
<p>You play as Grimace attempting to locate his buddies so his birthday party can begin. And the game play primarily involves you skateboarding your way through some unique platforming levels.</p>
<p>From personal experience developing a Game Boy Color game, I can tell you that this project took quite a bit of time and talent to complete.</p>
<p>Gumpy Function did a great job producing the game, and it’s wild to imagine them receiving the call from McDonald’s requesting them to make a brand new Game Boy Color game.</p>

<p>If Grimace’s Birthday were released 20 years ago, it would have been a pretty solid title for the Game Boy. And we would have paid $20 to pick it up on a physical cartridge.</p>
<p>But today, twenty five years after the Game Boy Color was released, we can play Grimace’s Birthday for free on our web browser.</p>
<p>It is unclear if McDonald’s hoped to keep the game locked on their website or if there’s any particular reason they wouldn’t want us to have a ROM.</p>
<p>But needless to say, the internet was very quick to rip the file and share it online.</p>
<p>So many of us emulation fans grabbed a copy and loaded it onto our handhelds to give it a spin.</p>

<p>If you’d like to grab a digital ROM of Grimace’s Birthday, it’s currently available <a href="https://archive.org/details/grimaces-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just be sure to order some McDonald’s to support them. Who knows… if we keep eating McDonald’s, they might keep producing these oddball retro gaming related projects.</p>
<p>I, for one, will NEVER stop eating McDonald’s. You have my word.</p>
