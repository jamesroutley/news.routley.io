<p>Recently, I&#39;ve run across people adovcating for long
command line arguments. This got me thinking again about
a paradox I&#39;ve observed.</p>

<p>On their own, long command line flags are more readable.
However, I find that often, programs that opted into long
command line arguments far less usable. Programs that restrict
themselves exclusively to single character flags tend to be
easier to learn and remember</p>

<p>Lifting the restrictions and making an effectively infinite
number of flags possible means that a large number of flags get
used, and a large number of similar, rarely used options get
added, just in case.</p> 

<p>The small number of characters available in the alphabet
seems to force authors of programmers to think harder about
the flags that they are implementing. This results in more
usable programs.</p>

<p>As often happens, restrictions shape a culture, and cultures
strongly influence usability.</p>
