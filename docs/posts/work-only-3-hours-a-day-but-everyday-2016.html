    <h1>Work only 3 hours a day, but everyday (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		<p>I am an indie iPhone developer, and I’ve been working for 3 hours everyday for almost 2 years now. It may not work for everybody, but I started this habit in early 2014, and I have continued to do it since have I found that this is the most productive way to work for me.</p>
<h2>Taleb and DHH advices</h2>
<p>I first got this idea when I watched the talk by DHH (Rails creator) in the startup school.  </p>
<p>He was saying this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Working long hours isn’t productive at all, if you work for 8 hours, try for 5 hours, or only for 4 hours.  If you only have that time to work, you don’t have time to see Twitter while working.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, when I read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680">Antifragile</a> by Taleb, he mentioned that the trick to working in a productive way over a long period of time is to only work for a short amount of time every day. </p>
<p>Making money on the App Store is really tough, and people don’t care how many hours I spend on my apps. They only care if it is useful or not. This is a completely result oriented world, but personally, I like it.</p>
<p>I have always thought about how I can optimize my time to work effectively, and after I tried a lot of different ways, I found it best to limit my work time each session for the best result in the long run.</p>
<p>Spaces are a very important factor in UI design, and that theory holds true for working.</p>
<h2>Why 40 hours a week didn’t work</h2>
<p>I can choose how I spend my time since I am making my own apps, so first I’d been searching for the most effective way to divide my work time weekly and monthly.</p>
<p>There is no one who orders me to work, and I can rest anytime, so I made a quota first. For example, my first quota was 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>I calculated my work time using a stopwatch, and I checked like “Ah, I worked for hours today”, and “I went out yesterday, so I couldn’t work, so let’s work more today”.</p>
<p>However, even if I work for the same amount of hours, the productivity depends on the conditions for each day. When I am tired or in a bad environment, I can’t focus. The work quality was not consistent at all.</p>
<p>Often, even if I could focus for the first few hours, the more time would go on, the less I could focus.</p>
<h2>Work short hours every day</h2>
<p>Then, I made a rule to work only 3 hours every day without holidays. This is a bit extreme, but in this short hour limit, you are more motivated to work harder to make your working time meaningful.  </p>
<p>First, the most productive time for me is after I wake up, so I need to sleep well, and start working right after I wake up. I don’t read any news or SNS because even if I only read them a little bit, it could affect my productivity because it distracts my mind. </p>
<p>I even disable all notifications on my iPhone before I go to bed, so I don’t see them before I start working next day. </p>
<p>I prepare for each day seriously like an athlete who prepares for their games in the morning. There was a huge difference of productivity between a 9 hour work day and a 3 hour day.</p>
<h2>You really think about what to do</h2>
<p>This was a good discovery. When you have only a short amount of time, you care about what you do more than ever.</p>
<p>When I develop features on my apps, I think more seriously if I should do it. Is it really worth my time for today?  Is this project worth doing?</p>
<p>I cared about it before, but the seriousness increases when you have only a few hours to work a day.</p>
<h2>Less stuck for coding</h2>
<p>When you are coding, you get stuck quite often, and it can take a lot of hours to solve it sometimes. However, with my 3 hour work day, I find that this happens less since you can’t keep digging into the issue when you don’t have enough time anyway.</p>
<p>This way, you will be able to find the solution or come up with something the next day with a different viewpoint.</p>
<p>My challenge is that it is sometimes hard to go bed without solving some unknown issues, and you don’t want to stop coding in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when you take a break from the issues, you can think like “Well, it was not worth taking so much my time anyway…” in a calm mind the next day.</p>
<h2>What if when you are in the zone?</h2>
<p>Another pain for this method is that you should stop working anyway even when you are in the zone.</p>
<p>I often feel like I want to continue working when I am in the zone for some work. But, if you extend your work time rule once, you will do it again, then the more you extend, the more your productivity will drop.</p>
<p>It’s a hard trade off.</p>
<p>If I work for only a week, working more should produce more results, but when I work for a full month, the results from shorter work days will be more productive than if I was working longer days.</p>
<p>If I work for a year, I can complete my jobs more efficiently with this routine. I am sure I won’t retire after several years anyway.</p>
<h2>Keep working until I die</h2>
<p>Previously, I thought I would rather retire early and spend my life by having a fun without working at all.</p>
<p>With this method, I don’t get stressed so much even if I keep working years, so I thought I could keep working with fun until I die. This is the another surprising discovery I didn’t imagine before.</p>
<p>To stop working when I want to work more every day was the best way to keep working over a long period of time.  It might fit me to keep running like a marathon runner with a same pace instead of working hard and retire early.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>I got a lot of mails after I posted this post, so I answer some popular questions here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I was wondering how work other than coding fits that profile.  e.g. work with designer to prepare logo or any kind of promoting – that must be a part of your work as well, right?<br/>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you monetize?<br/>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you freelance, or are you available for hiring?<br/>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you do with the remaining time?<br/>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does it work for a freelancer?<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>I might change my habit completely in the future, if I come up with a brilliant startup idea, and want to work very hard on that every day.</p>
<p>I believe everyone has the right to choose how you use your time for the rest of your life.  I consistently think about it too.</p>
