Google has so far refused to hand over these documents to an attorney representing aggrieved former Google employees, citing attorney client privilege.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The fired employees filed a subpoena for these documents as part of an ongoing NLRB lawsuit against the company. Google fired the workers in 2019 after they organized against the company’s contracts with immigration detention agencies. In late 2020, the NLRB <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzg8n/heres-the-nlrb-complaint-alleging-google-illegally-fired-and-surveilled-workers">issued a federal complaint</a> against Google for illegally firing and surveilling the four software engineers. Google claimed at the time and maintains that it fired them for breaching security protocols.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In 2019, Google employees discovered that Google had hired a union avoidance firm called IRI Consultants. IRI Consultants is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdqaz/lazy-money-oriented-single-mother-how-union-busting-firms-compile-dossiers-on-employees">known for assisting employers</a> in anti-union campaigns by collecting information on workers’ personalities, finances, work ethic, motivations, and ethnicity in order to defeat union drives. At the time, Google was facing an unprecedented wave of employee protests and activism for issues related to sexual harassment, contracts with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai" target="_blank">Department of Defense</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/google-workers-question-contract-with-customs-and-border-agency" target="_blank">Customers and Border Protection</a>. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In his ruling on the documents related to Project Vivian, the NLRB judge describes evidence he reviewed of a situation where a Google attorney proposed to find a “respected voice to publish an OpEd outlining what a unionized tech workplace would look like, and counseling employees of FB (Facebook), MSFT(Microsoft), Amazon, and google (sic) not to do it.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kara Silverstein, Google’s human resources director said that she “like[d] the idea” of the op-ed, but that it should be executed so that “there would be no fingerprints and not Google specific.” IRI Consultants eventually provided a proposed draft of the op-ed to a Google attorney, according to the judge’s report. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The secret documents pertaining to Google’s Project Vivian also reveal that “the decision to hire IRI was not made by lawyers but by a group composed primarily of non-attorneys” including Silverstein, Google’s human resources director and Danielle Brown, Google’s vice president of employee engagement. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Project Vivian also included discussions of Google employees’ “opposition to mandatory arbitration,” the judge’s report says. Ending forced arbitration at Google has previously been a crucial rallying point for employee activists at Google. The company agreed to end mandatory arbitration in February 2019, following employee protests.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The underlying case here has nothing to do with unionization, it&#39;s about employees breaching clear security protocols to access confidential information and systems inappropriately,” a Google spokesperson said. “We disagree with the characterization of the legally privileged materials referred to by the complainants. As we’ve stated, our teams engage with dozens of outside consultants and law firms to provide us with advice on a wide range of topics, including employer obligations and employee engagement. This included IRI Consultants for a short period. However, we made a decision in 2019 not to use the materials or ideas explored during this engagement, and we still feel that was the right decision.&#34;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Earlier this year, Google identified 1,507 documents pertaining to the subpoena request for documents related to Google’s anti-union campaign.</p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Do you have a tip to share about Google or Project Vivian?
