    <h1>No focus, no fights, and a bad back – 16 ways technology has ruined my life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>L</span>et’s be fair: technology has improved my life in ways that still surprise and delight me on a daily basis. My phone is also a torch! My TV remembers how far I got in last night’s episode, even if I don’t! The bus stop knows when the bus is ­coming, and I can watch my ­pizza’s entire journey from the restaurant to my house! These are, frankly, miracles.</p><p>But there have been corresponding sacrifices. Over 20 years, I have turned over whole areas of competence, memory, authority and independence to the machines in my life. Along the way, I have become anxious about problems that didn’t used to exist, indecisive over choices I never used to have to make, and angry about things I would once have been wholly unaware of.</p><p>There are probably hundreds of ways in which ­technology has ruined my life. But let’s start with 16 of them.</p><p><strong>2. It’s destroying my posture</strong></p><p><strong>3. Life sometimes feels like an unending struggle to prove I’m not a robot</strong></p><p><strong>4. It has rendered meetings inescapable</strong></p><p><strong>5. I’m no longer able to have arguments in pubs</strong></p><p><strong>6. I find it increasingly hard to turn things on</strong></p><p>Weirdly, the virtual world is full of old-fashioned mechanical emulators – animated buttons that make a clicking sound; knobs and sliders you can manipulate with your cursor – while in the realm of actual stuff the controls have been reduced to flat black panels covered with inscrutable symbols: a crescent moon; a lightning bolt; a circle with an M inside, where M stands for Mode.</p><p>I know how old this makes me sound, but I can’t believe the young people of today are clamouring for wifi-enabled kettles.</p><p><strong>7. It’s given me unfiltered access to the opinions of stupid people</strong></p><p><strong>8. It’s given stupid people unfiltered access to each other’s opinions</strong></p><p><strong>9. I am </strong><strong>demonstrably worse at typing than I was 10 years ago</strong></p><p><strong>10. I feel a strange obligation to monitor bad news in real time</strong></p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><strong>11. I live in fear of being scammed</strong></p><p><strong>12. I’m forced to live in silent, shameful defiance of all the accepted wisdom regarding passwords</strong></p><p><strong>13. It’s created a requirement to go everywhere forewarned and forearmed</strong></p><p><strong>14. I have consistently risen to the level of disorganisation that any new technology allows</strong></p><p><strong>15. As much as I resent technology, I am helpless without it</strong></p><p><strong>16. The rest of the world is also helpless without it</strong></p><p>In the service of journalism, I have occasionally ­subjected myself to specific technological deprivations: a week without a smartphone; a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/17/would-life-be-happier-without-google-i-spent-a-week-finding-out" data-link-name="in body link">month without Google</a>, that sort of thing. And I’m here to tell you that when you ­forsake modern technology the world ­generally refuses to take part in the experiment. You find this out the first time someone behind a ticket ­window looks you in the eye and tells you to just ­download the app.</p><p>You can’t win, and you can’t quit.</p></div></div></div>
