by Leonard Tramiel When Chuck Peddle was given the go ahead to bring his ideas of what would become the PET computer into reality many of the ingredients were only loosely constrained. One example is the character set. It would clearly need to have alpha-numeric characters and the basic punctuation. But that was far  too limiting for many recreational uses of the machine. It should be possible to create a set of graphics characters that would allow a wide range of images to be created yet still have the hardware simplicity of a character based system. He knew that one of the likely uses of the computer was going to be card games. The game of Blackjack was a favorite of both Chuck and my dad. That meant the only thing that was well defined about the set was that it needed to have the four suits; hearts, clubs, spades and diamonds. He gave me the task of designing that character set. Each screen location would store an 8 bit number, 256 possibilities. The top bit would swap on and off pi

by Leonard Tramiel Shortly after Commodore bought MOS Technology Dad told me that he needed my help to evaluate a proposal he had been been given by an MOS employee. Chuck Peddle told my father that he was going to build a personal computer. If Commodore wanted the product he would do it as an employee. If they didn&#39;t them he would quit and do it on his own. The fact that dad wanted my opinion was quite a shock. I was in my early 20s at the time and the idea that my dad would ask for my help on a business decision was unprecedented. I had worked at Commodore during the summers while in college. Starting with working in the warehouse. One summer, based on my interest in science and technology I learned to repair electronic calculators. Yes, there was a time when that was possible. I learned a LOT that summer. During a later summer I went to work with dad and went to the group designing Commodore&#39;s most advanced calculators. These were based on fully custom chips of this group&amp;#3

by Leonard Tramiel VIC concept computer at Chicago summer CES 1980. Photo by John Feagans. As mentioned in another  one of these posts, I was asked by my dad to give him my opinion of going along with Chuck Peddle’s idea for a computer. Shortly after working in the team that developed that machine from idea to fully working prototype I left Commodore to further my education. While in my apartment in New York City I got a call from Dad asking me to do the same thing again. One of the engineers at MOS Technologies had made a demo to show what could be done with one of their chips. It was going to be displayed at CES in Chicago and dad wanted me there to see it and tell him what I thought. I went to Chicago, to the all too familiar environment of a trade show. I had been regularly going to these shows since I was about 12. Often giving demos of Commodore’s calculators to the throngs of people in attendance. The show was like all the others, but instead of spending my time in the public ar
