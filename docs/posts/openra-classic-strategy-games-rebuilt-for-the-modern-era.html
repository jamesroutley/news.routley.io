  <li>Fixed several palette remapping issues and restored the ability to select darker player colors</li>
  <li>Implemented a new custom Lua wrapper which improves error reporting for map scripters</li>
  <li>Introduced a modular asset installer which allows for installation of the classic assets via Steam or the EA app</li>

<p>And before we wrap up, we would like mention that this release contains significant progress towards C&amp;C Remastered Collection support, including compatibility with the new EA app. The “Tiberian Dawn HD” playtest is a separate release and can be <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/playtest-20230801">downloaded here</a>. This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20230801 playtest. However, please keep in mind that performance, memory usage and loading times have not been optimized yet. The C&amp;C Remastered Collection must be installed through Steam or the EA App, and in case you are using macOS or Linux the project README provides you <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation">detailed installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates and be sure to take part in the playtest. Don’t forget to share your feedback with us on <a href="https://forum.openra.net/">our forum</a>, <a href="https://discord.openra.net">community Discord server</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues">GitHub</a>. Enjoy the summer gaming season with OpenRA!</p>
