<p>Welcome back, Commanders!</p>

<p>Introducing the newly revamped Map Editor, designed with a modern interface and a cohesive design. We took notice of how players use the editor and reimagined it to better align with your creative needs.</p>

<p>New Map Editor features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>draggable selections</li>
  <li>draggable actors</li>
  <li>measurement tools</li>
  <li>a marker layer</li>
  <li>a play button</li>
  <li>and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>We added an encyclopedia to the Tiberian Dawn mod! This feature was inspired by the community’s desire for an in-game resource to consolidate knowledge about units, structures, and technologies. While fan-made wikis have been invaluable, many have become outdated or inconsistent as the game evolves.</p>

<p>This latest release has significantly improved support for HD art assets. You should notice faster load times and overall performance improvements for the “Tiberian Dawn HD” project. It is packaged as a separate release and can be <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/playtest-20241116">downloaded here</a>. This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20241116 playtest. The C&amp;C Remastered Collection must be installed through Steam or the EA App, and if using macOS or Linux, the project README provides <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation">detailed installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Other notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>game assets can now be installed from the Steam release of The Ultimate Collection</li>

</ul>
