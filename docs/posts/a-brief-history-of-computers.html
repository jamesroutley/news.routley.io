    <h1>A brief history of computers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>Have you ever heard someone say that a disk or memory is a “bunch of bits”?</p>

<p>I’m not sure about this idea’s origin, but it’s a pretty good idea. It reduces the mystery of computers. For example, it rules out the theory that inside of my computer is a very flat elf.</p>

<p>No, inside are bits, encoded on electrical components.</p>


<p>Yet, computers are still pretty mysterious. What <em>are</em> these bits? What do they mean? Can we play with them, parse them, make sense of them?</p>

<p>In this post, I will show you that, yes, absolutely we can! For your entertainment, I am going to stick my hand into my computer, pull up a bunch of bits, and we will examine and make sense of them.</p>

<p>What bits, exactly, should we explore? For this exercise, let’s pick apart how a disk-backed file is represented on disk.</p>

<p>Say we have a file called <code>/data/example.txt</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ cat /data/example.txt

Hello, world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s one big question: where does “Hello, world!” live?</p>

<p>Also, you may know that files have permissions (e.g. the file is executable), an owner, creation timestamp, etc. Where is this metadata stored?</p>

<p>I mean, literally, where are the actual bits that store this information? Let’s find them and try to parse them.</p>

<p>First, a bit of theory.</p>


<p>The following applies to the ext4 filesystem commonly used in Linux (and, in fact, the whole article is ext4-specific). These concepts are common to most filesystems, though.</p>

<p>What even is <code>/data/example.txt</code>? It’s what we call a <em>directory entry</em>. A directory entry is just a human-readable name – <code>example.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Directory entries are stored on disk, but they are not terribly interesting, because they are just names.</p>

<p>A name <em>names</em> something, right? What does <code>example.txt</code> name? The thing it names is called an <em>inode</em>.</p>

<p>inodes <em>are</em> interesting. When you say, “a file lives on disk”, what you really mean is, “an inode lives on disk”. They are the on-disk collections of bits that describe a file.</p>

<p>An inode stores pretty much everything about a file, like the metadata we mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>We’re almost done with the theory. You should also know that inodes, files, and directory entries are all elements of what’s called a <em>filesystem</em>. A filesystem is the software that takes the bits on your disk and turns them into familiar files and directories.</p>

<p>With that, we’re ready to get our hands dirty.</p>


<p>Let’s start our exploration by listing some of the inode metadata. To do that, we can use <code>stat</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> /data/example.txt

  File: /data/example.txt
  Size: 14              Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: 831h/2097d      Inode: 11          Links: 1
Access: <span>(</span>0664/-rw-rw-r--<span>)</span>  Uid: <span>(</span> 1000/  dmitry<span>)</span>   Gid: <span>(</span> 1000/  dmitry<span>)</span>
Access: 2023-07-18 13:53:20.808536879 +0100
Modify: 2023-07-10 15:18:48.199691583 +0100
Change: 2023-07-18 14:52:26.349625767 +0100
 Birth: 2023-07-10 15:18:48.199691583 +0100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t try too hard to understand all of the output. Just notice that you see metadata like the file size, owner, and timestamps. Everything you see comes from the inode (other than the name, which came from the directory entry<a name="inode-number-return"></a><sup><a href="#inode-number">[Also, the inode number itself]</a></sup>).</p>


<p>But we want to see the raw bits for this inode, right? How can we see the raw bits?</p>

<p>Long-time kernel developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Ts%27o">Ted Ts’o</a> maintains a set of filesystem debugging tools called e2fsprogs. We can use one of these tools, debugfs, to play with the inode.</p>

<p>debugfs has a cool command that will spit out the raw binary for an inode. From the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/debugfs.8.html">manpage</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>inode_dump filespec
    Print the contents of the inode data structure in hex and
    ASCII format.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, here comes the raw binary I promised. Except, it’s not going to be binary like 0011000. It’s much easier for humans to read binary when it’s converted into a representation called <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/hexadecimal/">hexadecimal</a>, so that’s what we’ll use.</p>

<p>Makes sense? Cool – thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Just kidding. Look, actually seeing the raw data of the inode is slightly cool, but we still don’t know <em>where</em> on disk this lives and what the bits actually mean.</p>


<p>So, let’s find the raw inode on disk. To do that, we can again use debugfs:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>imap filespec
    Print  the location of the inode data structure (in the inode table) of the
    inode filespec.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, let’s find the location.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>debugfs:  imap example.txt                                                                  
Inode 11 is part of block group 0
        located at block 73, offset 0x0a00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let me decipher this: a filesystem is broken up into blocks. In my case, a block is 4,096 bytes (this is the default for many Linux distributions). So, this output is saying “start at the beginning of the filesystem, and walk forward 73 blocks, i.e. 73*4096 bytes”. That sort of tells us what street the inode is on. The house number is the offset: <code>0x0a00</code> bytes. In decimal, that’s 2560 bytes.<a name="2560-return"></a><sup><a href="#2560">[Why 2560?]</a></sup></p>

<p>So, to find our inode, we need to start at the beginning of the disk partition (which is also the beginning of the filesystem), then skip forward <code>4096 * 73 + 2560 = 301568</code> bytes.</p>

<p>Let’s do it! Let’s dump the raw bits from my disk and see if they match the <code>debugfs inode_dump</code> output.</p>

<p>Here is where the ASCII interpretation at the right comes in handy: visually, we can see that this stuff looks identical to the raw bits from <code>debugfs inode_dump</code>! We found where the inode lives on disk!</p>

<p>This feels way cooler than the <code>inode_dump</code> output did. In that case, we had asked a program written by a core kernel developer to please tell us what the inode looked like. In this case, we found the information directly on the disk ourselves.</p>

<p>But we still don’t know what these bits mean. Can we parse them?</p>


<p>If you’re enjoying yourself, may I ask if you’d like to follow me via <a href="https://www.cyberdemon.org/feed.xml">RSS feed</a>, <a href="https://file-explorers.club/@dmitry">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://cyberdemon.substack.com/?r=kk1l&amp;utm_campaign=pub&amp;utm_medium=web">email</a>, or <a href="https://t.me/cyberdemon6">Telegram channel</a>? Thanks!</p>


<p>For a few weeks, I sat on this. How do we ask a computer to turn a bunch of bits into an inode?</p>

<p>Then it hit me: that is exactly what a struct is for!</p>

<p>You may have come across structs. They’re sort of like objects from dynamic languages, except confusing.</p>

<p>Well, here’s how I think about structs now: let’s say you come across a bunch of bits. A struct is simply a specification of what those bits mean.</p>

<p>With that realization in hand, the Linux kernel must define a struct for the inode somewhere, right? <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/fdf0eaf11452d72945af31804e2a1048ee1b574c/fs/ext4/ext4.h#L769">It does</a>!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * Structure of an inode on the disk
 */</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ext4_inode</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>__le16</span>	<span>i_mode</span><span>;</span>		<span>/* File mode */</span>
	<span>__le16</span>	<span>i_uid</span><span>;</span>		<span>/* Low 16 bits of Owner Uid */</span>
	<span>__le32</span>	<span>i_size_lo</span><span>;</span>	<span>/* Size in bytes */</span>
    <span>/* ... */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I will repeat, for effect: this struct is exactly how the ext4 filesystem knows how to parse the bits we saw previously! This is the skeleton key.</p>

<p>It says, basically: the first 16 bits are the file permissions, the next 16 bits are the owner, and the next 32 are the file size, and so on<a name="padding-1-return"></a><sup><a href="#padding-1">[It’s a tad more complicated because of padding.]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Let’s use this struct to parse the raw bits from before!</p>

<p>We are going to write a small C program that will do the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask the computer to set aside 256 bytes in memory (because that’s how big an ext4_inode struct is).</li>
  <li>Ask it to copy 256 bytes from <code>/dev/sdd1/</code>, at location 301568, into that memory.</li>
  <li>Tell it how to parse those bytes using our ext4_inode struct.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s the above program in C (boiled down to its essence).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// open the partition file</span>
<span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;/dev/sdd1/&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>O_RDONLY</span><span>);</span>

<span>// seek to the inode location</span>
<span>lseek</span><span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>301568</span><span>,</span> <span>SEEK_SET</span><span>);</span>

<span>// initialize the struct and copy 256 bytes from disk to memory</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ext4_inode</span> <span>candidate_inode</span><span>;</span>
<span>read</span><span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>candidate_inode</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>ext4_inode</span><span>));</span>

<span>// now we can access the fields of the inode!</span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;User:  %u&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>inode</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>i_uid</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmazin/ed608be38e4b0ec7ed2db65a74bc123a">the full program, with error checking</a>. If you want, you can build it and try it on your own computer.</p>

<p>Let’s run it! Are you excited?! If this works, that means we have wrangled the bits. We have sussed out their structure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span> ./parse /dev/sdd1 301568

Inode: 11   Mode:  0664

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yay! We’ve got ourselves a valid inode!</p>

<p>To verify that this output makes sense, here’s the output of <code>debugfs stat example.txt</code>. Look, every common field – importantly, the checksum – match!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>debugfs: stat example.txt

<p>To me, this is super cool. We set out to find the raw bits for an inode on disk, found them, and then made sense of the bits.</p>


<p>Now, we’re not done just yet.</p>

<p>At the beginning, I said that disks <em>and memory</em> are bunches of bits. Our program copies the raw inode bits into memory, right?</p>

<p>That means we should be able to find those bits, in memory, and confirm that they are the same bits that came from disk<a name="padding-2-return"></a><sup><a href="#padding-2">[Note about struct padding]</a></sup>!</p>

<p>To do this, let’s run our program in a debugger called <code>gdb</code> (kind of like Python’s <code>pdb</code>). We’ll use it to pause the program’s process, and then spy on the process’s memory.</p>

<p>Let’s compare that to the raw bits from disk:</p>

<p>They match!</p>

<p>(The asterisk just means that the row was all 0’s. A keen observer would also notice that the last 16 bytes of 0s are missing from the <code>gdb</code> output – I think due to a compiler optimization).</p>

<p>What this shows is that the bits on disk and the bits in memory are the same. In retrospect, it may be obvious, but we have seen it with our very own eyes.</p>


<p>I know what you’re thinking: we haven’t actually seen the file contents!</p>

<p>It’s true. The inode does not itself store the file contents. They are elsewhere.</p>

<p>Allow me to briefly explain why. You can think of a filesystem as having two components: a bunch of boxes to put file contents into, and a database for managing those boxes. It’s sort of like a distributed system, where you store records in a database (all the metadata), but you put actual file blobs in something like S3 or a disk.</p>

<p>So, the inode doesn’t actually hold the contents; it points to them.</p>

<p>Let’s use debugfs to parse the location from the inode. From the manpage:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>blocks filespec
    Print the blocks used by the inode filespec to stdout.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>debugfs:  blocks example.txt
33280
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this says is that the contents are 33,280 4 KiB blocks from the start of the filesystem.<a name="struct-extents-location-return"></a><sup><a href="#struct-extents-location">[Could we have gotten the location straight from the inode struct?]</a></sup></p>

<p>Let’s dump the disk at that location!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdd1 skip=33280 bs=4096 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null | hexdump -C
00000000  48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77  6f 72 6c 64 21 0a 00 00  |Hello, world!...|

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There it is! Our hello world, hot and fresh from disk!</p>


<p>So, what have we learned? What have we done?</p>

<p>We started with the common refrain that a disk, and memory, are just bunches of bits.</p>

<p>So we set out on a quest to become familiar with those bits. Specifically, the bits that encode disk-backed files: inodes.</p>

<p>We got very familiar with said bits: we found them on disk, parsed them using a program that loaded them into memory and applied a struct to them, and then turned around and saw the very same bits in memory.</p>

<p>Along the way, we learned a little bit about the ext4 filesystem (and filesystems in general), too!</p>

<p>When I performed this exercise for myself, it was one of the most revelatory experiences I’ve had on a computer. It reduced the mystery. I hope the mystery has been reduced for you too.</p>


<p><a name="inode-number"></a><strong>Also, the inode number itself</strong></p>

<p>Well, also, the inode number itself (11 in this case) isn’t stored in the inode either. Instead, it’s the inode’s position in the inode table. <a href="#inode-number-return">(back)</a></p>

<p><a name="2560"></a><strong>Why 2560?</strong></p>

<p>Recall that this inode’s number is 11. That means that, on disk, there are 10 inodes before this one. Each inode is 256 bytes, so those inodes take up 2560 bytes. <a href="#2560-return">(back)</a></p>

<p><a name="padding-1"></a><strong>It’s a tad more complicated because of padding</strong></p>

<p>Technically, the compiler will pad the struct, which means it will insert empty space throughout the struct. So, in that sense, the struct doesn’t <em>exactly</em> specify the order of the bits. However, given that the inode was generated on the same computer where it will be read, this means that the struct truly <em>is</em> the skeleton key to the seemingly random bits. <a href="#padding-1-return">(back)</a></p>

<p><a name="padding-2"></a><strong>Note about struct padding</strong></p>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned that the compiler pads the struct, adding extra bytes between the fields. This would make the in-memory representation hard to compare to the on-disk representation, so I prevented padding as much as possible by appending <code>__attribute__((__packed__))</code> to the struct definition. That is why in the memory dump I pasted, we only printed 160 bytes – that is <code>sizeof(struct ext4_inode)</code> when padding is disabled. <a href="#padding-2-return">(back)</a></p>

<p><a name="struct-extents-location"></a><strong>Could we have gotten the location straight from the inode struct?</strong></p>

<p>We could also parse the location from the inode we loaded into memory, via the <code>i_block</code> field, but the contents are a slightly cryptic array that it takes a bit of code to decode. It was easier to just call on the debugfs code to do it for us. For the curious, here’s what that array looks like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) p candidate_inode-&gt;i_block
$1 = {127754, 4, 0, 0, 1, 33280, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see the 33280 from debugfs’s output in that array. <a href="#struct-extents-location-return">(back)</a></p>
