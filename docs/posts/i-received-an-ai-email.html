    <h1>I Received an AI Email</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, July 1st, I received an email from a &#34;Raymond&#34;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>Enjoyed reading your post on revamping your homelab. It’s great to see your
continuous improvement journey!</p>
<p>Noticed you’re using Deno Fresh for your blog. Managing updates and
deployments must be quite the task.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve built Wisp, a CMS that simplifies content management, perfect for your
needs.</p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Best, Raymond</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought this was from a reader, because of the first sentence, that
happened to work on a CMS called Wisp. But something was off, since they saw
that I used Deno Fresh for my blog I assumed that they must have dove a bit
deeper before saying a CMS is &#34;perfect for your needs&#34;. But if they had made an
effort they could have found out that I use plaintext Markdown and that I enjoy
that workflow because it&#39;s set up using CI/CD.</p>
<p>I went to check out Wisp CMS and saw that it was headless CMS, alright. Then I
went straight to their blog, and saw that the latest blogpost, from today July
2nd, was &#34;<a href="https://www.wisp.blog/blog/how-i-use-ai-agents-to-send-1000-personalized-email-for-outreach">How I Use AI Agents to Send 1000 Personalized Email for Outreach</a>&#34;.
And right there in the featured image of the post was almost excately the email
I had received.</p>
<p>And then I remembered one of the links from <a href="https://timharek.no/blog/2024-june-recently">last month</a>, a blogpost by Neven
Mrgan: <a href="https://mrgan.com/ai-email-from-a-friend/">How it feels to get an AI email from a friend</a></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think this is the one and the same, but there are similarities. If
&#34;Raymond&#34; had made an effort to write this email and showed me how their CMS
would solve something for my particilar blog, I would most likely checked it out
with an open mind, but they didn&#39;t do that.</p>
<p>And their blogpost starts of with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever received an email that felt so personalized, so tailored to your
interests and experiences, that you couldn&#39;t help but be intrigued? What if I
told you that email wasn&#39;t crafted by a human, but by an artificial
intelligence (AI) agent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really have words for this, but I dislike this. Another part of the
post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used AI agents to send out nearly 1,000 personalized emails to developers
with public blogs on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that I should private my GitHub-mirror to my personal blog,
because this can become a common thing? I have removed my email from my
GitHub-profile now, but they can probably get it from my Git-log anyway...</p>
<p>Thanks Raymond, I hate spam.</p>
