      <span>Abstract:</span>  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHs) are a fascinating byproduct of
galaxy mergers in the hierarchical universe. In the last stage of their orbital
evolution, gravitational wave radiation drives the binary inspiral and produces
the loudest siren awaiting to be detected by gravitational wave observatories.
Periodically varying emission from active galactic nuclei has been proposed as
a powerful approach to probe such systems, although none of the identified
candidates are close to their final coalescence such that the observed periods
stay constant in time. In this work, we report on the first system with rapid
decaying periods revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves, which has
decreased from about one year to one month in three years. Together with its
optical hydrogen line spectroscopy, we propose that the system is an uneven
mass-ratio, highly eccentric SMBH binary which will merge within three years,
as predicted by the trajectory evolution model. If the interpretation is true,
coordinated, multi-band electromagnetic campaign should be planned for this
first binary SMBH merger event observed in human history, together with
possible neutrino measurements. Gravitational wave memory from this event may
also be detectable by Pulsar Timing Array with additional five-to-ten year
observation.
