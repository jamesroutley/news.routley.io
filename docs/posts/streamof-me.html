        <p>On winter solstice I had my personal &#34;new-year&#34; and I started an experimental <a href="https://www.streamof.me/?ref=fractalkitty.com" rel="noreferrer">journal of self</a>. My motivation was to see if my experiences and awareness change through the type of journaling that I do. Will tallying the days that I glimpse the moon, counting the number of bird species spotted, or writing a cinquain enable a more present self, a more meditative state, or a different self-awareness? My hypothesis is yes. </p><blockquote><strong>What is the mathematics of self and how does observing, hypothesizing, and experimenting change you?</strong></blockquote><p>Let&#39;s jump into the details of what I&#39;ve been doing, what I&#39;ve observed, how I have done it and where I am going. </p><h2 id="birds"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/birds/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Birds</a></h2><ul><li>What I track<ul><li>Every day I  note how many bird species I see</li><li>A small note on location (most are &#34;BY&#34; or Backyard).</li></ul></li><li>What I&#39;ve observed<ul><li>At first new species were daily, but now it&#39;s a big day when I get to add a bird for this year. </li><li>The days I see many birds are the days that I am more present - it means I am looking up.</li><li>By knowing I am counting birds, I look out the window more often and pick the right spots to walk</li><li>Listening for birds while sitting in nature is meditation. It is labeling sounds and being in the space awareness of thought, no thought, and the simplicity of noting: Townsend, Ruby-crowned, Ruby-crowned, Crow, Mallard, Ruby-crowned...</li></ul></li><li>How I track and where I am going:<ul><li>While I&#39;m out and about I just keep a temporary note on my phone for the day. (Merlin is great for confirmation with sounds if I am unsure.)</li></ul></li><ul><li>I update a Numbers spreadsheet at night by throwing a 1 if a bird is seen or adding a row for a new bird.</li><li>I hope to create some visuals with this data of me at some point, but am still pondering how I want to do this. </li></ul></ul><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image.png" alt="a spreadsheet showing bird names on the left and 1 or zero  in the columns for days seen" loading="lazy" width="1752" height="1486" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image.png 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image.png 1752w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="distance"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/distance/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Distance</a></h2><ul><li>What I track<ul><li>I note the distance traveled on foot (running/walking)</li><li>I add notes or thoughts from my time on foot</li></ul></li><li>What I&#39;ve observed<ul><li>By tracking my distance I have seen a slight increase in the distance I have covered on my health tracking, but not a ton.</li><li>Reflecting on my thoughts while walking has been beneficial before bed. It calls to memory the beauty of my day. </li></ul></li><li>How I track and where I am going:<ul><li>In the same Numbers file I note my distances and notes.</li><li>I use a color to show my distance on a 19x19 grid with 4 extra days. (This is done with a ton of CSS using each 0.1km as a different color.)<ul><li>19 is the largest square number that fits in 365</li></ul></li><li>I plan to look for patterns as I go, but nothing yet.</li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png" alt="A 19x19 grid with 4 extra at the bottom. more than 2.5 rows are shown with shades of grey and the rest are white." loading="lazy" width="1246" height="1308" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-1.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png 1246w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="tallies"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/tallies/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Tallies</a></h2><ul><li>What I track<ul><li>Instead of streaks and stress, I wanted to just note the days in a tally that I glimpse the moon, am aware the sun is rising, play music, talk to a tree, take time to stretch (I have a yin yoga practice).</li></ul></li><li>What I&#39;ve observed<ul><li>I feel like tallies are the way to go for me. There is no guilt or hamster-wheel pressure to maintain streaks. </li><li>By noting that I am aware, and that is all. </li><li>By knowing that I am noting, I make time for these things sometimes when I might not have otherwise. <ul><li>When I get up in the middle of the night - I open the curtain a crack and glimpse the moon</li><li>I am more aware of the sunrise getting earlier and when the perihelion occurred.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>How I track and where I am going:<ul><li>I note my tallies in the same Numbers file</li><li>I use a font to tally where each letter in the font is a symbol for this page. (music is n-p, stretch is a-o, sunrise is S,V,or T, etc)</li><li>I don&#39;t plan to do more than I am doing at this point. I may change what I tally in a following year, but I&#39;m not there yet. </li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="cinquains"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/cinquains/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Cinquains</a></h2><ul><li>What I do<ul><li>I write a daily cinquain</li></ul></li><li>What I&#39;ve observed<ul><li>I am finding that by knowing I will write a poem at the end of the day, I note my poetic thoughts throughout the day. (this also happened in a previous <a href="https://www.fractalkitty.com/serendipitous-oulipo-haiku/">haiku project</a>)</li><li>Cinquains have been harder for me to get into and I have had to adjust some of my flow to find my way with this form. </li></ul></li><li>How I track and where I am going:<ul><li>These are in my Numbers file</li><li>I may do a form of oulipo eventually with these</li><li>I may change the form of poetry yearly</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="micro"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/micro/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Micro</a></h2><p>This is exactly as it sounds - just a micro blog. I try to post a picture, thought, or what I did each day in a sentence or two. </p><h2 id="icons"><a href="https://www.streamof.me/icons/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Icons</a></h2><p>These only happen as I feel the need to make a new one. They are black and white icons for touch grass, balance, gather yourself, and other such notions.</p><h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2><p>Because this is an experiment, I have added some features that may be temporary.</p><ul><li>I have added a couple of small buttons for Genuary sketches that make a grid of <a href="https://www.streamof.me/tiles/index.html?ref=fractalkitty.com">hourly tiles</a> and then take you to the actual sketch (there are two of them on the site).</li><li>I have a button for a mandala of shovelers at the bottom of my birds page.</li><li>I just started a &#34;secret&#34; stickers feed - you have to use an rss reader or grab links from the feed to get them. (<a href="https://www.streamof.me/feed/?ref=fractalkitty.com">https://www.streamof.me/feed/</a> - this is not a website.)<ul><li>I plan to make a sticker for every bird seen (I started with the Acorn Woodpecker)</li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_5380-1.PNG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1422" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/IMG_5380-1.PNG 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/IMG_5380-1.PNG 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/IMG_5380-1.PNG 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_5380-1.PNG 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><ul><li>Everything is in a Numbers file for my tracking. </li><li>By keeping it in spreadsheets I am able to note birds or poetry from my phone and I love having it local first. </li><li>Some of the additional features are just thrown in when I feel like it. </li><li>I thought about having a listener look for changes in my Numbers file and then committing, but I like the process of committing my journal at the end of the day.</li><li>I run a python script to update any HTML once I am done logging and commit to git</li><li>It is deployed as a GitHub page.</li><li>I would say that running the script and committing take less than 2 minutes. </li><li>Most of my time is spent writing and logging - which is how I want my journal to work.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1933" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-4.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-4.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-4.png 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/02/image-4.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Well - there isn&#39;t one. This is an experiment and journey in progress. I look forward to seeing where it goes and how it affects me.</p><p>I encourage everyone to journal and play with what a journal actually is. What is the purpose of a journal? to remember? to change? to play? What is the math - the patterns of self that we wish to be aware and present with?</p>
