    <h1>Less Alone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Maybe I’m too small, thought Koala. She was on the hunt for a new place to rest her head after one of the big mean Koala guys kicked her out of her favorite tree again. Maybe small Koalas shouldn’t climb trees.</p>
<p>Finally she found a hollow little rock that seemed to fit her just right. She climbed in and rolled up into a furry little ball. Just for a moment to let my tiny eyes get some rest, she thought. This cave is oddly soft and warm, and it feels so nice.</p>
<p>&#34;Hello, Grey One&#34;, said Turtle.</p>
<p>&#34;The rock moves! And it talks!&#34;, Koala exclaimed. Her ears wiggled nervously.</p>
<p>&#34;I’m not a rock&#34;, said Turtle, &#34;I&#39;m a turtle. And you’re in my shell.&#34;</p>
<p>Koala blinked once. And then blinked again. Then she said, &#34;I’m awfully sorry, Mister Turtle. I didn’t mean to disturb you! I just needed a moment you see.&#34;</p>
<p>Turtle turned around and Koala saw his face for the first time. He smiled a gentle, toothless smile. &#34;It’s quite okay. You are soft and warm and I rarely get visits. I’m sorry I startled you.&#34; He paused, frowned, and asked, &#34;Who are you? I’ve never seen a creature like you, and you look quite particular.&#34;</p>
<p>Koala blushed, but her fur concealed it well. &#34;I’m a Koala. We usually live in trees, so you might not see us very often from the ground. We don’t move much.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I see&#34;, said Turtle. &#34;But I’m not a tree, you see. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy your company, but I’m afraid I’m not very tall, and the view from inside my shell can’t compare, I fear.&#34;</p>
<p>Koala looked downtrodden. &#34;I know, but the big Koalas up in the trees always kick me out. I can’t ever just rest for a few minutes without someone taking my spot.&#34;</p>
<p>Turtle smiled again. &#34;Well, in that case, I’m happy to host you for however long you need. Make yourself at home.&#34; He yawned. &#34;I’m a little tired. I’ll get back to sleep if that’s okay.&#34;</p>
<p>Koala curled up again and wiggled her butt a little to find a nice spot for it on Turtle’s back. Finally, she sighed, &#34;Thank you, Mister Turtle. You are quite nice&#34;, but she already heard him snoring again, so she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, if you listened closely from outside the shell, you could hear the gentle breathing of two tiny creatures who were no longer alone.</p>
