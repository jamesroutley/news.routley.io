    <h1>American Chestnut Foundation Ceasing Distribution of Blight-Resistant Seeds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>APHIS</strong> – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service – A unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture responsible for protecting animal welfare, animal health, and plant health.</p>
<p><strong>Backcross breeding</strong> – a technique to develop disease resistance wherein American and Chinese chestnuts are bred together and their progeny are bred with American chestnuts to produce a mostly American chestnut with traits of resistance</p>
<p><strong>B3F3</strong> (or similar conventions) – common nomenclature to refer to 7th generation backcrossed progeny of American and Chinese chestnuts by TACF</p>
<p><strong>BRAG</strong> – Biotechnology Risk Assessment Grant – A funding program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture intended to support generation of scientific evidence needed to assess affects of introduction of genetically engineered organisms</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR</strong> – Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats – a technique for gene editing and insertion</p>
<p><strong><em>Cryphonectria parasitica</em></strong> – The scientific name of the fungus that causes chestnut blight</p>
<p><strong>Common garden experiment</strong> – A type of experiment used to compare how organisms from geographically or environmentally distinct sources respond to living and growing in the same environment. This helps parse their apparent differences into those driven by genetics and those driven by their environment.</p>
<p><strong>D58</strong> – Darling 58 – transgenic variety of American chestnut developed at SUNY-ESF</p>
<p><strong>DarWin</strong> – Darling with Wound Inducible promoter. A transgenic chestnut tree which expresses the same OxO gene as D58, but only when wounded and only at the site of wounding. A recent development by the Powell lab at SUNY-ESF</p>
<p><strong>Deregulation</strong> – the current process of submitting appeals to the USDA, EPA, and FDA to allow wider dispersal and expanded trials of the transgenic D58 chestnut tree</p>
<p><strong>EPA</strong> – Environmental Protection Agency</p>
<p><strong>FDA</strong> – Food and Drug Administration</p>
<p><strong>FHI</strong> – Forest Health Initiative</p>
<p><strong>GCO</strong> – Germplasm Conservation Orchard – an orchard where seeds from wild-type American chestnuts are planted to preserve their genetic diversity</p>
<p><strong>Hypovirulence</strong> – a phenomenon wherein the blight fungus is weakened by infection with a virus. Depending on the interaction and relative virulence of the fungus and virus, the fungus may exhibit slower growth, reduced virulence and overall reduction in fitness.</p>
<p><strong>MOU</strong> – Memorandum of Understanding – an agreement between TACF and a partner organization which documents the goals and general terms of that partnership</p>
<p><strong>OxO</strong> – Oxalate oxidase – The terms commonly applied to a gene which produces the enzyme oxalate oxidase, which neutralizes oxalic acid. In American chestnut restoration context, the OxO gene is one of the most promising to confer resistance to the chestnut blight fungus.</p>
<p><strong>PRR</strong> – Phytophthora root rot/ink disease</p>
<p><strong><em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> </strong>– the scientific name for the organism which causes Phytophthora root rot</p>
<p><strong>Pure/purity</strong> – a commonly misconceived quality attributed to wild-type American chestnuts. All chestnut species have experienced hybridization events</p>
<p><strong>Reciprocal transplant experiment</strong> – A set of replicated common garden experiments where organisms from all source populations are compared in each other’s and in their own habitats of origin. This helps uncover whether particular populations are well adapted only to their own habitats or in other habitats as well.</p>
<p><strong>RNAi</strong> – In the context of American chestnut restoration, this is a method whereby partial sequences of important pathogenicity genes from the chestnut blight fungus are inserted into American chestnut. The partial fungal sequences are expressed in the chestnut tree as double stranded RNA, which are then degraded by the chestnut trees through a pathway called RNA interference. The degradation of the key fugal pathogenicity genes by the host reduces the chestnut blight fungal virulence. Thus far ESF researchers have used this technology to silence chestnut blight genes involved in the production of oxalic acid, which reduces the chestnut blight fungus’s ability to kill tissues in chestnut bark.</p>
<p><strong>ROC</strong> – Regional Outreach Coordinator – employee of TACF responsible for oversight of chapters and volunteer initiatives in their respective region</p>
<p><strong>RSC</strong> – Regional Science Coordinator – employee of TACF responsible for oversight of scientific endeavors in their respective region</p>
<p><strong>RSC</strong> – Resistance Screening Center – a US Forest Service facility at Bent Creek Experimental Forest, Asheville, NC</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;T</strong> – Science &amp; Technology Committee of the Board of Directors of The American Chestnut Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>SSA</strong> – Small stem assay. An inoculation trial performed on seedling trees wherein the pathogen is artificially administered in order to compare differences in apparent response for early screening of disease resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Stacked resistance</strong> – a technique utilizing the best progeny of the backcross breeding program to then cross with transgenic American chestnut to yield an offspring with resistance characteristics from both techniques</p>
<p><strong>SUNY-ESF</strong> – State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry</p>
<p><strong>TACF</strong> – The American Chestnut Foundation</p>
<p><strong>USDA</strong> – United States Department of Agriculture</p>
<p><strong>Wild-type American chestnut</strong> – a tree which is either a member of the remnant population of American chestnuts in the wild, or progeny thereof.</p></div></div>
