    <h1>Bcachefs may be headed out of the kernel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
The history of the bcachefs filesystem in the kernel has been turbulent,
most recently with Linus Torvalds <a href="https://blog.whal.ing/ml/all/CAHk-=wi2ae794_MyuW1XJAR64RDkDLUsRHvSemuWAkO6T45=YA@mail.gmail.com">refusing
a pull request</a> for the 6.16-rc3 release.  Torvalds has now <a href="https://blog.whal.ing/ml/all/CAHk-=wi+k8E4kWR8c-nREP0+EA4D+=rz5j0Hdk3N6cWgfE03-Q@mail.gmail.com">pulled
the code in question</a>, but also said:
</p>

<blockquote>
	I think we&#39;ll be
	parting ways in the 6.17 merge window.
<p>
	You made it very clear that I can&#39;t even question any bug-fixes and
	I should just pull anything and everything.
</p><p>
	Honestly, at that point, I don&#39;t really feel comfortable being
	involved at all, and the only thing we both seemed to really
	fundamentally agree on in that discussion was &#34;we&#39;re done&#34;.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Bcachefs developer Kent Overstreet <a href="https://blog.whal.ing/ml/all/xl2fyyjk4kjcszcgypirhoyflxojzeyxkzoevvxsmo26mklq7i@jw2ou76lh2py">has
his own view</a> of the situation.  Both Torvalds and Overstreet
refer to a seemingly private conversation where the pull request (and other
topics) were discussed.
