            <h3>Unobtrusive Type Safety</h3>
            <p>
              OCaml’s powerful type system means more bugs are caught at compile time, and large, complex codebases are easier to maintain. This makes it a good language for running critical code. At the same time, sophisticated inference makes the type system unobtrusive, creating a smooth developer experience.

              Fast Compiler and Efficient Applications
            </h3>
            <p>
              OCaml has two compilers. One is a bytecode compiler which generates small, portable executables and is very fast. The other is a native code compiler that produces more efficient machine code; its performance matches the highest standards of modern compilers.
