System was originally devised by Dennis Reynolds of </span><em>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em><span>, which detailed his repeatable, reliable, and somewhat psychotic approach to seduction. </span></p><p>I have repurposed the system to help you seduce hiring managers, and ensure they’re lined up in your inbox, begging to give you a job.</p><p><strong>D -</strong><span> Drive Initiatives</span></p><p><strong>E</strong><span> - Embrace LaTeX </span></p><p><strong>N</strong><span> - Name Recognition </span></p><p><strong>N</strong><span> - No More Lists </span></p><p><strong>I</strong><span> - Impact is King</span></p><p><strong>S</strong><span> - Short Stints are Dangerous</span></p><p>Here’s one of my favourite interview questions:</p><blockquote><p><em>In your last company, what wouldn’t have happened without you?</em></p></blockquote><p><span>As a senior, you should be proactive, not reactive, and this question quickly gets to the heart of whether you can </span><em><strong>get shit done</strong></em><span>. </span></p><p>While senior engineers are individual contributors; the best engineers’ best work is rarely code. Some real-world examples I have seen of top-tier initiative driving include: </p><ul><li><p><em>Drove the adoption of an RFC process that’s now used for all new system designs and changes to public interfaces</em></p></li><li><p><em><span>Introduced security check-ins into our releases to ensure our application was up-to-date with </span><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OWASP best practices</a></em></p></li><li><p><em>Set up our first platform team - focused on developing and maintaining internal libraries, SDKs, and build processes  </em></p></li></ul><p>LaTeX is a document preparation system that is mostly used for scientific papers - sort of like HTML for PDFs.</p><p>Using LaTeX for your résumé sends a subtle but clear message: you love software engineering so much that you&#39;ve coded your CV. </p><p>This can unconsciously sway more technical hiring managers like me from “looking for reasons to reject you” to “looking for reasons to book you into a call”. </p><p><span>A neat shortcut to avoid learning all the syntax - CV templates from Github as a starting point and </span><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Overleaf</a><span> to actually do the editing works pretty well.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Stuck looking for a starting point?</strong><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>I’ll surprise you here: hiring managers are humans.</p><p><span>And like most humans, we have a strong tendency towards </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiarity_heuristic" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">familiarity bias</a><span> - that means we overvalue options that we already know. </span></p><p>Therefore, seeing a name we’ve heard on your résumé is going to immediately put us in our comfort zone, and give a great first impression before they even meet you. </p><p><span>Admittedly, this is more strategic than tactical - but a stint at a </span><strong>well-known and reputable company</strong><span> generally does more for one’s CV than a more senior title at a no-name firm. Big-name companies </span><em>surely</em><span> have a high hiring bar, and so you </span><em>must</em><span> be a credible candidate.</span></p><p><span>If you aren’t fortunate enough to have a big name on your work experience, don’t despair - you could, for instance, contribute to </span><strong>popular open-source libraries</strong><span> and point us to that. </span></p><p><span>Another cognitive bias you could capitalise on is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">social proof</a><span> - it will generate a positive impression with the hiring manager if you have </span><strong>lots of Github stars</strong><span>, a high </span><strong>StackOverflow reputation</strong><span>, or, of course…</span></p><p>The vast majority of CVs I see contain a section listing the platforms, frameworks, and libraries you’re familiar with. Unfortunately, all applicants for, say, an Android or iOS role generally have the exact same list. </p><p>You might have heard that hiring managers spend less than 10 seconds looking at each résumé. In the days of LinkedIn one-click-apply, this is a huge overestimate. Do you want to be using up valuable first-page real-estate on something that does nothing to make you stand out?</p><p>The key here is; you want to differentiate yourself through your unique skills. </p><p>It’s not interesting to a hiring manager that you know Dagger/Hilt/Koin, or that you’re proficient in UIKit, Foundation, and Core Data. But it would be interesting if you’re a rare specialist in BLE, Camera APIs, or low-level graphics frameworks - or, even better, if you’re a full-stack mobile dev who’s also great with API design, infra, and SQL.</p><p>In the mobile world, there’s been a massive UI paradigm shift to declarative frameworks such as JetPack Compose &amp; SwiftUI. Deep knowledge of these modern tools is often a huge competitive advantage for some job listings, and so these are certainly worth embellishing your credentials in. </p><blockquote><p><strong>What about automatic CV screening?</strong><span> </span></p><p>There are many companies which use automated HR tools to screen CVs for keywords and filter them out before any human even takes a look. </p><p>This is understandable, in the age of LinkedIn one-click-apply -  junior openings at well-known firms regularly get applications in the 1000s. </p><p>If you want to play it safe, try to include the tech with which you’re experienced as part of your work experience, or moving your list to the bottom. </p></blockquote><p>Many applicants describe their work experience with mundane contributions like bug fixes, feature development, setting up CI, or mentorship. While these are a major part of any individual contributor role, none of this is very interesting to read.</p><p>If you can show you had ownership over a critical project, it tells me “your company trusted you to deliver” - it’s a strong signal that you’re capable. Showcase your impact by highlighting achievements:</p><ul><li><p><em>Specced out a high-level technical design for an analytics system that balances  cost minimisation and fidelity, which halved our analytics spend without losing any information.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Transitioned our release process from ad-hoc feature releases towards a structured regular process using automated SQL queries and an alerting system to run rollout health checks and instantly ping us if any issues occurred, reducing prod issues by 85%.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Collaborated with our product and infra teams to create a feature flagging system that allowed us to roll back changes instantly, reducing the rate of SEV-1 and SEV-2 incidents by 85%.</em></p></li></ul><p>When possible, use real-life examples and quantifiable data to support your claims of impact, but make sure you can back them up - if I’m on my 4th hour of interviews, you can bet I’m going to grill you if I smell bullshit.</p><p>Several studies show that new employees might take many months to become fully productive. </p><p>In the recent round of tech layoffs, sometimes it’s unavoidable to have one or two shorter tenures - hiring managers are aware of this, and so this generally doesn’t count against you. But giving the appearance of job hopping in ‘peacetime’ is another thing entirely. </p><p>If you’ve worked more than 4 jobs in the last 4 years, you’re in the danger zone. Many companies will discard a CV quickly if we don’t think you’ll stick around until next year.</p><p><span>Of course, it wouldn’t be fair to pontificate about how to write a CV without dogfooding my own advice, and </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/jacobsapps/abb305843bf5929f0ff1335a82c9eda4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">showing you my own</a><span>:</span></p><p>Please keep your eyes peeled for my next post, which brings us into how to perform phenomenally in your first-round interview!</p><p>In conclusion, crafting a winning résumé doesn&#39;t have to be daunting.</p><p><span>By following </span><strong>The D.E.N.N.I.S. System</strong><span> and focusing on a few key principles: </span></p><p><strong>D -</strong><span> Drive Initiatives</span></p><p><strong>E</strong><span> - Embrace LaTeX </span></p><p><strong>N</strong><span> - Name Recognition </span></p><p><strong>N</strong><span> - No More Lists</span></p><p><strong>I</strong><span> - Impact is King</span></p><p><strong>S</strong><span> - Short Stints are Dangerous</span></p><p><span>…you’ll have a stunning CV, create a fantastic first impression, get an </span><strong>instant</strong><span> </span><strong>swipe-right</strong><span> into every interview and, ultimately, landing that dream job.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
