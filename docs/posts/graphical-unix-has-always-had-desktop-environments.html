    <h1>Graphical Unix has always had desktop environments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>(Graphical) Unix has always had desktop environments</h2>

	<p><small>May 17, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the stories that you could tell about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">the X Window System</a> and by extension
graphical Unix is that first came (simple) window managers and
xterm. Only later did Unix developed desktop environments like GNOME
and KDE. This is certainly more or less the development that happened
on open source PC Unixes and to a certain degree it&#39;s the experience
many people had earlier on workstation Unix machines running X, but
it&#39;s actually not historically accurate. In reality, Unix has had
full scale desktop environments of various degrees of complexity
more or less from the beginning of serious graphical Unix.</p>

<p>(This origin story of desktop environments on Unix is sufficiently
attractive that I was about to use it in another entry until I
paused to think a bit more.)</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was no X. Workstation vendors had to create
their own GUI environments, and so of course they didn&#39;t just create
a terminal emulator and window management; instead, they tended to
create a whole integrated suite of GUI applications and an environment
to run them in. One early example of this is Sun&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunView">Suntools/SunView</a>, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIS_Workspace">SGI had one too</a> and I believe most
other Unix workstation vendors did as well (plus I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Project">CMU&#39;s
Andrew</a> had its own
desktop-like environment). When X started to win out, these Unix
vendors didn&#39;t abandon their existing GUI desktops to fall back to
a much less well developed window manager and terminals experience;
instead they re-implemented versions of their old desktop environments
on top of X (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWindows">Sun&#39;s OpenWindows</a>) or created new ones
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment">the Common Desktop Environment (CDE)</a>.</p>

<p>Open source PC Unixes didn&#39;t follow this pattern because in the
1990s, there were few or no open source desktop environments. Since
X window managers, xterm, and various other graphical programs were
free software, that&#39;s what people had available to build their
environments from, and that&#39;s what people did for a while. In this,
the open source PC Unixes were recapitulating an earlier history
of people running X on Unix vendor desktop workstations before the
vendor itself supported X on their hardware and had built a desktop
for it (and X itself started out this way, as initially distributed
out of MIT and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena">Project Athena</a>).</p>

<p>(Some people then continued to use a basic X environment because
they liked their version of it better than the Unix workstation
vendor&#39;s desktop. Sometimes such a basic X environment ran faster,
too, because the vendor had written a bunch of bloatware.)</p>
