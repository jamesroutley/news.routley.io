    <h1>Rust and C&#43;&#43; with Steve Klabnik and Herb Sutter [audio]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												
						<p>In software engineering, C++ is often used in areas where low-level system access and high-performance are critical, such as operating systems, game engines, and embedded systems. Its long-standing presence and compatibility with legacy code make it a go-to language for maintaining and extending older projects. Rust, while newer, is gaining traction in roles that demand safety and concurrency, particularly in systems programming.</p>
<p>We wanted to explore these two languages side-by-side, so we invited <a href="https://herbsutter.com/">Herb Sutter</a> and <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> to join host Kevin Ball on the show. Herb works at Microsoft and chairs the ISO <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a> standards committee. Steve works at Oxide Computer Company, is an alumnus of the <a href="https://x.com/rustlang">Rust</a> Core Team, and is the primary author of The Rust Programming Language book.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this deep dive into Rust and C++ on Software Engineering Daily.</p>
