    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2023 was a great reading year for me. 
I read roughly twice as much as my average and I found so many books I really loved. 
Quitting my job in Decemeber 2022 helped and then applying the Recurse Center principles of identifying 
what I truly enjoy vs what I think I should like made it easier to find books that worked for me and
drop those that didn’t. I also found some more places on the internet people talk about books
(RC included) that improved my book recommendation pipeline.</p>

<p>Here are my favorite books that I read in the last year (in the order I read them).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52692515-there-s-no-such-thing-as-an-easy-job">There’s No Such Thing as an Easy Job, Kikuko Tsumura, Polly Barton (Translator)</a> - This was great to read right after quitting my job. It’s about burnout told through a series of very strange, surreal jobs. It made me feel better about having so many feelings about work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52588525-did-ye-hear-mammy-died-a-memoir">Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? A Memoir, Séamas O’Reilly</a> - So sad and so funny. Amazing writing about grief, family and about the weird, mundane realities of being a child at the end of the Troubles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366231-the-night-ship">The Night Ship, Jess Kidd</a> - Super atmospheric, spooky and engaging. Split perspective between a child on a historical Dutch trading ship in 1629 and a child on a tiny Pacific island in 1989.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54304105-milk-fed">Milk Fed, Melissa Broder</a> - A deeply bizzare and cathartic book about eating disorders, queerness, and golems.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50215350-we-ride-upon-sticks">We Ride Upon Sticks, Quan Barry</a> - A field hockey team makes a Satanic bargain in the 1980s but it’s very sweet and nothing very bad happens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51183428-the-love-songs-of-w-e-b-du-bois">The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers</a> - Following a family over hundreds of years into present day Georgia, exploring historical circumstance with complex, engaging characters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower">Parable of the Sower, Octavia E. Butler</a> - A classic. Reading this after 2020 and while living in California made it feel more immediate that if I’d read it earlier.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56816904-the-sentence">The Sentence, Louise Erdrich</a> - Probably the first book I’ve read about living through 2020. It’s about the Native community in Minneapolis, being haunted, and healing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58388343-some-desperate-glory">Some Desperate Glory, Emily Tesh</a> - I can’t remember where I heard this, but it’s like: what if Ender’s Game loved you back? Plus an impressively unlikeable protagonist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58085285-the-five-wounds">The Five Wounds, Kirstin Valdez Quade</a> - Hyper local setting (Espanola Valley, Northern New Mexico) near where I grew up. It plays with some really unique cultural elements. Also an impressively unlikeable protagonist!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58328439-calling-for-a-blanket-dance">Calling for a Blanket Dance, Oscar Hokeah</a> - Fascinating structure - every chapter is from the perspective of someone in the protagonists life - we only see him through others’ eyes until the end. Also, beautiful writing about loving people by making art.</p>
