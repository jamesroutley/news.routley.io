    <h1>A Sneaky Phish Just Grabbed My Mailchimp Mailing List</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>You know when you&#39;re really jet lagged and really tired and the cogs in your head are just moving that little bit too slow? That&#39;s me right now, and the penny has just dropped that a Mailchimp phish has grabbed my credentials, logged into my account and exported the mailing list for this blog. I&#39;m deliberately keeping this post very succinct to ensure the message goes out to my impacted subscribers ASAP, then I&#39;ll update the post with more details. But as a quick summary, I woke up in London this morning to the following:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_3302.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1216" height="1473" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/IMG_3302.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/IMG_3302.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_3302.jpg 1216w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I went to the link which is on mailchimp-sso.com and entered my credentials which - <em>crucially </em>- did not auto-complete from 1Password. I then entered the OTP and the page hung. Moments later, the penny dropped, and I logged onto the official website, which Mailchimp confirmed via a notification email which showed my London IP address:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1790" height="958" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-12.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-12.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png 1790w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I immediately changed my password, but not before I got an alert about my mailing list being exported from an IP address in New York:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1771" height="862" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-14.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-14.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-14.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-14.png 1771w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>And, moments after that, the login alert from the same IP:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-13.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1788" height="998" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-13.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-13.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-13.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-13.png 1788w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This was obviously highly automated and designed to immediately export the list before the victim could take preventative measures.</p><p>There are approximately 16k records in that export containing info Mailchimp automatically collects and they appear as follows:</p>

<p>Every active subscriber on my list will shortly receive an email notification by virtue of this blog post going out. Unfortunately, the export also includes people who&#39;ve unsubscribed (why does Mailchimp keep these?!) so I&#39;ll need to work out how to handle those ones separately. I&#39;ve been in touch with Mailchimp but don&#39;t have a reply yet, I&#39;ll update this post with more info when I have it.</p><p>I&#39;m enormously frustrated with myself for having fallen for this, and I apologise to anyone on that list. Obviously, watch out for spam or further phishes and check back here or via the social channels in the nav bar above for more. Ironically, I&#39;m in London visiting government partners, and I spent a couple of hours with the National Cyber Security Centre yesterday talking about how we can better promote passkeys, in part due to their phishing-resistant nature. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>More soon, I&#39;ve hit the publish button on this 34 mins after the time stamp in that first email above.</p><h3 id="more-stuff-from-after-initial-publish">More Stuff From After Initial Publish</h3><p>Every Monday morning when I&#39;m at home, I head into a radio studio and do a segment on scams. It&#39;s consumer-facing so we&#39;re talking to the &#34;normies&#34; and whenever someone calls in and talks about being caught in the scam, the sentiment is the same: &#34;I feel so stupid&#34;. That, friends, is me right now. Beyond acknowledging my own foolishness, let me proceed with some more thoughts:</p><p>Firstly, I&#39;ve received a gazillion similar phishes before that I&#39;ve identified early, so what was different about this one? Tiredness, was a major factor. I wasn&#39;t alert enough, and I didn&#39;t properly think through what I was doing. The attacker had no way of knowing that (I don&#39;t have any reason to suspect this was targeted specifically at me), but we all have moments of weakness and if the phish times just perfectly with that, well, here we are.</p><p>Secondly, reading it again now, that&#39;s a <em>very</em> well-crafted phish. It socially engineered me into believing I wouldn&#39;t be able to send out my newsletter so it triggered &#34;fear&#34;, but it wasn&#39;t all bells and whistles about something terrible happening if I didn&#39;t take immediate action. It created just the right amount of urgency without being over the top.</p><p>Thirdly, the thing that should have saved my bacon was the credentials not auto-filling from 1Password, so why didn&#39;t I stop there? Because that&#39;s not unusual. There are so many services where you&#39;ve registered on one domain (and that address is stored in 1Password), then you <em>legitimately </em>log on to a different domain. For example, here&#39;s my Qantas entry:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="320" height="476"/></figure><p>And the final thought for now is more a frustration that Mailchimp didn&#39;t automatically delete the data of people who unsubscribed. There are 7,535 email addresses on that list which is nearly half of all addresses in that export. I need to go through the account settings and see if this was simply a setting I hadn&#39;t toggled or something similar, but the inclusion of those addresses was obviously completely unnecessary. I also don&#39;t know why IP addresses were captured or how the lat and long is calculated but given I&#39;ve never seen a prompt for access to the GPS, I imagine it&#39;s probably derived from the IP.</p><p>I&#39;ll park this here and do a deeper technical dive later today that addresses some of the issues I&#39;ve raised above.</p><h3 id="the-technical-bits">The Technical Bits</h3><p>I&#39;ll keep writing this bit by bit (you may see it appear partly finished while reading, so give the page a refresh later on), starting with the API key that was created:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="333" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-17.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-17.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-17.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/03/image-17.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This has now been deleted so along with rolling the password, there should no longer be any persistent access to the account.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mailchimp doesn&#39;t offer phishing-resistant 2FA:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-18.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-18.png 600w"/></figure><p>By no means would I encourage people <em>not </em>to enable 2FA via OTP, but let this be a lesson as to how completely useless it is against an automated phishing attack that can simply relay the OTP as soon as it&#39;s entered. On that note, another ridiculous coincidence is that <em>in the same minute</em> that I fell for this attack, I&#39;d taken a screen cap of the WhatsApp message below and shown Charlotte - &#34;See, this reinforces what we were talking about with the NCSC yesterday about the importance of passkeys&#34;:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-20.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="934"/></figure><p>Another interesting angle to this is the address the phish was sent to:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="417" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-21.png 600w"/></figure><p>The rest of that address is probably pretty predictable (and I do publish my full &#34;normal&#34; address on <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/" rel="noreferrer">the contact page of this blog</a>, so it&#39;s not like I conceal it from the public), but I find it interesting that <em>the phish came to an address only used for Mailchimp</em>. Which leaves two possibilities:</p><ol><li>Someone specifically targeted me and knew in advance the pattern I use for the address I sign up to services with. They got it right first go without any mail going to other addresses.</li><li>Someone got the address from somewhere else, and I&#39;ve only ever used it in one place...</li></ol><p>Applying some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Occam&#39;s razor</a>, it&#39;s the latter. I find the former <em>highly</em> unlikely, and I&#39;d be very interested to hear from anyone else who uses Mailchimp and received one of these phishes.</p><p>Still on email addresses, I originally read the phish on my iThing and Outlook rendered it as you see in the image above. At this point, I was already on the hook as I intended to login and restore my account, so the way the address then rendered on the PC didn&#39;t really stand out to me when I switched devices:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-23.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="450" height="118"/></figure><p>That&#39;s so damn obvious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The observation here is that by not rendering the sender&#39;s address, Outlook on iOS hid the phish. But having said that, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/humans-are-bad-at-urls-and-fonts-dont-matter/" rel="noreferrer">by no means can you rely on the address as a solid indicator of authenticity</a> but in this case, it would have helped.</p><p>Curious as to why unsubscribed users were in the corpus of exported data, I went searching for answers. At no point does <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/about-unsubscribes/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Mailchimp&#39;s page on unsubscribing</a> mention anything about not deleting the user&#39;s data when they opt out of receiving future emails. Keeping in mind that this is AI-generated, Google provided the following overview:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="506" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-22.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-22.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>That &#34;Purpose of Keeping Unsubscribes&#34; section feels particularly icky and again, this is the AI and not Mailchimp&#39;s words, but it seems to be on point. I can go through and <a href="https://www.storylane.io/tutorials/how-to-delete-unsubscribed-contacts-from-mailchimp?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">delete unsubscribed addresses</a> (and I&#39;ll do that shortly as the last thing I&#39;m going to do now is rush into something else), but then it looks like that has to be a regular process. This is a massive blindspot on Mailchimp&#39;s behalf IMHO and I&#39;m going to provide that feedback to them directly (just remembered I do know some folks there).</p><p>I just went to go and check on the phishing site with the expectation of submitting it to Google Safe Browsing, but it looks like that will no longer be necessary:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1540" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-24.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-24.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-24.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/03/image-24.png 2075w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>2 hours and 15 minutes after it snared my creds, Cloudflare has killed the site. I did see a Cloudflare anti-automation widget on the phishing page when it first loaded and later wondered if that was fake or they were genuinely fronting the page, but I guess that question is now answered. I know there&#39;ll be calls of &#34;why didn&#39;t Cloudflare block this when it was first set up&#34;, but I maintain (as I have before in their defence), that it&#39;s enormously hard to do that based on domain or page structure alone without creating a heap of false positives.</p><p>On the question of the lat and long in the data, I just grabbed my own records and found an IP address belonging to my cellular telco. I had two records (I use them to test both the daily and weekly posts), both with the same IP address and created within a minute of each other. One had a geolocation in Brisbane and the other in far north Queensland, about 1,700km away. In other words, the coords <em>do not</em> pinpoint the location of the subscriber, but the record does contain &#34;australia/brisbane,au,qld&#34; so there&#39;s some rough geolocation data in there.</p>
