      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m 50. I started my career as a developer but my role over the past 15 years has morphed into a professional generalist in small (&lt;10 people) financial firms. I have responsibility for all non-revenue activities (legal, accounting, audit, operations, regulatory, etc) so most of the team can focus on revenue.<p>I&#39;ve decided to move to another country and that means I&#39;ll have to leave this job. As much as I have enjoyed it, I would like to go solo / entrepreneurial. Being a generalist with no specific skills, seems to be both an asset and a liability in such a transition</p><p>Has anyone made similar career changes with advice to share?</p><p>EDIT - <i>Great</i> responses so far. I&#39;m particularly interested in hearing from anyone that went from generalist to a completely different direction/field. Not just contracting their generalism or specializing within one of their general fields. Thanks!</p></td></tr>
