<p>I&#39;d like to get into the habit of writing a yearly review, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2018/2017-sumana-in-review/">as I did for 2017</a>, so here&#39;s an attempt for 2021. I&#39;m aiming here for speed so I&#39;ll probably miss some stuff. </p><h3>Adventures</h3><p>These were pretty limited -- even seeing a friend for a beverage, outdoors, became an adventure, and I saved much of my COVID risk budget for stuff like helping close friends and family (e.g., accompanying them to doctors&#39; appointments). There were two trips I took for pleasure during the summer:</p><ul><li>I took a bunch of precautions to visit friends in summer 2021, and particularly treasure memories of visiting a <a href="https://holdenfg.org/">botanical garden and arboretum</a> in Cleveland and the <a href="https://riversofsteel.com/experiences/tours/">Rivers of Steel mill tour</a> in Pittsburgh. The most precious thing was getting to just have big long in-person conversations with dear friends. Also: If you talk with me sometime, feel free to ask me the story of the strangest or second-strangest intercity bus ride of my life, involving a lost driver and a passenger who suggested vigilante action against another passenger (everyone turned out okay, I think).</li><li>I did an overnight luxury camping-type (&#34;glamping&#34;) trip in a New York City park near the beach. I enjoyed sitting on a blanket on the beach eating slices of bell pepper while reading adrienne maree brown&#39;s <i>Emergent Strategy</i>. And I sat around the evening campfire with the other campgoers to eat dinner; I believe it was the only time in 2021 I got to chat with a bunch of strangers in person and share stories and jokes.</li></ul><h3>Community Service</h3><p>I created <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/monday-will-be-volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>, which has gotten some traction. I continued to serve on the board of the <a href="https://otherwiseaward.org/about-the-award/motherboard">Otherwise Award</a> and in working groups and volunteer groups related to Python. I wrote a few blog posts that other people found helpful, like <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/getting-my-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-new-york-city/">this explanation of the process for getting my first COVID-19 vaccine</a> (I found out that this helped someone realize she was eligible right away because of a health condition, which made me glad I&#39;d written it). I attended a few virtual meetings for my neighborhood and sent a few notes to my elected representatives about stuff, like about <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/nychh-covid-testing-great-so-lets-increase-access/">increasing COVID testing access</a>.</p><h3>Work</h3><p>I wrapped up the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG#Dependency_resolver_and_user_experience_improvements_for_pip">pip resolver overhaul project</a> and did some consulting (grantwriting, research, and advice) for other projects, and got plans in place for the <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/sign-up-now-for-free-maintainer-skills-workshops/">maintainer skill workshops</a> that started this week.</p><h3>Talks and conferences</h3><p>I spoke at <a href="https://harihareswara.net/texts/talks/#tech-talks">eleven virtual tech events in 2021</a>, sometimes in multiple sessions at the same conference, plus some panels/interviews and a couple scifi conventions. And I attended some other virtual events although I sometimes just dipped into the chat or attended one single session. I am glad I got to share my experiences and teach people at these events, but if I could do it over again I&#39;d perhaps reduce how many times I spoke so I could pour more time into working on the book.</p><p>The most interesting of my talks was <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/what-would-open-source-look-like-if-it-were-healthy-video-transcript/">&#34;What Would Open Source Look Like If It Were Healthy?&#34;</a></p><p>Relatedly, I published <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/if-you-give-a-speech-you-care-about-post-a-transcript/">&#34;If You Give A Speech You Care About, Post A Transcript&#34;</a> which has spurred at least one person I know to do so!</p><h3>Book</h3><p>I invested a lot of <a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">book</a>-related time in 2021 writing a book proposal and discussing it with publishers. I also made progress writing the manuscript. I&#39;ve been wanting to write this book for some time, and I put solid effort into it starting in November 2020. As of November 17, 2020 I had about 16,000 words of the first draft. I released <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/new-free-ebook-sampler-from-getting-unstuck-advice-for-open-source-projects/">the three-chapter sampler</a> at the turn of the year: if you <a href="https://buttondown.email/Changeset">subscribe to my email newsletter</a> you&#39;ll get it for free.</p><p>As of March 2, 2021, I had 27,610 words (23,411 of which had been written in November 2020). As of today (January 12, 2022) I&#39;ve written 48,908 words. In my email newsletter I&#39;ve shared further bits of the work in progress: on <a href="https://buttondown.email/Changeset/archive/a-livechat-today-amnesty-days-hiring-an-early/">categories of stuckness, training, scope, and positioning</a>, on <a href="https://buttondown.email/Changeset/archive/maintainer-skills-workshops-an-early-book-excerpt/">helping unreliable colleagues</a>, and <a href="https://buttondown.email/Changeset/archive/5-book-recs-internship-program-tips-and-a-holiday/">pitfalls and opportunities for internship programs</a>.</p><h3>Writing in general</h3><p>On technology and related topics, I wrote about <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/police-the-future-and-biometric-security/">something Troy Hunt said</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/health-insurance-retirement-plans-for-open-source-maintainers/">the game-changing significance of a way for open source maintainers in the US to get health and retirement benefits</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/gaps-in-existing-guidance-on-open-source-software-management/">why a lot of software management advice doesn&#39;t match the reality of grassroots open source projects</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/not-the-first-time-we-tried-fsf-gnu-rms-etc/">the Free Software Foundation and GNU</a>, and <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/painstakingly-reminding-myself-how-to-play/">how free-range learners in programming assess our own skill levels and choose what to learn next plus sometimes-stultifying weight of concentrating one&#39;s work on infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Other interesting things I wrote: <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/it-can-be-hard-to-talk-about-learning-and-teaching/">my basic assumptions about teaching and learning</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/rick-steves-underappreciated/">an appreciation of Rick Steves</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/podguess-a-little-guessing-game/">a podcast-related guessing game Leonard and I still play</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/paralipsis/">thinking about what I don&#39;t say</a> partly because I&#39;m <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/if-you-call-me-a-thought-leader-for-this-post-i-will-give-you-a-stern-look/">a weeeeee bit of a public figure</a>, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/the-stories-i-chose/">thoughts on the stories I chose to recommend on MetaFilter</a>. I <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/activity/98835/posts/mefi/">wrote many posts for the front page of MetaFilter.com</a>, not all of them about scifi/fantasy.</p><h3>Public notice I received</h3><p>I got some really nice responses to a few of my essays and talks (such as from <a href="https://mikepennisi.com/blog/2022/article-highlights-2021/">Mike Pennisi</a> and <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/18/unhealthy-balance-sheet/#user-personas">Cory Doctorow</a>). Also: Sometimes I get compliments on my professional work that are not necessarily things I will note as endorsements on my business&#39;s website, primarily because of profanity or because the endorsement is embedded in criticism of someone or something else. <a href="https://twitter.com/momijizukamori/status/1455275962870997000">One example</a> came up in November.</p><h3>Habits</h3><p><a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/three-ways-i-exercise-in-my-apartment/">Exercising with friends and sometimes Ring Fit Adventure</a>, and <a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/mar/9/coworking-to-write-more/">coworking with friends via videocalls</a>, really helped me pull through better than I might have. I particularly appreciated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JessicaValantPilates/videos">Jessica Valant&#39;s Pilates videos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBodyCoachTV/videos">Joe Wicks&#39;s calisthenics videos</a> for hitting just the right tone (encouraging but not pushy). Special shout-out to my cowriting partner for probably more than a hundred hours in 2021, <a href="https://jacobian.org/2022/jan/7/year-in-review-2021/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>; so many of the words I eked out into emacs last year came accompanied by Jacob&#39;s face in a little rectangle in the corner of the screen.</p><h3>Watched/listened</h3><p>I found some podcasts for ambient music to work or chill to: <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/191006/Fill-World-With-Gentleness">chair house</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05k5bq0">Slow Radio</a> and <a href="https://bff.fm/shows/sounds-in-the-dark">Sounds in the Dark</a>. I also found <a href="https://johnfinnemore.blogspot.com/2021/06/how-to-listen-to-series-9-of-john.html">Season 9 of John Finnemore&#39;s Souvenir Programme</a> enthralling and sustaining. I watched all of <i>Brooklyn 99</i> and <i>Leverage: Redemption</i> and was grateful for how they demanded of me only what I could give, and I found Bo Burnham&#39;s <i>Inside</i> moving and troubling. And the contemporary TV <i>Babysitters&#39; Club</i> adaptation grabbed me way harder than I foresaw. Leonard and I <a href="https://www.crummy.com/nb/nb.cgi/category/nycb/film">watched a lot of stuff</a> and I think the standouts for me were <i>Spotlight</i>, <i>Mo&#39; Better Blues</i>, and <i>Ruthless People.</i></p><h3>Social</h3><p>2021 was a year of calls, a lot pre-scheduled as recurring calendar events, many more ad hoc. I saw a tiny handful of friends in person, and I spent some time on social media for ambient updates on friends&#39; lives. And I got closer to the friends that I co-worked with or virtually exercised with. Proximity and consistency and shared activities have a way of doing that. My marriage continues to be a haven, and we are, I think, better each year at taking care with each other.</p><h3>Things I&#39;m glad I got/bought</h3><p>The Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (three shots, including a booster); a hammock that now sits in our living room where one can lounge to read/nap/talk; <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/switched-to-a-new-blogging-platform/">the updated Cogito, Ergo Sumana website</a>.</p><p>This year I shall iterate forward, as we all do.</p>
