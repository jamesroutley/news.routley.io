    <h1>2021: Year in review</h1>
    
    

<p>It&rsquo;s the end of the year again! This was my second full year working for myself
on <a href="https://wizardzines.com">wizard zines</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts about what I&rsquo;m working towards, a bunch of things I made
this year, and a few ideas and questions about 2022.</p>

<h3 id="made-some-progress-on-a-mission-statement">made some progress on a &ldquo;mission statement&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I think the two hardest things about working for myself are working alone and
having to decide what to do.</p>

<p>This year I spent some time trying to figure out what I&rsquo;m doing with wizard
zines. This is hard for me because I work in a pretty intuitive way &ndash; I have
some feelings about what&rsquo;s important, and even though following my feelings
usually turns out well, I can&rsquo;t always explain what I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts about what I&rsquo;m trying to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m only interested in explaining &ldquo;old&rdquo; established technologies (HTTP, DNS, assembly, C, etc)</li>
<li>I want to help people who are learning about these &ldquo;old&rdquo; things for the first time today (whether they&rsquo;re new to programming or just new to the thing)</li>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s very important to learn through experimentation and actually using the thing</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of hidden knowledge about these &ldquo;old&rdquo; tools (what are they used
for? what are the common mistakes? which parts can you ignore?). I want to
make that knowledge easy to find.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s also something which I can&rsquo;t quite articulate yet, which is that
computers were &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; in the past, and that it&rsquo;s still possible in 2022 to
learn programming in a &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; way and cut through some of the chaos and
churn in modern computing.</p>

<p>As stated this sounds unrealistic, because you do need to use a lot of more
&ldquo;complicated&rdquo; stuff to get things done in a real programming job. Most people
can&rsquo;t avoid it! But understanding the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; core of how computers work
really gives me a lot more confidence when dealing with all of the chaos. (&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what all this nonsense is but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s all just
assembly instructions and memory and system calls, I can figure this out&rdquo;)</p>

<p>So I guess I want to figure out how to help other people move towards that
confidence of &ldquo;ok, I know how this computer stuff works, I can figure out any
weird new nonsense you throw at me&rdquo;. That seems ambitious and it might be
unrealistic for a collection of a few zines and and blog posts and websites but
it feels important to me.</p>

<h3 id="educational-websites">educational websites!</h3>

<p>This year I felt more excited about making websites than making zines and so I
spent more time building websites than I did writing zines. I think this is
because:</p>

<ul>
<li>the way I learn things is by <em>doing</em>, not by reading</li>
<li>I feel really comfortable experimenting and breaking things on my computer,
but I get the impression that not everyone feels the same level of comfort</li>
<li>writing code is fun</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to write about each project at length here because I already
wrote long blog posts about each one, but here&rsquo;s a list of all of the
educational websites I made this year (and one command line tool):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">mysteries.wizardzines.com</a> (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/04/16/notes-on-debugging-puzzles/">blog post</a>), a choose-your-own-adventure debugging game</li>
<li><a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com">nginx playground</a> (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/24/new-tool--an-nginx-playground/">blog post</a>), where you can do nginx experiments</li>
<li><a href="https://messwithdns.net">mess with dns</a> (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/15/mess-with-dns/">blog post</a>), where you can do DNS experiments. I built this one with <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jvns/dnspeep/">dnspeep</a> (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/03/31/dnspeep-tool/">blog post</a>), a command line tool for spying on your DNS queries</li>
<li><a href="https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/">a simple dns lookup tool</a> (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/02/24/a-little-tool-to-make-dns-queries/">blog post</a>), a friendly website version of <code>dig</code></li>
<li><a href="https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/trace.html#twitter.com">what happens behind the scenes when you make a DNS query</a>, a friendly website version of <code>dig +trace</code></li>
<li>a sort of &ldquo;linux challenges&rdquo; site that I <a href="https://jvns.ca/#recurse-center-2020">wrote about a lot</a> but haven&rsquo;t released yet</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can tell, a lot of them are related to DNS :)</p>

<h3 id="collaboration">collaboration!</h3>

<p>My biggest problem with working for myself is that it gets lonely sometimes,
and in previous years I haven&rsquo;t been very good at finding collaborators.
This year I got to work with <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> on
<a href="https://messwithdns.net">Mess With DNS</a>. It was a lot more fun (and a lot
easier!) than building it by myself would have been.</p>

<h3 id="opened-a-print-zine-store">opened a print zine store!</h3>

<p>I finally (after several years of struggling to figure it out) opened an
<a href="https://store.wizardzines.com">online store</a> that sells print versions of my zines in May.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous artisanal attempts where I did all the shipping myself
(which was kind of fun but totally unsustainable), this time an amazing company
called White Squirrel is handling the shipping.</p>

<p>Setting this up involved a lot of logistics (I just finished figuring out how
to handle EU VAT for example), but now that it&rsquo;s set up it doesn&rsquo;t need too
much ongoing attention except to answer occasional emails from people who run
into shipping problems.</p>

<h3 id="put-all-of-my-comics-online">put all of my comics online!</h3>

<p>I put all of my comics online in one place at <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics">https://wizardzines.com/comics</a>.
Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/02/publishing-comics/">blog post about that</a>. I&rsquo;m really happy about this and it&rsquo;s amazing to be able to just link to any comic I want (like <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/grep">grep</a>).</p>

<h3 id="some-partial-zines">some partial zines!</h3>

<p>I worked on a few zine ideas this year but did not finish any. Here are some bits and pieces that I wrote this year.</p>

<p>Some pages from a DNS zine draft:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/updating-dns/">why updating DNS is slow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/dns-server-types/">the 4 types of DNS servers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/cname/">CNAME records</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/dns-record-types/">DNS record types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/why-dns/">why we need DNS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/subdomains/">subdomains</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/tld/">top-level domains</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also worked on a zine about debugging that I&rsquo;ve been writing on and off since
2019. Here are some pages I wrote in this year&rsquo;s attempt:  (you can find more by searching for &ldquo;debugging&rdquo; at <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics">https://wizardzines.com/comics</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/track-your-progress/">track your progress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/guesses-are-often-wrong/">guesses are often wrong</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/track-your-progress/">why some bugs feel &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/minimal-reproduction/">make a minimal reproduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/list-what-youve-learned/">list what you&rsquo;ve learned</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1409513645256630274">this flowchart</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;we think about debugging as a technical skill (and it absolutely is!!) but a
huge amount of it is managing your feelings so you don&rsquo;t get discouraged and
being self-aware so you can recognize your incorrect assumptions&rdquo; (this was just a tweet, not a comic)
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>I also wrote 3 pages about how things are represented in memory (<a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/hexadecimal/">hexadecimal</a>, <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/little-endian/">little-endian</a>, <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bytes/">bytes</a>), but there&rsquo;s a very long way to go on that project.</p>

<p>I got stuck writing these for the reason I usually get stuck finishing zines &ndash;
I need to have a clear explanation in my mind of what the zine is about. The
explanation looks something like &ldquo;the reason many people struggle with TOPIC is
because they don&rsquo;t understand X, here&rsquo;s what you need to know&rdquo;. My first guess
at what &ldquo;X&rdquo; is often wrong, and the farther I am away from learning the topic
for the first time myself the more wrong I am.</p>

<p>But I have some thoughts about how to get unstuck, we&rsquo;ll see what happens!</p>

</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve historically had a &ldquo;never write anything negative&rdquo; rule for this blog and
I&rsquo;m trying to back off that a little bit because it feels limiting.
Specifically the posts on <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/06/dns-doesn-t-propagate/">dns propagation</a>, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/11/what-s-the-osi-model-/">the osi model</a>, and <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/">confusing explanations</a> are a little more
negative than what I would have written previously, and I think they&rsquo;re better
because of it.</p>

<p>Looking at this list, maybe I want to write more hands-on &ldquo;how things work&rdquo; / &ldquo;how to use X tool&rdquo; posts next year.</p>

<p>Also, I see people linking to <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">Get your work recognized: write a brag document (from 2019)</a> on Twitter all the time. I&rsquo;m
very happy it&rsquo;s still helping people.</p>

<h3 id="the-business-is-doing-well">the business is doing well!</h3>

<p>This past year I released a lot of free things and not as many things that cost
money, but the business is doing well nonetheless and I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>

<p>All of the work in this post continues to be 100% funded by zine sales, which
I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-might-do-in-2022">things I might do in 2022</h3>

<p>Here are some things I might do in 2022. I write these because it&rsquo;s interesting
to see at the end of the year which ones happened and which ones didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<ul>
<li>keep working with other people.</li>
<li>try to finish some zines</li>
<li>make more websites where people can do computer experiments</li>
<li>figure out where to take the <a href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">computer mysteries</a> project</li>
<li>give a talk (I&rsquo;ve taken 3 years off writing talks, but I have some ideas)</li>
<li>try to understand what&rsquo;s going on with this &ldquo;mission statement&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>some things I&rsquo;m less likely to do, but that I&rsquo;ve thought about:</p>

<ul>
<li>write an actual book (for example a book about computer networking)</li>
<li>write some computer networking command line tools that are easier to use</li>
<li>collaborate with someone to write a zine about a topic that I know almost nothing about (like databases)</li>
<li>spend more (than 0) time reading papers about CS education</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-questions">some questions</h3>

<p>Here are some questions I have going into 2022.</p>

<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the scope of the &ldquo;zines&rdquo; project? How many more do I want to write?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s hard for developers about learning to use the Unix command line in 2021? What do I want to do about it?</li>
<li>If I keep making these educational websites, how can/should I measure how much they&rsquo;re used? (I&rsquo;m thinking here about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3472749.3474819">this paper</a> by Philip Guo about <a href="https://pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>&rsquo;s design guidelines)</li>
<li>Do any of my educational websites need to make money, or can I keep releasing them for free?</li>
</ul>
