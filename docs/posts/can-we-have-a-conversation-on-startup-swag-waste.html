      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Yesterday I made a Jokr order and was handed a swag bag. It had a rag thin bandana, a tote bag, and a plastic bag dog waste holder. The tote bag has a use, but the bandana was so thin it was a waste of fabric. The dog waste holder is another problem, but also uanessacry when I don&#39;t have a dog.<p>I think swag is great to get, when it has a use. I they probably made a lot of bandana&#39;s and plastic bag holders that were probably thrown away. I also know there are a ton of conferences where this is also happening. This is leading to so much waste that is not controllable, but companies continue to waste money in this area. They will also shift blame to consumers on recycling when the companies are constantly producing it.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>- Why do companies continue to waste money on useless swag?</p><p>- What can be done to have companies think about the waste they are producing from swag?</p><p>Edit 1: I&#39;m not talking about t-shirts or sweatshirts</p></td></tr>
