<p>
Here is a chronology of the versions of Lua.
<a href="https://lua.org/doc/hopl.pdf">The evolution of Lua</a>
is documented in a
<a href="https://lua.org/docs.html#papers">paper</a>
presented at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages#HOPL_III">HOPL III,
the Third ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference</a>,
in 2007.
See also its
<a href="https://lua.org/doc/cola.pdf">continuation</a> published in 2025 in a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cola.2025.101326">journal</a>.
The source code and documentation for all releases of Lua are available in the
<a href="https://lua.org/ftp/">download area</a>.

<h2><a name="numbering">Numbering scheme</a></h2>
<p>
The releases of Lua are numbered <em>x.y.z</em>,
where
<em>x</em> is the series, <em>x.y</em> is the version, and <em>z</em> is the release.

</p><p>
Different releases of the same version correspond to
<a href="https://lua.org/bugs.html">bug fixes</a>.
Different releases of the same version have the same
<a href="https://lua.org/manual/">reference manual</a>,
the same virtual machine, and are binary compatible (ABI compatible).

</p><p>
Different versions are really different.
The API is likely to be a little different
(but with compatibility switches),
and there is no ABI compatibility:
applications that embed Lua and C libraries for Lua must be recompiled.
The virtual machine is also very likely to be different in a new version:
Lua programs that have been precompiled for one version will not load in a different version.

<!--
<A HREF="http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/03-04-041">More...</A>

booleans,
proper tail calls,
and weak tables.
Other features were
better support for packages,
new API for loading Lua chunks,
new error handling protocol,
better error messages,
and much more.
Lua 5.0 was the first version to be released under the
<a href="https://lua.org/license.html">new license</a>.

</p><p>

a debug library
and
new table functions.

</p><h2><a name="3.1">Lua 3.1</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="https://lua.org/ftp/lua-3.1.tar.gz">Lua 3.1</a>

Its main new features were
anonymous functions and
function closures via &#34;upvalues&#34;.
(<a href="#5.0">Lua 5.0</a> brought full lexical scoping and dropped upvalues.)
This brought a flavor of functional programming to Lua.
There was also support for multiple global contexts;
however, the API was not fully reentrant
(this had to wait until <a href="#4.0">Lua 4.0</a>).
Lua 3.1 also saw a
major code re-organization and clean-up,
with much reduced module interdependencies.
Lua 3.1 also adopted double precision for the internal representation of numbers.
