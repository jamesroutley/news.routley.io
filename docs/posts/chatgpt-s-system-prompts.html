Even among those who lived to adulthood, most people’s time was spent on survival: growing and harvesting food, finding water, hunting, gathering, building shelter, surviving weather events. </span></p><p><span>So, it’s certain that thousands of Einsteins lived and died unrecognized and illiterate,  brilliant thoughts extinguished with their minds. Thousands may have tried to speak up but been ignored entirely or persecuted for thinking outside the box (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" rel="">even Galileo dealt with this in progressive-for-its-time Renaissance Italy</a><span>!). Thousands may have kept their mouths shut, knowing that survival as part of a community meant more than spouting some weird theory that would get them ostracized or killed. </span></p><p>We will never know their names or count their numbers. Da Vinci and Ada Lovelace are the exceptions, not the rule. The inventions we don’t have may matter as much as the ones we do; we just don’t know what we’re missing.</p><p>But many humans alive today are in enviably different positions than our ancestors.

When we use that opportunity in gratitude, we honor those who didn’t have it and who we never knew.</p></div></div></div>
