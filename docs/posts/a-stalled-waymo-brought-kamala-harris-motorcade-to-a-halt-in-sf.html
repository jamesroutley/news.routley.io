    <h1>A stalled Waymo brought Kamala Harris&#39; motorcade to a halt in SF</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A motorcade escorting Vice President Kamala Harris to San Francisco’s Fairmont Hotel was brought to a standstill late Friday by a stalled Waymo.</p><p>Video from ABC7 shows the driverless car stopping while making a U-turn on California Street. A police officer then gets in the robotaxi to drive it out of the way.</p></div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HAPPENING NOW: A driverless <a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Waymo</a> gets stuck making a u-turn as <a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VP</a>’s motorcade arrived at the Fairmont S.F. </p>— LaurenABC7 (@LaurenABC7) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenABC7/status/1839883724621529202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure><div><p>The distinctly San Francisco traffic jam punctuated a visit that’s likely to be Harris’ last stop in the city before the election. The Democratic presidential nominee was set to speak at a private fundraiser the next day.</p><p>The Waymo malfunction is just the latest of many incidents in San Francisco involving self-driving cars, which are still exempt from traffic citations. But that will soon change. </p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1777">a bill</a> that allows law enforcement to cite driverless car companies for traffic violations. </p></div><div><p>The citations won’t come with fees, but the car companies will have to report them to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If a company racks up enough citations, the DMV will then be able to change or pull its permits.</p><p>The law, however, doesn’t take effect until 2026, which means Waymo is off the hook for the robotaxi that stalled the vice presidential motorcade. </p><p>San Francisco’s many traffic issues with driverless cars — including incidents in which cars impeded first-responders during emergencies — helped inspire the new law authored by Assemblymember Phil Ting, D-San Francisco. </p></div><div><p>Driverless car company Cruise lost its permit to operate in San Francisco after a series of incidents, including a high-profile case in which a car caught and dragged a pedestrian along the street. </p><p>Incidents had already begun to decline, according to <a href="https://thefrisc.com/cruise-robotaxis-were-banned-from-sf-streets-now-self-driving-cars-have-miles-to-go-before-winning-public-trust/">data analyzed by The Frisc</a>, and continued to drop off after Cruise pulled its fleet off the streets. </p><p>More recent data wasn’t immediately available on Saturday, but a spokesperson for the San Francisco Fire Department said the agency could provide updated figures early next week. </p></div></div></div>
