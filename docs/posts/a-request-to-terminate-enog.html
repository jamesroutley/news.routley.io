    <h1>A Request to Terminate ENOG</h1>

                                                      <pre>Peace,
(which is my usual greeting message, always was, and will ever be, —
because the only thing I&#39;ve always valued the most is peace)

As the Programme Committee Chair of the Eurasian Network Operators
Group (ENOG), I, hereby, with all due respect, request that the RIPE
Executive Board formally dissolve ENOG and cancel all the potential
future meetings indefinitely.

Rationale: ENOG was founded in 2011 per the decision of the RIPE
Executive Board, and it was assumed to be incorporating Ukrainian,
Russian, Belarusian, Armenian, Azerbaijanian, and many other regional
communities in the hope of building a better shared Internet space
among the communities.

In view of the recent events (if not even the prior events), the said
&#34;ENOG community&#34; does not exist anymore, and in no way it could be
clear to the Programme Committee how to arrange a programme for all
the distinct and divided communities colloqually recognized as ENOG at
the time.

Technically, under normal circumstances, a request like this should&#39;ve
gone through a voting process in the PC; however, we currently have
several PC members under ongoing _missile attacks_, and I therefore
don&#39;t believe it is sane to arrange any vote in the PC.

Additionally, at the moment, being a Russian citizen, I don&#39;t believe
I should assume there&#39;s a consensus in the entire RIPE Service Region
to still invest trust in me, without further due diligence, to hold
any official community position in the RIPE community; therefore, I
hereby step down as the PC Chair.

It&#39;s now up to the members of the RIPE NCC Executive Board to decide
on future actions, and I urge the RIPE NCC Executive Board to act.  It
is entirely up to the RIPE NCC Executive Board to consider any future
alignments to replace ENOG.

Stay safe.
