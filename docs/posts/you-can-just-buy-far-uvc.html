</span><a href="https://faruvc.org">Far-UVC</a> is something people have
talked about for years in a &#34;that would be great, if you could buy it&#34;
sort of way.  Coming soon, once someone actually makes a good
product.  But the future is now, and it costs $500.

Many diseases spread through the air, which is inconvenient for us as
creatures that breathe air.  You can go outside, where the air is too
dilute to spread things well, but it&#39;s cold out there, and sometimes
wet.  You can run an air purifier, but cleaning lots of air without
lots of noise is still the world of <a href="https://www.bqap.ca/">DIY</a> <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/better-air-purifiers">projects</a>.  Ideally you could just
shine some light, perhaps in the <a href="https://faruvc.org">222-nm
range</a>, which would leave people alone but kill the viruses [1] and
bacteria.  Yes, let&#39;s do that!

Last year if you asked &#34;<a href="https://strainhardening.substack.com/p/if-far-uv-is-so-great-why-isnt-it">if far-UV is so great, why isn&#39;t it
everywhere?</a>&#34; one of your answers would be:

</p>

<blockquote>
There are very few providers, and hardly any of them sell an
off-the-shelf product. You usually can&#39;t just buy a lamp to try it
out—you have to call the company, get a consultation, and often have
someone from the company come install the lamp. It&#39;s a lot of overhead
for an expensive product that most people have never heard of.

This has changed!  You can buy an <a href="https://aerolamp.net/products/devkit">Aerolamp</a> for $500,
shipped.  Proudly displayed at Thanksgiving:

At $500 this is out of (my) Christmas gift range, but I think we&#39;re now
at the point where dances, churches, offices, rationalist group
houses, schools, etc. should consider them.

(I have no stake in Aerolamp and they&#39;re not paying me, I&#39;m just very
excited about their product.)

A couple weeks ago, I got my braces off.  I kind of wish I had never
had them, though.



When I was younger, two of my teeth were sticking out, and they looked
kind of funny.  I thought that my teeth were just fine, and I didn&#39;t
want to get braces.  But s…</p>

Unlike many families my family celebrates Christmas with really really
a lot of our family.  This past year there were about 29 people at my
Grandfather&#39;s house in the week around Christmas.  I know what you&#39;re
thinking: how does that work?
