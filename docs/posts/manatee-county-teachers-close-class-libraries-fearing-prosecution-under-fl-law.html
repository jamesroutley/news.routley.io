Chapman said many of the books teachers make available to students in their classrooms are likely already approved through the district&#39;s library system, but many teachers have chosen to close access altogether, since making unvetted books available could lead to felony prosecution.</p><p>The district did not, however, directly advise teachers to shut down classroom libraries and cover them up, Chapman said.</p><p><strong>Book Bans:</strong><a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/01/23/after-book-donation-freeze-sarasota-schools-reverse-course/69825682007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:5|${u}">Sarasota School District partially reverses book donation freeze, but not for libraries</a></p><p><strong>Education:</strong><a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/01/18/sarasota-bridget-ziegler-conservative-school-board-members-nationwide/69717635007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:6|${u}">Sarasota ground zero as conservatives seek to replicate Florida school board success</a></p><p>The policy comes in response to HB 1467, which requires all reading material in schools to be selected by an employee with a valid education media specialist certificate. In a message sent from the Manatee district to principals, the material must be “free of pornography” and “appropriate for the age level and group.” New training approved by the State Board of Education also asks media specialists to avoid materials with “unsolicited theories that may lead to student indoctrination.”</p><p>Don Falls, a history teacher at Manatee High School, said some of his colleagues have already covered their bookshelves and he plans to join them. </p><p>“If you have a lot of books like I do, probably several hundred, it is not practical to run all of them through (the vetting process) so we have to cover them up,” he said. “It is not only ridiculous but a very scary attack on fundamental rights.”</p><p>Falls was involved in a lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis over the Stop WOKE Act, which banned the teaching of critical race theory in Florida schools despite it not being in the state&#39;s curriculum. He said the law violates a teacher’s First Amendment rights.</p><p>Jean Faulk, a history and journalism teacher at Bayshore High, had to remove books on democracy and writings from John Adams because they weren’t vetted in the district’s library system. Her bookshelves are now only lined with reference books, she said.</p><p>“This is totally a political move by the governor,” Faulk said. “It has nothing to do with the students.”</p><p>She said her school’s administration sent out a directive to teachers asking them to put away or cover up all books in classroom libraries. Faulk said the books from her classroom libraries would now go to other local libraries or Goodwill.</p><p>Manatee Education Association President Pat Barber said the union advised its teachers to listen to principals and comply with the law, erring on the side of caution.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a scary thing to have elementary teachers have to worry about being charged with a third-degree felony because of trying to help students develop a love of reading,&#34; Barber said.</p><p>Several Manatee teachers have taken to social media to post images of their classroom libraries covered to prevent students from taking books. Posts call the vetting process &#34;cumbersome&#34; and said the process of comparing the books on their shelves with the list of approved books is “incredibly difficult.”</p><p>Each of Manatee County&#39;s more than 60 schools has at least one certified media center specialist to vet books, Chapman said. The district and schools have begun making calls for volunteers to help teachers go through their classroom libraries and inventory what was already approved and what needs to be approved. </p><p>There is no deadline or timeline as to when classroom books would need to be vetted by, he said.</p><p><em>Follow Herald-Tribune Education Reporter Steven Walker on Twitter at @swalker_7.
