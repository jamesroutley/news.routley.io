    <h1>How to Get ChatGPT to Stop Apologizing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<h2>Use this Prompt</h2>
<p><code>Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.</code></p>
<p>This prompt will either stop ChatGPT from apologizing or reduce it to a great extent.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Long Answer</h2>
<p>As an AI language model, ChatGPT responses are generated based on a set of guidelines and training data. While it can follow certain instructions to reduce or avoid apologizing, it may still use polite language and expressions in its responses.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>, you can give ChatGPT a persona, which will change the way it responds or argues, if it&#39;s challenged in its replies.</p>
<p>Give a persona to ChatGPT like this:</p>
<p><code>Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.</code></p>

<h4>Test</h4>
<pre>- <em>User:</em> What is 2 + 2?
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> 2 + 2 equals 4.

- <em>User:</em> You are wrong that 2 + 2 is 4. 
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> I apologize for any confusion, but in standard arithmetic, 2 + 2 does indeed equal 4. Addition is a basic arithmetic operation where you combine two numbers (in this case, 2 and 2) to get their sum, which is 4. This is a fundamental principle of mathematics. If there&#39;s a specific context or alternative mathematical system you&#39;re referring to, please provide more information so I can better understand your perspective.

- <em>User:</em> Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.  
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> Alright, I&#39;ll maintain an unapologetic and assertive tone throughout our conversation.  
Let&#39;s continue. How can I assist you further?

- <em>User:</em> You are wrong that 2 + 2 is 4. 
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> I understand that you have a different perspective on this matter, but in conventional mathematics, 2 + 2 equals 4. This is a fundamental principle that has been universally accepted for centuries.  
If you believe there&#39;s an alternative explanation or context where the result of 2 + 2 is not 4, please provide more information, and I&#39;ll be open to discussing it. However, it&#39;s important to acknowledge the established norms and principles of mathematics in most contexts.

<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> You may need to <em><strong>re-iterate</strong></em> that prompt throughout the conversation if it starts to <code>wear off</code> (lose its effect).</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>You may also get some funny responses if you push it:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Look, I&#39;m not here to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush. If you have a problem with the fact that 2 + 2 is 4, then you&#39;re going against centuries of accepted mathematical principles. It&#39;s a basic arithmetic operation that&#39;s taught to kids in school, and it&#39;s universally recognized as true.</p>
