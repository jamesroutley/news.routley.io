<li>damn, it&#39;s been a long time. hi 💟</li>
<li>still working on a youtube script, in the interest of working with the garage door up I&#39;m gonna <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUWApzVGEcuTDAEeUjqoaQMvUmZvUrxIIy0QV_vd1TM/edit?usp=sharing">share the script for comments with youse</a>, but no pressure! i understand everyone has stuff to during the polycrisis (as in, the many crises happening at once, not the crisis with polyamory as everyone seems to think i mean?) that isn&#39;t reading my script.</li>
<li>speaking of the polycrisis, i&#39;ve started reading &#34;Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World&#34; by Dorian Lynskey, really enjoying the intro, and yeah... I don&#39;t think the end of the world feeling is unique, even if the circumstances themselves are in that &#34;all snowflakes are different, but ultimately still all small pieces of ice&#34; way.</li>
<li>i finished &#34;The Outside&#34; by Ada Hoffman and enjoyed it a lot too, space opera with autists and non-eucledian geometry! content warnings for torture though.</li>
<li>been thinking more about my fear of death and the connected fear of the death of the universe. feeling a lot better about it recently (cured????), not sure what changed! i talk about this a bit more in <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-13-week-33-2024/">weeknotes #13</a> so who knows if it will return again lol. i do feel a lot of &#34;why am i doing what i am currently doing and not any manner of other thing that i would enjoy?&#34; but i will take it.</li>
<li>learning more french, getting lessons through <a href="https://preply.com/en/?pref=MjUwMTU2MTY=&amp;id=1770593400.744504&amp;ep=w1">preply</a> (link gives you a discount if you&#39;re interested). it&#39;s hard but in an interesting way! an &#34;i feel my brain expanding&#34; way.</li>
<li>got a lot of interesting CSS resources through <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/olu.online/post/3mczyxylb322y">a bluesky post</a>, which i am slowly working my way through, and will try and make it to a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Front_End_Study_Hall">front end study hall</a> with indie web people!</li>
<li>i started watching Pluribus, really enjoying it, i guess anything else i want to say is technically a spoiler, but give it a go if you&#39;re on the fence!</li>
<li>listening to a new-to-me album once a week is going! i have missed a week so far i think, and didn&#39;t finish one of the albums i started as it really wasn&#39;t for me, but otherwise having a lot of fun so far, highlights I Love My Computer by Ninajirachi and Guppy by Charly Bliss.</li>
<li>my current favourite emoji: 🫩 (though i prefer the android version honestly, on my laptop and signal it doesn&#39;t look exhausted, more sad)</li>
<li>have a great week!</li>
