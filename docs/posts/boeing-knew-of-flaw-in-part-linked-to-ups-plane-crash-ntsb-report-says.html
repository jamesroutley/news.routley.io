    <h1>Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, NTSB report says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="byline-block"><div data-testid="byline"><p><span data-testid="byline-contributors"><div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0"><p><span>Theo Leggett</span><span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location">International Business Correspondent</span></p></div></span></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>An aircraft that crashed in flames in Kentucky in November had a structural flaw  that had been identified by Boeing on similar planes 15 years ago, according to investigators.</p><p>The MD-11F freighter operated by UPS, crashed after one of its engines separated from the wing as it was preparing to take off from Louisville.</p><p>The plane briefly lifted off from the runway, before hurtling out of control into an industrial area. Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.</p><p>In an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/DCA26MA024%20Investigative%20Update.pdf">update report</a>, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue &#34;would not result in a safety of flight condition&#34;.</p><p>The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997.</p><p>The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of &#34;fatigue&#34; – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.</p><p>It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a &#34;service letter&#34; to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.</p><p>In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.</p><p>Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB&#39;s update made disturbing reading.</p><p>&#34;The structure concerned is not decorative, it&#39;s an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag,&#34; he explained.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences,&#34; he claimed.</p><p>Boeing&#39;s internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.</p><p>Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.</p><p>Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.</p><p>In a statement, Boeing said: &#34;We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.&#34;</p><p>The NTSB&#39;s investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.</p></div></div>
