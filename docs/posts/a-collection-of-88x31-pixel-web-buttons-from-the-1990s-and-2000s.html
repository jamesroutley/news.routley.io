<td><SPAN color="white" size="4"><p>Here is a collection of more than 700 88x31 web buttons from the 1990&#39;s and 2000&#39;s, including the famous &#34;Netscape NOW&#34; and &#34;Internet Explorer&#34; buttons as well as various other buttons for websites of past and present. All were rescued from a now defunct http://harrypagerubbish.webs.com/buttons just before it disappeared without warning. These buttons are an historic example of advertising in the earlier days of the World Wide Web. Enjoy these buttons and use them to your liking.
