    <h1>The Llama Ecosystem: Past, Present, and Future</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As our history shows, we believe deeply in the power of the open source community. We believe that state-of-the-art AI technology is safer and better aligned when it’s open and accessible to everyone.</p><p>Additionally, where there are areas of high entropy, it’s advantageous to build bridges and leverage the innovation that inevitably arises. This was true for PyTorch, where breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion, GPT 3, and GPT 4 continually disrupted the world of AI, and it’s true for Llama as well. For us at Meta, we can summarize the value back along three axes:</p><p><u>Research:</u> New techniques, performance optimizations, tools, and evaluation methods, including work on safety, provide Meta leverage from the research community to more quickly incorporate learnings. Many of these communities are also nascent, and collaborating in the open makes it much easier to make progress;</p><p><u>Enterprise and commercialization:</u> The more enterprises and startups build on our technology, the more we can learn about use cases, safe model deployment, and potential opportunities; and</p><p><u>Developer ecosystem:</u> LLMs have fundamentally changed AI development, and new tools and approaches are emerging daily for manipulating, managing, and evaluating models. Having a lingua franca to the community enables us to quickly leverage these technologies, accelerating our internal stack.</p><p>But this isn’t new for Meta. Just as with <a href="http://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>PyTorch</u></a> and dozens of other publicly released or open source projects, this philosophy is deeply ingrained in our company’s DNA.</p></div><div><p>One thing is for certain: The generative AI space moves rapidly, and we’re all learning together about the capabilities and applications of this technology. Meta remains committed to an open approach for today’s AI. Here are a few of the areas of focus for us as we continue on this journey together:</p><p><u>Multimodal:</u> Just as the world isn’t made up entirely of text, AI can embrace new modalities to enable even more immersive generative experiences;</p><p><u>Safety and responsibility:</u> Generative AI has revitalized the world of responsible AI. We will place even greater emphasis on safety and responsibility, developing new tools, building partnerships, and utilizing Llama as a vehicle for our community to continue to learn about how to build safely and responsibly; and</p><p><u>A focus on community:</u> Much like PyTorch, we see this as a community of developers that have a voice, and we want to give them agency and a vehicle to further their innovation. We aim to provide new ways for the community to showcase work, contribute, and tell their stories.</p></div><div><p>During the <a href="https://www.metaconnect.com/en/home" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Meta Connect</u></a> keynote, we talked a lot about our Llama models and the future of open access. From our sessions to hands-on workshops, we’re excited to share our latest developments with you.</p><p>Here are some ways you can dive deeper and learn more:</p><ol><li><a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Download the model</u></a> and interact with Llama 2.</li><li>Attend the Connect Sessions including our workshops on building with Llama models.</li><li>Visit <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>ai.meta.com/llama</u></a> to read the paper, review our responsible use guide and acceptable use policy, and learn more about the partners that help support the Llama ecosystem.</li></ol></div></div>
