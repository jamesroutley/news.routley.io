<p>Pharmacy giants CVS and Walmart will have to face trials over claims that placing ineffective homeopathic products alongside legitimate over-the-counter medicines on store shelves deceives consumers into thinking that the pseudoscientific products are akin to evidence-based, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs.</p>
<p>The claims come from the nonprofit organization Center for Inquiry (CFI), which filed nearly identical <a href="https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/22151859/CFI-v-Walmart.pdf">lawsuits</a> against CVS and Walmart in 2018 and 2019, respectively, to try to boot homeopathic products from pharmacy aisles for good. CFI claimed that deceptive placement of the water-based products violated the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA).
</p><p>Two lower courts initially dismissed the lawsuits. But, in a <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/Center%20for%20Inquiry%20v.%20Walmart%2020-CV-392.pdf">unanimous ruling</a> last week, a panel of three judges for the District of Columbia&#39;s highest court overturned the dismissals in a consolidated appeal, allowing the trials to move forward.</p>
<p>CFI may need more evidence to prevail during the trial, Senior Judge Phyllis Thompson wrote on behalf of the panel. &#34;But, at this juncture, we cannot say that it is implausible that a reasonable consumer might understand [CVS&#39; and Walgreen&#39;s] placement of homeopathic products alongside science-based medicines as a representation that the homeopathic products are efficacious or are equivalent alternatives to the FDA-approved over-the-counter drugs alongside which they are displayed.&#34;</p>
<h2>Dangerous dilutions</h2>
<p>As longtime Ars readers know, homeopathy is a debunked pseudoscience that dabbles with toxic substances intended to be diluted into oblivion. The practice rests on two nonsensical concepts: that a toxic substance that produces the same symptoms as a disease can be used to cure that disease (like cures like); and that the therapeutic potency of a substance increases with more and more ritualistic dilution, even far beyond the point at which not a single atom of the starting substance remains (the law of infinitesimals). In fact, some homeopaths believe that water molecules can have &#34;memory&#34; of substances.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>At best, homeopathic products are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/">watery placebos</a>. At worst, they&#39;re <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/fda-homeopathic-teething-gels-may-have-killed-10-babies-sickened-400/">poorly diluted toxic potions</a>. The latter isn&#39;t just a hypothetical. In 2017, the FDA confirmed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/fda-confirms-toxicity-of-homeopathic-baby-products-maker-refuses-to-recall/">elevated levels of the toxic substance belladonna (deadly nightshade)</a> in homeopathic teething products intended for infants. The FDA&#39;s finding followed reports of 10 infant deaths and more than 400 illnesses connected to the products.</p>

And the CFI doesn&#39;t mince words. &#34;Homeopathy is bunk,&#34; the organization wrote regarding its lawsuit against Walmart. &#34;All evidence demonstrates that it doesn&#39;t work at any level above that of a placebo. And it can&#39;t work, unless every understanding of science we have is incorrect.&#34; But, placed alongside legitimate medicines in pharmacy aisles, like those in Walmart and CVS, they are &#34;peddled to an unsuspecting public as a cure for everything from ear aches to asthma.&#34;</p>
<p>In the two lower DC courts, the claim that the products&#39; placement in stores could mislead consumers about their efficacy gave judges pause. The judges argued that the placement on shelves with real medicine didn&#39;t &#34;constitute an actionable &#39;representation&#39; as to efficacy&#34; in regard to violating the CPPA.</p>
<p>But the appeals court judges disagreed. They noted that courts in the past have found that such non-verbal cues and imagery may indeed be considered misleading to consumers. For one example, they pointed to a 2017 case in which obsolete motor oils were sold on the same store shelf as non-obsolete motor oils. When the defendants tried to have the case tossed for &#34;failure to recite a cognizable deceptive practice,&#34; the federal district court dismissed the motion, suggesting that it considered the product placement a potentially deceptive practice. That was even despite the fact that the obsolete motor oils carried a warning on their back labels that said the oil &#34;is not suitable for use in most gasoline powered automotive engines built after 1988.&#34;</p>
