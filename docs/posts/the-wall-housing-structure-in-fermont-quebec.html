    <h1>“The Wall” Housing Structure In Fermont, Quebec</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								

								<p>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermont" target="_blank">city of Fermont </a>is small mining town located in northeastern Quebec. It has an unusual appearance due to its prominent housing structure completed in 1974 called &#34;The Wall&#34; (le Mur Écran).</p>

<p>
	This type of housing represents an interesting relationship between the form of the settlement, and the harsh environment in which it lives.</p>
<p>
	Located in a place with sub-arctic temperatures and high winds, the design brief was to accommodate both housing for workers while mitigating the challenges of the local climate.</p>

<p>
	The project was initiated in the late 1960s by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9bec_Cartier_Mining_Company" target="_blank">Quebec Cartier Mining Company</a>, who hired the firm of Desnoyers and Schoenauer to build the town of Fermont.</p>
<p>
	The result? Standing 50 metres high with a length of 1.3 kilometres, &#34;The Wall&#34; was inaugurated in 1974, and is now the symbol of Fermont.</p>
<p>
	Why? This curtain wall complex was designed to protect the city from prevailing winds while developing a warmer micro-climate for town residents. </p>

<p>
	The inspiration of the Wall came from Swedish architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Erskine" target="_blank">Ralph Erskine</a> who had designed a similar building in 1962 to provide housing for a mining town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svappavaara" target="_blank">Svappavaara</a> in the Swedish Arctic. </p>
<p>
	In contrast to <a href="http://www.sevardhet.se/ormen-lange/" target="_blank">Erskine&#39;s residential windscreen building</a>, Fermont&#39;s windscreen building has a multi-use character which includes residential, commercial, and educational facilities.</p>

<p>
	&#34;The Wall&#34; is home to City Hall, businesses, schools, a health centre, and 440 residences! </p>
<p>
	Architects had to define interior and exterior spaces according to the hierarchy of private, semi-public and public domains. Other challenges include providing communal service and recreational facilities to satisfy personal, social, and family needs, and to ensure the possibility of cross ventilation.</p>

<p>
	The entrances to the blocks were placed strategically so that the snowdrift does not affect easy accessibility. Moreover, architects brought all services under one roof with the hope of creating a close-knit community. </p>
<p>
	The main windscreen structure is made up of interconnected housing blocks, of which approximately 1,000 residents live. The apartments were planned so that all of them get enough <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation" target="_blank">sun insolation</a>, which is limited in locations this the far North.</p>
<p>
	The windscreen itself works as a protection for other housing units within its wind shadow.</p>

<p>
	Seven hundred fifty five houses extend beyond the structure, and all of them were prefabricated using a system of pre-engineered wood modules. The proximity of amenities allows for many residents to access services within a short commute, without driving long distances.</p>

<p>
	Fermont&#39;s housing demonstrates a town defined by the terms of the environment. Even though the length of &#34;The Wall&#34; and its appearance does not look very appealing, it serves its purpose quite well.</p>
