    <h1>Lessons on building business value</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
        
        <p>I have extracted some interesting points from <a href="https://youtu.be/DcWqzZ3I2cY?si=-TIL7rCatfR_FckU">Lex - Jeff Bezos podcast</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every day is day one, every day you are deciding what you gonna do. Day one thinking, we start fresh everyday. You never want to get trapped by dogma, history or beliefs. &#34;Everything can improve.&#34;</li>
            <li>Some companies rely on metrics which they do not quite understand. Metrics are proxies for their in-world representations, not actual factual truth indicators. </li>
            <li>If the metric is not understood or optimized, it could be not representing what we are trying to graph. If you manage your business from within metrics, you start thinking as day two thinking </li>
            <li>As a company/team, you need to seek for ways/mechanisms that enable your employees/folks to tell the truth.</li>
            <li>Your most junior person can overrule your most senior person, if they have the data to back it up. In your meetings, the order of voice should go from the most junior person, to the most senior person.</li>
            <li>When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. Meaning that a profound analysis on data is a must. <a href="https://youtu.be/DcWqzZ3I2cY?si=4byOyX-HmFa5ZdoV&amp;t=5097">E.g.</a></li>
            <li>If you have a customers complaining about something, but your metrics shows the other. That is where you need to rearrange your metrics with the right data.</li>
            <li>Identify the things in your business which are stable, and invest time in making them better. E.g. customers in a retail store will want low prices in 10 years time, fast and seamlessly deliveries, big selection of products...</li>
            <li>Meetings accompanied with a document will make the final goal easier. All participants should read the document in a 30-min time window.</li>
            <li>This guarantees an starting point for all the participants in the meeting. The author of the memo should go first in answering the questions from the audience.</li>
        </ul>
