This deal brings together the best-in-class tools for creating, reviewing, and merging code in the age of AI. Graphite will continue to operate as an independent product, now with even greater resources to help our customers ship faster.</p><h3 id="defining-the-new-developer-toolchain">Defining the new developer toolchain</h3><p>Tomas, Greg, and I started building Graphite almost five years ago because the world’s best engineering teams demanded a better code review platform. What we never expected was how dramatically tools like Cursor would transform our industry, empowering engineers to build features in hours or minutes that would have typically taken days or weeks without AI. Previously, we were limited by how quickly we could write code, but now the bottleneck is how quickly we can review it. Leading engineering orgs like Shopify, Snowflake, Robinhood, Figma, and Ramp have realized that the age of AI demands an entirely new developer toolchain, and these companies have turned to Graphite to help them review and merge code at the new speed of creation.</p><p>Listening to our customers’ journeys of AI adoption has helped us sharpen and refine our ultimate vision for Graphite: one integrated platform where humans and agents create, review, and merge code changes collaboratively. A future where PRs become self-driving, where the inner and outer loops collapse into one iterative process, and where speed and quality are no longer at odds. But realizing that vision required deep integrations with the tools our customers use to generate code, and, naturally, Cursor was our first stop.</p><h3 id="why-cursor">Why Cursor</h3><p>From our first conversations with the Cursor team, we were deeply impressed by their thoughtfulness, ambition, and craft. We quickly found that we had a lot more in common than just our largest customers and investors; we shared both a nearly identical vision for the future of software development and set of values around talent density, urgency, and craft. An acquisition wasn’t on our radar; Graphite’s growth curve, product, and team are stronger than ever, and the future of code review has never been more exciting.</p><p>We chose to join forces with Cursor because of the opportunity to create something phenomenal together: the end-to-end platform for building with AI. We’ve long dreamed of connecting the surfaces where we create, collaborate on, and validate code changes, and this deal dramatically accelerates the timeline on which we can make that a reality.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-graphite">What this means for Graphite</h3><p>Graphite’s product and brand aren’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to be the place where hundreds of thousands of engineers at the world’s top software companies review and merge code. The only change is that we now have far greater resources to continue to deliver an incredible product.</p><p>In the coming months, you can expect us to:</p><ul><li><p>Double down on our best-in-class stacked PRs platform and merge queue.</p></li><li><p>Ship thoughtful integrations between Cursor and Graphite to seamlessly connect local development, background agents, and pull requests.</p></li><li><p>Leverage Cursor’s expertise in coding models to make Graphite’s AI features even more intelligent.</p></li><li><p>Combine the best of Graphite’s AI Reviewer and Cursor’s Bugbot into the most powerful AI reviewer on the market.</p></li><li><p>Lay the foundations for an even bolder product vision which we’ll share more on soon.</p></li></ul><p>This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We anticipate closing in the next few weeks, and until then, it’s business-as-usual. On closing, the entire Graphite team will join Cursor to continue building.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>First and foremost, I want to thank our customers. Your feedback has made Graphite an orders-of-magnitude better product, and your willingness to trust us with such a critical piece of the developer toolchain is something we’ve never taken for granted.</p><p>To Hunter, Peter, Christine, and all of our investors: Thank you for your unwavering support. Working with you all has truly been a highlight of this journey.</p><p>To our current and former diamonds: Thank you for everything you’ve given to this company. You&#39;ve worked incredibly hard and made Graphite a huge part of your lives without any certainty that doing so would pay off. Today, we can proudly say that it was all worth it.</p><p>Lastly, to our future Cursor colleagues: We’re so excited to work together. We truly can’t think of a better team to be joining forces with.</p><p>Graphite’s story has had many chapters, and today marks the start of the most exciting one yet. Together with Cursor, we can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p><p>Merrill Lutsky</p><p>Co-founder &amp; CEO</p><p><em>If you’re excited about defining the future of software development with us, we’re hiring for many open roles across the company in NYC &amp; SF. </em><a href="https://graphite.dev/careers"><em>Apply here</em></a><em>.</em></p></article></div>
