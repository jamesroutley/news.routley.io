    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello,</p><p>I always have the itch to learn C, juts because it was such an influental language and when you are digging around a lot in GNU/linux you will have contact with it one way or another.</p><p>What is the way you would suggest learning C in 2023? I am already familiar with other languages (rust..) but would like to have an introduction to the C basics and program some hands-on projects in C, so I can learn the pecularities of the language.</p></div></div></div>
