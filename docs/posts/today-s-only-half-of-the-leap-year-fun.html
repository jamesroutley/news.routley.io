    <h1>Today&#39;s only half of the leap year fun</h1>
    
    
<p>
It&#39;s that time again, when code written in the past four years shows up 
in our lives and breaks something.  Still, while you&#39;re enjoying the 
clown show of game companies telling people to manually set the clocks 
on their consoles and people not being able to fill up their cars, keep 
one thing in mind:
</p>
<p>
Only half of the fun of a leap year happens on February 29th.
</p>
<p>
The rest of it happens in ten months, when a bunch more code finds out 
that it&#39;s somehow day 366, and promptly flips out.  Thus, instead of 
preparing to party, those people get to spend the day finding out why 
their device is being stupid all of the sudden.
</p>
<p>
So, if you got through today unscathed, but are somehow counting days in 
the year somewhere, you now have about 305 days to make sure you don&#39;t 
have your own Zune bug buried in your own code.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
One more random thought on the topic: some of today&#39;s kids will be 
around to see what happens in 2100.  That one will be all kinds of fun 
to see who paid attention to their rules and who just guessed based on 
a clean division by four.
