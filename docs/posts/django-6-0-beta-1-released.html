    <h1>Django 6.0 beta 1 released</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Django 6.0 beta 1 is now available. It represents the second
stage in the 6.0 release cycle and is an opportunity to try out
the changes coming in Django 6.0.</p>
<p>Django 6.0 assembles a mosaic of modern tools and thoughtful design, which you
can read about in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/6.0/">the in-development 6.0 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier Django versions will be
fixed between now and the 6.0 final release. Translations will
be updated following the &#34;string freeze&#34;, which occurs when the release
candidate is issued. The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/6.0/roadmap/">current release schedule</a> calls
for a release candidate in about a month, with the final release scheduled
roughly two weeks later on December 3.</p>
<p>Early and frequent testing from the community will help minimize the number of
bugs in the release. Updates on the release schedule are available <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-6-0-release-timeline-and-next-steps/41275">on the
Django forum</a>.</p>
<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this release is <strong>not</strong> for production
use. However, if you&#39;d like to try some of the new features or help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a copy of the beta
package from <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">our downloads page</a> or
on PyPI.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for this release is Natalia Bidart: <a href="https://github.com/nessita.gpg">2EE82A8D9470983E</a></p>
