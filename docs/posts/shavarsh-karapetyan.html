<p>Karapetyan was born on May 19, 1953, in Armenia&#39;s third largest city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirovakan" title="Kirovakan">Kirovakan</a> (now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadzor" title="Vanadzor">Vanadzor</a> again), then part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan" title="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> in 1964, where Shavarsh finished eight years of school and then attended a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_school" title="Technical school">technical school</a> for auto-mechanics. On the advice of family friends, he started to learn swimming at a young age. He later switched to finswimming. In 1975–1976, Karapetyan served in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Defence_Forces" title="Soviet Air Defence Forces">Soviet Air Defence Forces</a> base in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku" title="Baku">Baku</a> military district.<sup id="cite_ref-RIA_bio_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-RIA_bio-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>In 1974 Shavarsh was riding a bus when the driver pulled over to check on a mechanical problem. The engine was left running and the bus suddenly started rolling down towards a mountain gorge. Karapetyan broke down the partition separating the passengers from the driver&#39;s compartment, then took control of the steering wheel and turned the bus away from the cliff.<sup id="cite_ref-aurora_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-aurora-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

<p>On September 16, 1976, Karapetyan was jogging alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan_Lake" title="Yerevan Lake">Yerevan Lake</a> with his brother Kamo. Karapetyan had just completed his usual finswimming distance of 20 km (12 mi) when he heard the sound of a crash and saw a sinking trolleybus.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> 
</p><p>The trolleybus had lost control and fallen from a dam wall, laying at the bottom of the reservoir some 25 meters (80 ft) offshore at a depth of 10 meters (33 ft).<sup id="cite_ref-yahoo_voices_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-yahoo_voices-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite the challenging conditions of sewage-infested waters and poor visibility due to silt, Karapetyan dived in and used his legs to kick open the back window of the trolleybus. He managed to rescue 46 out of the 92 passengers onboard, saving the lives of 20 individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-grantland_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-grantland-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In total he dove 20 times, each dive lasting about 25 seconds, and pulled out a total of 37 people. 9 others escaped on their own through the window he broke. Unfortunately only 20 of the 46 survived, despite medical attention at the scene.<sup id="cite_ref-aurora_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-aurora-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The combined effect of multiple lacerations from glass shards led to Karapetyan&#39;s hospitalization for 45 days,<sup id="cite_ref-yahoo_voices_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-yahoo_voices-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> as he developed pneumonia and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis" title="Sepsis">sepsis</a>. Subsequent lung complications prevented Karapetyan from continuing his sports career.<sup id="cite_ref-grantland_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-grantland-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> He did, however, insist on one last meet despite his damaged lungs, and managed to set a new world record despite the pain.<sup id="cite_ref-aurora_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-aurora-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Karapetyan&#39;s achievement was not immediately recognized. All related photos were kept at the district attorney&#39;s office and were only published two years later.
