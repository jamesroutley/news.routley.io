    <h1>Why do people not notice our enormous, prominent, clear and contrasting banner?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<p>I&#39;m part of a MediaWiki site called <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="noreferrer">D&amp;D Wiki</a>. <em>Among others</em>, one of our longstanding issues in the public eye was our failure to label clearly enough that certain pages are categorised &#39;Homebrew&#39;, as opposed to &#39;Official&#39;.</p>

<p>Consequently, we pushed through a solution wherein all pages that are not &#39;Official&#39; are labelled with this <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/w/images/5/54/Homebrew_Banner.jpg" rel="noreferrer">lovely homebrew banner</a>. Contrasting with the site&#39;s light, creamy-browns, brazenly displayed is this page-wide, striking black/dark purple/red banner, complete with black-bordered white text that is very largely and clearly displaying the words &#34;Homebrew Page&#34;, with extra minor explanation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:System_Reference_Document" rel="noreferrer">Official pages</a> and <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3.5e_Homebrew" rel="noreferrer">homebrew pages</a> have different colour schemes, different fonts, different text sizes, different table layouts, different title schemes, and, notably, a <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/w/images/b/b8/3.5e_SRD_Banner.jpg" rel="noreferrer">different banner</a> declaring it &#39;official content&#39; that is noticeably different at the shortest glance.</p>

<p>However, I have heard multiple times from reddit, to our chat, to stackexchange itself that, and I quote: &#34;<a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/109309">the homebrew banner is inexplicably hard to notice despite being bright purple.</a>&#34;. Somehow people are still getting these two categories of pages mixed up?</p>

<p>I profess my own inability to understand this situation. Did we overshoot human perception? Did we make it so noticeable, so.. obvious, that it could not be seen from within; Like humanity itself being unaware of the entirety of the universe around them?</p>

<p>How do we make people actually notice our banner? Or is there a better way to inform people of the homebrew nature of the content they&#39;re seeing? Are these blind people all weird freaks, or am I somehow off my nut?</p>
