                <p>In 1978, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston took out a loan to fund development of &#34;Calcu-ledger,&#34; the very tool that could project if taking out a loan were fiscally prudent. In 2025, VisiCalc still has the necessary precision to express the hundreds of billions in spreadsheet profits generated since.</p>

            <p>Unless Dan Fylstra had the world&#39;s largest vest pockets, <a href="https://youtu.be/IU96Pd_npn4?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Steve Jobs&#39;s story</a> about &#34;Dan Fylstra walked into my office and pulled a diskette from his vest pocket&#34; to introduce the spreadsheet in 1977 is apocryphal.</p><p>The punchline, that <em>VisiCalc </em>propelled the Apple II to its early success, is supported by the earnings calls. While <em>VisiCalc </em>remained exclusive to the Apple II, estimates say that 25% of all Apple II sales (at $10K a pop, in 2025 money) were solely for the purpose of running <em>VisiCalc</em>. <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/patenting.htm?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">An un-patented gift to the world</a>, it would go on to be subsumed by the very industry it spawned. </p><p>What&#39;s surprising in looking at <em>VisiCalc </em>today is how much it got right, straight out of the gate. Dan Bricklin&#39;s clear product vision, combined with Bob Frankston&#39;s clean programming produced a timeless, if clunky by modern standards, killer app.</p><p>Here at Stone Tools, &#34;clunky&#34; does not equal &#34;useless.&#34; I have copies of <em>Spreadsheet Applications for Animal Nutrition and Feeding </em>and <em>VisiCalc </em>and I&#39;m ready to ration protein to my swine.</p><hr/><h2 id="historical-record">Historical Record</h2><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/visicalc_historical_context8.jpg" alt="A timeline of VisiCalc and its contemporaries over time. A golden crown rendered in Apple 2 high res graphics sits above the header text, a regal typeface also rendered in Apple 2 high res graphics, which reads &#34;Heirs to the Throne&#34;. A timeline running from 1977 to 1995 runs down the middle. On the right are a number of products that tried to take the throne from VisiCalc and failed. The subhead reads &#34;Pretenders to the Throne&#34; This includes SuperCalc in 1980, Multiplan in 1982, Lotus Symphony in 1984, StarOffice in 1985, Lotus Jazz in 1985, and Lotus Improv in 1991. Down the left we start with &#34;The Birth and Reign of VisiCalc&#34; at 1977. The first “killer app.” VisiCalc launches exclusively for the Apple ][ at $100 ($445 adjusted for 2025) and remains essentially unchallenged for about four years. In 1983 we have &#34;The Birth and Reign of Lotus 1-2-3&#34;. VisiCalc’s warmed-over PC port in 1981 failed to take advantage of the processing power and RAM. Lotus seized the opportunity with a powerful response to VisiCalc, written in assembly, which did for the PC what VisiCalc had done for the Apple 2; the PC had its killer app. $495 ($1,610 adjusted for 2025). 1985 sees &#34;The Regicide of VisiCalc&#34; Lotus purchases Software Arts and ceases all VisiCalc production. VisiCalc on DOS users, and *only* those users, are given an “upgrade” option to 1-2-3 for $250. 1985 also sees &#34;The Birth of Microsoft Excel&#34; First debuts in 1985 on the Apple Macintosh, embracing the new era of GUI-based operating systems and applications. A Windows version soon followed. $395 ($1,189 adjusted for 2025). Into the 90s we see &#34;The Dynasty of Microsoft Excel&#34; With Microsoft embracing Windows as the basis for Excel, Lotus struggles to keep pace with the newcomer,  opting instead to initially back OS/2 as their platform of choice. The writing is on the wall already. Then in 1995 we see &#34;The Regicide of Lotus 1-2-3&#34; IBM acquires Lotus in a hostile takeover. While the product continued for a time, it was effectively out of the market. Lotus products and name ended in 2013.

Then, I will examine <a href="https://archive.org/details/spreadsheetappli0000lane" rel="noreferrer"><em>Spreadsheet Applications for Animal Nutrition and Feeding</em></a> by Ronald J. Lane and Tim L. Cross. I want perspective on how it can be used to assist business owners of all types, not just the white-collar office executives depicted in the advertising.</p><p>Booting into <em>VisiCalc </em>in AppleWin from Windows 11 desktop is fast and frictionless, though I do have to answer at every launch, &#34;Do you want to use 80 columns (Y/N)?&#34; Of <em>course</em> the answer is YES, but until AppleWin supports the 80-column Videx card, I must reluctantly answer NO.</p><p><em>SuperCalc</em>, a contemporary rival, <em>does </em>run in 80 columns. That&#39;s <em>if</em> I can boot <em>SuperCalc</em>. AppleWin complains that it needs 128K of RAM, which is supposedly what it has. For now, I&#39;ll leave that mystery <a href="https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin/issues/1428?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">to the AppleWin developers</a>.</p><p>Once launched, I&#39;m at a screen layout recognizable even to a generation born post-Google; info bar across the top, input bar below it, then the spreadsheet proper. Alphabetic column identifiers run horizontally and numeric row identifiers run vertically down the left-hand side of the screen inscribing the familiar &#34;A1&#34; system. A kindergartner who knows their numbers and ABCs could find cell <code>J17</code>.</p><blockquote>A1 wasn’t really meant to be a name as much as shorthand for that cell. This is why we didn’t use a grid notation like R1C1.</blockquote><h3 id="slashing-prices">Slashing prices</h3><p>Type <code>/</code> and what first appears to be &#34;the entire alphabet&#34; pops up at the top of the screen. Sometimes referred to as the &#34;slash menu,&#34; it remained a fixed and expected option in spreadsheets for many years after its introduction, and <a href="https://excelribbon.tips.net/T013054_Slash_Key_No_Longer_Works_as_Expected.html?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">still exists</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-141618.png" alt="The command prompt from VisiCalc listing all keyboard commands.

The Apple 2 only has left and right arrow keys, no up and down (those were introduced on later models). <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code> toggles direction allowing two arrows to perform the work of four. Clever, but annoying. Using <code>&gt;</code> to &#34;go to&#34; specific cells immediately is often preferred. </li><li><code>34</code> is a true remnant of a simpler time, when RAM was so limited we had to quite literally <em>watch </em>usage while working. <em>VisiCalc </em>is showing us how many free kilobytes of memory are available to use.</li></ul><p>As the sheet grows, <em>VisiCalc </em>dynamically allocates RAM to accommodate and the free memory indicator drops accordingly. A flashing <code>M</code> means your sheet has outgrown available RAM. While <em>VisiCalc </em>dynamically allocates RAM it does <em>not</em> dynamically <strong>de</strong>-allocate it. Save-and-reload will force the sheet into the smallest memory footprint necessary to run it. </p><p>Still not enough memory?

Being the first computerized spreadsheet, it has to help us understand, &#34;What is a computerized spreadsheet?&#34; Then it has to prove, by example, the benefits over traditional pencil and paper methods. Lastly, with foundational knowledge set, it must introduce us to the extended set of tools and purposes thereof. The manual pulls this hat-trick off admirably.</p><p>The quality of the manual was foremost in the publisher&#39;s mind from the start. Personal Software co-founder Peter Jennings, creator of <em>MicroChess</em>, <a href="https://benlo.com/visicalc/index.html?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">recounts the approach taken toward documentation</a>. </p><blockquote>&#34;Meanwhile, Dan (Fylstra) and I in Sunnyvale were doing our best to create a professional product with documentation to match the software quality. We hired a professional writer to write the manual (which we paid for, rejected and rewrote), printed it on high quality glossy stock, and enclosed a well conceived and useful reference card. This professional approach to software for personal computers was unique at the time.&#34;</blockquote><p>The tutorial is divided into four sections, each of which builds upon the previous. It offers gentle guidance into the world of computers and spreadsheets, carefully navigating the reader through the unfamiliar interface and keyboard commands.</p><p>One thing I&#39;m finding as I continue the tutorial each day is how easy it is to recall what I learned in previous days. Even after two days away on other matters, I still find previous knowledge to be &#34;sticky.&#34; That owes a lot to the intuitiveness of the menu commands; every tool feels logical and carefully considered for the task.</p><p>Additionally, there is a kind of rudimentary &#34;autocomplete&#34; for functions. Type <code>@lo(</code> and <em>VisiCalc </em>will fill in <code>@lookup(</code>. You won&#39;t get as-you-type autocomplete, but you will make a best effort to give you the correct function name even if the best you can do is half-remember it.</p><p>The general usage of the program is to move the cursor around on screen and start typing into the highlighted cell. Type text to create a &#34;label&#34; and type numbers to create a &#34;value.&#34; This binary distinction essentially persists to this day, even if formatting control over the cells gives us greater flexibility, or &#34;values&#34; have been sub-typed to be more precise in their intent.</p><p>Values are not restricted to simple numbers or math equations. Functions exist, like <code>@sum()</code> , <code>@(average)</code> , or <code>@(max)</code> which can be chained and nested with other mathematical functions to create very complex formulas. Functions update themselves based on the latest sheet calculation, and this dynamism obsoleted paper methods instantly. It still feels a little magical to see dozens or hundreds of numbers update in a cascade across a large sheet, each cell dutifully contributing its small part to the overall whole.</p><h3 id="replication-relativity-and-recalculation">Replication, relativity, and recalculation</h3><p><code>/R</code> &#34;replication&#34; is one of the most powerful tools in <em>VisiCalc. </em>Cell formulas can be replicated, i.e. copy-pasted, <em>from</em> one-or-a-group of cells <em>to</em> one-or-a-group of cells. When replicating, we are given a chance to shape how each copy of the formula references other cells.</p><p>Source: Cell A3 adds A1 + A2.</p><p>Replicate A3 to B3 and we&#39;re asked, for each cell reference, if we want it to be relative to the new cell or fixed (&#34;no change&#34; in <em>VisiCalc </em>parlance). We&#39;ll answer relative for the first and fixed for the second.</p><p>Target: Cell B3 now adds B1 (relative) + A2 (fixed)</p><p>This functionality remains essentially unchanged today. In <em>Excel, </em>click a formula cell and a small dot appears in the bottom right corner. Drag that dot out to marquee a rectangle of cells, inside of which every cell instantly and automatically receives a relative-only copy of the source cell&#39;s formula.</p><p>In <em>VisiCalc </em>I&#39;m prompted for a &#34;relative or fixed?&#34; decision for <em>every</em> cell reference in <em>every</em> target cell. Replicate a formula with 5 cell references across a column of 100 cells and be ready to answer 5 x 100 prompts. Unfortunate and unavoidable.</p><p>Once I have even a mildly complex sheet, perhaps one that includes processing  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">transcendental functions</a>, making changes becomes time consuming as I have to wait for the <em>entire </em>sheet to update with <em>every </em>change I make to <em>any </em>cell.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-13-161528-1.png" alt="Screenshot from VisiCalc graphing out the SINE function over 17 rows.

When I want to, I can explicitly demand a full recalculation of the sheet with the cute <code>!</code> command. This saves a lot of time when making multiple sheet changes, or even setting things up for the first time.</p><p>You know what else saves a lot of time? Setting the emulator to run at the fastest speed possible. It&#39;s so fast I wasn&#39;t even sure it had done anything. It instantly transforms the system from &#34;fun, if slow&#34; to &#34;I could be productive with this.&#34; This is not to take away from the simple joy of watching the sheet work, but sometimes enough is enough.</p><p>There&#39;s an interesting phenomenon in culture where the ideas and language of a particular work of art become so utterly commonplace it can be hard to appreciate the original for what it was <em>at the time</em>. Kind of a <em>Citizen Kane </em>effect.</p><p>In a sense, using <em>VisiCalc </em>in 2025 feels so familiar it&#39;s almost anticlimactic.</p><p>It&#39;s a little hard to remember, but there was a time when this kind of direct manipulation of data simply wasn&#39;t commonplace. The display and input of data were often highly separated, for many good system performance reasons.

These <strong>two </strong>were chosen because, &#34;They are very common among agricultural microcomputer users.&#34; which is an interesting cultural note.</p><p>I really enjoy seeing software terminology couched in terms of an agricultural target audience. Here, the concept of boolean logic functions is introduced.</p><blockquote>&#34;VisiCalc also contains several logical operator functions which may be used to build conditional statements or actions. For instance, we may want to work with different nutrient requirement values for steers depending on their rate of gain.&#34;</blockquote><p>The book gets further points because the writers do something I think is all too infrequent in guides of this nature. Typically there is an exclusive focus on vagaries like &#34;getting the most out of <em>VisiCalc</em>.&#34; In this book, each chapter of real-world application begins with a section called &#34;Define and Understand the Problem.&#34;</p><blockquote>&#34;...realize the importance of a thorough and complete understanding of the problem to be solved. FIRST, determine what results or outputs are desired. SECOND, know what inputs are available. As your THIRD step, make sure it is possible to get the desired results from the available inputs. The computer is not capable of magically generating information that is otherwise unattainable. LASTLY, know the limitations of the hardware and software.&#34;</blockquote><p>For the chapter &#34;Swine Applications&#34; a full TEN PAGES are devoted to &#34;Define and Understand the Problem.&#34; <em>VisiCalc </em>isn&#39;t even touched until that&#39;s been done as formulas are constructed and tested by hand well before any cells are defined in a sheet.

Please bear with me, I swear I have a point.</p><p>From the book, &#34;The object in formulating a ration for any farm animal is to supply sufficient amounts of the nutrients that will enable the animal to satisfy its needs for a specific function or functions. For example, if we are feeding a first-calf heifer six months after calving, we must be concerned with the productive functions of lactation, growth, gestation, and possibly extra work if extreme distances must be traveled daily. The actual process of ration formulation may require up to four sets of information.&#34; </p><p>I know the suspense is killing you. The four sets of information are: nutrient requirements, feedstuff composition, actual feed intake, and economic considerations (least-cost ration formulation).</p><p>Consider now how <em>VisiCalc </em>nimbly adapts to such a specific and esoteric use case. I can&#39;t imagine Bricklin and Frankston ever once thought, &#34;Gosh, we need to ensure that users calculating post-calving heifer nutrition are adequately covered!&#34;</p><p>What they did right was to stick to a clear vision and not let presumptions of usage cloud their development. As noted earlier, mundanity is an intentional feature of the program&#39;s design. We can really understand that in the above passage and the flexibility this gives <em>VisiCalc </em>to rise to this agricultural challenge.</p><p>I may even go so far as to posit that a piece of software passes the &#34;timeless&#34; threshold if can be used for hog slop protein content as well as Q2 financials at a Wall Street equity firm. This may be the start of a list of Stone Tools Maxims.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-214901.png" alt="Screenshot from VisiCalc showing sample information from the agriculture book.
