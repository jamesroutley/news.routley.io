OpenAI hasn&#39;t said how many parameters <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gpt-4-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" rel="follow">GPT-4</a> has, but it&#39;s estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters -- the more parameters, the better the model can understand input and generate appropriate output.</p><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-bard-is-stepping-up-its-ai-game-with-these-new-features/" rel="follow"><strong>Google Bard is stepping up its AI game with these new features</strong></a></p><p>Currently, OpenAI leads the AI race, with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt/" rel="follow">ChatGPT</a> as its sprinter, an AI chatbot that unleashed a generative AI revolution with its release in November. Microsoft has made hefty investments into OpenAI. The tech giant uses GPT-4 technology in the revamped, AI-powered Bing, and to power its Image Creator. Google has its own AI chatbot, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-bard-is-stepping-up-its-ai-game-with-these-new-features/" rel="follow">Bard</a>, and proprietary LLMs. None of these systems are open source.</p><p>Though open-source AI models already exist, launching Meta&#39;s LLaMA commercially is still a significant step, due to it being larger than many of the available open-source LLMs on the market, and the fact that it is from one of the biggest tech companies in the world.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-vs-bing-chat-vs-google-bard-which-is-the-best-ai-chatbot/" rel="follow"><strong>ChatGPT vs Bing vs Google Bard: Which is the best AI chatbot?</strong></a></p><p>The launch means Meta is directly competing with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google, and that competition could mean significant advancements in the AI field.
