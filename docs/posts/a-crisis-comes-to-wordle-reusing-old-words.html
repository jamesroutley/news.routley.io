    <p>A few days ago, The new York Times (owner of Wordle) announced that from 2 February it would start reusing some words from previous years.</p>
<p>Their announcement started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Wordlers! We have some exciting news to share</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and continued</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting on Monday, we will begin adding previously run words back into play. There are still many first-time answers to debut, but also more chances for Wordle in ones and those magical, serendipitous moments when Wordle overlaps with real life. Happy solving!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, whoever wrote this nonsense deserves an award for fake cheerfulness.  There is absolutely no &#34;exciting news&#34; in that paragraph.</p>
<p>It has caused a bit of a stir in the Wordle Community.  Many wondering why, and some suggesting they will now stop playing the <em>dumbed down</em> version.</p>
<h2 id="it-got-me-thinking">It got me thinking</h2><p>Are they running out of five-letter words?  I&#39;ve gathered the data and crunched the numbers, and here are my findings:</p>
<p>Firstly, I started with a list of English words. I&#39;ve actually had a list for some time, and I knew one day it would come in useful.  It contains 466,547 words: from <em>aahed</em>  to <em>zugzwang</em> .</p>
<p>I then narrowed that down to five-letter words (22,949) before excluding plurals, which are not used in Wordle, and Proper Nouns (such as Paris, or March -- anything with uppercase first letter, but leaving &#34;march&#34; for example).  The list was down to 10,784 words.</p>
<p>Finally, one more trip through the sausage machine.  I put this list in a word processor and calculated how many spelling errors there were.  This, roughly, would help me identify the more <em>common</em> five-letter words.  I doubt many of us could use <em>valew</em>  in a sentence.</p>
<p>We now have a more manageable potential Wordle list of 5,437 words.</p>
<h2 id="the-longevity-of-five-thousand-words">The longevity of five-thousand words?</h2><p>A word-a-day from that list would yield almost 15 years of daily challenges.  Wordle has been running since October 2021.  By my reckoning we have enough to run until 2036</p>
<h2 id="nyt-why">NYT, Why?</h2><p>So that does beg the question: New York Times - why start repeating?</p>
