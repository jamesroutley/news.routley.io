    <h1>Hard problems that reduce to document ranking</h1>

  <div><p>There are two claims I’d like to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>LLMs can be used effectively<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for listwise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank#Approaches">document ranking</a>.</li>
<li>Some complex problems can (surprisingly) be solved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)">transforming</a> them into document ranking problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve primarily explored both of these claims in the context of using patch diffing to locate N-day vulnerabilities—a sufficiently domain-specific problem that can be solved using general purpose language models as comparators in document ranking algorithms. I demonstrated at <a href="https://youtu.be/IBuL1zY69tY?si=l27sUOaECO-o9QFW&amp;t=1846">RVAsec ‘24</a> that listwise document ranking can be used to locate the specific function in a patch diff that actually fixes a vulnerability described by a security advisory, and later wrote on the <a href="https://bishopfox.com/blog/raink-llms-document-ranking">Bishop Fox blog</a> in greater defense of listwise ranking by publishing a <a href="https://github.com/noperator/raink">command-line tool implementation (<code>raink</code>)</a> to prove the idea.</p>
<p>The key insight is that instead of treating patch diffing as a complex problem requiring specialized security engineering knowledge, you can reframe it as ranking diffs (documents) by their relevance to a security advisory (query), applying proven document ranking techniques from information retrieval.</p>
