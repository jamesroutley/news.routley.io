                  <p><SPAN size="2"> Welcome to The Great Renaming FAQ. The problem
                      with most FAQs is they are too long and are often unreadable.
                      One should be able to print out a FAQ and read it over
                      dinner. Thus this FAQ intends to give a concise, readable
                      history of the 1986 Great Renaming of Usenet. The origins
                      of the now mythical Usenet Cabal and the great &#34;comp.women&#34; debacle
                      are also touched on. Although much of what happen so long
                      ago has been lost in the mists of time, or become mythology,
                      this FAQ hopes to be as accurate as possible. </SPAN>

                      from David
                      DeLaney&#39;s Net.Legends
                      FAQ, 2nd Ed. Thus the FAQ&#39;s are not written, but alluded
                      to. This FAQ answers the 5W&amp;H of The Great Renaming and
                      the Backbone Cabal. This information in this FAQ comes
                      from a collection of posts and email the author has collected. </SPAN>

                      of holes were pluged after I read a great history of the

                  <p><SPAN size="2"> According to the Net.Legends FAQ, Usenet&#39;s
                      collective memory lasts about a fortnight. Thus most people
                      know little or nothing about where Usenet came from or
                      how it got where it currently is. Given the seemingly never
                      ending stream of new users, and the drop out or burn out
                      of older readers, the earlier years of Usenet are starting
                      to take on mythological qualities. Yet Usenet can only
                      understand where it is going unless it knows where its
                      been. This history deals with events immediately before
                      the Great Renaming and ends with the death of the Backbone
                      Cabal, and hopes to tell what really happen during Usenet&#39;s
                      more traumatic experiences. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> The years between the creation of the Unix
                      User Network in 1979 and the Great Renaming of 1986 were
                      ones of great growth for Usenet. Over the years, a large
                      enough group of core sites were organized and linked together
                      to give most of North America access to Usenet. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> During these early ye would aars of Usenet,
                      UUCP <SPAN>[http://cs.weber.edu/home/rlove/HTML/uucp.html]</SPAN>,
                      a point-to-point connection protocol was Usenet&#39;s only
                      communication method. NNTP <SPAN>[http://www.academ.com/academ/nntp.html]</SPAN>,

                      (<em><a href="https://amedee.me/">Internet</a></em>&#39;s forefather) had yet to become widely used.
                      The two systems were connected, but not as interdependent
                      as Internet and Usenet are today. </SPAN>

                  <SPAN size="2"> Instead of looking to the user as an amorphous
                  blob, Usenet had the form of a graph (in the graph-theory sense). &#34;Network
                  maps&#34; were produced from time to time which looked like this.
                  (The machine names are real, but the connections are drawn
                  at random.)

          </SPAN><p><SPAN size="2">Now the thing is that on such a diagram you can choose to emphasize
            a set of lines forming a path through the hosts -- say &#34;utzoo - decvax
            - seismo - ihnp4&#34;. The &#34;backbone&#34; was simply a group of hosts whose
            admins agreed to form such a connected set, and to devote whatever
            resources were necessary to carry all the Usenet traffic and to pass
            it on promptly (rather than, say, waiting for overnight when their
            machine was less busy, as other sites often did). Orginially organized
            by Gene
            Spafford <SPAN>[http://www.shadow.net/~proub/net.legends/spaf.html]</SPAN> in
            1983 , the backbone was formalized by Spaf after the Great Renaming.
            Most
            posts arriving on any given machine had
            a backbone site in its path, because it was simply more likely to
            arrive earlier via the backbone than via any other link. Without
            the backbone, news would be i ncredibly delayed or just expire before
            it could be transmitted. This indeed happen at times when one of
            the key sites -- e.g. &#34;ihnp4&#34;, through which almost 100% of the news
            flowed from west cost to east cost --went down.

                      Rick Adams. Adams, site admin for &#34;seismo,&#34; at the Center
                      for Seismic Studies <SPAN>[http://www.css.gov/]</SPAN> in northern Virginia,
                      was powerful for a number of reasons. Among them was its
                      status as the
                      only link between the US and Europe. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> Transmitting news was quite expensive in
                      those days, so the Europeans refused to pay for the fluff
                      groups like net.religion and net.flame. Thus the discussion
                      on the Great Renaming began. According to a post by Joe
                      Buck, Adams proposed a &#34;talk&#34; hierarchy for the high flame
                      groups. (As the GR progressed, it was generally understood
                      that if a group was put in talk.* instead of soc.* it would
                      not be as widely propagated.) </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> According to Buck, &#34;The idea was that he
                      could simply put &#39;!talk&#39; in the configuration file for
                      each connected site that didn&#39;t want these groups,&#34; After
                      Adams threaten to stop participating in Usenet altogether
                      due to resistance to his idea, the Backbone Cabal was given
                      the job of the Great Renaming. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> The Great Renaming started July 1986 and
                      ended in March 1987, according to Henry Edward Hardy&#39;s
                      history. Among the people involved with the initial discussion
                      on the mailing list were Chuq von Rospach and Gene Spafford.
                      There was some concern that the Backbone Cabal, which was
                      made up of a small group male computer experts in their
                      20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, would be deciding the newsgroups for the
                      entire, div erse Usenet community. The Cabal and their
                      cronies often reiterated a magic phrase: &#34;Usenet works
                      by the golden rule: whoever has the gold, makes the rules.&#34; This
                      was their way of saying they weren&#39;t going to pay the long-distance
                      transmission charges for groups they didn&#39;t like. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> Much of the debate centered on ways in which
                      the wider Usenet community could somewhat support the backbone
                      financially, so everyone could keep getting the groups
                      they wanted. In the end, no one thought anything like that
                      would work. Various people also proposed schemes for cutting
                      down volume. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> As the Great Renaming progressed, a current
                      list of proposed new newsgroups was posted to net.news
                      several times along the way. However, protests by a few
                      vocal people forced changes. So under the direction of
                      the Cabal the Great Renaming happen. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> The current comp, misc, news, rec, sci,
                      soc, talk, (local) was created. Yet ironically, nothing
                      really changed for a significant portion of sites, and
                      almost all the sites except company ones still got a full
                      feed. The connectivity, modem baud rates, stora ge capacity,
                      etc improved so dramatically that very few university and
                      public-access sties dropped the soc.* talk.* and later
                      alt.* groups. For a few years after the GR, however these
                      groups were not transmitted to Europe, although that changed
                      after NNTP . </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> So the major effect of the Great Renaming
                      was just to organize the groups better. Since the community
                      in question was Usenet, there was bound to be some disagreement
                      over the proposed general renaming of groups. </SPAN>

                        a member of the Cabal decided he didn&#39;t like how things
                        were going. So he John Gilmore and Gordon
                        Moffett discussed the creation of an &#34;Alternet&#34; over
                        dinner on May 7, 1987 at G.T&#39;s Sunset Barecue in Mount
                        View California. An &#34;alternative&#34; distribution system
                        was organized by this group that didn&#39;t use the &#34;backbone&#34; links.
                        A new top-level hierarchy name &#34;alt.*&#34; was created for
                        this distribution. In Henry Edward Hardy&#39;s history, <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/tracts/nc/images/BKRsmall.jpg">Reid</a> is
                        quoted as saying: </SPAN>
                  </p><blockquote><SPAN size="2"> <em> John&#39;s home computer was &#34;hoptoad&#34;;
                        my home computer was &#34;mejac&#34;. We set up a link between
                        us, and each of us set up a link to amdahl, and we vowed
                        to pass all alt traffic to each other and to nurse the
                        net along. In those days one sen t out numerous newgroup
                        messages in the hopes that one would &#34;take&#34;; by the end
                        of May the groups alt.test, alt.config, alt.drugs, and
                        alt.gourmand were active. At the time I also managed &#34;decwrl&#34;,
                        so I quietly added &#34;alt&#34; to the list of groups that it
                        carried. </em> </SPAN></blockquote>
                  <p><SPAN size="2"> Reid created the first alt.* group, <a href="news:alt.gourmand"> alt.gourmand</a> ,
                      because the Cabal wanted to put his recipe group under
                      rec.food.* Gilmore objected the Cabal&#39;s dropping of net.flame
                      and the refusal to create rec.drugs. (Moffett just wanted
                      to help.) <a href="news:alt.drugs">Alt.drugs</a> was also
                      been created around this time. (One of the big debates
                      of the Great Renaming had been whether there should be
                      a &#34;drugs&#34; newsgroup *anywhere,* This putative newsgroups
                      was the example people used of a group that sysadmins would
                      not be able to convince their bosses to support.) </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> Nearly a year later there was the rec/soc.sex
                      debate This was the attempted creation of a sex group that
                      caused alt.* to take off. There was a lot of sex-related
                      traffic being carried in soc.singles at the time, so when <a href="https://amedee.me/missing-middle/ui_alt_sex.htm"> Richard
                      Sexton</a> jokingly suggested a <a href="https://amedee.me/missing-middle/ui_alt_sex.htm" news:alt.sex=""> alt.sex </a> and <a href="news:alt.rock-n-roll"> alt.rock-n-roll </a> the
                      afternoon of April 3, 1988. Reid sent the following to
                      the Backbone Cabal when he did it: </SPAN>
                  </p><blockquote><SPAN size="2"><em>That meant that the alt network
                        now carried alt.sex and alt.drugs. It was therefore artistically
                        necessary to create alt.rock-n-roll, which I have also
                        done. I have no idea what sort of traffic it will carry.
                        If the bizzarroids take it over I will rmgroup it or
                        moderate it; otherwise I will let it be. <br/>

                  <h2>The Death of the Backbone Cabal </h2>
                  </a></SPAN>
                  <p><SPAN size="2"> A number of simultaneous events rendered
                      the Backbone Cabal irrelevant. The most important was the
                      increase use of NNTP around this same time. Usenet&#39;s use
                      of Internet made it easer to ignore what the news admins
                      thought. Acording to Reid <SPAN>[http://reid.org/brian/]</SPAN>,
                      the Backbone started to decline when he and <a href="https://amedee.me/missing-middle/ui_alt_sex.htm">Richard
                      Sexton</a> snuck the site &#34;gryphon.com&#34; into the backbone.
                      It was arranged to get &#34;gryphon,&#34; a 386 PC in Greg Laskin&#39;s
                      living room in Los Angeles, to get news feed from &#34;famous
                      and important (NASA JPL)&#34; backbone sites and thus put into
                      the official backbone map. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> Also, the new procedures set up after the
                      Great Renaming led to a challenge by &#34;readers&#34; against
                      the &#34;privileged&#34; positions of the admins. Early in Usenet&#39;s
                      life, one could create a group simply by posting to it,
                      and a number of groups were created because of typos. Later
                      a new group would be created after a subject had sufficient
                      traffic on an existing group. Then backbone folks would
                      figure out the name and create it. The Cabal was strongest
                      right before the Great Renaming: backbone sites refused
                      to carry groups they considered stupid. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> The new procedure went something like this,
                      according to Greg Woodbury. Someone proposed a newsgroup
                      and then the Cabal talked about the potentials of/for the
                      new group. The Cabal defined a name for the group, and
                      asked for the views of other admins a bout the group and
                      then finally if the group name was good enough they would
                      create the group. The original system eventually became
                      the proposal and &#34;vote&#34; scheme. Holding votes was a way
                      to make people shut up if a group was unpopular. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> The current voted format was laid down around
                      right before the Great Renaming, but not used until 1987.
                      Once the voting mechanism was in place, the individual
                      opinions of the backbone-site admins no longer mattered
                      much.. </SPAN>
                  </p><p><SPAN size="2"> Lastly, Usenet&#39;s changing make up was involved.
                      Adams was given a loan by USENIX to set up a non-profit
                      Usenet site. Eventually this became UUnet and thus as a
                      commercial entity existing to distribute news, had every
                      reason _to_ carry all of alt.*. </SPAN>

                  <h2> V. The Last Days: The Great &#34;comp.women&#34; debacle </h2>
                  <p> During the Cabal&#39;s last days, its death was quicken by &#34;comp.women&#34; debacle,
                    as it was later known. In summer, 1988, a newsgroup for woman
                    was proposed. Its creation became the subject of a massive
                    flame war because its supporters wanted to put it in the
                    comp.* groups because this would insure a better propagation.
                    Opponents noted that this hierarchy was devoted to far more
                    technical things. After *much* discussion someone created
                    a &#34;comp.society.woman&#34; out of exasperation. This person got
                    a great deal of flamage for doing so, but the group came
                    to life after it was created.
                  </p></SPAN><p><SPAN size="2"> About a month or so later, the backbone having gone almost
                    entirely silent, Spaf announced he was going to shut it down,
                    it had become silent because very few people were using dialup
                    UUCPnet links anymore. A few months after _that_, it was
                    observed that the list had become /dev/null. The Backbone
                    Cabal was dead, and the &#34;Usenet Cabal&#34; myth was born.
