    <h1>Lithium-ion batteries a growing fire hazard in NYC garbage trucks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>Fires inside New York City garbage trucks caused by lithium-ion batteries are rising at an alarming rate, prompting sanitation officials to issue repeated public warnings against tossing the devices in household trash.</p><p>Sanitation department spokesperson Joshua Goodman said 18 fires on city collection trucks over the last year were “likely related” to the batteries — a threefold increase from the year before.</p><p>The batteries are supposed to be disposed alongside other hazardous materials, and city officials urge New Yorkers to get rid of them at <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/harmful-products/special-waste-drop-offs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disposal sites</a> or at sanitation outreach events.</p><p>While no injuries have been reported from the truck fires, city officials say they are concerned about the dangers to sanitation employees as these batteries proliferate in the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/fdny-e-bike-battery-fires-in-nyc-on-pace-to-double-this-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">small electronic devices and e-bikes</a> that are widely used by the city’s food delivery workers.</p><p>“This is certainly a growing challenge that we as an industry are facing,” said Gregory Anderson, the sanitation department&#39;s deputy commissioner for policy and strategic initiatives, during an April 19 City Council hearing.</p><p>On April 15 in the Bronx, FDNY units responded to a fire that had erupted inside a sanitation truck near Grand Avenue and North Street in University Heights.</p><p><a href="https://www.norwoodnews.org/update-university-heights-fire-in-garbage-truck-caused-by-lithium-ion-battery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Norwood News</a> reported that witnesses saw the flames and alerted the truck crew, who had to dump the burning garbage onto the street in a video provided by a resident. An FDNY spokesperson said an unspecified lithium-ion battery was recovered from the garbage and handled by a hazmat team.</p><p>“It is against the law to dispose of lithium-ion batteries in your trash or regular recycling, and these fires are clear evidence that doing so endangers the lives of our sanitation workers,” Goodman said.</p><p>An FDNY spokesperson said the department doesn’t track data on the number of lithium-ion battery fires that break out in city-owned vehicles.</p><p>But the devices are a growing cause for concern. A<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/e-bike-sparks-fatal-astoria-house-fire-killing-7-year-old-and-teenager" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> fire sparked by an e-bike battery in Astoria earlier this month</a> killed a 7-year-old and a 19-year-old. The FDNY reports there have been more than 400 fires caused by lithium-ion batteries in the city over the last four years.</p><p>City Councilmember Sandy Nurse has introduced a <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5958274&amp;GUID=9529460F-D911-4799-BB79-3F26AD53D8DD&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bill</a> to require the sanitation department to develop a plan for educating New Yorkers about the proper disposal of these batteries, including holding regular disposal events.</p><p>The city has a dedicated <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/harmful-products/special-waste-drop-offs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hazardous waste disposal site</a> in each borough — but the hours of operation for these sites are limited.</p><p>Nurse pointed out that many people who know the dangers of lithium-ion batteries are trying to get them out of their own households.</p><p>“The idea of storing them in your house is also very dangerous,” said Nurse. “So they&#39;re just trying to get it out of their house. And without more access points to drop stuff off, they’re just throwing it in the trash, because it&#39;s out of their house and it&#39;s out of sight, out of mind.”</p><p>Harry Nespoli, the president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen&#39;s Association, said the battery fires are the latest danger that sanitation employees face because the public doesn’t know what to do with hazardous waste.</p><p>“They just think putting it in the garbage, it disappears,” Nespoli said.</p></div><!--]--><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div>
