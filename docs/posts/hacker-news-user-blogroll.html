        <td>You probably have seen this in the front page sometime last week due to the &#34;Fast machines, slow machines&#34; post :)
I started this blog during exams session back in university and I&#39;ll reach the 20-year mark next year. Wow. I write about my own projects, but also tech in general based on my current interests, which at the moment are around Rust, Bazel (again), and Unix systems in general.
It&#39;s interesting how the blog has changed: I used to write short posts almost daily describing whatever I had been tinkering with in open source projects (back when I contributed to NetBSD and Gnome regularly)... or whatever crossed my mind really. These days, most of those misc posts go into social media, and the blog is reserved for purposeful articles, which end up being much longer (and thus infrequent).
Commenting on the blog used to be much more common years ago, but these days discussion happen off-site in either social media or here. Similarly, people used to visit the blog periodically, but these days nobody does: traffic to the blog is either from organic searches or from spikes due to referrals from sites like HN.
As for how I build it: the posts are written in Markdown; I use Hugo to generate the site; Bootstrap for styling; and my custom web service (EndTRACKER) to offer email subscriptions, post voting and commenting, as well as privacy-respecting analytics.</td>

        <td>It&#39;s pretty new, first post was made in September of 2022. I&#39;ve been going at the speed of ~1 post per month since then so I got 8 posts.
I mostly talk about stuff I&#39;ve been learning about. For instance:
1. Lagrangian mechanics I [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/lanlifshitz_1/notes.html] and II [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/lanlifshitz_2/notes.html]
2. Group theory (solubility and symmetric groups in particular) [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/insolubility/p.html]
Besides this, I occasionally write about some of my own explorations as well; stuff that doesn&#39;t fit as neatly into a university course format:
1. Going over a random lemma from Newton&#39;s Principia [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/lemma14/lemma14.html]
2. Encoding ternary logic into the lambda calculus (I previously posted on HN) [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/ternary/ternary.html]
3. Some epistemological ideas (tbh this is not very good and I intend to write a better post about this stuff soon) [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/pragsol/p.html]
I hope you guys enjoy and give me some feedback if you got some.</td>

So many great websites, it almost reminds one of the good old days, where you could wander from one blog to another.I have ended up with two blogs and by no means update them often enough. My personal blog started out as being tech-focused with a bit of photography and motorcycle content, but is probably leaning more and more in way of photography and motorcycles.
https://jesperreiche.com/
Hence I started a more simple static site generated from Github to handle the more tech-oriented topics. But as fate would have it, I have worked very little with any even mildly interesting tech-related subjects since then so the blog is a bit stale, even though I really like the design.

Before becoming a full time software engineer I used to develop video games for fun, initially in Game Maker but then later in Unity and other languages. Over time I&#39;m aiming to (re)publish them on my website, rather than just leaving them to rot on my hard drive. None were particularly big hits back in the day, though the most successful was probably Dominos 2: Winter Edition, a physics based platformer with level editor. You can play it here:

Tend to write about lessons I’ve learned that others find useful, or stories I think will be enjoyable. Helps me collect my thoughts and practice my writing!
Examples would be;
- Want to found a start-up? Work at one first (https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/learn-at-scale-up/)
- Adding latency: one step, two step, oops (https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/latency/)
- My most impactful code (https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/most-impactful/)
- On working too hard: finding balance, and lessons learned from others (https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/working-too-hard/)
Occasionally get a popular share on HN or people mentioning they read my blog in real life, which makes it feel worth it.</td>

It&#39;s a new site. Some of my favorites so far:
- https://daveon.design/what-are-you-optimising-for.html - How managers ask for something and get something else, but think they&#39;re doing a good job
- https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.ht... - UX design often looks lovely, but what is it missing? Joy.
- https://daveon.design/metrics-and-mistakes.html - on measuring things... and poetry.
I&#39;m particularly happy with the design of the site: I&#39;d love to hear what readers think of the layout and typography. My CSS style is called &#39;manuscript&#39; and it&#39;s very inspired by older book and manuscript look and feel.

        <td>About two months ago, there was an Ask HN about the most interesting interesting tech you built for just yourself [1]. In this topic, I shared about my Ghidra modifications to unlink pieces of an executable back into relocatable object files [2] in an effort to reverse-engineer a PlayStation 1 video game.
Long story short, I&#39;ve wanted to write about this esoteric but powerful technique and it snowballed into starting my own blog with a series of articles about reverse-engineering. It&#39;s still a WIP draft, quite rough around the edges and not ready for prime-time, but you only have that kind of Ask HN thread once (every couple of years I assume).
Side-note: the Google and Bing webcrawlers managed to find and index that domain name despite having no public links to it whatsoever (to my knowledge) until now, my only logical explanation is that they&#39;ve found it by scrapping the WHOIS database. It&#39;s also hosted inside my home on my personal Synology DS218 NAS with a rather dodgy setup, which will probably crash and burn under any level of load by the time you&#39;ve read this comment.

        <td>I started NLJ back in 2020. It is built with WordPress (hosted on Hetzner VPS and managed with Cloudron). I have published more than 800 articles and 350 short-form posts (almost all posts by me, but my friend has published 30something articles). I write about whatever interests me (I tell myself this means there is something for everyone). Common topics include, but are not limited to, tech (digital ownership, open source software, feeds, and my learning Linux), history (usually American or Roman), old books and poems, anime, visual novels (mainly English translations of freeware NScripter/KiriKiri novels), photos from my walks, fictional dialogues, and occasional commentary about life in NYC.

I used to have a large blog ten years ago, with at least one post per day, because every blog guru on the internet said you needed to post every day to grow an audience. But I&#39;m not smart enough to have something interesting to say every day, so it was rather poor quality. So I started this new iteration from scratch and post once or twice a year, mostly about software design.</td>

- List of categories (Java, PostgreSQL, etc.): https://www.databasesandlife.com/categories/
Started life on uboot.com (does anyone remember that?) then migrated to WordPress, and now Hugo.
The only articles which really get any hits any more are those where I&#39;ve specifically solved problems I was having, i.e. posts which are similar to Stack Overflow answers. I guess people search for the error messages and find my articles, so that&#39;s search working as intended I guess.
If I write anything else e.g. my thoughts on software development, it&#39;s still a useful exercise to focus the mind, and I can send the article to a few mates and they might read it, but that&#39;s it, no hits from Google etc.
Back in the days of Google Reader I used to have some readers via RSS, and I used to follow a number of interesting blogs from various individuals I&#39;d found. Those were nice times, but I guess they&#39;re over.</td>

My personal blog. I originally started it when I was running my first company to document the stuff I learned. It&#39;s been around in various incarnations since 2008, but I don&#39;t blog very often. In the last couple of years, it&#39;s devolved into personal book and movie reviews.

I mainly write about energy transition stuff, intersecting with my work at TenneT. I like to analyze stuff as a hobby without the work pressure. In the past I have used blog posts internally at TenneT as well if something came up that was similar to a post haha.
Traffic is mainly driven by summarizing and linking to a post on linkedin.

This one ended up on the front page of HN and gets hundreds of visits monthly. I wrote it because it&#39;s the post I would have liked to read instead of reading the papers themselves.
* An internship working on &#34;Customers who bought this also bought&#34; at Amazon 16 years ago -- https://vikramoberoi.com/an-internship-working-on-customers-.... I wrote this one as an addendum to throwaway tweet I posted that went viral.
* How I made atariemailarchive.org --
 https://vikramoberoi.com/how-i-made-atariemailarchive-org/. I wrote this one when I open-sourced the dataset behind atariemailarchive.org. The dataset got featured in Data is Plural and in a podcast interview I did with Jeremy Singer-Vine.

My favorite personal blog to read this past year is Phil Eaton&#39;s (eatonphil on HN): https://notes.eatonphil.com/.
I enjoy the subject matter he posts about (a lot of systems work and research, primarily), but his other posts are great too.
His post, &#34;Is it worth writing about?&#34; is a nice inspirational one for folks who want to/have been thinking about writing: https://notes.eatonphil.com/is-it-worth-writing-about.html.</td>
