    <h1>meta: micro posts are in the feed now</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 6, 2024</em></p><p>Hi out there to any folks subscribing via RSS! You probably got a bunch of posts in your feed reader just now that had to do with an exploration of starting a business I did in August of last year. And with the next post in your feed, you&#39;re going to start getting more like that.</p><p>If that&#39;s cool with you, then great: no action required on your part to get everything. However, if you&#39;d like to be more picky about which of my posts you get, re-point your feed reader to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/index.xml">https://bytes.zone/posts/index.xml</a> for only deeper posts</li><li><a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/index.xml">https://bytes.zone/micro/index.xml</a> for only micro posts</li><li><a href="https://bytes.zone/index.xml">https://bytes.zone/index.xml</a> for everything</li></ul><p>BTW, about the &#34;micro&#34; name: I started this thinking of these as truly tiny, but they ended up being simply looser and less well-researched than the bigger posts I do. They may end up being more like 140-character things sometimes, but the real point is to &#34;work with the garage door up&#34; and give you a look at what I&#39;m doing on a more regular basis.</p></article></div></div>
