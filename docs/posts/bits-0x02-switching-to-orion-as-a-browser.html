<p>The most interesting thing I wanna share is my browser switch. I’ve always been using Arc. As that is done, I made the switch to Zen. Pretty buggy but ok. The biggest problem I had was the power draw. As I’m preparing a more nomadic lifestyle, I really need to care for my battery. The power draw is really just way too high. By accident, I stumbled upon <a href="https://browser.kagi.com/">Orion</a>. I’ve had it in the back of my head but for whatever reason never even looked at it. I’ve been using kagi as a search engine on and off for a while now.</p>

<p>It’s a safari-based browser so it’s really heavily optimized for power draw. It has almost all features I need and supports chrome and firefox extensions, which is wild. You can create spaces just like in Arc, which is a must have. You have all the bells and whistles you need. The only thing I’m missing is multi-account containers, or a way to isolate google or meta products for example into its own profile. But I can live with that for now. The browser is in active development and the team is very responsive to feedback (<a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">see here</a>).</p>
