    <h1>Formula One’s sharpest car designer is also its master of loopholes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p data-type="paragraph">LONDON—Adrian Newey estimates that he has spent a quarter of his life in wind tunnels, testing car designs. It’s possible that he’s spent another quarter nosing around the F1 rulebook. </p><p data-type="paragraph">What he spent all that time looking for was loopholes, little crannies in the regulations that he could exploit to find  and, eventually, drive a car through at 200 miles per hour. Over the course of 40 years in the sport, that uncanny ability made Newey the leading aerodynamicist in the world’s fastest motor racing series, and turned him into an architect of the Red Bull team’s success. </p></section></div></article></div>
