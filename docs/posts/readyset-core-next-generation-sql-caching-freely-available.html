    <h1>ReadySet Core: next-generation SQL caching, freely available</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Introducing ReadySet Core</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago, we <a href="https://readyset.io/blog/introducing-readyset">announced that we’re building ReadySet</a>, the next generation of SQL caching.</p>
<p>ReadySet connects to an upstream Postgres or MySQL instance, automatically maintaining a cache for specific queries by listening to the database replication stream. Rather than forcing developers to switch to a key-value store or copy their database to a new provider for high performance, ReadySet adds an ultra-low latency cache to your existing database.</p>
<p>We believe there’s a future where developers won’t need to write their own complex, error-prone caching layers.</p>
<p>To get them there, we’re releasing <a href="https://github.com/readysettech/readyset">ReadySet Core</a>, a freely available version of ReadySet that you can run anywhere from your own laptop to any cloud provider, on as many nodes as you need.</p>
<p>You can connect ReadySet Core to your database and start caching queries in less than five minutes by using the ReadySet orchestrator. Click <a href="https://github.com/readysettech/readyset#getting-started">here</a> to get started.</p>
<p>Interested in what’s behind the curtains? The source code for ReadySet Core (written entirely in Rust!) is now available under the BSL license, converting to a fully open-source Apache license after four years. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/readysettech/readyset">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to chat about ReadySet or just trade dog pics, come hang out with us in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/readysetcommunity/shared_invite/zt-18z5bxv02-C5R08CYFL00jXmIqjd7Ziw">community Slack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<p>ReadySet is under active, heavy development. Do you have questions or feature requests? Need help getting started? Hop into <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/readysetcommunity/shared_invite/zt-18z5bxv02-C5R08CYFL00jXmIqjd7Ziw">our Slack</a> and let us know!</p>
<p>Our team is hard at work building out ReadySet Cloud, our fully-managed cloud product. Interested in trying it out? Sign up for our <a href="https://readysettech.typeform.com/to/BqovNk8A">Cloud waitlist</a> today!</p></div></div></div>
