    <h1>RC: Week 4</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-learning-algorithms">
        <p>I&#39;ve been following the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/">
        MIT 6.006 course</a> as I never had a proper introduction to algorithms
        before, which I felt has been holding me back when programming as I did
        not have a good grasp of more fundamental algorithms (sorting, shortest
        path, etc.) and data structures (arrays, dictionaries, sets, etc.). I&#39;m
        really enjoying myself so far, a bit more than halfway through the
        course.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above I&#39;ve been slowly doing LeetCode problems
        together with some other RC attendants and it&#39;s been great fun. Hope to
        get some more problems under my belt and tackle medium and hard in due
        time!</p>
