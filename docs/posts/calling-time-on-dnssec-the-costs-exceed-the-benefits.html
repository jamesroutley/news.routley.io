    <h1>Calling time on DNSSEC: The costs exceed the benefits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m calling time on DNSSEC. Last week, prompted by a change in my DNS hosting setup, I began removing it from the few personal zones I had signed. Then this Monday the .nz ccTLD experienced a <a href="https://internetnz.nz/news-and-articles/dnssec-chain-validation-issue-for-nz-second-level-domain/">multi-day availability incident</a> triggered by the annual DNSSEC key rotation process. This incident broke several of my unsigned zones, which led me to say <a href="https://mastodon.nz/@mattb/110454220262285434">very unkind things</a> about DNSSEC on Mastodon and now I feel compelled to more completely explain my thinking:</p><p><strong>For almost all domains and use-cases, the costs and risks of deploying DNSSEC outweigh the benefits it provides. Don’t bother signing your zones.</strong></p><p>The .nz incident, while topical, is not the motivation or the trigger for this conclusion. Had it been a novel incident, it would still have been annoying, but novel incidents are how we learn so I have a small tolerance for them. The problem with DNSSEC is precisely that this incident was not novel, just the latest in a <a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html">long and growing list</a>.</p><p>It’s a clear pattern. DNSSEC is complex and risky to deploy. Choosing to sign your zone will almost inevitably mean that you will experience lower availability for your domain over time than if you leave it unsigned. Even if you have a team of DNS experts maintaining your zone and DNS infrastructure, the risk of routine operational tasks triggering a loss of availability (unrelated to any attempted attacks that DNSSEC may thwart) is very high - almost guaranteed to occur. Worse, because of the nature of DNS and DNSSEC these incidents will tend to be prolonged and out of your control to remediate in a timely fashion.</p><p>The only benefit you get in return for accepting this almost certain reduction in availability is trust in the integrity of the DNS data a subset of your users (those who validate DNSSEC) receive. Trusted DNS data that is then used to communicate across an untrusted network layer. An untrusted network layer which you are almost certainly protecting with TLS which provides a more comprehensive and trustworthy set of security guarantees than DNSSEC is capable of, and provides those guarantees to all your users regardless of whether they are validating DNSSEC or not.</p><p>In summary, in our modern world where TLS is ubiquitous, DNSSEC provides only a thin layer of redundant protection on top of the comprehensive guarantees provided by TLS, but adds significant operational complexity, cost and a high likelihood of lowered availability.</p><p>In an ideal world, where the deployment cost of DNSSEC and the risk of DNSSEC-induced outages were both low, it would absolutely be desirable to have that redundancy in our layers of protection. In the real world, given the DNSSEC protocol we have today, the choice to avoid its complexity and rely on TLS alone is not at all painful or risky to make as the operator of an online service. In fact, it’s the prudent choice that will result in better overall security outcomes for your users.</p><p><strong>Ignore DNSSEC and invest the time and resources you would have spent deploying it improving your TLS key and certificate management.</strong></p><p>Ironically, the one use-case where I think a valid counter-argument for this position can be made is TLDs (including ccTLDs such as .nz). Despite its many failings, DNSSEC is an Internet Standard, and as infrastructure providers, TLDs have an obligation to enable its use. Unfortunately this means that everyone has to bear the costs, complexities and availability risks that DNSSEC burdens these operators with. We can’t avoid that fact, but we can avoid creating further costs, complexities and risks by choosing not to deploy DNSSEC on the rest of our non-TLD zones.</p><h3 id="but-dnssec-will-save-us-from-the-evil-ca-ecosystem">But DNSSEC will save us from the evil CA ecosystem!</h3><p>Historically, the strongest motivation for DNSSEC has not been the direct security benefits themselves (which as explained above are minimal compared to what TLS provides), but in the new capabilities and use-cases that could be enabled if DNS were able to provide integrity and trusted data to applications.</p><p>Specifically, the promise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)</a> is that with DNSSEC we can be free of the X.509 certificate authority ecosystem and along with it the expensive certificate issuance racket and dubious trust properties that have long been its most distinguishing features.</p><p>Ten years ago this was an extremely compelling proposition with significant potential to improve the Internet. That potential has gone unfulfilled.</p><p>Instead of maturing as deployments progressed and associated operational experience was gained, DNSSEC has been beset by the discovery of issue after issue. Each of these has necessitated further changes and additions to the protocol, increasing complexity and deployment cost. For many zones, including significant zones like google.com (where I led the attempt to evaluate and deploy DNSSEC in the mid 2010s), it is simply infeasible to deploy the protocol at all, let alone in a reliable and dependable manner.</p><p>While DNSSEC maturation and deployment has been languishing, the TLS ecosystem has been steadily and impressively improving. Thanks to the efforts of many individuals and companies, although still founded on the use of a set of root certificate authorities, the TLS and CA ecosystem today features transparency, validation and multi-party accountability that comprehensively build trust in the ability to depend and rely upon the security guarantees that TLS provides. When you use TLS today, you benefit from:</p><ul><li>Free/cheap issuance from a number of different certificate authorities.</li><li>Regular, automated issuance/renewal via the ACME protocol.</li><li>Visibility into who has issued certificates for your domain and when through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency">Certificate Transparency</a> logs.</li><li>Confidence that certificates issued without certificate transparency (and therefore lacking an SCT) will not be accepted by the leading modern browsers.</li><li>The use of modern cryptographic protocols as a baseline, with a plausible and compelling story for how these can be steadily and promptly updated over time.</li></ul><p>DNSSEC with DANE can match the TLS ecosystem on the first benefit (up front price) and perhaps makes the second benefit moot, but has no ability to match any of the other transparency and accountability measures that today’s TLS ecosystem offers. If your ZSK is stolen, or a parent zone is compromised or coerced, validly signed TLSA records for a forged certificate can be produced and spoofed to users under attack with minimal chances of detection.</p><p>Finally, in terms of overall trust in the roots of the system, the CA/Browser forum requirements continue to improve the accountability and transparency of TLS certificate authorities, significantly reducing the ability for any single actor (say a nefarious government) to subvert the system. The DNS root has a well established transparent multi-party system for establishing trust in the DNSSEC root itself, but at the TLD level, almost intentionally thanks to the hierarchical nature of DNS, DNSSEC has multiple single points of control (or coercion) which exist outside of any formal system of transparency or accountability.</p><p><strong>We’ve moved from DANE being a potential improvement in security over TLS when it was first proposed, to being a definite regression from what TLS provides today.</strong></p><p>That’s not to say that TLS is perfect, but given where we’re at, we’ll get a better security return from further investment and improvements in the TLS ecosystem than we will from trying to fix DNSSEC.</p><h3 id="but-tls-is-not-ubiquitous-for-non-http-applications">But TLS is not ubiquitous for non-HTTP applications</h3><p>The arguments above are most compelling when applied to the web-based HTTP-oriented ecosystem which has driven most of the TLS improvements we’ve seen to date. Non-HTTP protocols are lagging in adoption of many of the improvements and best practices TLS has on the web. Some claim this need to provide a solution for non-HTTP, non-web applications provides a motivation to continue pushing DNSSEC deployment.</p><p>I disagree, I think it provides a motivation to instead double-down on moving those applications to TLS. TLS as the new TCP.</p><p>The problem is that costs of deploying and operating DNSSEC are largely fixed regardless of how many protocols you are intending to protect with it, and worse, the negative side-effects of DNSSEC deployment can and will easily spill over to affect zones and protocols that don’t want or need DNSSEC’s protection. To justify continued DNSSEC deployment and operation in this context means using a smaller set of benefits (just for the non-HTTP applications) to justify the already high costs of deploying DNSSEC itself, plus the cost of the risk that DNSSEC poses to the reliability to your websites. I don’t see how that equation can ever balance, particularly when you evaluate it against the much lower costs of just turning on TLS for the rest of your non-HTTP protocols instead of deploying DNSSEC. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461.html">MTA-STS</a> is a worked example of how this can be achieved.</p><p>If you’re still not convinced, consider that even DNS itself is considering moving to TLS (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DoT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DoH</a>) in order to add the confidentiality/privacy attributes the protocol currently lacks. I’m not a huge fan of the latency implications of these approaches, but the ongoing discussion shows that clever solutions and mitigations for that may exist.</p><p>DoT/DoH solve distinct problems from DNSSEC and in principle should be used in combination with it, but in a world where DNS itself is relying on TLS and therefore has eliminated the majority of spoofing and cache poisoning attacks through DoT/DoH deployment the benefit side of the DNSSEC equation gets smaller and smaller still while the costs remain the same.</p><h3 id="ok-but-better-software-or-more-careful-operations-can-reduce-dnssecs-cost">OK, but better software or more careful operations can reduce DNSSEC’s cost</h3><p>Some see the current DNSSEC costs simply as teething problems that will reduce as the software and tooling matures to provide more automation of the risky processes and operational teams learn from their mistakes or opt to simply transfer the risk by outsourcing the management and complexity to larger providers to take care of.</p><p>I don’t find these arguments compelling. We’ve already had 15+ years to develop improved software for DNSSEC without success. What’s changed that we should expect a better outcome this year or next? Nothing.</p><p>Even if we did have better software or outsourced operations, the approach is still only hiding the costs behind automation or transferring the risk to another organisation. That may appear to work in the short-term, but eventually when the time comes to upgrade the software, migrate between providers or change registrars the debt will come due and incidents will occur.</p><p>The problem is the complexity of the protocol itself. No amount of software improvement or outsourcing addresses that.</p><p>After 15+ years of trying, I think it’s worth considering that combining cryptography, caching and distributed consensus, some of the most fundamental and complex computer science problems, into a slow-moving and hard to evolve low-level infrastructure protocol while appropriately balancing security, performance and reliability appears to be beyond our collective ability.</p><p>That doesn’t have to be the end of the world, the improvements achieved in the TLS ecosystem over the same time frame provide a positive counter example - perhaps DNSSEC is simply focusing our attention at the wrong layer of the stack.</p><p>Ideally secure DNS data would be something we could have, but if the complexity of DNSSEC is the price we have to pay to achieve it, I’m out. I would rather opt to remain with the simpler yet insecure DNS protocol and compensate for its short comings at higher transport or application layers where experience shows we are able to more rapidly improve and develop our security capabilities.</p><h3 id="summing-up">Summing up</h3><p>For the vast majority of domains and use-cases there is simply no net benefit to deploying DNSSEC in 2023. I’d even go so far as to say that if you’ve already signed your zones, you should (carefully) move them back to being unsigned - you’ll reduce the complexity of your operating environment and lower your risk of availability loss triggered by DNS. Your users will thank you.</p><p>The threats that DNSSEC defends against are already amply defended by the now mature and still improving TLS ecosystem at the application layer, and investing in further improvements here carries far more return than deployment of DNSSEC.</p><p>For TLDs, like .nz whose outage triggered this post, DNSSEC is not going anywhere and investment in mitigating its complexities and risks is an unfortunate burden that must be shouldered. While the full incident report of what went wrong with .nz is not yet available, the interim report already hints at some useful insights. It is important that InternetNZ publishes a full and comprehensive review so that the full set of learnings and improvements this incident can provide can be fully realised by .nz and other TLD operators stuck with the unenviable task of trying to safely operate DNSSEC.</p><h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2><p>After taking a few days to draft and edit this post, I’ve just stumbled across a <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/presentations/51-2023-05-23-dnssec.pdf">presentation</a> from the well respected Geoff Huston at last weeks RIPE86 meeting. I’ve only had time to skim the <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/presentations/51-2023-05-23-dnssec.pdf">slides</a> (<a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/archives/video/1018/">video here</a>) - they don’t seem to disagree with my thinking regarding the futility of the current state of DNSSEC, but also contain some interesting ideas for what it might take for DNSSEC to become a compelling proposition.</p><p>Probably worth a read/watch!</p></div></div>
