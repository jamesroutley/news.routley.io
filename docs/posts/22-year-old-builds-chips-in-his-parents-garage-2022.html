    <h1>22-year-old builds chips in his parents&#39; garage (2022)</h1>

As in a real chip fab, he wanted to transfer his microscopically detailed designs onto his devices using a process called photolithography. It involves coating a chip-to-be in light-sensitive material and using a device like a super-precise projector to burn in a template that will guide subsequent processing steps. Photolithography machines are expensive—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/asml-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography-chips-moores-law/">up to $150 million</a>—and so Zeloof made his own by bolting a modified conference room projector bought on Amazon onto a microscope. It projects his designs at tiny scale onto silicon wafers that Zeloof coats in material sensitive to ultraviolet light.</p><p>In 2018, Zeloof designed his first chip, a simple amplifier with six transistors, during gym class after a substitute teacher directed students to do class work. After about 12 hours of work and 66 steps in his garage, he had the Z1. It featured three of the dancing bears that are a symbol of the Grateful Dead and now appear on all of Zeloof’s chips, in a nod of thanks to Rothman, a fan of the band.</p><p>The Z1 used transistors that Zeloof calls “straight out of the 1970s,” with features as small as 175 microns, roughly a hairsbreadth. He put the chips to work in a circuit board that flashes a single LED and a <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1280249239495479297" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1280249239495479297&#34;}" href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1280249239495479297" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">guitar distortion pedal</a>.</p><p>Late in 2018, Zeloof started at Carnegie Mellon University, hacking on pieces of garage fab equipment in his dorm room while studying electrical engineering. Although he says he followed safety protocols, the university took exception to the x-ray machine in his dorm room. During trips home, he upgraded his setup in preparation for his second chip, the Z2. It uses a faster-switching transistor design based on wafers of a form of crystalline silicon known as polysilicon that became dominant in the 1970s.</p><p>Zeloof spun hand-cut, half-inch squares of polysilicon, each to become a separate chip, on a small homemade turntable at 4,000 revolutions per minute to coat them with the photosensitive material needed to transfer his design onto the surface. Then his homemade photolithography machine beamed on his design: a grid of 12 circuits, each with 100 transistors (and a dancing bear), 1,200 transistors in all.</p><div data-testid="feature-large-callout"><div data-testid="GroupCalloutWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Zeloof’s first chip, the Z1, was made in 2018 when he was still in high school and has six transistors.</p>

Three more rounds under the photolithography machine—separated by steps including time in a vacuum chamber filled with glowing purple plasma to etch away polysilicon—finished off each chip. Today’s commercial fabs produce chips in a broadly similar way, using a sequence of steps to gradually add and remove material in different parts of a design. Those chips are much more complex, with billions of much smaller transistors arrayed tightly together, and the steps are performed by machines not by hand. The transistors on Zeloof’s second-generation chips were about 10 times faster than those on his first and had features as small as 10 microns, not much bigger than a red blood cell.</p><p>In August, Zeloof tested the Z2 by hooking it up to a boxy beige semiconductor analyzer released by Hewlett Packard about two decades before he was born. A series of smoothly ramping current-voltage curves on its glowing green screen signaled success. “That curve was amazing to look at,” Zeloof says, “the first sign of life after you spend all day dunking this little shard of crystals into beakers of chemicals.”</p></div></div></div></div>
