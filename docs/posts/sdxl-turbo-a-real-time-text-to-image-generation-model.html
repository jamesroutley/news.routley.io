    <h1>SDXL Turbo: A Real-Time Text-to-Image Generation Model</h1>

  <p>Today, we are releasing SDXL Turbo, a new text-to-image mode. SDXL Turbo is based on a novel distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), which enables the model to synthesize image outputs in a single step and generate real-time text-to-image outputs while maintaining high sampling fidelity. For researchers and enthusiasts interested in technical details, our research paper is available <a href="https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation"><span>here</span></a>. It&#39;s important to note that SDXL Turbo is not yet intended for commercial use.</p><p><strong>Advantages of Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</strong></p><p>Featuring new advancements in diffusion model technologies, SDXL Turbo iterates on the foundation of SDXL 1.0 and implements a new distillation technique for text-to-image models: Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. By incorporating ADD, SDXL Turbo gains many advantages shared with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), such as single-step image outputs, while avoiding artifacts or blurriness often observed in other distillation methods. The SDXL Turbo research paper detailing this model’s new distillation technique is available <a href="https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Performance Benefits Compared to Other Diffusion Models</strong></p><p>To make the selection for SDXL Turbo, we compared multiple different model variants (StyleGAN-T++, OpenMUSE, IF-XL, SDXL, and LCM-XL) by generating outputs with the same prompt. Human evaluators were then shown two outputs at random and tasked to pick the output that most closely followed the direction of the prompt. Next, an additional test was completed with the same method for image quality. In these blind tests, SDXL Turbo was able to beat a 4-step configuration of LCM-XL with a single step, as well as beating a 50-step configuration of SDXL with only 4 steps. With these results, we can see SDXL Turbo outperforming a state-of-the-art multi-step model with substantially lower computational requirements without sacrificing image quality.  </p>

  <p>Additionally, SDXL Turbo provides major improvements to inference speed. On an A100, SDXL Turbo generates a 512x512 image in 207ms (prompt encoding + a single denoising step + decoding, fp16), where 67ms are accounted for by a single UNet forward evaluation.</p><p><strong>Explore SDXL Turbo with Clipdrop</strong></p><p>To test the capabilities of this new model, visit Stability AI&#39;s image editing platform, <a href="http://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion-turbo" target="_blank"><span>Clipdrop,</span></a> for a beta demonstration of SDXL Turbo&#39;s real-time image generation.
