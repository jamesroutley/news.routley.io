    <h1>Do Something, Brag About It</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I haven’t blogged in quite a while. Not because I haven’t done anything in the past 9 months, but because I have too much to do!</p>
<p>This past year has been challenging in ways I’ve never expected. I’m still trying to figure out some kind of balance as a interdisciplinary person whose job title at any given time unfortunately puts me in <em>one</em> box. My breadth of experience has resulted in some really great short-term opportunities in the past year, but I’m still trying to figure out where that fits as a <em>career</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of professional “hobby” development, 2023 was the year of maps for me. I started out the year wanting to add mapping to <a href="https://bridge.watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bridge.Watch</a>, but given its status as a hobby project, I never wanted to commit any amount of money to a tiling service. Thanks to a fellow Recurser, Brandon Liu, I was tipped onto <a href="https://maplibre.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Maplibre</a> and <a href="https://protomaps.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Protomaps</a> and attended a bunch of Recurse meetups <em>for</em> mapping (appropriately called Maptime) to explore the world of open source mapping. I started with some smaller data sets, first looking at the <a href="https://mclare.dev/soft-stories/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">soft-story retrofit program</a>. After several building failures in NYC, I <a href="https://mclare.dev/nyc-building-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mapped</a> all of the active DOB complaints as well.</p>
<p>This self-imposed mapping learning path culminated in <a href="https://foss4gna.org/schedule.html#speakers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">giving a talk</a> at the FOSS4G North America conference at the end of October, which was a nice way to meet a different segment of open source users and contributors. I also got to visit NYC for the first time since I left in 2019, and I met up with nearly 30 friends and family over the course of 10 days.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the highs of those two weeks came crashing down in November. I won’t say it was the <em>most</em> stressful time of my life, but it’s a close second. I’m still trying to recover both physically and mentally, so hoping to move towards better habits and a better mindset in the new year. To that end, I’m hoping to blog more about my “extracurriculars” and live a lot more by <a href="https://shapr.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shapr’s</a> words, “Do something, brag about it.”</p>
