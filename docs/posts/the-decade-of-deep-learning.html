<p><span>As the 2010’s draw to a close</span>, it’s worth taking a look back at the monumental progress that has been made in Deep Learning in this decade. Driven by the development of ever-more powerful compute and the increased availability of big data, Deep Learning has successfully tackled many previously intractable problems, especially in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Deep Learning has also begun to see real-world application everywhere around us, from the high-impact to the frivolous, from autonomous vehicles and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841517301135" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical imaging</a> to virtual assistants and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deepfakes</a>.</p>
<p>This post is an overview of some the most influential Deep Learning papers of the last decade. My hope is to provide a jumping-off point into many disparate areas of Deep Learning by providing succinct and dense summaries that go slightly deeper than a surface level exposition, with many references to the relevant resources.</p>
<p>Given the nature of research, assigning credit is very difficult—the same ideas are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursued by many simultaneously</a>, and the most influential paper is often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither the first nor the best</a>. I try my best to tiptoe the line between influence and first/best works by listing the most influential papers as main entries and the other relevant papers that precede or improve upon the main entry as honorable mentions. Of course, as such a list will always be subjective, this is not meant to be final, exhaustive, or authoritative. If you feel that the ordering, omission, or description of any paper is incorrect, please let me know—I would be more than glad to improve this list by making it more complete and accurate.</p>

<p>This paper explored some problems with deep networks, especially surrounding random initialization of weights. This paper also noticed issues with sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activations, and proposed an alternative, SoftSign, which is a sigmoidal activation function with smoother asymptopes. The most lasting contribution of this paper, however, is in initialization. When initialized with normally-distributed weights, it is easy for values in the network to explode or vanish, preventing training. Assuming the values from the previous layer are i.i.d Gaussians, adding them adds their variances, and thus the variance should be scaled down proportionally to the number of inputs to keep the output zero mean and unit variance. The same logic holds in reverse (i.e with the number of outputs) for the gradients. The Xavier initialization introduced in this paper is a compromise between the two, initializing weights from a Gaussian with variance <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span><span>n</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>i</span><span>n</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span><span>+</span><span><span>n</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>o</span><span>u</span><span>t</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>2</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n_{in}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>n</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>i</span><span>n</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n_{out}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>n</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>o</span><span>u</span><span>t</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span> are the numbers of neurons in the previous and next layers, respectively.

<p>Most neural networks, from the earliest MLPs up until many networks toward the middle of the decade, used sigmoids for intermediate activations. Sigmoids (most commonly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logistic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic tangent</a> functions) have the advantages of being differentiable everywhere and having a bounded output. They also provide a satisfying analogy to biological neurons’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-none_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-or-none law</a>. However, as the derivative of sigmoid functions decays quickly away from zero, the gradient is often diminished rapidly as more layers are added. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem and is one of the reasons that networks were difficult to scale depthwise. This paper found that using ReLUs helped solve the vanishing gradient problem and paved the way for deeper networks.</p>
<p><img src="https://reserialised.routley.io/images/sigmoid_derivative_small.png" alt="Sigmoid and its derivative (&lt;a href=&#39;https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-sigmoid-function-536880cf918e&#39;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)"/></p>
<p>Despite this, however, ReLUs still have some flaws: they are non-differentiable at zero, they can grow unbounded, and neurons could “die” and become inactive due to the saturated half of the activation. Since 2011, many improved activations have been proposed to solve the problem, but vanilla ReLUs are still competitive, as the efficacy of many new activations has been under question.</p>

<p>AlexNet is an 8 layer Convolutional Neural Network using the ReLU activation function and 60 million parameters. The crucial contribution of AlexNet was demonstrating the power of deeper networks, as its architecture was, in essence, a deeper version of previous networks (i.e LeNet).</p>
<p>The AlexNet paper is generally recognized as the paper that sparked the field of Deep Learning. AlexNet was also one of the first networks to leverage the massively parallel processing power of GPUs to train much deeper convolutional networks than before. The result was astounding, lowering the error rate on ImageNet from 26.2% to 15.3%, and beating every other contender in <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILSVRC 2012</a> by a <em>wide margin</em>. This massive improvement in error attracted a lot of attention to the field of Deep Learning, and made the AlexNet paper the most cited papers in Deep Learning.</p>

<p>The results of DeepMind’s Atari DQN kickstarted the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning was previously used mostly on low-dimensional environments such as gridworlds, and was difficult to apply to more complex environments.

<p>The paper uses Deep Q-Learning in particular, a form of value-based Reinforcement Learning. Value-based means that the goal is to learn how much reward the agent can expect to obtain at each state (or, in the case of Q-learning, each state-action pair) by following the policy implicitly defined by the Q-value function.

Unlike the Jensen-Shannon distance used by vanilla GANs, which saturates and provides an unusable gradient when there is little overlap between the distributions, WGANs use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth Mover’s distance</a>. The original WGAN paper enforced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lipschitz continuity constraint</a> (gradient less than a constant everywhere) via weight clipping, which introduced some problems which using a gradient penalty helped solve.

<p>This paper introduced the idea of attention—instead of compressing information down into a latent space in an RNN, one could instead keep the entire context in memory, then allowing every element of the output to attend to every element of the input, using <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">O</mi></mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mi>m</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(nm)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>O</span></span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>m</span><span>)</span></span></span></span> operations.

Initially designed to deal with the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs, the residual block has become the elementary building block for almost all CNNs today. The idea is very simple—add the input from before each block of convolutional layers to the output. The inspiration behind residual networks is that neural networks should theoretically never degrade with more layers, as additional layers could, in the worst case, be set simply as identity mappings. However, in practice, deeper networks often experience difficulties training. Residual networks made it easier for layers to learn an identity mapping, and also reduced the issue of gradient vanishing. Despite the simplicity, however, residual networks vastly outperform regular CNNs, especially for deeper networks.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Kasparov by Deep Blue, Go became the next goal for the AI community, thanks to its properties: a much larger state space than chess and a greater reliance on intuition among human players. Up until AlphaGo, the most successful Go systems such as <a href="https://www.remi-coulom.fr/CrazyStone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crazy Stone</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zen</a> were a combination of a Monte-Carlo tree search with many handcrafted heuristics to guide the tree search. Judging from the progress of these systems, defeating human grandmasters was considered at the time to be many years away. Although previous attempts at <a href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ilya/pubs/2008/go_paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applying</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neural</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/clark15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">networks</a> to Go do exist, none have reached the level of success of AlphaGo, which combines many of these previous techniques with big compute. Specifically, AlphaGo consists of a policy network and a value network that narrow the search tree and allow for truncation of the search tree, respectively. These networks were first trained with standard Supervised Learning and then further tuned with Reinforcement Learning.</p>
<p>AlphaGo has made, of all the advancements listed here, possibly the biggest impact on the public mind, with an estimated 100 million people globally (especially from China, Japan, and Korea, where Go is very popular) tuning in to the AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol match. The games from this match and the other later AlphaGo Zero matches have influenced human strategy in Go. One example of a very influential move by AlphaGo is the 37th move in the second game; AlphaGo played very unconventionally, baffling many analysts. This move later turned out to be crucial in securing the win for AlphaGo later.</p>

The Transformer architecture, making use of the aforementioned attention mechanism at scale, has become the backbone of nearly all state-of-the-art NLP models today. Transformer models beat RNNs in large part due to the computational benefits in very large networks; in RNNs, gradients need to be propagated through the entire “unrolled” graph, which makes memory access a large bottleneck. This also exacerbates the exploding/vanishing gradients problem, necessitating more complex (and more computationally expensive!) LSTM and GRU models. Instead, Transformer models are optimized for highly parallel processing. The most computationally expensive components are the feed forward networks after the attention layers, which can be applied in parallel, and the attention itself, which is a large matrix multiplication and is also easily optimized.</p>

<p>BERT is a bidirectional contextual text embedding model. Like word2vec, it is based on assigning each word (or, rather, sub-word token) a vector. However, these vectors in BERT are contextual, allowing homographs to be properly distinguished. Furthermore, BERT is deeply bidirectional, with each latent vector in each layer depending on all latent vectors from the previous layer, unlike earlier works like GPT (which is forward-only) and ELMo (which has separate forward and backward LMs that are only combined at the end). In unidirectional LMs like GPT, the model is trained to predict the next token at each time step, which works because the states at each time step can only depend on previous states. (With ELMo, both the forward and backward models are trained independently in this way and optimized jointly.) However, in a deeply bidirectional network, a state <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>L</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S^L_t</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>S</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span>L</span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span> for step <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span>t</span></span></span></span> and layer <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span>L</span></span></span></span> must depend on all states <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><msup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">′</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S^{L-1}_{t&#39;}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>S</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span><span>t</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>′</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>L</span><span>−</span><span>1</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span>, each of which could, in turn, depend on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S^{L-2}_{t}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span></span><span></span><span><span><span>S</span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span><span><span><span>L</span><span>−</span><span>2</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span>, allowing the network to “cheat” on the language modeling.

<p><img src="https://reserialised.routley.io/images/deepdoubledescent.png" alt="Deep Double Descent (&lt;a href=&#39;https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/&#39;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)"/></p>
<p>The phenomenon of (Deep) Double Descent explored in this paper runs contrary to popular wisdom in both classical machine learning and modern Deep Learning. In classical machine learning, model complexity follows the bias-variance tradeoff. Too weak a model is unable to fully capture the structure of the data, while too powerful a model can overfit and capture spurious patterns that don’t generalize. Because of this, in classical machine learning it is expected that test error will decrease as models get larger, but then start to increase again once the models begin to overfit. In practice, however, in Deep Learning, models are very often massively overparameterized and yet still seem to improve on test performance with larger models. This conflict is the motivation behind (deep) double descent. Deep Double Descent expanded on the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Double Descent paper by Belkin et al.</a> by showing empirically the effects of Double Descent on a much wider variety of Deep Learning models, and its applicability to not only the model size but also training time and dataset size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By considering larger function classes, which contain more candidate predictors compatible with the data, we are able to find interpolating functions that have smaller norm and are thus “simpler”. Thus increasing function class capacity improves performance of classifiers. <cite>Belkin et al. 2018</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the capacity of the models approaches the “interpolation threshold,” the demarcation between the classical ML and Deep Learning regimes, it becomes possible for gradient descent to find models that achieve near-zero error, which are likely to be overfit. However, as the model capacity is increased even further, the number of different models that can achieve zero training error increases, and the likelihood that some of them fit the data smoothly (i.e without overfitting) increases. Double Descent posits that gradient descent is more likely to find these smoother zero-training-error networks, which generalize well despite being overparameterized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that—when trained in isolation—it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another paper about the training characteristics of deep neural networks was the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis paper. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis asserts that most of a network’s performance comes from a certain subnetwork due to a lucky initialization (hence the name, “lottery ticket,” to refer to   these subnetworks), and that larger networks are more performant because of a higher chance of lottery tickets occurring. This not only allows us to prune the irrelevant weights (which is already well established in the literature), but also to retrain from scratch using only the “lottery ticket” weights, which, surprisingly, obtains close to the original loss.</p>

<p>The past decade has marked an incredibly fast-paced and innovative period in the history of AI, driven by the start of the Deep Learning Revolution—the Renaissance of gradient-based networks. Spurred in large part by the ever increasing computing power available, neural networks have gotten much larger and thus more powerful, displacing traditional AI techniques across the board, from Computer Vision to Natural Language Processing. Neural networks do have their weaknesses though: they require a large amount of data to train, have inexplicable failure modes, and cannot generalize beyond individual tasks. As the limits of Deep Learning with respect to advancing AI have begun to become apparent thanks to the massive improvements in the field, attention has shifted towards a deeper understanding of Deep Learning. The next decade is likely to be marked by an increased understanding of many of the empirical characteristics of neural networks observed today. Personally, I am optimistic about the prospects of AI; Deep Learning is an invaluable tool in the toolkit of AI, that brings us yet another step closer to understanding intelligence.</p>
