    <h1>Ask HN: Why does every package&#43;module system become a Rube Goldberg machine?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A programming language has a &#34;core language&#34; plus a package/module system.
In each successful language, the core language is neat-and-tidy,
but the package/module system is a Rube Goldberg machine.
See JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or C/C++.</p><p>Lots of brain cycles are spent on &#34;programming language theory&#34;.
We&#39;ve roughly figured out the primitives required to express real-world computation.</p><p>In contrast, we apparently have no &#34;package management theory&#34;.
We have not figured out the primitives required to express dependencies.
As a result, we keep building new variants and features,
until we end up with &lt;script&gt;, require(), import, npm, yarn, pnpm, (py)?(v|virtual|pip)?env, (ana)?conda, easy_install, eggs and wheels ...</p><p>Is it just a &#34;law of software&#34; that this must happen to any successful language?
Or are there examples of where this it has not happened, and what can we learn from them?
Is there a &#34;theory of package management&#34;, or a &#34;lambda calculus of package management&#34; out there?</p></div></div></div>
