    <h1>OpenAI came after our domain because we use GPT in it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tldr; OpenAI registered the brand GPT and wants us to take down our gptsomething.io domain. The domain was a blank page.</p><p>OpenAl brand guideline outreach</p><p>Dear Team,
We are contacting you on behalf of our client OpenAl, Inc. (&#34;OpenAI&#34;). Our job is to work with developers to ensure that they are marketing their products in accordance with OpenAl&#39;s brand guidelines https://openal.com/brandand in a way that doesn&#39;t create confusion for the consumer.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re writing regarding your use of the mark &#34;GPT&#34; in connection with your GPT&#39; product.</p><p>https://branddb.wipo.int/en/quicksearch/brand/CH502023000001493?

ation=CH&amp;I=Q</p><p>Stating &#34;GPT&#34; is inaccurate and may imply a partnership or endorsement where there isn&#39;t one. If your project uses GPT-3, GPT-4, or ChatGPT you may choose to say in the Product description (not in the Product/Site name) that it is &#34;Powered by GPT-3&#34; or &#34;Powered by GPT-4&#34; or &#34;Powered by ChatGPT&#34; and/or &#34;Powered by DALLE&#34; as applicable. We do not permit model names in products/site titles because there is concern that it can confuse end users, and it also triggers our enforcement mechanisms. It&#39;s important to identify the GPT-3, GPT-4, or ChatGPT (or DALL-E) model specifically, as opposed to just referencing GPT.</p><p>Please reply to this message by 05.10.2023 to let us know that you received it and intend to make the applicable changes. If you have any questions, please contact us directly at openal@brandshield.com.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>BrandShield Ltd.</p></div></div></div>
