<p>One of the country&#39;s two spy agencies has revealed it retrieves information directly from where it is stored or processed on computers.</p>
<p>The &#34;computer network exploitation&#34; operations have been a highly-classified secret at the GCSB until now.</p>
<p>US commentators refer to computer network exploitation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-network-exploitation">as a form of cyber warfare</a>, or the &#34;theft of data&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Our legislation ... allows us to access information infrastructures, which is more than just interception,&#34; the Director-General of the Government Communications Security Bureau, Andrew Hampton, said.</p>
<p>It &#34;also allows us to retrieve digital information directly from where it is stored or processed&#34;.</p>
<p>The GCSB refers to this as &#34;accessing information infrastructures&#34;.</p>
<p>The spy watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Brendan Horsley, cited Hampton&#39;s speech to the Institute of International Affairs in May, for making the revelation.</p>
<p>This had freed Horsley up to be able to assure the public that the exploitation operations were scrutinised, he said <a href="https://igis.govt.nz/assets/Annual-Reports/Annual-Report-2021-2022.pdf">in his annual report</a> released on Friday.</p>
<p>Previously, he had had to refer to &#34;certain operations&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Although it was subject to oversight, it was not possible to provide any clear public assurance of this.&#34;</p>
<p>In fact, he had conducted a review that found the compliance systems around CNE &#34;to be generally effective and appropriate&#34;.</p>
<p>However, he was still not allowed to go into details &#34;on the bureau&#39;s use of this important capability&#34;.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Inspector-General reported how the SIS was doing a lot more &#34;target discovery&#34;, resulting in it having to manage significantly more data, at a time its checks and controls over data - while improving - were &#34;not there yet&#34;.</p>
<p>Horsley is conducting a review this year of target discovery by the SIS, and will soon include the GCSB, too.</p>
<p>Both agencies boosted this work after the 2019 mosque attacks.</p>
<p>&#34;The potential hazard of target discovery activity, from a civil liberties and privacy point of view, is intrusion into the lives of people who have done nothing to merit the attention of a national security agency,&#34; the Inspector-General said.</p>
<p>He concluded Section 19 of the security laws did not pose a significant problem - that S19 simply required each agency to be able to justify monitoring or collection &#34;besides the fact of certain ideas being expressed on a platform&#34;.</p>
<p>As for holding on to all the extra data, the GCSB had adopted a new policy late last year under which &#34;it may not retain information merely because it may be useful for its functions in the future&#34;.</p>
<p>However, the report said the SIS was struggling on the policy front. Fully 93 percent of its policies were overdue for review, and in some cases, including data analytics, were &#34;non-existent&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Draft procedures were being relied on to guide decisions,&#34; Horsley said.</p>
<p>While the SIS had a plan to address the backlog, and even though it had reduced the number of its policies by a fifth, &#34;in the meantime there is no assurance these policies are fit for purpose&#34;.</p>
<p>It was also way behind on reviewing its data-sharing agreement with the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>The SIS and bureau both scored better for internal controls and how they handled any breaches.</p>
<p>The agencies had improved their joint policy on sharing information with foreign partners where there was a risk it would contribute to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>The new policy was &#34;a marked improvement&#34; on 2017 policy, though Horsley retained reservations about some of the terms, criteria and &#34;the handling of reports likely obtained by torture&#34;, and he wanted more of the policy made public.</p>
<p>The report showed he reviewed 63 spying warrants, 49 of them the most serious kind, a Type 1, which lets an agency carry out an otherwise unlawful activity in order to collection information about a New Zealander.</p>
