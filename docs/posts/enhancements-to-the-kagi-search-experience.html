<h3><a name="web"></a> Web</h3>

<p>Web search results are the core of any search engine. At Kagi, we are primarily interested in providing the best search results available to anyone who trusts us with their hard-earned money in the world of free search engine alternatives (see also “<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/why-pay-for-search.html">Why pay for search?</a>”).</p>

<p>Summary of web search improvements:</p>

<h3><a name="images"></a> Images</h3>

<p>We have vastly improved the quality, variety of sources, and the number of image search results. Kagi Image search is now featuring, on average, 2x-3x more results than before.</p>

<h3><a name="videos"></a> Videos</h3>

<p>Our video search results now feature higher quality results from mainstream video websites like YouTube but also surfaces more results from other platforms (like Twitter) and individual websites.</p>

<p>We are showing around 100 most relevant videos (when available) for your video searches. This is Video search taken to the next level.</p>

<h3><a name="news"></a> News</h3>

<p>We have increased the number and variety of sources in the News results, focusing more on local and “interesting finds.”</p>

<p>Note that you can set your preferences for your favorite source using standard Kagi personalization tools like “pin” (to surface the source to the top) or “block” (to block the source from showing). Make your news feed the one you will always enjoy.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning - we have many ideas for improving the feature’s quality and robustness.</p>

<h3><a name="podcasts"></a> New integration - Podcast search</h3>

<p>Podcasts as a media format are on the rise, and we are happy to introduce podcast search as an entirely separate searchable category in Kagi.</p>
