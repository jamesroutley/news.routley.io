<p>earlier this week i shared <a href="https://far.computer/how-to/">the how-to</a> for this website, which is running on an old smartphone</p>
<p>folks on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fid6eb/host_website_from_old_phone_using">lobste.rs</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46016902">hacker news</a> pointed out the fire risk of keeping a lithium battery plugged in all the time</p>
<p>french blogger korben even mentioned it in an <a href="https://korben.info/far-computer-vieux-telephone-serveur-web-postmarketos.html">article</a> about the device</p>

<p>forty seconds later the farphone had booted and the web server was back up</p>
<p>thank you lobsters, thank you hackers, you might have prevented a tragic server explosion</p>
