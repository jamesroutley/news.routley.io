    <h1>A rash of nearly lethal mushroom poisonings in Ohio</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="YXLLXRC6YBG4FDLTLPGIB4R3A4">CLEVELAND, Ohio — <b> </b>When Bill Hickman found some mushrooms growing in his backyard the last week of September, he’d heard enough about accidental poisonings to know not all of them are safe to eat.</p><p id="PWQPTDFPRRFODBRTXJFCES7IOA">The 54-year-old beekeeper and amateur naturalist from Windham, in rural Portage County, had grown and picked mushrooms in the past, and regularly enjoyed identifying plants. So he did what he thought was the responsible thing: he used the plant identification app on his phone to determine the species of mushroom.</p><p id="DMWEOND4MJALLEPRJBOU2ZZOCQ">When the app matched his photos of the backyard mushrooms with an edible species, Hickman collected them, took<b> </b>them home, and sautéed them with onions, garlic and butter. Then he ate them on top of the mushroom tortellini his wife had made for dinner.</p><p id="72GONETLHVDLPCHHP2HM4ROXC4">The meal was delicious, he recalls but, as he later discovered, it almost killed him.</p><p id="YXLLXRC6YBG4FDLTLPGIB4R3A4">Hickman is not alone. It’s mushroom season in Ohio, tempting more than a few enthusiasts to forage for their dinner in the woods, or even in their own backyard. But unbeknownst to many, Ohio is home to some of the world’s deadliest mushrooms -- and they can look a whole lot like their edible cousins.</p><p id="SBWJXXYJBJDBHJEBNFZCOVMAWE">A recent rash of nearly lethal poisonings have experts worried that mobile naturalist apps may be lulling otherwise cautious citizens into a false sense of security, and they’re warning Ohioans against eating any mushrooms found growing in the wild. But for those that take the risk, they also want the public to know the warning signs of toxic mushroom poisoning and the promising, but time-sensitive therapy that could save a life.</p><p id="OOKK5V57KVC3VKYQEMBAVPPRZM">“I think if I wouldn’t have had my phone, I wouldn’t have picked them. I know I wouldn’t have. There’s no question in my mind,” Hickman said. His wife Tammy, who was less enthusiastic about his discovery, declined to eat them.</p><p id="IZJGZFXGMNAPXDOWLSCSDWJV3Y">“I just thought he’s going to get a belly ache if they’re not good for him, and that will be the end of it. So, when he ate them and didn’t get sick right away, I was relieved,” she said. “I honestly didn’t know that there were any mushrooms in Ohio that could kill you.”</p><p id="EIOZF4TJARAVXALUVAO334O26A">Most people begin to feel ill within just a few hours of eating a poisonous plant – but what the couple didn’t know was that some of the deadliest species of mushrooms don’t cause any signs of illness for eight to 12 hours.</p><p id="JU475HGYSJFMLAZTEEI3OUFLDI">Right on cue, sometime in the middle of that night roughly eight hours later, Hickman became violently ill with crippling stomach pain, and continuous vomiting and diarrhea. As he would later discover, that time lapse would be the first indicator to doctors that the mushrooms he had eaten were not an edible variety but instead one of the particularly deadly varieties of mushrooms commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroying_angel" target="_blank">Destroying Angel</a><i> </i>or<i> </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides" target="_blank">Deathcap </a>mushrooms.</p><figure><div><p><img srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/Pe-bTOSGwsPk3cmIoDu-OPRpxBs=/500x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/OUS2TJQUEFFWTAFZTXEQ2X7MLI.jpeg 500w, https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/Bh5_bb093MMLoeGxn9OgpnpIvWw=/800x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/OUS2TJQUEFFWTAFZTXEQ2X7MLI.jpeg 800w, https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/Rrd_s3cW8SfbDCzH2ZzV5uEfbvs=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/OUS2TJQUEFFWTAFZTXEQ2X7MLI.jpeg 1280w" sizes="50vw" src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/Rrd_s3cW8SfbDCzH2ZzV5uEfbvs=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/OUS2TJQUEFFWTAFZTXEQ2X7MLI.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Amanita mushroom" height="600" width="300"/></p><figcaption><p>A photo of one of the deadly Amanita mushrooms Bill Hickman found in his yard at the end of September.

And a 2021 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/newsletter/poisonous_mushrooms.html" target="_blank">CDC newsletter</a> stated that nationally there are 1,400 emergency visits a year due to ingestion of poisonous mushrooms.</p><p id="IEDIFWTACVASZO7ADAMQ6NLFMA">Within 48 hours of that ill-fated dinner, Hickman found himself at University Hospitals main campus in Cleveland, unsure if he would live.</p><p id="R6YWO5CNOBCBVGLOD73QZ6YROU">Approximately 40% of people who ingest the deadly <i>Amanita </i>mushrooms die or require a liver transplant, according to Dr. Pierre Gholam, the liver specialist at University Hospitals who treated Hickman.</p><p id="GVGPLU2VDVGVJD5HD3GQBV77E4">“I didn’t think I was going to make it,” Hickman said. “The whole experience was just unreal.”</p><p id="LNHVEX5LHZAZHLQNWNYOTACR2Q">However several things likely saved Hickman’s life.</p><p id="PWNTHW3NQRD4LKETG47LZBCEJM">First his wife, went out to the location where her husband said he had found the mushrooms, picked one and sent a picture to poison control. Second, on the advice of poison control, they went almost immediately to their local emergency room. And third, emergency room personnel<b> </b>knew there was an antidote, where to get it, and acted fast.</p><p id="IEDIFWTACVASZO7ADAMQ6NLFMA">The problem with <i>Amanita </i>species’ is they come in many shapes and colors that are easily mistaken for edible varieties, sometimes even fooling seasoned experts. The poison they contain is not destroyed by cooking and unlike many other foul tasting poisonous plants, the mushrooms taste very good, at least according to those who have lived to tell about it, explains Gholam.</p><p id="H5WNQKML7VCENPW7C7FF7IKTBU">They are also quite plentiful in Ohio, particularly in September and October after a late summer with high humidity and plenty of rain. A lot like this year.</p><p id="UVJGOMI7GFBWHKRU2RJHIJTSF4">“I could tell just by looking at my own yard that this was not going to be a good season,” said Gholam, who recommends that people never eat wild mushrooms – but especially not in the fall.</p><p id="43SOFVJWDBDL3GRSR4CG6EWUZY">“The bottom line is it’s a very, very dangerous proposition for anyone – especially between the dates of<b> </b>Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 in Northeast<b> </b>Ohio – that’s when these things tend to grow,” Gholam said. “It’s really playing Russian Roulette with your health.”</p><h2><b>The hard-to-get treatment</b></h2><p id="2R3AQMKPRBF25AQKTYJT6MW5YU">UH’S main campus over the last decade has developed a reputation as a regional referral center for poisoning from the exact species of mushroom Hickman had eaten – and the staff there – including Gholam – knew just what to do. They immediately began preparing an application to the FDA for the emergency use of an investigational antidote – that if administered within 72 hours of ingestion can prevent liver damage and death in almost every patient who receives it.</p><figure><div><p><img srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/qfncClxlpLrukkiFhINuh4UlSNg=/500x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/GL7E3N2S4NHRDD746734OHGCOU.jpeg 500w, https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/fRP9465x6GAdp6WCVtUcp97FG00=/800x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/GL7E3N2S4NHRDD746734OHGCOU.jpeg 800w, https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/5LtadYgLeiUSEkHc-y8ZsArmT_Q=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/GL7E3N2S4NHRDD746734OHGCOU.jpeg 1280w" sizes="50vw" src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/5LtadYgLeiUSEkHc-y8ZsArmT_Q=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/GL7E3N2S4NHRDD746734OHGCOU.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Silibinin" height="600" width="300"/></p><figcaption><p>Silibinin, the investigational drug used to prevent liver damage after amatoxin poisoning was administered to Bill Hickman at University Hospitals in Cleveland.<span>Tammy Hickman</span></p></figcaption></div></figure><p id="C3XFSUKBWJBGLMEH2YP5LYKAAQ">The drug, called Silibinin, is derived from the milk thistle plant and given intravenously. It has been available in Europe for over 30 years, but here in the United States it has yet to be approved by the FDA, so it is not stocked in hospitals or pharmacies.</p><p id="SBO464N2VVCJHGDRQRZPPA2WJE">The result is that in order to obtain it for patients, an emergency use application must be submitted to the FDA for every patient who needs it, after which it is flown in by courier directly from the FDA laboratory in Philadelphia.</p><p id="27J6EHRNGJGL7I2MT3EYTOSM54">“This literally takes an army of people working after hours,” said Gholam. “There are tireless, really unsung heroes at the UH research office who make this happen for every patient – they have to do this over and over and over.” Forty-seven times in the last 10 years to be exact.</p><p id="2ATPG3GH2BA35ITER3V4JXJ6MU">The biggest enemy in this process, says Gholam, is time. If the drug is administered after the 72-hour window closes, the chances of a full recovery drop dramatically.</p><p id="SQNIBMGMVZEXTDNADRX5EX33SM">The liver-killing toxins are initially removed and begin passing through the intestines. But what makes amatoxins so deadly, Gholam says, is that they are able to escape the intestines and are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, where they damage the liver again and again. Silibinin, he explains, is believed to work by blocking this never-ending loop if it can catch the cycle before it starts.</p><p id="WZCMMZCE3BDGTECFKVLBCB35AQ">Many patients, the doctor says, begin to feel better after the initial wave of vomiting, and they decide to tough it out. By the time they finally decide to go to the hospital, it is often too late.</p><p id="IORRNL2UEVHRTNOKD33E3VKRDM">Fortunately, for Hickman he received quick treatment. He went home after just 4 days after starting the drug, and is expected to make a complete recovery.</p><p id="MMORTPKYI5ARZNN4DYX7O2GN7U">“I’m glad we got him help,” said Tammy Hickman. “They don’t expect that there will be any long-term effects from this, except that maybe he’ll never eat a mushroom again,” she said laughing.</p><h2><b>Why the holdup for FDA approval?</b></h2><p id="JPDXQ5HGYZHNBC6JF7IJQ3U3SQ">Gholam says that the process of FDA approval for Silibinin is slow, primarily because it only works for amatoxin poisoning, from the <i>Amanita </i>mushroom species. Those poisonings are rare – so gathering enough data to satisfy the safety and efficacy requirements of the FDA takes time. And there is little financial incentive by the company that owns the drug to invest in its research and development.</p><p id="LATWSB7DURBVFPKDWLYZJM2KV4">On the other hand, most patients are young and otherwise healthy, and the treatment can mean the difference between life and death. UH, along with other medical centers, are providing data from patients they’ve treated with Silibinin to the FDA directly in an effort to get the drug approved.</p><p id="LOLLJWD25ZE3HFMCMDTBREZKN4">“The FDA and the physician community is very interested in doing the right thing for the American public, said Gholam. “Nobody wants to keep doing this in the middle of the night when the patients need the medicine right away, that’s not the ideal way to do it, but that’s how we do it right now.”</p><p id="TAS4OHNW7VF2NLD3WZGUCC3LJU">“The FDA really needs to look at it because even though it doesn’t affect that many people, if it can save one person,” Hickman paused choking back tears, “it’s worth it.”</p><p id="C7ILCCFPFVETTE6NAH4MRXW4JM">And as for using an app to decide if mushrooms are safe to eat? Don’t do it, he warns.</p><p id="MIDKWYIJ35AKDI6XZY4JTGJ32Y">“I love that app — other than the fact that it doesn’t always give you 100% accurate information, which can be very dangerous as I found out,” Hickman said. “People just need to be very, <i>very </i>careful. If you are using those apps you should use some other source to triple-check yourself.”</p></div></div><p>If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.</p></div>
