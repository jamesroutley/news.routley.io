<p>I was feeling particularly Emu this morning and asked</p>



<blockquote>
<p>create code to heal a breakup</p>
</blockquote>



<p id="4cb7">The answer was very interesting</p>



<blockquote>
<p id="bfb9">I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through a breakup, but it’s important to note that healing from a breakup is a complex and emotional process that cannot be solved with code. It’s a deeply personal experience, and there are no one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>



<p id="63ed">However, I can provide you with some general advice and tips that may help you cope with a breakup:</p>



<p id="bc50">1. Allow yourself to grieve: It’s okay to feel sad, angry, and hurt. Give yourself permission to feel these emotions and work through them.</p>



<p id="3235">2. Lean on your support system: Reach out to friends and family who care about you. Talking to someone you trust can be very therapeutic.</p>



<p id="4584">3. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. This includes getting enough sleep, eating healthily, exercising, and engaging in activities you enjoy.</p>



<p id="78a8">4. Reflect and learn: Use this time to reflect on the relationship and what you’ve learned from it. This can help you grow and make better choices in the future.</p>



<p id="6a43">5. Keep a journal: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process your emotions and gain clarity.</p>



<p id="bc7c">6. Avoid contact with your ex: It’s often best to limit or avoid contact with your ex for a while to create some emotional distance.</p>



<p id="f8e5">7. Set goals: Focus on your personal and professional goals to give your life a sense of purpose and direction.</p>



<p id="7162">8. Seek professional help: If you’re struggling to cope with the breakup, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support.</p>



<p id="a61a">Remember, healing from a breakup is a process that takes time, and it’s essential to be patient with yourself. There’s no quick fix, but over time, you will likely find that your emotional wounds will begin to heal, and you’ll be in a better place to move on and start anew.</p>

<p id="676c">Not really what I wanted — but nice.</p>



<p id="ab5f">I then asked</p>



<p id="cf91">&gt;create python code to heal a broken heart</p>



<p id="2380">I got something I felt was a bit cheezy with affirmations.</p>

<p id="241a">&gt;can you create a visual experiment using python to heal a broken heart</p>



<p id="c930">&gt;can you make this animated and interactive and use ayurvedic principles</p>



<p id="ddf8">&gt;this does not really work</p>



<p id="8f29">&gt;you dont have to use python but make it interactive and animated</p>



<p id="e56a">This last one generated this sort of cool javascript HTML app with a flame that did not entirely work.</p>

<p id="0a3f">It sort of gives me ideas tho.</p>



<p id="fe48">I think the most poetic compositions are with HTML and javascript and styles.</p>
