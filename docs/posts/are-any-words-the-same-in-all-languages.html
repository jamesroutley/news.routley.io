This week&#39;s question had me busy doing a lot of research, including consulting Dr. Emilie Zuniga, <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/language-tips-from-a-hyperpolyglot/">a hyperpolyglot</a>. Let&#39;s take a look!</p><h3 id="our-question-this-week">Our question this week:</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Dear Duolingo,</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you&#39;re learning a new language, you already know that grammar can be wildly different, new sounds can be incredibly hard to learn, and of course each word is different! Even <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/cognates-in-spanish/#what-is-a-cognate">cognates</a>‚Äîwords that look and mean the same in different languages‚Äîcan <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/false-cognates/">sometimes be misleading</a>. Cognates get borrowed from one language to another, or they get passed down from an older language (like Latin) to the languages that evolve from it (like <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-are-romance-languages/">Spanish, French, and Italian</a>). </p><p>But cognates are often limited to languages spoken in the same region, or are shared across languages that have been in contact with each other. Are there any words that made it outside their region to <em>all</em> languages?</p><p>For this post, I wasn&#39;t able to research all 7000+ languages (unfortunately!). But I did look at a lot of them, and I found a surprising answer:</p><p>YES!!*</p><p>*Or, well‚Ä¶ it seems like 2 words have come close. üò¨ Let&#39;s take a look!</p><h2 id="honorable-mentions-3-words-that-made-it-pretty-far">Honorable mentions: 3 words that made it pretty far</h2><p>Before we get to the (possible) winners, there are a few words to mention that really tried their hardest to make it around the globe. For these words, there are just a few options worldwide:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>ü´ñ <strong>Words for tea</strong></p><p><em>Exceptions: We don&#39;t know of any! But with over 7,000 languages in the world, there&#39;s bound to be some exceptions we don&#39;t know about.</em></p><p>üçç <strong>Words for pineapple</strong></p><p><em>Ananas</em> and <em>abacaxi </em>both come from words used by the Tupi, an indigenous community in South America, where this fruit comes from. Today, you&#39;ll find a form of <em>ananas</em> in Hindi, Arabic, Swahili, and most European languages. Interestingly, both Tupi-origin words are used in Portuguese: <em>Anan√°s</em> is the word in Portugal, <em>abacaxi</em> is the word in Brazil, and the Portuguese-speaking Azores use both, for different kinds of pineapples!</p><p>Long ago, English used a form of <em>ananas</em> as well, but it was soon replaced by the word <em>pineapple</em>‚Ä¶ which originally meant &#34;pinecone&#34;! In Germanic languages like English, <em>apple</em> was a generic word for any fruit, so a <em>pineapple</em> was the &#34;fruit&#34; of the pine tree. In the 17th century, 2 important things happened to change this: A new word <em>pinecone </em>came onto the scene for the pine tree fruits, and people started talking about an incredible new-to-them fruit that sort of looked like that pine tree fruit. <em>Pineapple </em>was repurposed for the new fruit!</p><p>Many languages that use <em>pineapple</em>-like words borrowed their word from English, although Spanish <em>pi√±a</em> (like <em>pino, </em>&#34;pine tree&#34;) evolved separately for the same reasons!</p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese uses a different word for pineapple.</em></p><p>üçä <strong>Words for orange</strong></p><p>Those 2 words cover most languages, but there&#39;s a third word in the mix: <em>appelsin</em>, and words like it. These variants are found in languages of northern Europe and in Russian and Ukrainian. This is another version of <em>apple</em> showing up with that general &#34;fruit&#34; meaning, and the suffix <em>-sin </em>comes from the Latin word for China (an <em>appelsin </em>is a &#34;Chinese fruit&#34; or &#34;Chinese apple&#34;).</p><p><em>Exceptions: Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, and Swahili use something besides these 3 options for &#34;orange.&#34; It&#39;s also worth noting that some languages have different words for the fruit and the color, so one might be like the options here and the other could be something else!</em></p><h2 id="runners-up-2-words-that-nearly-made-it">Runners up: 2 words that *nearly* made it<br/></h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>üöï <strong>Words for taxi</strong></p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese and Icelandic use their own words instead of </em>taxi<em>: Âá∫ÁßüËΩ¶ (ch≈´z≈´chƒì) in Mandarin and</em> <em>leigub√≠l in Icelandic.</em> <em>Modern Standard Arabic uses ÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿ£ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ©. In all 3, the word is based on the words for &#34;rent&#34; and &#34;car&#34;! (Note that Arabic dialects typically use a word like &#34;taxi.&#34;)</em></p><p>üçÖ <strong>Words for tomato</strong></p><p><em>Exceptions: Italian uses </em>pomodoro<em>, and some other languages use a word similar to the Italian one. Mandarin Chinese is another exception!</em></p><h2 id="our-champions-2-words-that-are-the-same-worldwide">Our champions: 2 words that are the same worldwide</h2><p>This pair pushed through borders when our runners up lost steam: You can use both words in basically any country and it has the same meaning everywhere. They might be pronounced slightly differently, or have an extra ending or prefix, but the core words have made it around the world‚Äîthis time, even to Chinese.</p><p>Ready? ü•Åü•Åü•Å</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>‚òïÔ∏è <strong>COFFEE</strong></p><p>The Arabic &#34;q&#34; sounds is produced at the back of the throat, so other languages used whatever sound they had at the very back of the mouth (typically a &#34;k&#34; sound like in English <em>coffee</em>). The &#34;w&#34; in the Arabic word was also often replaced (not all languages have a &#34;w&#34; sound!)‚Äîthe Turkish word <em>kahve</em> uses the &#34;v&#34; sound which is also made at the lips. It&#39;s the Turkish word that was borrowed into many European languages, and so you can see an additional change from &#34;v&#34; to another lip sound: the &#34;f&#34; you know from English <em>coffee</em>, Spanish <em>caf√©</em>, Italian <em>caff√®</em>, etc.</p><p>Are there any exceptions? ü§î ¬†Probably‚Ä¶ but we don&#39;t know them! (<a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">Tell us!</a>)<br/></p><p>üç´ <strong>CHOCOLATE</strong></p><p>When other communities and languages adopted this new food, they slightly altered the pronunciation and spelling to match their language. For example, German and Russian replaced the &#34;ch&#34; sound with &#34;sh,&#34; and Japanese added &#34;o&#34; to the end of the English word since Japanese words can&#39;t end with &#34;t&#34; sounds.</p><p>Just like with the other semi-global words in this post, <em>chocolate</em> gets this honor because the food and idea of <em>chocolate</em> itself originated in one region and was unknown elsewhere‚Äîso when people first learned about the food, they learned the Nahuatl word for it at the same time, too. They went hand in hand! And as the product spread around the world, that single word was carried along for the ride.</p><p>So the world over, some variation of <em>coffee </em>and <em>chocolate</em> will get you exactly what you&#39;re hoping for!</p><h2 id="all-for-one-and-one-for-all">All for one, and one for all!</h2><p>It&#39;s fun to see what kinds of words many unrelated languages do share! And now you can be proud that you probably know 2 words in (nearly) every spoken language on earth. üòâ</p><p>For more answers to your language and learning questions, get in touch with us by emailing <a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">dearduolingo@duolingo.com</a>.</p>
