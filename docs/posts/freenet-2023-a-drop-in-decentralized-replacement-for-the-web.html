    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="K8"><div id="K9"><nav id="Ka" role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation"></nav><section id="K13"><h2 id="K14">Declare your digital independence</h2><span id="K15"></span><div id="K17"><p>The centralization of the internet poses a fundamental threat to individual freedom. In 2023, a few corporations control most internet services and infrastructure. These corporations wield immense power over most of us with little accountability, enabling them to censor content, exploit our data, and exclude users from services they depend on —all with profound implications for democracy. We need a solution urgently.</p>
<p>In 1999, we created the <a href="https://freenet.org/static/freenet-original.pdf">original Freenet</a>—the world&#39;s first scalable, decentralized, peer-to-peer network. It introduced revolutionary ideas such as cryptographic contracts and small-world networks, and was analogous to a shared hard disk.</p>
<p>Building on this legacy, we present Freenet 2023— a drop-in decentralized replacement for the world wide web. This new Freenet is analogous to a global shared computer, a platform for sophisticated decentralized software systems. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, Freenet 2023 can be used seamlessly through your web browser, providing an experience that feels just like using the traditional web.</p>
<p>Freenet 2023 allows developers to create decentralized alternatives to centralized services, including messaging, social media, email, and e-commerce. Our user-friendly decentralized applications are scalable, interoperable, and secured with cryptography.</p>
