    <h1>Charter boat captains don&#39;t have to share location with government, court rules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><strong>Boat-tracking regulation is a warrantless search, court says.</strong> Can the government force charter boat captains to continuously transmit their location information to the authorities? It seems preposterous, but the Department of Commerce and the <span id="page47R_mcid6"><span id="page53R_mcid0"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</span></span> this privacy-infringing protocol in 2020. </span><span id="page47R_mcid6">The rule required charter-boat captains to install—at their own expense—onboard monitoring systems that regularly relayed their boats&#39; GPS locations to the government. </span></p>
<p>A group of charter boat captains represented by t<span>he </span>New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) sued, saying the rule violated rights to due process, privacy, and freedom of movement, among other things.</p>
<p>&#34;<span>The reason we were against this so much is it tracked us precisely where we were going,&#34;</span> Allen Walburn, one of the boat captains who brought the suit, <a href="https://www.fortmyersbeachtalk.com/2023/03/05/charter-boat-captains-win-lawsuit-against-government-over-tracking-devices/">told</a> the <em>Fort Myers Beach Observer and Beach Bulletin</em>.</p>
<p>Another reason: The monitoring systems can be expensive, costing thousands of dollars to install in addition to a monthly service charge.</p>
<p>Now a federal court has sided with the captains.</p>
<p><span id="page86R_mcid1"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#34;Th</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">e asserted benefits from the GPS-tracking requirement do not bear </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">any reasonable relationship to the undisputed costs,&#34; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2023/01/29/the-washington-post-profiles-the-5th-circuit/" title="">Fifth Circuit</a> in Louisiana held in its recent <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/22-30105_Decision.pdf">decision</a>:<br/></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span id="page86R_mcid2"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span id="page86R_mcid1">The Final Rule found that installation of a [monitoring] device would cost $3,000,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span id="page86R_mcid2"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">What benefits does the Government point to in response?</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Next to </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">nothing. </span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The court concluded that the GPS requirement &#34;<span id="page142R_mcid3"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">violates the Administrative </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Procedure Act because it is arbitrary and capricious, in turn because the Gov</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">ernment failed to address Fourth Amendment issues when considering it and </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">failed to rationally consider the associated costs and benefits.&#34; </span> </span><span id="page47R_mcid7"></span></p>
<p>&#34;<span id="page93R_mcid4"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The requirement that charter boats transmit their GPS loca</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">tion to the Government appears to be a search, and no warrant authorizes </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">that search,&#34; it said. </span></span></p>
<p>The regulation—issued pursuant to the <span id="page53R_mcid0"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span id="page50R_mcid3">Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976—was proposed by NOAA. (The Commerce Department has delegated regulatory authority for the Magnuson-Stevens Act to that agency.) It </span></span></span>which would have applied to charter boats in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>The court also ruled against another aspect of the new regulation, which would have required <span id="page53R_mcid4"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">charter boat owners to report </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#34;all fish harvested and dis</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">carded, and any other information requested,&#34; including <span id="page133R_mcid2">&#34;information about the permit holder, vessel, location fished, fishing <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">effort, discards, and socio-economic data.&#34; The court held that this rule violated the Administrative Procedures Act, because it &#34;<span id="page142R_mcid3">did not give fair notice that it would require the type of data specified.&#34; </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>There was concern that the new regulations would lead to surveillance of all recreational fishermen. <span>&#34;This [decision] stops that right in its tracks,&#34;</span> NCLA attorney John Vecchione <a href="https://www.fortmyersbeachtalk.com/2023/03/05/charter-boat-captains-win-lawsuit-against-government-over-tracking-devices/">told</a> the <em>Beach Observer and Beach Bulletin</em>.</p>

<p><strong>More lawmakers move to decriminalize psychedelic plants.</strong> &#34;Local leaders in the city of Ferndale, Michigan, passed a resolution this week that advocates say decriminalizes psychedelic plants and fungi, including drugs such as <a href="https://reason.com/2021/02/13/how-to-take-shrooms/" title="">psilocybin mushrooms</a>, ayahuasca and DMT,&#34; <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/fourth-michigan-city-passes-measure-to-decriminalize-psychedelics/">reports</a> <em>Marijuana Moment</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ferndale is the fourth Michigan city to pass such a measure. <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/detroit-voters-approve-psychedelics-decriminalization-ballot-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit</a>, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/city-council-unanimously-votes-to-decriminalize-psychedelics-in-ann-arbor-michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann Arbor</a> and <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/another-michigan-city-approves-psychedelics-decriminalization-as-activists-pursue-statewide-ballot-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazel Park</a> have adopted similar policy changes.</p>
<p>Last year activists also took steps to put psychedelics legalization on the statewide ballot, but they ultimately decided to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/michigan-activists-give-up-2022-push-for-psychedelics-legalization-ballot-initiative-shifting-focus-to-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay the reform campaign and aim for 2024 instead</a>.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in three other Midwestern states—Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri—are <a href="https://heartlandsignal.com/2023/02/27/four-midwestern-states-could-soon-decriminalize-magic-mushrooms/">introducing legislation</a> this year to decriminalize pscyhedelic plants. And a pair of Rhode Island lawmakers recently introduced a similar proposal. &#34;State Rep. Brandon Potter and state Sen. Meghan Kallman are sponsoring legislation that would legalize the personal use of psilocybin, or psychedelic mushrooms,&#34; <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rhode-island-democrats-seek-decriminalize-magic-mushrooms">reports</a> Fox News. &#34;Contingent on approval from the Food and Drug Administration…their bill would also permit psilocybin to be used to treat chronic mental health disorders.&#34;</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/05/us/tennessee-law-drag-shows.html">delves</a> into Tennessee&#39;s new &#34;adult cabaret&#34; law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bill signed into law this week in Tennessee makes staging &#34;adult cabaret&#34; on public property or anywhere a child could see it a criminal offense. The law forbids performances in those places by topless, go-go or exotic dancers, strippers, or male or female impersonators who, as the law defines it, provides entertainment that is &#34;harmful to minors.&#34;</p>
<p>The word &#34;drag&#34; does not appear in the legislation. And to some legal experts, the description provided in the letter of the law would not apply to drag as they know it. But many in the state are still trying to grasp how the measure will ultimately affect drag events, theater performances that involve drag, and even transgender and gender nonconforming people as they go about their lives.</p>
<p>The law is part of a cascade of legislation across the country fueled by a conservative backlash to drag events, which has also spurred protests from far-right groups and threats directed at performers. Now that it is one of the first to succeed, with lawmakers in other states pursuing legislation with similarly ambiguous language, the law has prompted concerns about how it will be enforced and the implications it could have.</p>
