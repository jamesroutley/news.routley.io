<p>However, the seller also noted that the engine is<em> “perfect” </em>for dismantling and repurposing<em> “into collectable pieces of furniture or art.”</em> The engine is approximately 18 feet long and five feet high (5.5 meters by 1.5 meters). It weighs three and a half tons, while its stand is another two tons, making the combined weight five and a half tons.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-g-boag"> The history of G-BOAG </h2>
<p>The engine was installed on the aircraft initially registered as G-BFKW. This would be the aircraft’s third engine. According to Heritage Concorde, the plane was built in 1977 and was delivered to British Aerospace (BAe), an aircraft, ammunition, and defense systems manufacturer, on January 27, 1978. Having a less-than-glamorous beginning to its life with no buyer, the jet was loaned for a sixth-month period to BA via a sale or return agreement, as the airline was awaiting the repair of another Concorde at a maintenance facility at Filton Airfield.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":1105} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":0} -->

<p>G-BFKW was grounded after an aborted flight to New York on April 26, 1980, due to water contaminating the hydraulic system. The issues led to an intake failure at a speed of Mach 2, which later reportedly resulted in engine surges. After remaining on the ground for several months, $1.2 million (£1,000,000) was spent to return the aircraft to flying condition. On February 9, 1981, BA re-registered the Concorde as G-BOAG. Under these letters, the aircraft would continue to fly for the better part of 22 years, according to Heritage Concorde.</p>

<p>In 1982, the aircraft suffered another grounding as it was utilized as the primary source of spares for the remainder of BA’s Concorde fleet. This lasted for a few years until the airline acquired another Concorde, G-BBDG, to be utilized as the source for spares. G-BOAG returned to service in 1984. One year later, the plane was the first Concorde to unveil BA’s new “Landor” livery and new interior.</p>

<p>In 1996, the jet underwent refurbishment and became the last Concorde to be repainted in BA’s new Chatham livery. Following the Paris crash modification program in 2001, G-BOAG was the third BA Concorde to return to the skies on October 19 of that year. Just two years later, it flew to Toronto to begin its North American farewell tour. On October 14, 2003, the jet visited Washington Dulles International Airport to conclude its North American farewell tour and flew back over the pond to begin its UK farewell tour.</p>

<h2 id="flying-into-retirement"> Flying into retirement </h2>
<p>G-BOAG operated its final flight from New York to London on October 24, 2003, and joined two other Concordes, G-BOAE and G-BOAF, at Heathrow Airport to mark the last day of Concorde commercial flights. On November 3, 2003, the aircraft flew to its retirement home at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, where it can still be visited today.</p>
