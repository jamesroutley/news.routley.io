<p>No his­tor­i­cal fig­ure bet­ter fits the def­i­n­i­tion of “Renais­sance man” than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonar­do da Vin­ci</a>, but that term has become so overused as to become mis­lead­ing. We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>
<p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p>


<p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p>

<p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p>
<p>First, there was the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-codex-arundel-mapping-leonardo-s-working-life-the-british-library/5AUBtgGQK_TgJQ?hl=en"><em>Codex Arun­del</em></a>. It is, writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art">Jonathan Jones at <em>The Guardian</em></a>, “the liv­ing record of a uni­ver­sal mind”—but also, specif­i­cal­ly, the mind of a “technophile.” Then, the Vic­to­ria and Albert Nation­al Art Library <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html">announced the dig­i­ti­za­tion of<em> Codex Forster</em></a>, which con­tains some of Leonardo’s ear­li­est note­books. Now The Visu­al Agency has released <a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">a com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em></a>, a huge col­lec­tion of the artist, engi­neer, and inventor’s fine­ly-illus­trat­ed notes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.openculture.com/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" alt="" width="835" height="621" loading="lazy" data-src="https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png" data-srcset="https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png 835w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-240x178.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-360x268.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-768x571.png 768w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-300x223.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px"/></p>
<p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> “con­sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ­ten on both sides.” Its name has “noth­ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso­teric, mys­te­ri­ous con­tent hid­den in its pages.” The 12-vol­ume col­lec­tion acquired its title because the draw­ings and writ­ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak­ing atlases. Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p>
<p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p>

<p><a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it fea­tures <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p>
<p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">the col­lec­tion</a>.” It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p>
