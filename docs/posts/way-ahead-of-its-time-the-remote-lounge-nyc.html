    <h1>Way ahead of its time: The Remote Lounge NYC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The <a href="http://jpda.net/projects/remote-lounge">Remote Lounge</a> was a high tech bar in NYC’s Bowery District from 10/2001 to 11/2007. The bar’s gimmick was that it was packed full of monitors and closed circuit television cameras. Each CCTV camera was mounted on a servo and could be controlled by anyone in the bar via any of the terminals throughout the bar. Each terminal had a joystick (for controlling a camera), a camera button (which would capture an image and upload it to the RemoteLounge.com), a next button (for switching to another camera), a chat button, and a land line phone. So you could cycle through the bar until you found someone sitting near a camera, then you could request to chat with them via the phone. Sometimes as you were watching a scene your camera would start to move and you’d realize someone else was watching and controlling the same camera that you were.</p>

In each image, you can see people smiling or posing for the camera. The footage is grainy and black and white.

<p>12 years later, it’s funny to think how this novelty bar in NYC would so closely mirror our modern experience. Just replace the always connected security cameras with smart phones and opt-in social media. Sometimes I’m shocked at how my experiences at the Remote Lounge would be recreated time and time again by following a hashtag on twitter, to a photo on instagram, to a small conversation online, and finally with meeting someone face to face… all over the course of ten or twenty minutes on my iPhone at a local bar.</p>

The are retro-futuristic, like a scene from the Jetsons. On each table is a small CRT screen, many light up buttons, a joystick, and a telephone. On the top of the monitor is a small camera that is controlled by servos. The walls are padded and the bar stool cushions are hexagon shaped."/></a></figure>

Each console has two cameras on top and each of those cameras has servos that point the cameras in different directions.

<p>The cameras at the bar could be used to capture photos and upload them to a special section on RemoteLounge.com, like these photos I found from an old chiptune night that was hosted there.</p>
