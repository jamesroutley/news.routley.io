No flying allowed. I would arrive in Africa after voyaging between the Pillars of Hercules, across one of the great seaways of the world. </p><p>(Would it be perilous? Maybe! A bit would be nice. Isn’t that what adventurers deliberately seek out, just the right amount of peril? Tally-ho!)</p><p>Looking back, a lot of this is troublesome: an entirely selfish dream about what Africa would give <em>me</em>. But still, on readying myself for this sea crossing in 2016, it felt like the right call. </p><p>I felt it in Algeciras, looking across the sea to the mountains of Morocco, absurdly close across the Strait. </p><p>I felt it on the ferry, as those mountains gained detail and my thoughts caught up with themselves (“<em>woah, that’s AFRICA…</em>”). </p><p>And I even felt it in Tangier when my girlfriend and I were arguing with taxi-drivers fanatically intent on charging us 20 times the going rate, presumably because I had <em>exactly</em> the kind of facial expression of someone who should never, ever visit anywhere outside of the UK on his own. (There’s your peril, Mike. Enjoy!)</p><p>In crossing the Strait of Gibraltar by sea, taking great lungfuls of sea air and snapping away madly with my crappy camera-phone, I thought I was having the best experience available - and inviting into my excitable brain the maximum amount of awe and wonder available to me. </p><p>In fact, I was looking for them in entirely the wrong direction. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg" width="800" height="316" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:316,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:62137,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02e77d60-08e4-4a69-96bd-ec2c97aa13eb_800x316.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></a></figure></div><p>Six million years ago, the Mediterranean Sea looked very different. </p><p>For starters, “sea” is a misnomer. Because it appears there wasn’t one. In place of the 1,000,000 cubic miles of seawater that currently stretches 2,500 miles (4000 km) from Gibraltar to the Gulf of İskenderun (Turkey), there was…</p><p>Something. It’s unclear what. But it wasn’t a “sea”.</p><p>A big problem here is how unimaginably distant 6 million years is. Putting it simply, that’s time for a lot of monumentally huge things to occur and then be <em>completely</em> erased by the most gradual of natural processes. </p><p>(When I was an archaeologist, we always had to think about the story-muddying effects of <em>taphonomy</em>, the natural processes that break down &amp; scatter biological material. It’s detective work that often gets brain-bendingly complicated - and <strong>that’s</strong> only across centuries or a couple of thousand years.) </p><p>Over millions of years, rainfall can completely dissolve away rock, erosion can strip away vertical kilometres of soil and sediment - and the tectonic plates determining the shape of land &amp; sea can buckle and heave into forms we wouldn’t recognise today. At a local scale, it’s enough time for <em>anything</em> to happen.</p><p>For indicators of what actually <strong>did</strong> happen, we turn to geology. </p><p>In the 1960s, a seismic survey (think “geological ultrasound”) of the floor of the Mediterranean uncovered a continuous feature a few hundred metres down. Further investigations by the crew of the research vessel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_Challenger" rel="">Glomar Challenger</a></em> in the ‘70s confirmed both its existence and composition.</p><p>It was salt. </p><p>Lots and <em>lots</em> of salt. </p><p>More salt than you’re capable of believing, I’ll bet. </p><p>Some of these layers of salt were <strong>two miles thick</strong>. As <em>National Geographic</em> science writer Maya Wei-Haas puts it: “enough to give each of the world’s 7.7 billion people nearly 50 Great Pyramids of Giza filled with the stuff.”</p><p>(Read that again, if you like! It won’t help though. Sorry.)</p><p>Salt comes from evaporated seawater - so, salt on <em>this</em> scale? It must have been the mother of all dessications. </p><p>Scientists now refer to this as the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis" rel="">Messinian Salinity Crisis</a></strong>, named after the geological age it took place in. In some presumed tectonic upheaval, the sea floor of what’s now the Strait of Gibraltar was thrust upwards, forming a bridge that cut the Mediterranean off from the Atlantic, its main replenishing source of water…and the Med started drying out. </p><p>After some amount of time - certainly much than all recorded human history, probably even longer than the 300,000 years that anatomically modern humans have existed on Earth - the bowl of the Mediterranean was a deep, empty desert, save for a few huge, super-salty lakes of unknown size. (There’s fossil evidence that suggests the presence of marine life during this time, so the Med is unlikely to have completely dried out.)</p><p>An enormous salty dryness, up to 900 miles across, with sloping cliffs over a mile deep - shallower in the west of the Mediterranean bowl where the seabed is former of continental crust, much deeper in the east (and at its extreme eastern end, an incredible “<a href="https://thenaturalhistorian.com/2019/05/28/the-lost-grand-canyon-of-egypt-another-monument-to-an-ancient-earth/" rel="">Egyptian Grand Canyon,</a>” formed from the foundations of the Nile)… </p><p>And at its Western end, a plug - a strip of land just a few miles wide - with the force of the whole Atlantic behind it.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg" width="800" height="552" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:552,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:126353,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65569b30-7373-4f8e-b83e-eb5c0be3b50b_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></a></figure></div><p>A few decades ago, Daniel Garcia-Castellanos, a geophysicist at Geosciences Barcelona, grew curious about what happened next. </p><p>How quickly could a whole sea be refilled? </p><p>It’s easy to imagine centuries of streams and rivers trickling water back in, nibbling away at that land-bridge, a little stronger every year. A <em>uniformitarian</em> model, as was most popular during the earliest days of the science of geology, based on the kind of gradual change we can see at work today. It’s a no-brainer concept aided by what can see with your own eyes: go for a walk in the mountains, chart the course of a stream cutting its way through solid rock for thousands of years, extrapolate all your models accordingly. What could be more logical? I mean, all this geology didn’t happen <em>overnight</em>, did it?</p><p>But the gradualistic model didn’t tally with the work Garcia-Castellanos had previously done around tectonic lakes:  </p><blockquote><p>“In the models we were running in Amsterdam, this transition was very fast.”</p></blockquote><p>It seemed more likely that while a stream or river maybe have taken hundreds or thousands of years to cut back to the Atlantic side and form a breach, when that critical tipping-point was reached, 90% of the floodwater powered through according to a <em>human</em> timescale:</p><p>“When we got the first predictions, I was very surprised and thought maybe something was wrong with the formulations,” Garcia-Castellanos later told <em>Nature</em>. “If the model was correct, we would expect to find traces of the flood erosion preserved under the sedimentary layers in the strait.”</p><p>So he and his team went looking - and found the marks of a <strong>cataclysm</strong>. </p><p>There on the floor of the Strait of Gibraltar was a massive channel, carved through sediment and rock, hundreds of meters deep and running from the Gulf of Cadiz to the Algerian Basin - a distance of nearly 390 km. If this did indeed happen quickly, and <em>this</em> was the result…can you imagine the violence at work here?</p><p>This is a silly question.
