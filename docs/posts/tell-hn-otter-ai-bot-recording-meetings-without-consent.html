    <h1>Tell HN: Otter.ai bot recording meetings without consent</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I occasionally use Otter.ai to transcribe when I&#39;m multitasking. Recently they made an update, which I carefully opted out of, to automatically join every meeting through my Google Calendar and transcribe it. Screenshots prove I had the feature disabled.<p>The bot proceeded to join two confidential meetings on my behalf and record the whole thing, then email every member an absurd, inaccurate &#34;outline&#34; after.</p><p>I am not much of a privacy person but I feel completely abused in this situation. I have opened a support ticket with screenshots but there is no response, and according to Twitter they are essentially not reviewing tickets from free users at the moment.</p><p>So just a heads-up to the HN community!</p><p>Are there other, more privacy oriented transcription services anyone can recommend?</p></td></div></div>
