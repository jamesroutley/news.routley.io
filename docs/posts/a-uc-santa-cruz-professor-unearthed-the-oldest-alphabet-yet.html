            <div><p><strong>In 2004, while she was still a meticulous young graduate student, Elaine Sullivan made a discovery that would deepen the history of human writing. </strong></p>

<p>Using trowels and brushes to remove ancient soil at an Early Bronze Age burial site in Umm el-Marra, Western Syria — 35 miles from modern-day Aleppo — Sullivan unearthed a pivotal clue: four small clay cylinders inscribed with mysterious symbols.</p>

<p>Now a UC Santa Cruz history professor and renowned Egyptologist, Sullivan recalls her excitement that season when she first spotted the first artifact. “I was running all of the materials through a sieve by hand in order to make sure that we captured any artifacts, no matter how small,” Sullivan says. </p>

<p>At first, the drably colored object nearly escaped her attention.  </p>

<p>“When I picked the first cylinder up, I thought it was merely a compacted piece of surface dirt,” Sullivan said. “Only after brushing it off did I realize it was an artifact.”</p>

But he hesitated to draw any immediate conclusions because early languages are not his primary subject of research. </p>

<p>But Schwartz, over time, began to explore the possibility that the symbols on the cylinders could be an early Semitic alphabet dating to the Bronze Age. </p>

<p>After the discovery of the first artifact, the team continued to dig, uncovering the three additional cylinders, each about two inches long and inscribed with similar markings. </p>

<p>The discovery was thrilling but mysterious. “Anytime you&#39;re working in an ancient context and you find something with writing on it, it’s very exciting,” Sullivan explains.</p>

<p>However, when the team cleaned the cylinders, they realized the symbols did not belong to any known script like Egyptian hieroglyphs or a recognizable Near Eastern language.</p>

<p>At the time, the team hoped the symbols might reveal details about the people buried in the tomb, known as Tomb 4. </p>

<p>The burial site contained other artifacts like pottery, metal vessels, and jewelry, but the cylinders stood out. Despite initial disappointment that the inscriptions didn’t provide immediate answers, their significance has grown clearer over time.</p>

            <div><p>“The cylinders are remarkable because they force us to rethink where, when, and how the alphabet was invented, and not just because they date at least 500 years earlier than the earliest known examples of alphabetic writing previously identified,” Schwartz said. “Further, they were found in northern Syria, rather than Egypt and the southern Levant, where the earliest known examples had previously been identified.”</p>

<p>“When Elaine discovered the cylinders, she had been working meticulously, exposing and documenting the objects on the floor of the tomb,” Schwartz continued.”If she hadn&#39;t been so careful and so observant, these little clay objects - of the same color and consistency as the clay floor of the tomb - could easily have been overlooked.”</p>

<p>“I suspect that&#39;s why archaeologists haven&#39;t found similar objects elsewhere,” Schwartz said. “Ordinary excavations are faster paced and don&#39;t allow for such careful consideration of every little morsel of dirt turned up.”</p>
