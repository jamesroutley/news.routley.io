    <h1>getting back off the CI train</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 20, 2024</em></p><p>I got Woodpecker working, but the first job I did (a <code>nix build</code>) totally froze up the whole cluster for like an hour and a half, and didn&#39;t even complete successfully. Pretty yikes. Looking at this realistically, I don&#39;t want to buy the size nodes that I would need to do this properly, so it probably makes sense for me to use a hosted service (probably just a free one!) If I had a bunch of money to throw at this problem, though, I&#39;d probably use Woodpecker. It was pretty nice!</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>After doing some investigation, it looks like I&#39;m going to end up on GitHub actions for now. I don&#39;t <em>love</em> thatâ€”part of the reason I started self-hosting my own stuff was to get away from GitHub, but the price is right and it enables me to get going on things that I care about more than fiddling with CI runners.</p><p>Tradeoffs, as always: if I don&#39;t want to run my own thing, I have to put up with what someone else is willing to run. That seems annoying, but fine.</p></article></div>
