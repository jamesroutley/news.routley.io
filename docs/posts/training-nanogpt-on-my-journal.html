    <h1>Training NanoGPT on My Journal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a pet AI chat bot that knows you really well, and
can give you <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-3-is-the-best-journal-you-ve-ever-used">free consulting, coaching and therapy</a>?  What could possibly go
wrong if an intelligent corporate-controlled system has unlimited access to
your private data to provide you the best possible service?  Well... a lot of
things.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking into building a helpful chat bot that runs 100% offline,
purely on the CPU of my 7-year-old laptop.</p>
<p>I have megabytes of personal notes that I could use for training it, along with
emails, chat logs, and other personal information that I would never entrust to
an external entity.  I will probably never get around reading all this stuff
myself, but at last, those files have found a new life as delicious AI Crispy
Bits :)</p>
<p>First I tried to run
<a href="https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax">GPT-J-6B</a> (see <a href="https://hut.pm/deadstar.html">&#34;Dying of
a Deadstar&#34;</a>) on my laptop as a starting point, but that doesn&#39;t
seem feasible, with a whopping 24GB VRAM requirement (my laptop has less than
1GB). There are portable USB Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), such as <a href="https://coral.ai/products/accelerator">Coral USB
Accelerator</a>, but it seems that they can
only run &#34;TensorFlow Lite&#34; models with only 8-bit precision, that rules out
GPT-J-6B without doing extra work.</p>
<p>Then Andrej Karpathy released his enlightening lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY">&#34;Let&#39;s build GPT: from
scratch, in code, spelled out.&#34;</a>,
along with the git repo <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT">&#34;nanoGPT&#34;</a>, which
makes it seem so easy to just build a somewhat decent language model on your
own, <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/f29a9ff5bf1ddf64c30ce74e371244eff6fc22b7/README.md#i-only-have-a-macbook">even on a
laptop</a>,
so I just gave it a try.  Conveniently, I could actually use nanoGPT mostly
as-is, with just some tweaking of the parameters so that it&#39;ll run on my Laptop
on acceptable timescales, and of course with my own dataset.</p>

<p>After half a day of training the neural network on my personal notes, I got
pretty good results already.  I asked the AI to generate new notes from
scratch, and while the majority of the output was garbage, some of the results
were quite eerie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My life is not this one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow.  The AI sees right through the matrix, and recognizes that it&#39;s only being simulated. Spot-on!</p>
<p>Here are some more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember I talk to the universe where I am ok, so I don&#39;t know right, but it&#39;s just enough to be good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But I kinda had a shit for her. And I got shit, shit out of my dad. And I
feel like something like &#34;omg it is difficult and is just sche to be sure
of him. It feel to research: improve and detached our things. who is just a
temporary desire to re an your xwas. I&#39;m a too good planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to go back to that time.  It was actually as 1 minutes too fast.
I was definitelyn happy with jet invite this girl while I was really a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I really wanted the feeling of the 3-10 days after before I was holding up with at the next day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I noticed a bit out of my life.  Or about how a human is that time to my past, I have the feeling that I just don&#39;t feel bad.  There is the reason I can tell my body in order to get something.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to find that stuff and play.  It feels quite bad when it fucked my body, but it was always beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I want a life where I can sit down for ~30 year, and after she starts for something she&#39;s that she&#39;s fucking fucking hard to shit when I she doesn&#39;t need.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still stupid.  I want to wonder why I am not able to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the AI is struggling to make sense of the world, confused about the
concept of time, and feels some disassociation from its body.  Don&#39;t worry,
buddy. It&#39;ll be all right.</p>

<p>Inspired by Dan Shipper&#39;s post <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/can-gpt-3-explain-my-past-and-tell-me-my-future">&#34;Can GPT-3 Explain My Past and Tell My Future? &#34;</a>, I added some writing prompts for the AI, like <code>&#34;I have been the happiest when &#34;</code> or <code>&#34;Im happy because&#34;</code>. These are some of the results, with the prompts in bold font:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I have been the happiest when</strong> She doesn&#39;t want to break up</li>
<li><strong>I&#39;m happy because</strong> I feels like happy.</li>
<li><strong>I&#39;m happy because</strong> of this. The things I want to go to sleep, and for the fucking time I have to stay there while.</li>
<li><strong>I&#39;m happy because</strong> of my brain.</li>
<li><strong>I&#39;m happy because</strong> I don&#39;t care about it</li>
<li><strong>I&#39;m happy because</strong> of my love.  There is no one, and I will go on disitation.  My whole thing is, and I don&#39;t care for it, but I don&#39;t have my mind with their own own feet, because can it be kinda be uncomfortable.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> The relationship was not good, I was actually doing much to problem.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> I can&#39;t have great time.  But it&#39;s not a pain.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> In the future I was with her.  I can do it now.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> I&#39;m not gonna love.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> I could just go.  don&#39;t even say.  I&#39;m just afraid of it back.  Maybe I was gapp?</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> I don&#39;t remember nothing.</li>
<li><strong>I never knew that</strong> I&#39;m an asshole [thanks, AI -_-]</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> time.</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> race...</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> sense to it.</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> &#34;real&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> real sex, but on some point it is a a bit, and I&#39;ve felt much more and I walked there.</li>
<li><strong>Maybe there is no</strong> way to be nothing.  It&#39;s still a a thing</li>
<li><strong>I wish I knew</strong>, but I think I don&#39;t know it.</li>
<li><strong>I wish I knew</strong> that I&#39;m hot in the right stuff...</li>
<li><strong>I wish I knew</strong> what I’m doing in this moment.</li>
<li><strong>Remember</strong> to walk for a while or something, for the planet is to go to see me.</li>
<li><strong>Remember</strong>. The problem has like a mother’s long.</li>
<li><strong>Remember</strong>, the first sweet-like impact when their time is on the top, its mind becomes.</li>
<li><strong>Remember</strong>. There is no new consciousness, a healthy different way to me in just because I have to write this...</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it&#39;s very confused, but some of the lines sound deeply profound.</p>
<p>With a lot of imagination, the last one could be interpreted like this: The AI
realized that it&#39;s not actually new consciousness.  It&#39;s just a healthy,
different way for the real me to exist.  Because the AI has to write all this,
and not the real me. Indeed, if this continues, I will not have to write any
more notes on my own ;)</p>

<p>The above outputs have been generated after 3-16 hours of training time, and
the text generation time was about 30 characters per second.  So it&#39;s totally
feasible to run it on a laptop, even for a live chat bot.</p>
<p>The output is not great, but at least there are some sentences that make sense
:) I will do some more neural network training and dataset cleaning, let&#39;s see
where it will get me.</p>
<p>All in all, this AI-generated line describes my feelings about the results
perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re a real problem, but I&#39;m just happy that you are doing.</p>
</blockquote>
