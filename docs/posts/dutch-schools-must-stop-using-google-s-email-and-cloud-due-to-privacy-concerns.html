    <h1>Dutch schools must stop using Google&#39;s email and cloud due to privacy concerns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://tutanota.com/blog/images/amp-email-gmail.jpg" title="Stop using Google; alternatives like Tutanota fully comply with the GDPR and protect user privacy." alt="Stop using Google; alternatives like Tutanota fully comply with the GDPR and protect user privacy."/></p><p>Dutch schools and universities must stop using Google&#39;s email and cloud services due to privacy concerns. According to
the Dutch Personal Data Authority, educational institutions do not know how and where the personal data of pupils and 
students are processed and stored. As a result, the processing of the information would be &#34;not lawful.&#34;

<h3 id="pupils-privacy-must-be-protected">Pupil&#39;s privacy must be protected</h3>
<p>Dutch education ministers Robbert Dijkgraaf and Dennis Wiersma have just reported in a parliamentary letter that
there are many privacy concerns about current Google services. Consequently, the Dutch education sector will not 
be able to use modified versions of the Chrome browser and Chrome OS in its
current state. </p>
<p>Already last summer, the Dutch Personal Data Authority advised schools and universities to stop using Google&#39;s email and 
cloud services. The watchdog had concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>According to the watchdog, educational institutions do not know how and where the personal data of pupils and students 
are processed and stored. As a result, the processing of the information would be &#34;not lawful.&#34;</p>
<h3 id="google-promises-fix">Google promises fix</h3>
<p>Google has indicated that it plans to fix the privacy concerns by August 2023, but the current versions of Google&#39;s email
and cloud services must not be used by educational institutions in the Netherlands.</p>
<h3 id="big-techs-privacy-protection-regularly-questioned">Big Tech&#39;s privacy protection regularly questioned</h3>
<p>A similar story hit in Germany in 2019 affecting Microsoft when 
<a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/microsoft-office-365-email-alternative">Office 365 was declared illegal for German schools</a>. Back then the
Hessian commissioner of Data Protection and Freedom of Information issued a statement that given the missing transparency 
in regards to data protection and potential third-party access no personal data of German school children must be stored on 
Microsoft&#39;s, Google&#39;s or Apple&#39;s servers outside of Germany.</p>
<p>As a consequence, 
American cloud providers do not comply with strict German privacy protection laws and must not be used by German schools.</p>
<h3 id="two-privacy-concerns">Two privacy concerns</h3>
<p>Two issues were criticized specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>American authorities can access data stored in the European cloud without the German government having control over this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Office 365 and Windows 10 lots of telemetry data is gathered and transmitted to Microsoft without Microsoft giving 
satisfying information about what is logged and transferred.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consequences-for-dutch--german-schools">Consequences for Dutch &amp; German schools</h3>
<p>Based on the statements by the Dutch and German privacy watchdogs, schools and universities in the Netherlands and in
Germany my not use Google&#39;s email or cloud services.</p>
<p>Instead, it is recommendable to use a European email service such as Tutanota.</p>
<p>On top of complying with strict data protection regulations, in Tutanota all data is stored encrypted on German servers, 
Thus, Tutanota is in full
compliance with the <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/gdpr-compliant-email">GDPR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="secure-groupware-suite-is-planned">Secure groupware suite is planned</h3>
<p>In the future, we plan to extend our secure email service that already incorporates fully encrypted calendars and contacts
into an encrypted Groupware Suite.</p>
<p>And we do not stop there: We are already working on making Tutanota&#39;s 
<a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/nist-publishes-quantum-resistant-encryption-algorithms">encryption resistant against attacks from quantum
computers</a>. As the most secure email service, we aim at securing your private emails not just now, but also in the future!</p>
<p><strong>tl:dr: While the publications by the Dutch and German privacy watchdogs are mostly about pressuring Google and Microsoft 
into adhering to strict European privacy regulations, it would be much preferred to have a true alternative to Microsoft, Google and Apple.
That&#39;s what Tutanota is building right now. Started with secure emails, Tutanota today also offers an encrypted address
book, an encrypted <a href="https://tutanota.com/calendar">calendar</a>, and the encrypted contact form <a href="https://tutanota.com/secure-connect">Secure Connect</a>. Many
more features are planned, and we estimate that in a few more years, we can offer an encrypted Groupware Suite with
maximum respect of user privacy.</strong></p>
