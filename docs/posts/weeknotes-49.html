<li>hello! hi! hey!</li>
<li>seven sevens make (week) 49!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng24U4zn8-I"><em>i feel different everyday</em> by chlothegod
</a> so much! always love to have a new fav in the rotation.</li>
<li>been utterly obsessed with the idea of getting an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7FUiJN9Ehw&amp;t=1s">omnichord</a> and learning words like &#34;groovebox&#34;, and &#34;sequencer&#34; and what a sampler does in this context, it&#39;s very fun!</li>
<li>i posted twice for <a href="https://olu.online/alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a>, <a href="https://olu.online/permanent">permanent</a> and <a href="https://olu.online/questions">questions</a>. i think i actually will finish this year, so exciting. <em>whispers conspiratorially</em>: the secret is to lower your standards.</li>
<li>i am sort of joking but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Caroline_Winkler">caroline winkler</a> once said something like &#34;if you&#39;re an all or nothing person, you usually end up being a nothing person&#34; as i have probably said on this blog before, and it changed my brain chemistry.</li>
<li>i wonder if i should have an entire page here for quotes? and a little blurb about what they mean for me?</li>
<li>been doing so much decluttering in anticipation of city move 2025!</li>
<li>continued reading <em>grokking algorithms</em> and <em>more than a glitch</em>. <em>grokking</em> seems cool so far and i&#39;m enjoying a more softball intro before i go and get pummelled by <em>the algorithm design manual</em> again.</li>
<li>been thinking a lot about the design of this site, spurred on by <a href="https://things.joodaloop.com/">things to add to your personal site</a>, especially the recommended reading on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/wn/website_enhance.html">using your personal site as a place to think</a> (poorly paraphrased). i clearly do that, here and on <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes</a>, but would like to make it more automatic, so will be experimenting with things!</li>
<li>i have drifted away from strict personal knowledge management (PKM) style note taking, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplacing</a> seems a bit much now, but i do think i will try and collect stuff that&#39;s relevant to a specific project together more often now. tried a tool that turned out to be more AI reliant than i guess at first use, so not that, so maybe <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> is the way forward and i should just commit. do you use anything in this way, to collect inspiration, sources and to reads for projects? i like to keep it seperate from the actual written or end product files, and i also like it to be somewhat visual, so it&#39;s a different mode. i might try using <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">tldraw</a> for a more visual element since all the paid options suck, maybe i could make or find thing to pull stuff from a channel in arena into tldraw??? ðŸ‘€ i think this must exist.</li>
<li>everest pipkin&#39;s talk <a href="https://discord.com/channels/801274974820106261/818598752507658251/1408520242606637176"><em>sungrazer</em></a> has stuck with me all week! it&#39;s inspired me to make something about my feelings (good, bad, and weird!) towards wikipedia when i finish the social media video.</li>
<li>i am resigning myself to <em>maybe</em> finishing one video essay this year, which i will take as a triumph and not an abysmal failure (at some point, so help me god).</li>
<li>i am eating rice, so much rice, and bread, so much bread. i am drinking peach bellini mocktails and tap water.</li>
<li>see you next week. look after yourself! ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
