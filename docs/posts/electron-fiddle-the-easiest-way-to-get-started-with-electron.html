    <h1>Electron Fiddle: The easiest way to get started with Electron</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback"><main><p><strong>Electron Fiddle</strong> lets you create and play with small Electron experiments. It greets you with a runnable quick start template â€” change a few things, choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around. Then, save your fiddle locally or as a GitHub Gist. Once uploaded to GitHub, anyone can try your fiddle out by just entering the Gist URL in the address bar.</p><div><div><h2>Explore Electron</h2><p>Try Electron without installing any dependencies: Fiddle includes everything you&#39;ll need to explore the platform. It also includes examples for every API available in Electron, so if you want to quickly see what a <code>BrowserView</code> is or how the<!-- --> <code>desktopCapturer</code> works, Fiddle has got you covered.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/assets/fiddle/explore.png"/></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Use npm packages</h2><p>If your experiment depends on third-party modules, you can search for any package available in the npm registry, with autocomplete and version selection powered by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/assets/fiddle/npm.png"/></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Code with types</h2><p>Fiddle is built on Microsoft&#39;s excellent<!-- --> <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco Editor</a>, the same editor powering VS Code. It also installs the type definitions for the currently selected version of Electron automatically, ensuring that you always have all Electron APIs only a few keystrokes away.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/assets/fiddle/types.png"/></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Compile and package</h2><p>Fiddle can automatically turn your experiment into binaries you can share with your friends, coworkers, or grandparents. It does so thanks to<!-- --> <a href="https://www.electronforge.io/">Electron Forge</a>, allowing you to package your fiddle as an app for Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/assets/fiddle/package.png"/></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Start with Fiddle, continue wherever</h2><p>Fiddle is not an IDE. However, it is an excellent starting point. Once your fiddle has grown up, export it as a project with or without Electron Forge. Then, use your favorite editor and take on the world!</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/assets/fiddle/export.png"/></p></div></div><section id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><a href="http://github.com/electron/fiddle">GitHub</a></section></main></div></div>
