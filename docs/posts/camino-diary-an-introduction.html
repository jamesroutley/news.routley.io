<hr/>
<p>In October of 2023, I flew to Spain and walked over 600km along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">Camino de Santiago</a>. I kept a diary throughout this journey, writing in broken Spanish. Here, I&#39;ll give a brief introduction to the series of diary entries, which I have now transcribed and translated to less-broken English.</p>

<h3 id="whats-a-camino">What&#39;s a Camino?</h3>
<p>The Camino de Santiago (&#34;Way of St. James&#34;) is a network of pilgrimages or walking routes. They&#39;re mostly situated in Spain, and the endpoint of all the routes is Santiago de Compostela, a city in the autonomous community of Galicia. Hundreds of thousands of people walk these routes every year. Some of them do it for spiritual reasons, but nowadays I think most people just do it for fun. The tradition is over 1000 years old.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-do-it">Why did you do it?</h3>
<p>I can&#39;t remember how I discovered the Camino. A lot of people, especially from North America, first hear of it through a Martin Sheen movie called <em>The Way</em>, but I haven&#39;t watched it. Someone probably mentioned it to me during the 3-month Spanish course I did in Valencia. Wherever I got the idea, I&#39;d been excited by it for a long time (adventure! introspection! nature! Spanish!), and after submitting my thesis in September of 2025 it seemed like the perfect time to go.</p>
<h3 id="which-route-did-you-take">Which route did you take?</h3>
<p>The Camino del Norte, or &#34;Northern Way&#34;, is a route along the coast of northern Spain. I picked it because it&#39;s less crowded than the the most popular route, the Camino Francés (&#34;French Way&#34;). I thought the pilgrims taking that route might be more interesting, and it&#39;d be less touristy.</p>
<!--I'm not sure if this comes from a nonconformist streak or what, but I often seem to pick options from the 2nd tier of popularity. I studied Spanish in Valencia instead of Madrid or Barcelona; in school, I joined the underpopulated German class rather than one of the many crowded French classes; and my favourite programming language is the underappreciated Common Lisp. On the other hand, I follow the recommendations of others when it comes to movies, books, music and food.-->

<p>The Norte starts in Irún, in the Basque Country of northeastern Spain. It consists of about 35 stages, depending on how you break it up. Given that I only had 30ish days to spend, I decided to skip a few stages and start in Bilbao instead. This shaved off about 150km, which happened to be the most mountainous and difficult part of the Norte, but I still had to walk over 600km.</p>
<p>Here are the stops I <em>planned</em> to make along the way, with particularly difficult segments marked by an X. The total distance was 667.8km.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bilbao</li>
<li>Portugalete (19.4km)</li>
<li>Castro Urdiales (25.4km)</li>
<li>Laredo (25.8km)</li>
<li>Guemes (29km)</li>
<li>Santander (15.2km)</li>
<li>Santillana del Mar (X 37km)</li>
<li>Comillas (22km)</li>
<li>Colombres (28.8km)</li>
<li>Llanes (23.2km)</li>
<li>Ribadesella (31.4km)</li>
<li>Sebrayo (X 31.6km)</li>
<li>Gijón (X 35.8km)</li>
<li>Avilés (25.4km)</li>
<li>Muros de Nalón (23.2km)</li>
<li>Soto de Luiña (15.3km)</li>
<li>Cadavedo (18.5km)</li>
<li>Luarca (15.3km)</li>
<li>La Caridad (30.5km)</li>
<li>Ribadeo (21.6km)</li>
<li>Lourenzá (X 28.4km)</li>
<li>Abadín (25.2km)</li>
<li>Vilalba (20.7km)</li>
<li>Baamonde (18.6km)</li>
<li>Sobrado (X 39.8km)</li>
<li>Arzúa (22km)</li>
<li>Pedrouzo (19.3km)</li>
<li>Santiago de Compostela (19.4km)</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, this isn&#39;t the precise route I ended up following, and I actually got to Santiago ahead of schedule. A few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>For one segment, I took the bus instead of walking, because I had a minor injury and wanted to rest. This earned me a scoff from an annoying Camino purist or two.</li>
<li>Among the tools I used for navigation was the Buen Camino app on my phone. I didn&#39;t realise that the stages in the app were different to the stages I&#39;d copied from pilgrim.es, and so I accidentally ended up following the app&#39;s much more ambitious schedule for the first few days.</li>
<li>There were a few branching paths that I hadn&#39;t anticipated. Sometimes I took a more scenic route, sometimes I took a shortcut.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a few days to spare at the end, which I used to explore Santiago and visit Finisterre. I envisioned myself reading Sylvia Plath&#39;s poem of the same name, <em>Finisterre</em>, in the final moments of the trip. [Editor&#39;s note: well, aren&#39;t you a pretentious little sod?]</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-pack">What did you pack?</h3>
<p>I had a relatively small backpack, with a capacity of 22L. It weighed 4-6kg, depending on whether my water bottle was full and whether I was carrying food. Many other pilgrims commented on how small and light my bag was. It was a conscious choice - all the guides said to be minimalist and reduce weight as much as possible. I may have taken it a bit too far, though.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>22L backpack.</li>
<li>3 pairs of socks (merino wool, helps to avoid blisters).</li>
<li>3 pairs of underwear.</li>
<li>3 t-shirts (synthetic material, dries faster).</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts (hiking shorts, dry quickly).</li>
<li>trail runners (breathable, good foot support, dry quickly when wet).</li>
<li>rain poncho (keeps bag and upper body dry).</li>
<li>light jumper.</li>
<li>scarf.</li>
<li>baseball cap.</li>
<li>sunglasses.</li>
<li>microfiber towel (dries fast).</li>
<li>passport.</li>
<li>water bottle.</li>
<li>pharmacy stuff (in a plastic bag): suncream, paracetamol, antihistamines, insect spray, blister plasters / bandages, vaseline.</li>
<li>toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
<li>a bar of soap (for washing self + clothes)</li>
<li>phone/charger.</li>
<li>converter for sockets.</li>
<li>e-reader.</li>
<li>journal + pen.</li>
<li>3 safety pins (for hanging wet clothes off the backpack when walking).</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are some things I might change with hindsight, I feel that the packing was a success! Possible amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I probably should&#39;ve brought another pair of shorts, because with only 1 pair I needed a private room in order to wash and dry them.</li>
<li>The scarf came in useful on one or two particularly chilly mornings, but mostly felt like a waste of space. And I looked kinda ridiculous wearing a scarf with shorts.</li>
<li>It would&#39;ve been good to have a container for my soap, because it made a mess when wet. I kept it in its original, papery container, which had almost completely disintegrated by the end of the trip.</li>
<li>The sunglasses weren&#39;t needed when I had a baseball cap. As it happened, though, I lost the baseball cap and the sunglasses got some use.</li>
<li>I only read ~100 pages on the e-reader (<em>Los detectives salvajes</em> was a slog), but I would be reluctant to give it up.</li>
<li>Earphones would&#39;ve been helpful on days when I was extremely bored, but I didn&#39;t bring them because &#34;living in the moment&#34;... or something. I ended up daydreaming a lot and not paying attention to my surroundings, so I probably should&#39;ve just brought earphones.</li>
<li>Some pilgrims marvelled at my lack of a sleeping bag, and a few albergues (hostels) didn&#39;t provide a blanket at night, but I managed to survive the cold by draping my towel &amp; jumper over myself. I&#39;d suggest bringing a light sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-did-you-plan-the-trip">How did you plan the trip?</h3>
<p>My main resource was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/">r/CaminoDeSantiago</a>. The discussions and guides on there cover everything you might need: routes, packing, walking tips, accommodation, weather, blister prevention, etc. I also used <a href="https://www.pilgrim.es/en/northern-way/">pilgrim.es</a> for route planning, and the Buen Camino app was helpful too. I didn&#39;t book any accommodation before the trip, which ended up biting me on the first night. After that, I sometimes booked accommodation ahead of my arrival in a town, but that mostly wasn&#39;t necessary.</p>
<h3 id="you-kept-a-diary-wow-loser">You kept a diary? Wow, loser.</h3>
<p>Yep. Almost every day. And I always went back to fill in the days I missed. It was a lot of work, but I didn&#39;t have much else to do in the evenings, and I&#39;m glad to now have a record of my trip.</p>
<p>I wrote in Spanish, for practice. This somewhat limited what I could express, but I usually managed to capture the day&#39;s events with the generous use of a dictionary. I wrote in a mixture of present and past tense, but for the transcription I&#39;m converting everything to the past tense, because otherwise it&#39;d be hard to read. I&#39;ve also done extensive editing, moved some non-chronological bits around, and added details that I neglected to write down at the time.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-eat">What did you eat?</h3>
<p>At the time I did the Camino, I was vegetarian. Sometimes I had to settle for subpar or expensive veggie food, especially in small villages, but for the most part I didn&#39;t have any issues. I ate a LOT of tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette), as they&#39;re available in all the cafeterías. It would&#39;ve been much harder as a vegan. I suspect I would&#39;ve had to cook for myself a lot more and carry more food supplies with me.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-you-writing-this">Why are you writing this?</h3>
<p>Seems a shame to write so much and not share it with anyone. Also, it&#39;s fun.</p>
