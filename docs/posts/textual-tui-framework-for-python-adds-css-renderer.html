    <h1>Textual TUI framework for Python adds CSS renderer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="blog-post-textual-0-point-2-point-0"><p>‚ù∞<!-- --> <a href="https://www.textualize.io/blog">Blog index</a></p><p>üóì Posted on <!-- -->Oct 23</p><div><p>I&#39;m happy to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual 0.2.0</a>. The headline feature of this version is CSS support, but frankly there are a lot more additional features and improvements than a <em>minor</em> version might suggest. The following video demonstrates a few of those features:</p>

</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been working in a Git branch since the beginning of the year because we didn&#39;t want to leave the main version in a state of flux while we made significant changes to Textual&#39;s architecture. Fortunately the API has reached point where we don&#39;t anticipate it changing significantly between updates.</p>
<p>The API stability means we finally have <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">documentation</a> which we are very proud of! We draw our inspiration from such projects as Django and FastAPI.</p>
<p>The documentation and Textual itself are still very much a work in progress, but stable enough that we encourage you to use it for your next TUI project. Let us know what you build!</p>
<h2>Thanks!</h2>

<p>I&#39;d also like to thank the beta testers who have helped us identify and fix issues in the last few weeks.</p>
