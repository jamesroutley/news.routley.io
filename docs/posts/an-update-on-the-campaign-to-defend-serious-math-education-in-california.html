    <h1>An update on the campaign to defend serious math education in California</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>As you might remember, last December I hosted a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">guest post</a> about the “California Mathematics Framework” (CMF), which was set to cause radical changes to precollege math in California—e.g., eliminating 8th-grade algebra and making it nearly impossible to take AP Calculus.  I linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> setting out my and my colleagues’ concerns about the CMF.  That letter went on to receive more than 1700 signatures from STEM experts in industry and academia from around the US, including recipients of the Nobel Prize, Fields Medal, and Turing Award, as well as a lot of support from college-level instructors in California. </p>



<p>Following widespread pushback, a <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">new version of the CMF</a> appeared in mid-March.  I and others are gratified that the new version significantly softens the opposition to acceleration in high school math and to calculus as a central part of mathematics.  Nonetheless, we’re still concerned that the new version promotes a narrative about data science that’s a recipe for cutting kids off from any chance at earning a 4-year college degree in STEM fields (including, ironically, in data science itself).</p>



<p>To that end, some of my Californian colleagues have <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathindatamatters/home"><strong>issued a new statement today</strong></a> on behalf of academic staff at 4-year colleges in California, aimed at clearing away the fog on how mathematics is related to data science.  I strongly encourage my readers on the academic staff at 4-year colleges in California to sign this commonsense statement, which has already been signed by over 250 people (including, notably, at least 50 from Stanford, home of two CMF authors).</p>



<p>As a public service announcement, I’d also like to bring to wider awareness <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/5-CCR-Sec-18533">Section 18533 of the California Education Code</a>, for submitting written statements to the California State Board of Education (SBE) about errors, objections, and concerns in curricular frameworks such as the CMF.  </p>



<p>The SBE is scheduled to vote on the CMF in mid-July, and their remaining meeting before then is on May 18-19 according to <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/st/index.asp">this site</a>, so it is really at the May meeting that concerns need to be aired.  Section 18533 requires submissions to be written (yes, snail mail) and postmarked at least 10 days before the SBE meeting.  So to make your voice heard by the SBE, please send your written concern by certified mail (for tracking, but <em>not</em> requiring signature for delivery), no later than Friday May 6, to State Board of Education, c/o Executive Secretary of the State Board of Education, 1430 N Street, Room 5111, Sacramento, CA 95814, complemented by an email submission to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:sbe@cde.ca.gov" target="_blank">sbe@cde.ca.gov</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:mathframework@cde.ca.gov" target="_blank">mathframework@cde.ca.gov</a>.</p>
