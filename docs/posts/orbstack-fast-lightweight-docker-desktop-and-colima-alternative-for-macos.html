Docker Desktop alternative that helps you work faster.</p></div><p><img alt="OrbStack running Traefik, Consul, amd MongoDB Docker containers, an Arch Linux machine, Linux files open in Finder, and nginx with port forwarding" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fhero.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fhero.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://orbstack.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fhero.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" width="1200" height="1200" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p></section><section id="companies"><h2>Loved by developers at</h2></section><section id="features"><h2>Fast, light, simple</h2><p>No more battery drain or complicated VMs. OrbStack respects your machine, with powerful capabilities. No compromises.</p><div><div><h3>Lightning fast</h3><p>Starts in seconds with turbocharged networking, smooth Rosetta x86 emulation, VirtioFS file sharing, and other optimizations for some workloads.</p></div><div><h3>Light as a feather</h3><p>Keep it breezy with low CPU and disk usage, minimal memory consumption, and a native Swift app. Battery drain is a thing of the past.</p></div><div><h3>Effortless integration</h3><p>Enjoy Docker as if it were native to macOS, plus CLI integration, file sharing, and remote SSH editing with Linux machines.</p></div><div><h3>Unbelievably simple</h3><p>Drop-in replacement for Docker Desktop. Easily get started with Linux machines in 1 minute with the simple, yet powerful, app and command line.</p></div><div><h3>Endlessly capable</h3><p>Run Docker containers and your favorite Linux distros (soon Kubernetes) all with robust network capabilities and integration.</p></div><div><h3>Robust connectivity</h3><p>Connect between Linux machines and Docker containers, and use IPv6 and ICMP painlessly. VPNs and DNS become friends, not foes.</p></div></div></section><section id="demos"><h2>See the <span>magic</span></h2><p>Embark on a seamless journey towards better development, within a matter of seconds.</p></section><div><div><h3>Use Docker like it’s native</h3><p>Build Docker images quickly and enjoy fast, reliable networking and file sharing. Bind mounts and port forwards just work. Debug containers easily with access to volumes. Run x86 containers with Rosetta. Docker Compose and other tools included.</p></div><div><h3>Linux machines without the fuss</h3><p>Run full-blown Linux machines with your favorite distro. Work seamlessly with Visual Studio Code (or your favorite editor) and SSH agent forwarding. Run Intel machines on Apple Silicon with Rosetta.</p></div><div><h3>First-class command line integration</h3><p>Live in the terminal? We think our native Swift app is great, but everything can be done from the command line. Run commands and copy files between Mac and Linux with ease. Send notifications and open files and links from Linux.</p></div><div><div><p><img alt="OrbStack virtual machine service in Activity Monitor, using 0.1% CPU" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fcpu-boxed.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fcpu-boxed.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://orbstack.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fcpu-boxed.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" width="800" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p></div><h3>Light as a feather</h3><p>With less than 0.1% background CPU usage on Apple Silicon, OrbStack sips power and stays out of your way.
