    <h1>Ask HN: Has the Apple Silicon excessive disk read/write issue been fixed?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This was a discussion when M1 macbooks were launched, and Apple supposedly addressed it in an OS update (macOS 11.4).</p><p>But I&#39;m seeing really high read/write numbers. I&#39;m aware that SSD lifespans are long and TBW spec is pretty generous. Still, compared to my linux machines, this seems extraordinarily high.</p><p>On my newish M1 MBA, with the latest updates, with barely any use, 98%+ sleep, I&#39;m seeing about 3 to 5 GB reads per day and 2 to 4 GB writes per day.</p><p>Latest report from smartctl.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><pre><code>    === START OF SMART DATA SECTION ===
