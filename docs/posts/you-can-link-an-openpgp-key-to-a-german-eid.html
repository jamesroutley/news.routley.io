                <p>With an OpenPGP key, you can securely encrypt your e-mail communications and ensure that your messages and files cannot be read by unauthorized third parties. By authenticating your public OpenPGP key via the eID function of your ID card, you can achieve additional trust for your e-mail communication: the e-mail address assigned to the OpenPGP key is provided with your real name and you actually have access to the associated e-mail mailbox.</p>

                    <div><p>OpenPGP is a widespread and secure method for digitally encrypting messages and files and thus protecting them from access by unauthorized third parties. This encryption is based on a so-called public key method, in which everyone participating in a communication requires a key pair consisting of a public and a private key. On the one hand, the public key is published for potential mail contacts. This is used to encrypt messages or files sent to you. The private key, on the other hand, remains in your possession and should be protected with a secure password. With its help you can decrypt the encrypted messages or files</p></div>

                        <p>Governikus provides the online service for authenticating your OpenPGP key on behalf of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). This online service compares the name read from your ID card, your electronic residence permit or eID card for citizens of the European Union with the name specified in your OpenPGP key. If the names match, your public key is electronically signed by Governikus, confirming the match. The Governikus public key can be used to verify the Governikus electronic signature.</p>
