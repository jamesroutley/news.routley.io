  <p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/278103/eIDAS-4th-column-extract.pdf">final
  text</a> of the update to the eIDAS regulation (establishing a
  framework for a European Digital Identity) has been agreed upon. In a
  last minute effort to improve the text, <a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/">we wrote an open letter</a>
  criticising the proposal on weakening the security of the web, and
  providing too few safeguards protecting users of the proposed European
  Identity Wallet. Were we successful?</p>
  <p>Looking at the text, it is clear this is a compromise (and an
  amendment to an existing regulation). In particular the structure is a
  mess, with new articles introducing the identity wallet running as far
  as four levels deep. This is a tough read. (Also, someone at the
  Commission needs to carefully cross-check all references because
  e.g. Article 45a-1.4 refers to Article 17(3)(c) that appears to no
  longer to exist.) I guess that’s life when regulating a hotly
  contested topic.</p>
  <p>Let’s study the two topics we addressed in our open letter: web
  security, and wallet privacy.</p>
  <h2 id="weakening-the-security-of-the-web">Weakening the security of
  the web</h2>
  <p>We were concerned about the phrasing of Article 45, that lays down
  a requirement for browsers to recognise any certificate that satisfies
  some criteria specified in an annex to the regulation, <em>without any
  other requirements to be imposed by the browsers</em>. We were
  especially concerned that browsers were prevented from running
  additional security checks when such certificates were being used to
  authenticate a website, depending on how you would read Article
  45a.</p>
  <p>Why would this be a problem?</p>
  <p>For a browser to ‘recognise’ a certificate means that the issuer of
  the certificate (the party that signs the contents of the certificate)
  is added to the trusted root list of a browser. When a browser visits
  a website, it asks the website to provide a valid certificate
  (i.e. one signed by <em>any</em> of the issuers in its trusted root
  list). The certificate contains the domain name of the website (which
  the browsers checks against the domain name in the link for the
  website it is visiting) and a public key for that domain. The issuer
  has verified that the public key indeed belongs to that website. And
  the browser verifies the signature on the certificate it just received
  to ensure correctness of this information. It then challenges the
  website to prove it knows the private key corresponding to the public
  key found in the certificate, while at the same time establishing a
  session key to encrypt the communication between the browser and the
  website.</p>
  <p>This complex protocol proves authenticity of the website and
  guarantees confidentiality of the communication between the browser
  and the website, <strong>provided that all issuers in the trusted root
  list refrain from issuing rogue certificates that link the wrong
  public key to a website domain</strong>. If not, a malicious entity
  (say a law enforcement agency in a member state) could mount a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle
  attack</a> pretending to be the actual website at domain
  <code>suspicious-forum.net</code> by sending a rogue certificate for
  that domain (that it forced one of the issuers in the member state to
  sign), thus getting hold of the encryption key used to protect the
  communication, and thus being able to eavesdrop on that communication.
  This would break the end-to-end encryption guarantee for websites, and
  would allow law enforcement to surreptitiously surveil visitors of
  websites.</p>
  <p>Security mechanisms currently implemented in browsers (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency">certificate
  transparency</a>) would detect and prevent such an abuse - but
  browsers might not be allowed to act upon it depending on how you
  would read Article 45 and 45a.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Article 45 itself has not changed since we published
  our letter. However, the following was added to Recital 32:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of
  QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure
  web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic
  in the manner and with the technology they consider most
  appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This still means that browsers have to unilaterally recognise
  certificates that satisfy the requirement specified in the annex to
  the regulation, which could be much weaker than those typically
  imposed ex ante by browsers. In practice this means that issuers of
  such certificates have to be added to the trusted root list in the
  browser, creating a less secure PKI for the web.</p>
  <p>But given the changes to recital 32 I am much less worried about
  the actual risk of breaking the end-to-end encryption for websites by
  e.g. law enforcement. In particular, with the text added to recital
  32, I believe that Article 45a.2</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>By way of derogation to paragraph 1 and only in case of
  substantiated concerns related to breaches of security or loss of
  integrity of an identified certificate or set of certificates,
  web-browsers may take precautionary measures in relation to that
  certificate or set of certificates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>allows browsers to continue to use the security mechanism (like
  certificate transparency) to detect and prevent such attacks to
  end-to-end encryption, by refusing to accept such a rogue
  certificate.</p>
  <p>Moreover, article 45a.3 requires the browser (vendor) to notify the
  competent supervisory authority in the member state <em>and</em> the
  Commission of such attacks taking place. Even though article 45a.4
  puts the sole authority to investigate and decide on the final
  withdrawal of such a certificate on the competent authority (of the
  member state whose law enforcement agency in the example above
  initiated the wilful subversion of the end-to-end encryption of the
  web), I simply cannot believe that any competent authority could claim
  there is nothing wrong and that the certificate should be reinstated:
  they would be very clearly and publicly be caught red-handed in
  subverting global web security.</p>
  <h2 id="privacy-of-the-wallet">Privacy of the wallet</h2>
  <p>Regarding the identity wallet, we were concerned about the lack of
  privacy guarantees when using it to reveal certain non-identifying
  attributes (like age) to service providers. In particular, we were
  worried that users would not be sufficiently protected against service
  providers asking for more information than necessary for offering
  their service (i.e. <em>over-authentication</em>). Also, we were
  worried that the use of the wallet and the use of the attribute
  certificates contained in it could be ‘linkable’, i.e. that visits by
  a particular user to different websites could be linked (by the issuer
  or the websites).</p>
  <p>It appears that our concerns have been addressed, somewhat.</p>
  <p>Regarding the risk of <em>over-authentication</em>, I am quite
  happy to see that the registration process of relying parties has been
  strengthened.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.4.(ba) requires that “the identity of relying parties
  can be validated by implementing authentication mechanisms in
  accordance with Article 6b”. Moreover, the attributes relying parties
  are allowed to request from wallet users must be specified upfront and
  be made “available online in electronically signed or sealed form
  suitable for automated processing” (Article 6b.1e). Wallets shall use
  this information to “implement the appropriate mechanism to inform
  that the requesting relying party or the requesting user of European
  Digital Identity Wallets have the permission to access [these
  attributes]” (Article 6a.4.(ca).</p>
  <p>Together these provide some technically enforced mechanism to
  prevent ‘over-authentication’ by relying parties.</p>
  <p>The situation regarding unlinkability is less clear. Article
  6a.4.(a).(4e) says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>European Digital Identity Wallets shall, in particular support
  common protocols and interfaces for relying parties to verify the
  authenticity and validity of European Digital Identity Wallets</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>and Article 6a.5.5a says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Member States shall provide means to revoke the validity of [a
  specific] European Digital Identity Wallet</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both requirements seem to imply that the validity of specific
  wallets can individually be checked by relying parties, which is hard
  (though not impossible, see below) to align with any unlinkability
  requirement.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.7b.(a) on the other hand says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The technical framework of the European Digital Identity Wallet
  shall not allow providers of electronic attestations of attributes or
  any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes,
  to obtain data that allows for tracking, linking, correlating or
  otherwise obtain knowledge of transactions or user behaviour unless
  explicitly authorised by the user.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that the most recent public version (i.e. version
  1.0) of the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) only allows the use
  of standardised ‘boring’ cryptographic primitives that do not allow
  the implementation of truly multi-show unlinkable attribute
  certificates (ABCs). As far as I understand, wallets work around this
  by requiring issuers to issue several one-time use certificates in one
  go. Users can use each of these only once and then throw them away.
  Clearly, this reveals the number of times you reveal a particular
  attribute to the issuer because you need to request new ones once your
  current stack in the wallet is empty. Also, issuers and relying
  parties can collude to track the use of such traditional certificates
  and link them back to you, which seems to contradict the language in
  6a.7b.(a) “shall not allow…”.</p>
  <p>Now this might all very well mean that the ARF needs to be updated
  to actually include cryptographic primitives that allow multi-show
  ABCs to be implemented. If that’s the case: hurray! To satisfy the
  requirement to verify the authenticity of wallets and to revoke
  specific wallets, so-called blacklistable credentials could be used.
  In any case, protocols to <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/epoch-revocation-journal.pdf">revoke
  ABCs in a privacy friendly fashion</a> exist.</p>
