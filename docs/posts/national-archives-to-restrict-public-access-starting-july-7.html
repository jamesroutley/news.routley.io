            <p>Effective July 7, 2025, the National Archives at College Park, MD, will become a restricted-access federal facility with access only for visitors with a legitimate business need. It will no longer be open to the general public. Security officers will enforce these restrictions, and your cooperation is appreciated.</p>

            

            <h3>Parking</h3>

            

            

            <p>Only U.S. government federal employees with valid Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and registered researchers with disability documentation may park in the Archives II garage.</p>

            <p>All NARA contractors, researchers, and other visitors with legitimate business needs must park in the PEPCO satellite parking lot. There will be a 15-minute loading/unloading zone to accommodate equipment and passenger drop-off and pick-up. Researchers will bring their equipment into the building, where it will undergo security screening. Equipment may be stored in a researcher locker or left in the lobby until the owner has moved their car to the PEPCO lot and returned to the building.</p>

            <p>All for-hire transportation services, such as Uber and Lyft, will be confined to this loading/unloading zone. Hotel shuttles and vans will be directed to discharge and pick up passengers at the Adelphi Road bus stops.</p>

            <p>If you park in an Americans with Disability Act (ADA) space without the proper disability documentation in the form of disability tags, placard, or permit, you will be ticketed and may be towed. Repeat offenders will lose their parking privileges. Security officers will thoroughly verify all ADA permits.</p>

            

            <h3>Visitor Requirements</h3>

            

            <p>All researchers must apply and present a <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/start/researcher-card">researcher card</a>, which may be obtained in Room 1000. This ensures that proper identification is on file for all individuals accessing the building to establish a legitimate business purpose. Abuse of any researcher registration to circumvent access by the general public may result in a trespass situation and a permanent ban from access to all NARA facilities.</p>

            <p>The pedestrian circle at the front of the building will be permanently closed to vehicle traffic. Registered researchers will be allowed to load and unload equipment at the designated 15-minute drop-off and pick-up zone.</p>

            

            <h3>Bus Services</h3>

            

            <p>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) bus will cease operations on June 30, 2025. The Prince George’s County bus will not be authorized to enter NARA&#39;s roadway, bus stop, or the pedestrian circle. Passengers must use the designated bus stops on Adelphi Road for drop-off and pick-up. The NARA shuttle bus schedule will remain the same; however, drop-off will take place in the 15-minute loading/unloading zone, and pick-up will take place in the bus shelter.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your understanding and support of these changes to ensure the security and safety of all building occupants.</p>

            

            <h3>Hours</h3>
