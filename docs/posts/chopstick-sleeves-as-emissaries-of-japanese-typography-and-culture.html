<h4>From Rarified to Commonplace:  A Brief History of Hashibukuro</h4>

<p>The chopstick sleeve originated in the Imperial Court of Japan sometime during the Heian period (8th–12th century). Ladies-in-waiting are thought to have wrapped chopsticks in scraps of silk or other fine fabrics as it was considered impolite to pass unwrapped objects from one hand to another. Hundreds of years later, <i>hashibukuro</i> (“chopstick envelopes”) graced the banquet tables of shoguns, and by the Edo period (17th–19th century), establishments in the <i>Yoshiwara</i> red light district furnished <i>hashibukuro</i> to their regulars. </p>                </div>

<p>Paper chopstick sleeves emerged at the turn of the 20th century when disposable chopsticks and packaged meals gained popularity with the advent of train travel. In addition to ensuring cleanliness, printed paper chopstick sleeves became vernacular advertisements for shops and restaurants. </p>



<p>The latest addition to the Archive’s holdings of Asian ephemera is the <em>hashibukuro</em> collection of Mr. Susumu Kitagawa of Fuji City, Japan. While individually modest in their design and messaging, when considered as a whole the sleeves that comprise this collection map a singular history of Japanese ideology and aesthetics.</p>



<h4 id="h-national-identity-origami-and-mount-fuji"><strong>National Identity: <em>Origami</em> and Mount Fuji</strong></h4>



<p>There is perhaps nothing more emblematic of Japan than Mount Fuji. The highest peak in the country, <em>Fujisan</em> has been venerated in Japanese art and literature for a millennium. Frequent eruptions in the 8th and 9th century prompted the Japanese to deify the volcano as<em> Asama no Okami</em>, a great mountain god capable of breathing fire. It is considered sacred in both Shinto and Japanese Buddhist traditions, and the Japanese have made pilgrimages up the mountain for centuries. </p>



<p>A more modest but equally popular expression of Japanese culture is <em>origami </em>(“folding paper”). Its origin is ceremonial: during the 7th century folded paper was used in Shinto rituals and to decorate shrines. Recreational <em>origami</em> emerged in the 1600s as paper became more affordable and was no longer reserved for specialized purposes. </p>

<p>A chopstick sleeve for a restaurant in Fujinomiya, a city built on the slopes of the iconic mountain, features a pattern of miniature Mount Fujis. <em>Origami</em> folding instructions on the back illustrate how the sleeve can be transformed into a chopstick rest (<em>hashioki</em>) in the likeness of the beloved, snow-capped <em>Fujisan</em>.</p>

<p>Three crabs beckon a passing train with placards and a Japanese flag on the front of this charming sleeve. Their signs bear the characters 米吾 (“<em>Komego</em>”), the name of an <em>ekiben</em> vendor located near the railway station in the coastal city of Yonago.</p>



<p><em>Ekiben</em> are particular kinds of<em> </em>boxed meals available at train stations and along platforms where they are sometimes sold to passengers through open windows. A portmanteau of <em>eki</em> (“railway station”) and <em>bento</em> (“boxed meal”), <em>ekiben</em> first appeared during the Meiji period (1868–1912.<sup data-fn="13a1ebc4-6e12-45b7-aa59-1067067f5929"><a id="13a1ebc4-6e12-45b7-aa59-1067067f5929-link" href="#13a1ebc4-6e12-45b7-aa59-1067067f5929">1</a></sup> when train travel became possible — and with it, the demand for portable meals.</p>

Located in Sapporo City, Japan. Established in 1899.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time many train stations became famous for <em>ekiben</em> that reflected the local cuisine. (<em>Komego </em>is known for its <em>gozaemonzushi,</em> a mackerel sushi inspired by the lunches local boatmen ate as they sailed the rough waters of the Sea of Japan.) The chopstick sleeve for <em>ekiben</em> shop Sapporo Station Standing Sales Company (札幌駅立売商会) features an illustration of a steam engine stretching along the length of the sleeve, giving no indication that its speciality is <em>yanagimochi</em>, a soft rice cake made from Hokkaido’s glutinous rice and wrapped in sweet red bean paste. The shop opened in 1899 and its website still showcases a photo of a steam locomotive in front of the original Sapporo station — a curious structure built in what is known as the Japanese-Western Eclectic Architecture style.</p>

Established in 1926.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The impulse to fuse Japanese and Western elements came to signal modernization. The sleeve for <em>Numazuken</em> (沼津軒) — a department store located opposite the Numazuken train station — advertises a restaurant that serves Western, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine. Its “mascot knight” is modeled after the Jack of Spades; the fanciful vehicle behind him seems equal parts palanquin and horse-drawn carriage. The letterforms are a cross-pollination of East and West: the strokes comprising the capital “R” mimic the brushwork of Asian calligraphy; the bold <em>kanji</em> characters with their upright rigidity, sharp angles, and blunt terminals evoke the heavy, geometric sans-serif fonts of the West.</p>

<h4 id="h-breaking-bread-sumo-stew-and-kettle-rice"><strong>Breaking Bread: “Sumo Stew” and Kettle Rice</strong></h4>



<p>In Western culture, the act of breaking bread is a traditional symbol of fostering community. (The word <em>companion</em> is formed from the Latin <em>com-</em> “with” and <em>panis</em> “bread” — literally one with whom you share your bread.<sup data-fn="6f2eaeac-5494-4e00-9065-463b4bf018a8"><a id="6f2eaeac-5494-4e00-9065-463b4bf018a8-link" href="#6f2eaeac-5494-4e00-9065-463b4bf018a8">2</a></sup>) In Japan, where bread has historically held less cultural significance, community is instead created through the sharing of rice and noodles.</p>



<p><em>Chankonabe</em>, also known as “<em>sumo</em> stew,” is a type of one-pot dish eaten in <em>sumo</em> stables where wrestlers live and train. This robust stew is replete with vegetables and proteins such as tofu, fish, and chicken cooked in broth. (Meat from four-legged animals was historically avoided since to “touch the ground on all fours” was to lose the match.) The word <em>chanko</em> is likely a compound of <em>chan</em> (“parent”) and <em>ko</em> (“child”), alluding to the ritual of coaches and trainees gathering to share a meal from the same pot.</p>



<p>The chopstick sleeve for <em>Chanko Edozawa</em> (ちゃんこ江戶沢) — located in the Ryōgoku neighborhood of Tokyo — the center of the <em>sumo</em> wrestling world — simply reads “<em>Edozawa</em>” in a calligraphic script. A brushwork caricature of a <em>sumo</em> wrestler with one leg raised high in the <em>shiko</em> position is the only hint that <em>Edozawa</em> is a <em>chanko</em> restaurant.</p>

Kamameshi</em>, or “kettle rice,” is a Japanese rice dish traditionally cooked in — and eaten out of — an iron pot. It is said to have originated in 1923 in the immediate aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake: the shopkeeper of <em>Kamameshi Haru</em> in Asakusa took inspiration from the distributed rice that was cooked and eaten communally and began selling “kettle rice.” Today most pots are sized for an individual serving, but the rice is still eaten directly from the pot and is meant to be shared.</p>



<h4 id="h-onnade-女手-women-s-script"><strong>Onnade</strong> (女手)<strong>: Women’s Script</strong></h4>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The frost on</em></p>



<p><em>—</em>Minamoto no Sanetomo</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the Japanese established their writing system around 1600 years ago they adopted Chinese characters — <em>kanji</em>, literally Han characters — for both meaning and sound. <em>Kanji</em> was used in official correspondence and recordkeeping, and its use was largely reserved for men from the ruling class. </p>



<p>Chinese characters are logograms — each sign represents a complete word — and did not prove to be an efficient system for expressing a syllabic language like Japanese. (It is time-consuming to write every syllable in <em>kanji</em> which tends to have many strokes.) <em>Kanji</em> was gradually simplified into a cursive script, and by the Heian period (794–1185) had evolved into an independent phonetic syllabary called <em>kana</em>.</p>







<p>While many noblewomen knew how to read <em>kanji,</em> they were not allowed to engage in official duties or to freely use <em>kanji</em> for personal pursuits. Women quickly adopted the simpler and less formal script, using <em>kana</em> to express themselves in diaries and letters and, for the first time, publish literary works. <em>Kana</em> thus gave Japanese women a written voice and came to be known as <em>onnade</em> (女手), or “women&#39;s writing.”</p>



<p><em>Hana ni koboruru</em> (花にこぼるる), a brand of <em>sake,</em> is written in a whimsical script on a chopstick sleeve for a Japanese inn. The calligraphy is the work of Machi Shunsō, a renowned female calligrapher who studied <em>kana</em> calligraphy of the Heian period. The stroke weight is delicate — <em>kana</em> is typically written with a small brush — and the characters are organically spaced as they flow down the sleeve.</p>







<p><em>Hana ni koboruru</em> (“spilling onto flowers”) is the last line of a poem written by Minamoto no Sanetomo, the third Shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate. In this poem Sanetomo observes how frost that has formed on plum trees melts and falls onto the blossoms — a poignant analogy for the the passage of time. (And perhaps also, from the brewer’s perspective, for the pouring of <em>sake.</em>)</p>



<h4 id="h-flower-storms-finding-beauty-in-the-ephemeral"><strong>Flower Storms: Finding Beauty in the Ephemeral</strong></h4>



<p>Machi Shunsō also created the calligraphic wordmark for <em>Hanafubuki </em>(花吹雪), the inn that produces <em>Hana ni koboruru </em>rice wine. The name <em>Hanafubuki </em>(literally, “flower storm”) alludes to the spectacle of windswept petals scattering like snowflakes — a symbol of life’s evanescence. </p>



<p>The very things that remind us of life’s transience can also heighten our awareness of its beauty. (This idea is encapsulated by the Japanese idiom <em>mono no aware,</em> or “a sensitivity to the ephemeral.”) Perhaps this is one of the reasons we save ephemera: to revel in the beauty of the fleeting, even as we seek to preserve it.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that single-use chopsticks are temporal by design, Mr. Kitagawa nonetheless succeeded in amassing over 800 chopstick sleeves from the 1970s through the 2000s. (The bulk of his collection is now housed at the Archive thanks to his granddaughter Taiyo’s donation.) What were once disposable have become unintentional repositories of information; of entwined histories of people, places, and Japanese culture.</p>



<p>Personal collections of ephemera such as this make Letterform Archive a singular resource: rare books and type specimens live in the stacks alongside punk flyers and chopstick sleeves. Few arts and cultural institutions treat both valuable and everyday objects with equal reverence. At the Archive, ephemera are no longer quite so ephemeral.</p>

Right: Susumu and Eiko Kitagawa on a company outing with Fujikyu—also known as FujiQ—a private railway company, ca. 1960s.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Susumu Kitagawa was born in Fuji, a city overlooking Suruga Bay and famous for its views of Mount Fuji. Mr. Kitagawa graduated from high school during World War II and was immediately deployed to China. He survived the war — and imprisonment in a Siberian labor camp—and returned home to work for Fujikyu, a private railway company that operated the train line closest to Mount Fuji.</p>



<p>Mr. Kitagawa traveled across Japan in his work for the Fujikyu tourism division. He fastidiously documented his trips with both written diaries and photographs that he carefully dated, captioned, and assembled into albums. (He would eventually compile over 175 photo albums, all prominently on display in his living room.) An archivist at heart, Mr. Kitagawa also collected <em>sake</em> cups and chopstick sleeves during his travels.</p>

<p>When asked what his collection — or the process of collecting — might have meant to her grandfather, Taiyo Kitagawa speculated that her grandfather’s habit of documenting and collecting may have been related to his experiences in the war. “He rarely talked about it, but I know it left an imprint on him,” she wrote. “He was trained to run into vehicles with explosives strapped onto his body but fortunately missed a battle by days. He was then captured and became a prisoner of war.”</p>



<p>A desire to extend the life of objects may also have compelled Mr. Kitagawa. <em>Mottainai</em> is a Japanese adage expressing regret that “something is being discarded needlessly”<sup data-fn="634a3de0-09cf-4edb-bb64-6161c925d385"><a id="634a3de0-09cf-4edb-bb64-6161c925d385-link" href="#634a3de0-09cf-4edb-bb64-6161c925d385">3</a></sup> — a familiar impulse for the generation of Japanese who lived through the deprivations of war. Taiyo recalls, “We probably used the same Christmas wrapping paper and ribbons for at least a decade. My grandfather would lecture me if I left even one single grain of rice in my bowl — every grain takes a year to grow and one must not waste it.”</p>
