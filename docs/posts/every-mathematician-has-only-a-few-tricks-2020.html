    <h1>Every mathematician has only a few tricks (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>From a physicist point of view I want to mention this trick and its generalization for operators:</p>
<pre><code>      &#34;Two commuting matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>(for physicists all matrices are diagonalizable). Of course the idea is that if you know the eigenvectors of one matrix/operator then diagonalizing the other one is much easier. Here are some applications.</p>
<p>1)The system is translation invariant : Because the eigenvectors of the translation operator are <span>$e^{ik.x}$</span>, then one should use the Fourier transform.  It solves all the wave equations for light, acoustics, of free quantum electrons or the heat equation in homogeneous media.</p>
<p>2)The system has a discrete translation symmetry: The typical system is the atoms in a solid state that form a crystal. We have a discrete translation operator <span>$T_a\phi(x)=\phi(x+a)$</span> with <span>$a$</span> the size of the lattice and then we should try <span>$\phi_k(x+a)=e^{ik.a}\phi_k(x)$</span> as it is an eigenvector of <span>$T_a$</span>. This gives the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch%27s_theorem" rel="noreferrer">Bloch</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floquet_theory" rel="noreferrer">Floquet</a> theory where the spectrum is divided into band structure. It is one of the most famous model of condensed matter as it explains the different between conductors or insulators.</p>
<p>3)The system is rotational invariant: One should then use and diagonalize the rotation operator first. This will allow us to find the eigenvalue/eigenvectors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom" rel="noreferrer">Hydrogen atom</a>. By the way we notice the eigenspace of the Hydrogen are stable by rotation and are therefore finite dimension representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span>. The irreducible representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span> have dimension 1,3,5,... and they appears, considering also the spin of the electron, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell" rel="noreferrer">columns</a> of the periodic table of the elements (2,6,10,14,...).</p>
<p>4)<span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry: Particle physics is extremely complicated. However physicists have discovered that there is an underlying <span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry. Then considering the representations of <span>$SU(3)$</span> the zoology of particles seems much more organized (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#/media/File:Baryon-decuplet.svg" rel="noreferrer">A</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson#/media/File:Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg" rel="noreferrer">B</a>).</p>
