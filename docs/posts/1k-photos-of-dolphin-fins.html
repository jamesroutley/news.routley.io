The photographs tell of a violent and brutal life that differs from the idyllic existence we probably imagine when thinking of these delightful mammals. </p><p>Scars, scratches and wounds abound in these photos as encounters with unknown creatures and boat propellers leave their marks, imprinting a story of close escapes and cheating death. Some fins are pierced with radio trackers, and others have numbers inscribed into the dolphin&#39;s skin by researchers for identification purposes.  </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS075_SMR283_2018Jan11_KAW_0753.JPG" width="727" height="500" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/PS075_SMR283_2018Jan11_KAW_0753.JPG 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS075_SMR283_2018Jan11_KAW_0753.JPG 727w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS458_PS1361_2016Apr25_AMG_0466.JPG" width="2000" height="1358" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/PS458_PS1361_2016Apr25_AMG_0466.JPG 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/PS458_PS1361_2016Apr25_AMG_0466.JPG 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/PS458_PS1361_2016Apr25_AMG_0466.JPG 1600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/04/PS458_PS1361_2016Apr25_AMG_0466.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS700_12_Dec_2006_AMG_0479.JPG" width="882" height="781" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/PS700_12_Dec_2006_AMG_0479.JPG 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS700_12_Dec_2006_AMG_0479.JPG 882w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/SNC0019_SMR184_2018Jan25_KAW_0289.JPG" width="1328" height="966" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/SNC0019_SMR184_2018Jan25_KAW_0289.JPG 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/SNC0019_SMR184_2018Jan25_KAW_0289.JPG 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/SNC0019_SMR184_2018Jan25_KAW_0289.JPG 1328w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption>Some of the fins carrying scars of past encounters.

They are unique enough to form a sort of fingerprint that can be used to identify distinct dolphins, allowing researchers to track their movements over time. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC),</a> based in Miami, Florida is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with a mission to provide “...the scientific advice and data needed to effectively manage the living marine resources of the Southeast region and Atlantic high seas”. The <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/67350?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">research project</a> that involved this data collection was conducted by the SEFSC’s Beaufort, NC facility, which is the second-oldest federal marine laboratory (Woods Hole in MA is the oldest). </p><p>The goal of the research project was to provide an updated count of the number of common bottlenose dolphins along the southern coast and estuarine area of North Carolina. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-18?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">US Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)</a> is a law that protects all marine mammals which defines large observed migratory populations into 61 distinct “stocks” and corresponding management zones in U.S. waters. The common bottlenose dolphins that were observed from this study occupy two overlapping stocks – the Northern North Carolina Estuarine System Stock and the Southern North Carolina Estuarine System Stock.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.11.28-AM.png" alt="A screenshot from a figure in the research paper showing the NC coastline where the 2018 survey occurred." loading="lazy" width="1802" height="1222" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.11.28-AM.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.11.28-AM.png 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.11.28-AM.png 1600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.11.28-AM.png 1802w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The area surveyed in the January 2018 research mission.

The good news is that this study found the estimated population to be three times higher than the previous estimate from 2006. </p><p>After the data collection, the photographs were analyzed to identify individual dolphins. Turns out there is an app for that: <a href="https://github.com/haimeh/finFindR?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">FinFindR</a>, which is a code library “for doing photo recognition on dolphins, sharks etc.” </p><p>The fin images contain a lot of information. The fins’ shape, color variations, notches, scars and “tooth rakes” all help to distinguish an individual. The Beaufort lab had been compiling photos of these fins since 1995, in a catalog of 2,423 individual dolphins.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/PS1882_SMR058_2018Jan08_AMG_1542.JPG" alt="A photo of Dolphin SMR058&#39;s fin showing curved scars deep in the flesh, and water splashing.

In the U.S., this well-studied intelligent species can be found all throughout the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean as well as along the Pacific coast from Washington to California. Measuring from six to thirteen feet and weighing up to 1,400 lbs, these dolphins can be seen in open ocean, near the coastline or in estuaries, bays and harbors.</p><p>The bottlenose’s close proximity to human beings creates one of its greatest threats. Becoming entrapped in fishing gear is one of the major threats affecting the populations of bottlenose around the world, as well as contamination from industrial pollution and harmful algae blooms.  </p><p>In five of the population stocks along the Atlantic coast, bottlenose populations are classified as “<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/laws-and-policies/glossary-marine-mammal-protection-act?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com#strategic-and-depleted-stocks">depleted</a>”.</p><p>In addition to simply counting and identifying the dolphins, the researchers set out to understand the social networks that the dolphins adhered to. </p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-10-at-2.09.09-AM.png" alt="A screenshot of a figure from the research paper showing a network diagram made up of three main clusters of dolphins.
