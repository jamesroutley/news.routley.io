    <h1>Reverse engineering Wordle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>You&#39;ve probably seen a lot of your friends share their Wordle emoji grids these past few weeks. It&#39;s a game, akin to Mastermind, that has gone viral for its simplicity yet challenge. I was curious how the game worked so I decided to pick apart the source code and see what it was doing. Read on to learn about how I was able to reverse engineer the algorithm and get the right answer on the first try, every time.</p> <p><img src="https://reichel.dev/assets/images/blog/reverse-engineering-wordle/one-try.jpeg" alt="Wordle success in one try"/></p> <h2 id="looking-for-network-requests"><a href="#looking-for-network-requests">#</a> Looking for Network Requests</h2> <p>The first thing I did was fire up the browser dev tools and watch the network requests. My default assumption was that there was a central server that the UI would interact with to submit answers to the word of the day. I clicked through and submitted a guess and, to my surprise, I didn&#39;t see any network requests. This meant that the word of the day was either embedded in the original page load or derived some other way.</p> <h2 id="looking-at-the-source"><a href="#looking-at-the-source">#</a> Looking at the source</h2> <p>I hopped over to Chrome&#39;s sources view and searched for the current word of the day <code>gorge</code>. I had one hit: <code>gorge</code> was in a static array that stored 2,315 words. So this was the wordlist itself! Now, we know which words are in the wordlist and which are not. The wordlist was assigned to a variable name that was a bit cryptic - <code>La</code>. It seems like many of the variables are given names that are not descriptive at all to make it a bit more difficult to read.</p> <p>So at this point I knew the following:</p> <ol><li>Wordle doesn&#39;t make any web requests when verifying your answer - Everything is client-side.</li> <li>The word of the day doesn&#39;t get embedded in page load - It&#39;s derived from the wordlist somehow.</li></ol> <p>The next step was looking for references to the <code>La</code> variable, which I&#39;ll refer to as the <code>wordlist</code> variable going forward. The great news is there was only one function that used the wordlist. This function was equally ambiguously named <code>Da()</code>.</p> <p>This function does a few things: It calls another generic function <code>Ga()</code> with a parameter then takes the result of that and uses it to index into the wordlist. So now we need to figure out two things:</p> <ol><li>What does <code>Ga()</code> do?</li> <li>What parameter does Da take?</li></ol> <p>We&#39;ll investigate <code>Ga</code> first. Conveniently, <code>Ga()</code> was immediately below <code>Da()</code>.</p> <p>Fun! Yet another function and a new mystery variable, <code>Ha</code>. After some searching again, I found <code>Ha</code> is assigned to a static date.</p> <p>My assumption is that this is the launch date for Wordle. Now turning our attention to Na, I searched yet again and found it.</p> <p>Woohoo! No more nested ambiguity! This function calculates the number of days between two dates provided to it and rounds to a whole integer. Now we know that Wordle is using <code>Ha</code> to calculate the days between the dates. Now that we know the whole call chain of <code>Ga()</code>, we can circle back to figure out what parameter <code>Da()</code> takes.</p> <p>With just one more quick search, I was able to quickly find that <code>Da</code> was being passed a parameter that was likely a date type, and the result of Da was being assigned to the <code>solution</code> property.</p> <p>How is <code>e</code> assigned?</p> <h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a href="#putting-it-all-together">#</a> Putting it all together</h2> <p>At this point, we&#39;ve done enough digging to know how Wordle is choosing the word of the day. We know that Wordle uses a client-side date-based algorithm to determine which word to use from a static wordlist. Each day is predictable so long as we have all of the code pieced together</p> <p>So what is tomorrow&#39;s word?</p> <p><code>query</code></p> <h2 id="try-it-out"><a href="#try-it-out">#</a> Try it out</h2> </div></div>
