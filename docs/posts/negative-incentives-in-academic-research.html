    <h1>Negative incentives in academic research</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>&gt; We have entered a ‘dark age’ where we are mostly stagnant. It is not that there is no progress per se, but progress is slow, uncommon and expensive. Why might that be?</p>
<p>It might also be the case that humankind has already plucked most of the lower hanging fruits in research, i.e., big questions with huge impact that are nevertheless solvable by the insights of one person or a small group. To reach the higher hanging fruits, everyone is getting more and more specialized and hence the problems we are thinking about are also more and more specialized. In contrast, earlier in this century, at least in STEM, the field was still relatively small, and people like J von Neumann had the possibility of being true experts in multiple disciplines.</p>
