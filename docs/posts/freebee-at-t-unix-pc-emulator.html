    <h1>FreeBee: AT&amp;T Unix PC emulator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>
I&#39;m developing an emulator for the AT&amp;T UNIX PC. Currently it can boot the 3B1 UNIX operating system and run acceptably.
</p>

</p>

<p>
There are some documents and other items here which may be useful to 3B1 owners.
</p>

<p>
The emulator currently boots 3B1 UNIX, and thanks to the hard efforts of many people, can run a wide variety of software (including, thanks to Jesse, the C compiler and MGR windowing system!).
</p>

<p>
The serial ports, printer port and modem are not currently emulated. I&#39;m currently looking for a good way to create a “virtual” serial port device on Linux, Windows and Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X.

<p>
The 3B1 emulator would not be possible without the generous donation of two AT&amp;T UNIX PC systems and software disks by <a href="http://www.tenox.net/" title="http://www.tenox.net/" rel="ugc nofollow">Antoni Sawicki</a>.
</p>

<p>
Andrew Warkentin has contributed many significant patches which improve the quality of the emulation and allow UNIX to be booted inside the emulator.
</p>

<p>
Jesse Booth put in a lot of time debugging and fixing the long-standing “PAGEIN” bug which prevented the C compiler from being used. Jesse also added support for the VIDPAL video PAL, and ImageDisk disk format support.

These are fitted at board locations 14C and 15C, and carry part numbers 72-00616 and 72-00617 respectively.
