    <h1>L.A. Judge Rules LGBT Corporate Diversity Law Unconstitutional</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A landmark law in California that mandated corporations to have board members from &#34;underrepresented communities&#34; has been ruled as unconstitutional by a Los Angeles judge.</p><p>On September 30, 2020, Governor <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom" data-sys="1">Gavin Newsom</a> signed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB979">into law Senate Bill (SB) 979</a> requiring publicly held corporations in California to push for diversity on their boards of directors by January 2023.</p><p>The measures came into force last year and gave firms with a main executive office in California until December 31, 2021 to have a member on their boards from groups including LGBT, Black, Latino, Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.</p><p>But Friday&#39;s decision followed an argument from conservative legal group Judicial Watch that the law had violated the state&#39;s constitutional equal protection clause.</p><p>Judicial Watch had sought a permanent injunction against the legislation, which also required firms with between four and nine directors to have at least two board members from underrepresented groups by the end of 2022.</p><p>Those with nine or more directors required at least three members from such groups and non compliance could result in fines of between $100,000 and $300,000.</p><p>However, no companies have been fined and the state said that no tax dollars had been spent to enforce the law, <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judge-rules-california-diversity-law-unconstitutional-83825479#:~:text=LOS%20ANGELES%20--%20A%20Los%20Angeles%20judge%20ruled,certain%20racial%2C%20ethnic%20or%20LGBT%20groups%20is%20unconstitutional." target="_blank">the Associated Press reported.</a></p>

</figure><p>But Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement that the judge&#39;s decision &#34;declared unconstitutional one of the most blatant and significant attacks in the modern era on constitutional prohibitions against discrimination,&#34; according to the AP.</p><p>Around 300 out of 700 corporations had complied with the law, although half of the corporations have not filed the required disclosure statement, according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bpd.cdn.sos.ca.gov/div-on-boards/dob-report-2022.pdf">Diversity on Boards state report</a> last month.</p><p>Supporters of the legislation had argued that their case for greater inclusion on boards had been bolstered by the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately affecting minorities.</p><p>The unrest after the killing of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/george-floyd" data-sys="1">George Floyd</a> in the custody of Minneapolis police also focused minds on the importance of the legislation.</p><p>After it was signed into law, the bill&#39;s co-author, Assemblyman Chris Holden (D-Pasadena), <a rel="nofollow" href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-chris-holden-legislation-racial-injustice-60eab0f0c722c65802050179c23dd3c5">said it </a>&#34;represents a big step forward for racial equity.&#34;</p><p>He also described it as a &#34;win-win as ethnically diverse boards have shown to outperform those that lack diversity.&#34;</p><p>The law had been expected to face legal challenges from conservatives who said it was a discriminatory quota. There is also a related legal challenge by Judicial Watch to a 2018 requiring a woman director on corporate boards.</p><p>Newsweek has contacted Governor Newsom&#39;s office and Judicial Watch for comment.</p><figure><div><picture width="790" height="445"><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.webp?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.jpg?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.webp?w=900&amp;f=757655846aa54ee7b09169b740f09fc0 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.jpg?w=900&amp;f=757655846aa54ee7b09169b740f09fc0 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 481px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.webp?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 481px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.jpg?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab 1x"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.webp?w=450&amp;f=b08f4d99d50f3f51b390ae1041f8d53f 1x"/><source type="image/jpeg" media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.jpg?w=450&amp;f=b08f4d99d50f3f51b390ae1041f8d53f 1x"/><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.webp?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab"/><img loading="lazy" id="i2013747" src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2013747/stock-image-board-room.jpg?w=790&amp;f=2affbfabdff030356eff183b3026cbab" alt="Stock image of board room" width="790" height="445"/></picture></div><figcaption>
