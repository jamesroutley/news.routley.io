So I had no reason to think it wasn&#39;t,&#34; Gaudreau said.</p><p dir="ltr">When Gaudreau phoned the number, he was asked for his Facebook username, the email address linked to his account, and his phone number, which he gave to the woman on the other end of the line. </p><p dir="ltr">She then opened his Facebook account.</p><p dir="ltr">That&#39;s when the call took a turn, said Gaudreau.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;She was trying to tell me that we were being hacked, that our IP address was hacked and that they were watching every keystroke,&#34; he recalled.</p><p dir="ltr">The woman said she would clear the hackers out, but he had to give her access to his phone through an app she had him download.</p><p dir="ltr">But during the phone call, he says someone also accessed his PayPal account and used it to buy a $500 Apple gift card, on a monthly renewal.</p><p dir="ltr">The person on the call also tried to buy bitcoin, Gaudreau said, but thankfully his bank refused that attempted purchase. </p><p dir="ltr">His wife caught on first. </p><p dir="ltr">&#34;She said, &#39;Hang up on them.… This is a scam,&#39;&#34; Gaudreau said, adding he still thought there was someone from Meta on the phone, because they were able to open his Facebook account.  </p><p dir="ltr">&#34;But I did hang up on them. And then we proceeded to call our bank and the internet provider and everybody else,&#34; he said.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | How Gaudreau got caught in the scam:</strong></em></p><p><span><div><div title="How AI lured this man into a phone scam" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="How AI lured this man into a phone scam"><div><p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/ais/acc03493-a4ec-44b4-a789-a862d4cdbc04,1717102571267/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1919%2C1079%29%3BResize%3D%28620%29" srcset="" alt="" loading="lazy"/></p></div><div><div><h3>How AI lured this man into a phone scam</h3></div></div></div></div></div></div><span>Winnipeg&#39;s Dave Gaudreau called a phone number he thought was for Facebook customer service, after checking it in a search through Facebook Messenger&#39;s AI tool  — but ended up on a call with a scammer.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr">Gaudreau cancelled credit cards and locked his bank accounts.
