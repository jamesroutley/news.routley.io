    <figcaption>These Landsat 7 images showcase the first and last captures of the Las Vegas area, taken on July 4, 1999, and May 28, 2024, respectively. The images highlight the city, the surrounding desert landscape, and Lake Mead, using shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to emphasize differences in vegetation, water, and urban growth. The final image, marking the satellite’s 25th anniversary, stands as a tribute to Landsat 7&#39;s quarter-century legacy of Earth observation.</figcaption>

<p>While Landsat 7’s long watch over Earth comes to an end, Landsat 8, launched in 2013, and Landsat 9, launched in 2020, continue to work together to create a complete snapshot of Earth every eight days. Their successor—Landsat Next—is currently planned to launch in the early 2030s and provide even greater coverage and detail.</p><p>Launched in 1999 as a joint mission of the USGS and NASA, Landsat 7 significantly enhanced Earth observations and provided a key part of the Landsat program’s five decade-plus record of imaging the planet’s surface. The satellite&#39;s imagery will remain <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">archived</a> at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center, continuing to support scientific discovery and decision-making for the future.</p><p>“The Landsat satellites have delivered over 50 years of extraordinary science data, economic value and national security benefits by informing decisions in every sector of the economy—from monitoring drought in the West to guiding disaster recovery,” said <strong>Sarah Ryker, USGS Acting Director</strong>. “For 25 of those years, Landsat 7’s data helped farmers, land managers, city planners, and scientists, as well as communities around the world better understand and manage land, water, and other natural resources.”</p><p>Landsat 7 achieved many milestones over its 25 years of operation and was the first Landsat to downlink data to the newly established USGS ground station in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It was also the first Landsat satellite to be fully operated 24/7 by the USGS after being launched by NASA. </p><p>Its Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor delivered improved high-resolution imagery that expanded its capabilities, capturing critical historical events such as the aftermath of 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The satellite also contributed to important projects, including the <a href="https://lima.usgs.gov/">Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica</a>, and inspired the &#34;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/earth-art">Earth As Art</a>&#34; collection, showcasing stunning visuals of the planet. </p><p>After ending its official mission in 2024, the USGS prepared Landsat 7 for decommissioning to follow responsible space practices and U.S. policies on keeping space clear of debris. The final steps included carefully lowering the satellite&#39;s orbit to decrease the risk of collisions and ensuring that all energy sources, such as fuel and batteries, are depleted to prevent the satellite from accidentally turning back on or creating debris. As Landsat 7 begins this decommissioned phase, it will drift silently in orbit for about 55 years before reentering Earth’s atmosphere. </p><p>To learn more about Landsat 7’s distinguished mission, visit: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/news/a-final-farewell-landsat-7">A Final Farewell to Landsat 7 | U.S. Geological Survey</a>.</p></div></div>
