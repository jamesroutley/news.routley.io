    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <main> <div data-color="bg-beige"><div><svelte-scroller-outer><svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container> <svelte-scroller-foreground><div slot="foreground"><section><p>In Mario Kart 8, choosing your driver, kart&#39;s body, tires, and glider isn&#39;t just
                    about style — it&#39;s as crucial as your racing skills to win a race. Ever
                    wondered how to truly find the best ones?</p></section> <section><p>For each of those four elements, you have tens of options. For each option,
                    there are distinct statistics (speed, acceleration, ...) affecting your
                    performance.</p></section> <section><p>This adds up to an unbelievable amount of builds to choose from.</p></section> <section><p>Hopefully, many choices are just stylistic — they have identical
                    statistics — but even after ignoring those duplicates, it remains a tough
                    job to navigate the thousands of options.</p></section> <section><p>Is there any chance to find the <span data-svelte-h="svelte-i741sf">best</span> build or is it
                    just luck? Should you favor <i data-svelte-h="svelte-nndadd">speed</i> to be the fastest, or
                    <i data-svelte-h="svelte-b95v2w">acceleration</i>
                    to quickly recover after taking a hit? Let me show you a solution proposed over a
                    century ago by economist Vilfredo Pareto.</p></section></div></svelte-scroller-foreground></svelte-scroller-outer></div></div> <div data-color="bg-blue-800"><div><svelte-scroller-outer><svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container> <svelte-scroller-foreground><div slot="foreground"><section><p>Finding the fastest driver is as simple as ranking them by their <i data-svelte-h="svelte-nndadd">speed</i>
                    statistic. Here you might think that

                    speed
                    to find the optimal build. You have to consider
                    one as well. Now, finding the best
                    
                    is not trivial anymore — you have to make trade-offs between

                    
                    and
                     </p></section> <section><p>Look closely though! You&#39;ll find out that some options are always <i data-svelte-h="svelte-sv5bxj">dominated</i>. Let&#39;s focus on this poor

                    on both <i data-svelte-h="svelte-nndadd">speed</i> and <i data-svelte-h="svelte-b95v2w">acceleration</i>. Together, they form what is called
                    the <i data-svelte-h="svelte-az7ies">Pareto front</i> (or frontier).</p></section> <section><p>Mind you: all elements on the frontier are not equally good. You probably won&#39;t
                    pick a driver sitting on the edge of the frontier because you want some balance
                    between <i data-svelte-h="svelte-nndadd">speed</i> and <i data-svelte-h="svelte-b95v2w">acceleration</i>. The Pareto <i data-svelte-h="svelte-17tvgv7">efficiency</i> is an
                    objective criteria to filter out suboptimal choices, but you still need to make up
                    your final decision.</p></section> <section><div><p>Given your play style and skills, you may put more
                    <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1spn57m">weight</span> on one statistic over
                    the other. Those preferences will reveal the component on the frontier that
                    suits you the best.

            In the next section, I&#39;ll display every build as a distinct point. It will however make
            the number of choices explode. But Pareto&#39;s with us!</p></div> <div data-color="bg-blue-800"><div><svelte-scroller-outer><svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container> <svelte-scroller-foreground><div slot="foreground"><section><div><p>585 builds with unique <i>speed</i> and <i>acceleration</i> properties are
                        available — tough decision for a player to make. But we can apply the
                        same method as before. See, the
                        <span>Pareto front</span>
                        — in yellow — narrows it down to 14 efficient options!</p></div></section> <section><div><p>Now, if you&#39;re a skilled player, you need a build that optimizes more than
                        just
                        
                        and
                        . There is a third crucial statistic: the
                        <i>mini turbo</i> that provides a speed boost after drifting.</p></div></section>  <section><div><p>Good news: the Pareto frontier concept can be generalized to more than two
                        dimensions. See, I added the <i>mini turbo</i> as a third one!</p></div></section> <section><div><p>Sadly, it comes at a cost. As a rule of thumb, the size of the Pareto front
                        expands exponentially with the number of (potentialy infinite) dimensions,
                        making your choice harder.</p></div></section> <section><div><p>As in the 2D case, you have to put weights on each dimensions to reveal the
                        optimal build. Open the dialogue below and find the best build for you!

                        cloud glider. Unsurprisingly, the build sits right on our frontier when
                        optimizing
                        <i>speed</i>, <i>acceleration</i>, and <i>mini turbo</i>.</p></div></section></div></svelte-scroller-foreground></svelte-scroller-outer></div></div> <div data-color="bg-beige" data-svelte-h="svelte-2qog0n"><p>We&#39;ve had a bit of fun here, but don&#39;t you see the pattern? We&#39;re often faced with
            similar trade-offs. You want a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodle_soup" target="_blank">meal that&#39;s both cheap and delicious</a>? A job that&#39;s both well-paid, easy, and fulfilling?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory" target="_blank">A portfolio with low risks and high returns</a>? A flexible and strong material that&#39;s also easy to produce?
            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/38/2/175/1527903">A fair taxation that remains efficient</a>
            ?
            <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/#summary">A high quality LLM that is also fast and cost-efficient</a>. In all these cases, you&#39;re facing a multi-objective optimization problem, and you
            have to make trade-offs.</p> <p>Of course, if you already know the exact weights you want to assign to each dimension
            (i.e., you know your utility function), you reduce the problem to a single objective
            optimization. This is because you can combine the dimensions with the weights into a
            single quantity to optimize (often called utility, cost, or fitness). In that case, you
            don&#39;t need Pareto at all.</p> <p>But you&#39;re often faced with situations where your utility function is unknown or
            uncertain. In those situations, the Pareto front helps you eliminate objectively all the
            sub-optimal options. It won&#39;t reveal the one best option right from the outset, but you
            may now experiment with these efficient options and select the one that fits you the
            best.</p></div> <div data-color="bg-beige" data-svelte-h="svelte-p78qch"><h3>Acknowledgments</h3> <p>I&#39;ve made some simplifying assumptions in this article to keep it readable for a large
            audience. In truth, the statistics that I presented are translated into derived in-game
            stats that are not always linear with the base statistics. Additionally, there are 4
            speed stats and 4 handling stats for all gears (except for the driver), but I decided to
            simply average those. I&#39;ve also completely hidden the functional form of the utility
            function, which can play a great role. To get access to more details behind this article
