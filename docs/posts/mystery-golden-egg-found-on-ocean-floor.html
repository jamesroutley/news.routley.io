<p>A golden egg, or an alien, on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean?

<p>American scientists have discovered a mysterious dome-shaped specimen deep on the Alaskan seafloor, but nobody knows for sure what it is.
</p><p>Ocean researchers using a remotely operated survey vehicle were amazed last week when they spotted the strange item on a rock about 3,300 meters (two miles) deep in the Gulf of Alaska.
</p><p>It is over 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter and had a small tear near its base.
</p><p>&#34;As cameras zoomed in, scientists were stumped as to its identification, with initial thoughts ranging from a dead sponge attachment, to coral, to an egg casing,&#34; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a statement.
</p><p>&#34;Invoking almost fairytale-like imagery, the specimen has since been dubbed a &#39;golden orb&#39; and even a &#39;golden egg,&#39;&#34; the agency added.
</p><p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/deep+sea/" rel="tag">deep sea</a> so delightfully strange?&#34; wondered Sam Candio,  an NOAA Ocean Exploration coordinator.
</p><p>As theories swirled on social media, including that of it being an alien egg, scientists extracted their August 30 discovery from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ocean+floor/" rel="tag">ocean floor</a> to analyze it in a laboratory setting.

<p>&#34;While we were able to collect the &#39;golden orb&#39; and bring it onto the ship, we still are not able to identify it beyond the fact that it is biological in origin,&#34; NOAA said.
</p><p>It remains unclear if the golden dome is associated with a known species, a new species, or represents an unknown life stage of an existing one, according to Candio.
</p><p>&#34;While somewhat humbling to be stumped by this finding, it serves as a reminder of how little we know about our own planet and how much is left to learn and appreciate about our <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ocean/" rel="tag">ocean</a>,&#34; he added.
</p><p>The dive was part of an expedition in the Gulf of Alaska to explore deepwater habitats.
