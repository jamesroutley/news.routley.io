    <h1>A Dictionary of Demons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Mythological creatures are interesting because of the wide range of roles they played (and continue to play) in the human imagination of how the world works. They’re a way for us to transform the random chance of systems far beyond our control into relationships with beings that we might have some hope of influincing. I’ve recently been considering using one particular mythological creature as inspiration for a project that may, or may not, at some point become a piece of publishable fiction. But in my pursuit of more options to choose from, I decided I needed more than just a few options. I needed ALL the options.</p>
<p>Thus having created a rabbit hole to throw myself into, the methodology I settled on was simple: start at known mythological creatures, open any and all related Wikipedia pages, and try to summarize my favorites. </p>
<p> But I am throwing in a couple of occult ideas which are fairly modern for fun. I’m treating everything about them as a fact for simplicity. </p>
<p>This list is definitely not comprehensive, because otherwise I would never post it. I’ve excluding totems, shapeshifters (unless they have other supernatural qualities), ghosts, mostly-modern paranormal creatures, succubi, and specific entities (eg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus">Krampus</a>). I haven’t read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_Infernal">1818 book of the same name</a>, nor have I delved deeply into the more arcane methods of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_demons">classification of demons</a>. If this list is missing your favorite demon / spirit / mystery entity, please send an entry to demons@rowan.earth and it will be considered for inclusion in the next publication. </p>
