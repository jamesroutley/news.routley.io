<p>Florida yesterday asked the US Supreme Court to reinstate its social media regulation law that made it illegal for sites like Facebook and Twitter to ban politicians.</p>
<p>Florida&#39;s <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/florida-netchoice-cert-petition.pdf">petition said the Supreme Court</a> should answer the questions of whether the First Amendment prohibits states &#34;from requiring that social-media companies host third-party communications, and from regulating the time, place, and manner in which they do so,&#34; and whether the First Amendment prohibits states &#34;from requiring social-media companies to notify and provide an explanation to their users when they censor the user&#39;s speech.&#34;</p>
<p>The Florida law is currently blocked by an order issued by the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which made its ruling in a lawsuit filed by Big Tech industry groups. Florida filed its Supreme Court petition several days after a Texas social media law was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/texas-court-upholds-law-banning-tech-companies-from-censoring-viewpoints/">reinstated</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.</p>
<p>Florida&#39;s petition points to the contrasting decisions by the 5th and 11th Circuit courts as evidence that the Supreme Court should settle the over-arching questions relevant to both cases. Florida said the case over its own law is &#34;an ideal vehicle&#34; for considering &#34;whether social-media platforms are &#39;speaking&#39; when they host third-party speech.&#34;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/texas-law-banning-social-media-censorship-reinstated-by-appeals-court/">previous 5th Circuit ruling</a> in the Texas case was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/sorry-texas-supreme-court-blocks-law-banning-censorship-on-social-media/">vacated by the Supreme Court</a> in May, suggesting the states face an uphill battle. The governors of Florida and Texas have both argued that state laws are needed to prevent censorship of conservatives on social media.</p>
<p>The Big Tech industry groups that sued Florida also said they want the Supreme Court to decide the case.                                            </p>
                                                        
<h2>Florida wants common-carrier rules for social networks</h2>
<p>Florida told the Supreme Court the &#34;Eleventh Circuit erred at the outset when it concluded that the hosting regulations in Florida&#39;s social-media law triggered heightened First Amendment scrutiny.&#34; Florida also said the court &#34;erred in its alternative holding that the platforms&#39; hosting decisions were inherently expressive.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Next, the Eleventh Circuit erroneously concluded that Florida could not regulate social-media platforms as common carriers, and in doing so, require the platforms to openly accept users,&#34; Florida argued. The state pointed to Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/texas-looks-to-a-clarence-thomas-opinion-to-defend-its-social-media-law/">Clarence Thomas&#39; opinion</a> backing the idea that social media companies can be treated as common carriers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s7072er.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Bill&amp;BillNumber=7072&amp;Session=2021">Florida law</a> says a social media platform &#34;may not willfully deplatform a candidate for office&#34; and imposes fines of up to $250,000 per day on social media companies that ban candidates for elected office. The law also says social platforms &#34;may not apply or use post-prioritization or shadow banning algorithms for content and material posted by or about... a candidate,&#34; and may not &#34;censor, deplatform, or shadow ban a journalistic enterprise based on the content of its publication or broadcast.&#34;</p>
<p>The Florida law originally had a &#34;theme park&#34; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/new-florida-law-banning-tech-from-deplatforming-politicians-is-a-mess/">exemption for Disney</a>, but the state legislature and Governor Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2022/04/22/governor-ron-desantis-signs-legislation-to-create-lawful-congressional-districts-and-remove-special-interest-carveouts/">eliminated the exemption</a> in April.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=872&amp;Bill=HB20">Texas law</a> says a &#34;social media platform may not censor a user&#34; based on the user&#39;s &#34;viewpoint&#34; and defines &#34;censor&#34; as &#34;block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.&#34;</p>
