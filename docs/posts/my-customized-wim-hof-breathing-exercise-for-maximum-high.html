<p>I’ve been doing the Wim Hof breathing for more than 6 months and I absolutely loved it when I started doing it. I was literally getting high off this breathing method. It was like a drug.</p>

<p>But as you know nothing lasts forever. After 4 or 5 months I noticed that the tingling and general feeling of expansion doesn’t happen any more or I have to try real hard to achieve even the slightest high.</p>

<p>So I had this idea to experiment with the technique, I started doing different things trying to see what could give the high again. It is fun to experiment. But it seems after couple months of experimenting I’ve come up with something that gives me some high again.</p>

<p>The instructions are below. If you haven’t done any Wim Hof breathing, the original method is also below.</p>

<p>Have fun and feel free to modify my method. I’m also always trying new things. Maybe I’ll have something new after another several months and I’ll post it here in such case.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: If this is new to you, i recommend to start with the original method first. Also, lay down and don’t do this in water, you can pass out!</p>

<p>– start of the round –</p>

<p>1) Inhale deep and exhale by letting go (shallow exhale) repeatedly in somewhat fast pace for 2 minutes or more</p>

<p>2) Deep breath in and constrict your abdomen and chest and push the breath in the brain (DMT breath) for 10 seconds</p>

<p>3) Repeat 1 and 2</p>

<p>4) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 2 minutes or more</p>

<p>5) Deep breath in and constrict your abdomen and chest and push the breath in the brain (DMT breath) for 10 seconds</p>

<p>6) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 50 seconds or more</p>

<p>7) Deep breath in and constrict your abdomen and chest and push the breath in the brain (DMT breath) for 10 seconds</p>

<p>– start the next round and repeat until you are done –</p>

<ul>
  <li>“pushing in the brain” means creating high pressure in the lungs until you feel it in your head. Do NOT push the air literaly into the airways in your head, that will cause tinnitus</li>
