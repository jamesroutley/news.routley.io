    <h1>JetBrains&#39; unremovable AI assistant meets irresistible outcry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>JetBrains introduced an AI assistant in December to help programmers write code. Now the biz is trying to figure out how to allow its customers to get rid of it.</p>
<p>&#34;JetBrains AI Assistant is similar to GitHub Copilot, but it’s deeply integrated into JetBrains development environments (IDEs), code editors, and other products,&#34; the software development tool maker, based in the Czech Republic, said at the time.</p>
<p>While neural-network-powered services have been widely hyped, they come with baggage – concerns about the security, legal risk, privacy, and ethics of large language models remain largely unresolved.</p>

    

<p>Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have opted to offer indemnify customers under certain conditions to reassure those worried about potential legal claims arising from generative AI.</p>

        


        

<p>But not every outfit offering AI services can make this bet and in some cases <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/21/artificial_intelligence_is_a_liability/">there&#39;s a cost</a>. For example, Zoom last August had to clarify that it would not use people&#39;s chats and calls for AI training despite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/zoom_ai_legalese_update/">a change</a> to its terms of service that allowed that.</p>
<p>Some JetBrains customers feel strongly about AI Assistant and really don&#39;t want the plugin to be present in their JetBrains applications at all, whether that&#39;s due to corporate policies that are incompatible with AI Assistant or other concerns. But because the plugin code has been &#34;deeply integrated,&#34; removal has proven complicated.</p>

        

<p>More than dozen threads on JetBrains&#39; YouTrack issue board have been posted seeking a way to delete, uninstall, or otherwise excise the AI Assistant plugin since it debuted.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely">thread</a> titled &#34;Provide the possibility to remove a plugin completely from the system&#34; makes the case for why one might not wish to have this plugin baked into the company&#39;s developer tools, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/ai-assistant.html">PyCharm</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/AI_Assistant.html">other</a> applications.</p>

</ul>
<p>Software developers posting to the support forum raise a number of concerns, calling the plugin &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8775047.0-0">bloatware</a>,&#34; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8710484.0-0">a risk to corporate intellectual property</a>, a security issue, an annoyance, and a breach of trust.</p>
<p>&#34;I just want to make it clear that I cannot use this product at the company I work for because security will not allow for a by-default AI implementation to be a part of the product,&#34; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1973/Provide-the-possibility-to-remove-a-plugin-completely-from-the-system#focus=Comments-27-8951378.0-0">wrote</a> an individual posting under the name Rusty Deaton.</p>
<p>Another developer posting under the name Marcus Grenängen <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8766615.0-0">wrote</a>, &#34;This is unacceptable. It should not bundle something by default that can send off the entire code base to God knows where. It&#39;s a real bad move JetBrains and I will not renew any subscriptions after this. It&#39;s a breach of trust that can&#39;t be undone.&#34;</p>
<h3>&#39;Dubious&#39;</h3>
<p>Yet another developer posting under the name Alan Burlison <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8753176.0-0">opined</a>, &#34;The fact that this service is AI based and that you don&#39;t know the provenance of the code it provides to you is a huge issue on its own, due to the dubious licensing/IP/legal situation it creates. But the biggest issue is not because it&#39;s AI, it&#39;s because it is leaking the user&#39;s company&#39;s IP to who knows where, potentially to direct competitors.&#34;</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em>, Matt Ellis, developer advocate at JetBrains, tried to address misapprehensions and to reassure to those alarmed by AI Assistant&#39;s persistence.</p>

        

<p>&#34;Although the AI Assistant plugin is bundled, and the plugin itself is enabled, there is no AI functionality enabled by default, and no data is sent off-machine without your consent,&#34; said Ellis, echoing similar replies posted to some of the discussion threads. &#34;You have to log in, accept the data policies and either purchase a subscription or start a trial.&#34;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is no AI functionality enabled by default, and no data is sent off-machine without your consent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;Any data sent to the AI service is not used for training. We also have ML support for ranking and completion, and this is provided by on-device models and no data is sent off device.&#34;</p>
<p>Ellis said JetBrains has a lot of customers who are happy with the bundled plugin and so the biz is looking into how its AI helper can be both bundled and fully removable.</p>
<p>&#34;The problem with removing a bundled plugin is that it can break application signatures and cause problems with updates,&#34; explained Ellis.</p>
<p>Asked what portion of JetBrains&#39; customers have objected to AI Assistant, a spokesperson said, &#34;We can&#39;t say for sure how well these opinions represent the position of all of our customers. We understand the strength of feeling, and we&#39;re listening to feedback from all parts of our community, including the many happy individuals and enterprises that are using the AI Assistant.&#34; ®</p>
