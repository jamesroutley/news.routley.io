<h3>from the <i>watch-what-we-do,-not-what-we-say</i> dept</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that there’s a massive, bipartisan push afoot to pass “right to reform” laws in many states making it easier and cheaper to repair the things you buy. </p>
<p>In a bid to undermine those laws, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/__trashed-4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/__trashed-4/">automakers</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/10/john-deere-once-again-pinky-swears-it-will-stop-monopolizing-repair/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/10/john-deere-once-again-pinky-swears-it-will-stop-monopolizing-repair/">companies like John Deere</a> have been using a fairly consistent playbook. One, they’ll lie about how such popular reform poses massive <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/">security and privacy threats to consumers</a>. Two, they’ll strike hollow, voluntary agreements with key industry groups in a bid to pretend that the industry can self-regulate (they can’t) and real reform isn’t necessary (it is).</p>
<p>For example, John Deere <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/01/john-deere-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair-despite-years-of-promises/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/01/john-deere-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair-despite-years-of-promises/">has a long history</a> of making tractor repair as inconvenient and expensive as possible in a bid to monopolize maintenance. And every so often they’ll strike a “memorandum of understanding” with a group like the American Farm Bureau Federation, pinky swearing that they’ll play nice if such groups avoid supporting right to repair legislation. It’s <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/10/john-deere-once-again-pinky-swears-it-will-stop-monopolizing-repair/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/10/john-deere-once-again-pinky-swears-it-will-stop-monopolizing-repair/">always bullshit</a>. </p>
<p>The auto industry has taken a similar tack. </p>
<p>Under the banner of the “<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/" target="_blank">Alliance for Automotive Innovation</a></em>,” the industry has recently struck deals with groups like the<em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.asashop.org/" target="_blank">Automotive Service Association</a> (ASA) and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scrs.com/" target="_blank">Society of Collision Repair Specialists</a> </em>(SCRS) promising to play nice on right to repair issues if these organizations refuse to support state right to repair legislation. But again, activists say the voluntary agreements <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/__trashed-4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/__trashed-4/">aren’t worth much</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We don’t think it means anything,” said Tommy Hickey, director of the <a href="https://massrighttorepair.org/">Right to Repair Coalition</a>, whose group led the campaign to pass the Massachusetts Data Access Law in 2020. “If you read the language, it says we’ll only give you telematic information if it’s absolutely necessary.”</em></p>

In most of the blogs, Tesla, which was just hit with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-hit-with-right-repair-antitrust-class-actions-2023-03-15/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-hit-with-right-repair-antitrust-class-actions-2023-03-15/">two class actions</a> for unlawfully curbing competition for maintenance and replacement parts for its electric vehicles, gets to pretend it’s already leading the way on “right to repair” reform. Without <a href="https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2023/08/24/tesla-rivian-back-independent-auto-repairer-oem-groups-r2r-agreement/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2023/08/24/tesla-rivian-back-independent-auto-repairer-oem-groups-r2r-agreement/">actually having to, you know, do anything</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy includes empowering independent repairers to service electric vehicles as the global fleet grows,” Tesla Public Policy and Business Development Vice President Rohan Patel wrote. “Through a comprehensive library of publicly available manuals and guides, Tesla already provides extensive information for independent and do-it-yourself repairers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both companies claim there’s nothing that needs fixing. But in the real world, Tesla’s efforts to monopolize repair and maintenance (as well as its terrible customer service) <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23318725/tesla-repair-mechanic-delay-electric-vehicles-ev" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/recode/23318725/tesla-repair-mechanic-delay-electric-vehicles-ev">are well established</a>. This is, after all, a company that just got caught not only intentionally and dramatically overstating EV ranges, but creating a team specifically designed to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/28/tesla-lied-about-ev-range-then-created-a-team-built-specifically-to-undermine-customer-attempts-to-get-help/#:~:text=These%20teams%2C%20located%20in%20Las,there%20wasn&#39;t%20a%20problem." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/28/tesla-lied-about-ev-range-then-created-a-team-built-specifically-to-undermine-customer-attempts-to-get-help/#:~:text=These%20teams%2C%20located%20in%20Las,there%20wasn&#39;t%20a%20problem.">undermine customer efforts to get help</a>. </p>
<p>In one instance, Tesla wanted $22,500 or more to replace a dying EV battery on a used car worth $23,000, when independent repair shops were able to do the same repair <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx535y/tesla-wanted-dollar22500-to-replace-a-battery-an-independent-repair-shop-fixed-it-for-dollar5000" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx535y/tesla-wanted-dollar22500-to-replace-a-battery-an-independent-repair-shop-fixed-it-for-dollar5000">for less than $5,000</a>. While Tesla does provide token diagnostic support for independent repair shops via its $3,000 a year (or $100 an hour) Toolbox platform, it still <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx535y/tesla-wanted-dollar22500-to-replace-a-battery-an-independent-repair-shop-fixed-it-for-dollar5000" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx535y/tesla-wanted-dollar22500-to-replace-a-battery-an-independent-repair-shop-fixed-it-for-dollar5000">greatly restricts</a> the <strong>far</strong> less expensive replacement of actual parts. Rivian repairs for even minor fender benders can also <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/heres-why-that-rivian-r1t-repair-cost-42000-after-just-a-minor-fender-bender/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theautopian.com/heres-why-that-rivian-r1t-repair-cost-42000-after-just-a-minor-fender-bender/">be comically expensive</a>; not simply because the vehicles are complex, but because of elaborate, often-convoluted restrictions on repair and replacement parts. </p>
<p>Both Rivian and Tesla claim to be innovatively a step beyond the traditional auto industry, but when it comes to making automotive repair as expensive, nontransparent, and annoying as possible, so far they’re not too far out of step with the rest of the pack. </p>
