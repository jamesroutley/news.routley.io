    <h1>Tech Billionaire Peter Thiel Was an FBI Informant</h1>

                                  <p>Peter Thiel has worn many hats over the years: Silicon Valley founder, Trump megadonor, cryptocurrency booster, democracy skeptic.</p><p>But there is yet another facet to Thiel, one that has remained secret until now: FBI informant.</p><p>In the summer of 2021, Insider has learned, Thiel began providing information as a &#34;confidential human source,&#34; or CHS, to Johnathan Buma, a Los Angeles-based FBI agent who specializes in investigating political corruption and foreign-influence campaigns. </p><p>Charles Johnson, a longtime associate of Thiel&#39;s and a notorious figure in the far-right movement that Thiel has subsidized for a decade, told Insider in a statement that he helped recruit the billionaire as an informant by introducing him to Buma.</p><p>A source with knowledge of Thiel&#39;s relationship to the FBI, whose identity is known to Insider but who insisted on anonymity, corroborated Johnson&#39;s account, telling Insider that Johnson brokered a relationship between Thiel and Buma. Insider was able to confirm through an additional source that the FBI added Thiel to its formal roster of registered informants.</p><p>Another source close to Thiel told Insider that while they could not confirm that Thiel was a CHS, Thiel did speak to Buma occasionally. The source said that any assistance Thiel might have provided to the FBI should be understood as part of Thiel&#39;s gradual distancing of himself from Trump and the broader MAGA movement, which has vigorously criticized the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies.</p><h2><strong>Valuable information on a recurring basis</strong></h2><p>The FBI maintains a vast network of informants to keep tabs on organized crime, terrorist threats, extremist groups, and other criminal and intelligence targets. These sources, according to the bureau&#39;s <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg-part-01-of-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Confidential Human Source Policy Guide</a>, are more than casual tipsters. </p><p>Confidential human sources enter &#34;into a relationship with the FBI, and that relationship will forever affect the life of that individual,&#34; the guide says. &#34;[They] will be either an &#39;FBI source&#39; or a &#39;former FBI source&#39; and, in turn, his or her conduct or misconduct will reflect upon the FBI.&#34; As such, the process for recruiting and maintaining such sources is highly regulated, requiring multiple layers of approval. Only people who are able to provide &#34;valuable information … on a recurring basis&#34; are granted CHS status, according to the policy.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

The information he passed on about foreign contacts and Silicon Valley intrigue was reviewed and &#34;validated,&#34; or cross-checked against other sources, by his case agents and their colleagues.</p><p>Thiel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Thiel spokesperson stopped responding to inquiries after being told that Insider was reporting on Thiel&#39;s relationship with the FBI. </p><p>The FBI&#39;s national press office and Scott Horton, an attorney who represents Johnathan Buma, both declined to comment.</p><h2><strong>No reporting on political ties</strong></h2><p>Thiel is a citizen of Germany, the United States, and New Zealand; as of last year,  he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/technology/peter-thiel-malta-citizenship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">reportedly in the process</a> of acquiring yet another passport, from Malta. In 2016, he donated $1.25 million to Trump&#39;s campaign and endorsed him from the stage at the Republican National Convention. After Trump won, Thiel served on his transition team.</p><p>Johnson, who said that he was also an informant for Buma, told Insider that he believes that Thiel&#39;s reporting to the FBI was largely limited to foreign contacts and attempts by foreign governments to penetrate Silicon Valley. Thiel has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/peter-thiel-reportedly-says-the-fbi-and-cia-should-investigate-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">publicly called on the FBI to investigate Google&#39;s ties to the Chinese government</a>.</p><p>Thiel, Johnson said, was directed by the FBI not to report on his interactions with Donald Trump or other US political figures.</p><p>Many of the politicians that Thiel has bankrolled — including Trump, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Blake Masters, a former Arizona senatorial candidate — have repeatedly attacked the bureau and its leadership in public. In 2022, Vance, whose campaign and affiliated PACs received a total of $15 million from Thiel, falsely claimed that the FBI had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-falsely-claims-fbi-illegally-wiretapped-trump-ohio-rally-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">illegally wiretapped Trump&#39;s phone</a>. Vance accused the bureau of &#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1624079332711825409" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">harassing faithful Christians</a>&#34; and pledged to block all of President Joe Biden&#39;s Department of Justice nominees in retaliation for the Trump prosecutions. (Most but not all of Thiel&#39;s donations occurred in early 2021, before the launch of Vance&#39;s campaign and the many false claims he made over the course of the race.)</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

He retains a 10% stake in Palantir, a data company that has sold more than a billion dollars of software and related services to the federal government, including the Pentagon, the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the FBI. A $250 million contract with the US Army in September adds to the evidence that Palantir is essentially &#34;a government service provider,&#34; a financial analyst <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-wins-250-million-army-ai-services-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">said</a>. </p><p>Thiel<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/02/01/billionaire-facebook-investor-peter-thiel-secretly-funded-a-cyber-warfare-startup-that-hacked-whatsapp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=forbes&amp;sh=7e49fa2d5600" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"> also backed</a> Boldend, a spyware company marketing itself as an American competitor to the Israeli NSO Group, Forbes reported last year.

But he is also a self-identified &#34;troll&#34; with a history of spreading false information and smearing his rivals.
