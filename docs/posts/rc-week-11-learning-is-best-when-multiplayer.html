    <h1>RC Week 11: Learning is best when multiplayer</h1>

    <p><strong>Saturday, December  3, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>As I come up on the end of my batch at <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, I&#39;ve been doing some reflecting on my time here.
One of the standout themes is how much I&#39;ve learned through struggling <em>with</em> other people.
In particular, this learning together has make some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq">difficult topics</a> approachable, where I may have given up or gotten stuck on my own.</p>
<p>This week, we were working through a couple of chapters of <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/index.html">Logical Foundations</a>, a book which teaches Coq and its related concepts.
The earlier chapters were for the most part smooth.
I could probably have gotten through them on my own.
But chapter 5 (and to some extent, 4) was where we hit an absolute wall.</p>
<p>Some of the proofs in chapter 5 were just absolute beasts to get through until we figured out the particular techniques we needed.
In particular, we had to remember to always include <code>eqn:E</code> (or similar) for every <code>destruct</code> tactic; it doesn&#39;t hurt (just adds more into the context, which can be overwhelming), but if you <em>don&#39;t</em> do this you sometimes get into a situation where you lack what you need in the context, so the goal is not provable!
Getting to this technique required a lot of back and forth between a couple of us.</p>
<p>I think there are a few things going on which make learning so much more effective with a peer group:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You have someone else to explain things to.</strong>
Just by trying to explain something, your own understanding will get better.
I first realized the power of this when I was a math tutor and found myself getting <em>better at math</em> by explaining material to other people.
It shored up my knowledge of the foundational material, and also gave me insights into multiple ways to explain things, which aids understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talking through problems helps you get unstuck.</strong>
Sometimes, your learning partners will see the problem and be able to nudge you in the right direction!
Even if your partner doesn&#39;t have a solution, though, you can get unstuck just from talking.
This is like <strong>rubber-duck debugging</strong>, where by saying something out loud you often get insights into the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You see other approaches.</strong>
There is rarely only one right way to do things.
By working through problems with other people, you get to see multiple approaches and get a richer understanding of the problem and solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You have accountability.</strong>
This one is big for me.
If you know that on Thursday, you and your &#34;axiom amigos&#34; are going to meet to discuss the chapter, it lights a fire to actually get through the reading and the problems.
When doing things on your own, it&#39;s a bit harder to keep momentum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn&#39;t work for everything.
Sometimes I&#39;m going to have to just chug through material on my own.
But I can get a lot of these benefits without having a formal group that&#39;s going through the same material:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write on my blog to explain things to other people</li>
<li>I can talk through problems with other Recursers and friends when I get stuck</li>
<li>I can read other people&#39;s blog posts or texts to see other approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability is the big one that&#39;s lacking when learning entirely on my own.
One way I try to keep that is with a schedule for when I put up new blog posts.
This motivates me to learn <em>something</em>, so I always keep forward momentum in some direction.</p>
<p>I think this multiplayer learning is one of the best parts of Recurse Center, and one of the hardest things to get outside of it.
But I can <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/running-software-book-reading-group/">run book clubs at work</a>, join some groups of future RC batches, and keep learning with friends (at a lower intensity) post-batch.</p>
