A side effect is that Meta, whose combined apps boast almost 3 billion daily users, has amassed an unknown but likely vast amount of personal contact information for people who have never signed up for an account, nor opted to share their information.</p><p>The tool, in theory, allows a non-user to mitigate some of this damage. And although the tool is targeted at people who have never signed up for Meta&#39;s apps, it&#39;s likely also useful to anyone who is a user but never wanted to share this information.</p><h2>Enter any number or email you want to check</h2><p>The service asks whether you want to scan for a phone number, landline number, or email address that may have been uploaded by a friend who uses Meta&#39;s core apps: Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram.</p>

                        </figure><h2>The bad news: It&#39;s a drop in the ocean of what Meta has on you</h2><p>Figuring out the benefits of doing any of this requires a bit of intellectual reverse-engineering. A primary benefit is privacy and the knowledge your data won&#39;t contribute to the opaque power of Facebook algorithms, such as its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-people-you-may-know-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T" data-analytics-module="body_link">infamous &#34;people you may know&#34; feature</a>.</p><p>It also gives more control to people whose data has been directly affected. Up until now, Meta only allowed users who had uploaded their contacts&#39; data to delete that information.</p><p>But in reality, privacy experts told Insider, deleting and blocking this small amount of data is one drop in the ocean compared to <em>what else</em> Meta has on you, regardless of whether or not you use its apps.</p>
                        
                        <p>For example, Meta harvests information on what people do outside its apps through Pixel, a piece of code that tracks what they do on different websites. That the firm has both browsing data and phone numbers of people who don&#39;t even use its services has given rise to the concept of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy" data-analytics-module="body_link">&#34;shadow profiles.&#34;</a></p><p>&#34;We first heard about shadow profiles very early in Facebook&#39;s dominance,&#34; Heather Burns, author of the book &#34;Understanding Privacy&#34;, told Insider. &#34;Facebook was keeping a sort of profile on you, even if you didn&#39;t have a Facebook account, composed of data gathered through things like Facebook Pixel.</p><p>&#34;Parallel to that was this notion of uploading the contact book, which at various times in Facebook&#39;s history was enabled by default when you started an account,&#34; she added. &#34;Even if you were a privacy-conscious person, if you hit that button, you had uploaded your friend&#39;s data. It feeds into the shadow profiles of people whether or not they use the service at all.&#34;</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/facebook-shadow-profiles-hearing-lujan-zuckerberg/" data-analytics-module="body_link">appeared ignorant of the term &#34;shadow profiles&#34;</a> during Congressional hearings in 2018, but admitted the firm collects data on non-users.</p>
                        
                        <p>Burns says she has never signed up for a Meta-owned service but found, on trying Meta&#39;s new privacy tool, that her email addresses and phone number had been picked up by the company. &#34;It&#39;s all in there, even though I&#39;ve never had an account,&#34; she said. &#34;I don&#39;t believe anybody uploaded my data to Facebook in a malicious manner, I&#39;m just in someone&#39;s address book.&#34;</p><p>But, she says, while it&#39;s positive that Meta now lets you block this information, &#34;that&#39;s just two strings of data.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I still have to use a browser with multiple defense plugins to protect myself from Meta on every page I view,&#34; she added. &#34;They are still tracking people, by default, even if they don&#39;t use an account. The notion that there&#39;s a tool to remove two data strings, to me, it&#39;s both beneficial and laughable.&#34;</p><p>Meta declined to answer questions from Insider about why it has rolled out this new tool, and why this year.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Meta may use this tool as a regulatory defense</h2><p>Both Burns and Eerke Boiten, professor of cybersecurity at De Montfort University, speculated that the motivation could be political or legal as regulatory scrutiny of the major tech firms increases.</p><p>&#34;There are two things — one is that installing the Messenger app leaks all of your contacts, that&#39;s an undeniable invasion of privacy,&#34; said professor Boiten. &#34;But now if anybody brings that up, Meta can always say: &#39;It doesn&#39;t have to be like that, you can undo the damage.&#39;&#34;</p><p>The second reason may be WhatsApp, which was bought by Meta in 2014 and whose core messaging functionality relies on people uploading their contact data to the app. An ongoing battle between Meta and regulators is whether it can connect the data it sucks up through WhatsApp to its other apps.</p><p>&#34;Having the possibility to delist your number from Facebook in a way that it can&#39;t be used by Facebook to make friend suggestions would be an argument that &#39;OK, we can do this safely,&#39;&#34; said Boiten. &#34;It wouldn&#39;t be very transparent ... the friend-suggestions algorithm is one of the least transparent of all, so it would be difficult to establish in any way that delisting a phone number would make an impact.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>It&#39;s possible that Meta isn&#39;t really technically deleting your phone number and emails at all, said Boiten.</p><p>&#34;The way Facebook has organically grown, it&#39;s probably true that the way they store information on people is on all sorts of disparate siloes,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;It may well be that they only implement something like this on the outside — so at a point the phone number threatens to go outside the system, it says, &#39;This phone number is one we&#39;ve been told we can&#39;t use,&#39; rather than really removing information.&#34;</p><p>Although both Burns and Boiten welcomed Meta taking tentative pro-privacy steps, Burns described it as &#34;a classic American approach&#34; that involves scooping up data without asking, versus the more permission-based approach favored by European privacy regulators.</p>
                        
                        <p>&#34;To me, the Facebook tool is <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#privacy-labour" data-analytics-module="body_link">privacy labor</a>,&#34; she added. &#34;They collected data they should not have collected in the first place, and are now shifting responsibility on you to remove it.&#34;</p>
