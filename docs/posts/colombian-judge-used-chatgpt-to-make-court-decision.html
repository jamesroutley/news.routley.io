According to the court document, the legal questions entered into the AI tool included “Is an autistic minor exonerated from paying fees for their therapies?” and “Has the jurisprudence of the constitutional court made favorable decisions in similar cases?” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Garcia included the chatbot’s full responses in the decision, apparently marking the first time a judge has admitted to doing so. The judge also included his own insights into applicable legal precedents, and said the AI was used to &#34;extend the arguments of the adopted decision.&#34; After detailing the exchanges with the AI, the judge then adopts its responses and his own legal arguments as grounds for its decision. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Colombian law does not forbid the use of AI in court decisions, but systems like ChatGPT are known for giving answers that are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkkgm/facebooks-ai-chatbot-since-deleting-facebook-my-life-has-been-much-better"><span>biased</span></a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3adyw9/facebook-pulls-its-new-ai-for-science-because-its-broken-and-terrible"><span>discriminatory</span></a>, or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaem/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt-for-constantly-giving-wrong-answers"><span>just plain wrong</span></a>. This is because the language model holds no actual “understanding” of the text—it merely synthesizes sentences based on probability from the millions of examples used to train the system. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>ChatGPT’s creators, OpenAI, have implemented filters to eliminate some of the more problematic responses. But the developers warn that the tool still has significant limitations and should not be used for consequential decision-making.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While the case is apparently the first time a judge has admitted to using an AI text generator like ChatGPT, some courts have—controversially—already begun using automated decision-making tools in determining sentencing or whether criminal defendants are released on bail. The use of these systems in courts has been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pezm/scientists-increasingly-cant-explain-how-ai-works"><span>heavily criticized by AI ethicists</span></a>, who point out that they regularly reinforce racist and sexist stereotypes and amplify pre-existing forms of inequality.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Although the Colombian court filing indicates that the AI was mostly used to speed up drafting a decision, and that its responses were fact-checked, it&#39;s likely a sign that more is on the way.</p></span></p><div><div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
