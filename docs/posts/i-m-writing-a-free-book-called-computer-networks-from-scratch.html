            <i>Computer Networks From Scratch</i> is a tour of the inner workings of the biggest computer network of them all--the internet.
            However, the internet wasn&#39;t built in a day. It&#39;s the result of decades of inventions and discoveries building on each other. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to understand it is to retrace that path, so we&#39;ll start from scratch assuming no prior networking knowledge. 
            First we&#39;ll build an example system that will allow two people to send messages back and forth using plastic tubing and marbles
            instead of wires and electrical signals. 
            Then we&#39;ll gradually work our way up to something resembling a state of the art computer network in the early 1960s. Finally we&#39;ll 
            build on top of that foundation until we have an in-depth understanding of the modern internet. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Each topic is explained in clear, easy to understand language, and the book is filled with helpful hand drawn illustrations 
            (painstakingly crafted by me) to guide the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first 3 chapters are done, and I&#39;ll release new chapters regularly. For now only the web version is available (it will remain free forever).
            The PDF, ebook, and print versions will be available soon for a fee.
