<p>The first big chunk of work on <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2020/figuring-out-which-blogging-platform-to-switch-to/">migrating to a new blogging platform</a> is done! I am of course slightly nostalgic about my old hand-hacked HTML and the specific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200701223725/http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/">NewsBruiser</a> featureset. But it is now far easier for anyone to search and browse my archives, for me to include images in a post...</p><p><img alt="Alert: Sumana is not a registered protocol. (screenshot from Konqueror)" height="130" src="https://danluu.com/media/images/sumana-protocol.width-500.png" width="357"/></p><p>and for me to upload and manage standalone pages such as <a href="http://harihareswara.net/texts/talks/">my list of talks &amp; presentations</a>. And, thanks to better CSS, it&#39;s probably easier for anyone to read my site in general.</p><p>Some improvements are still in the works and I apologize for the disruption to your Really Simple Syndication feed. (New location, by the way, for <a href="https://harihareswara.net/rss/">RSS</a>, and there&#39;s <a href="https://harihareswara.net/atom/">an Atom feed</a> now. Though redirects should be in place so you shouldn&#39;t <i>have</i> to update.)</p><p>Those of us who have been <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2010/belated-blog-anniversary/">blogging for years and even decades</a> sometimes need to figure out <a href="https://www.xorph.com/nfd/2021/04/21/toward-translucency/">what to do about old entries</a> that are factually outdated, offensive, invasive of someone&#39;s privacy, or otherwise a bad fit for today&#39;s world and today&#39;s Web. As a step in that direction, I&#39;ve added a disclaimer on my blog posts that are five years old or older, such as <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2013/comprehensions/">&#34;Comprehensions.&#34;</a> Feel free to borrow my wording if this is useful in your blog as well.</p><p>Once more of the work is in place here, and once we have <a href="https://changeset.nyc">my business site</a> overhauled as well, I&#39;ll talk more about the behind-the-scenes stuff. If you notice something that&#39;s a bug, please feel free to report in a comment (and if the comment system itself is what&#39;s buggy, email me).</p>
