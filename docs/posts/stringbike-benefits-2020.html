				<h2>
					 &amp; oil free 
				</h2>
				<p>
					Your stringbike is always clean and oil free: whether riding or transporting or during storage or maintenance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Say goodbye to the greasy chain, the dangerously sharp sprockets or delicate derailleurs. No more greasy palms, greasy wrists, cuts, scrapes or soiled clothes.
				</p>

				<h2>
					 &amp; graceful
				</h2>
				<!--p class="info">
					Experience a smoother and quieter ride without derailleur and chain noises.
				</p-->
				<!--p class="info">
					The symmetrical system shifts unnoticeably from the right to the left side and vice versa resulting in a pedaling experience that feels familiar, more comfortable and super smooth.
				</p-->
				<p>
					Strings are transferring the leg power to the rear wheel on a silky, smooth way, while filtering all vibrancy.
					The pedaling experience is improved by the symmetrically balanced drive system.
				</p>
				<p>
					 
					The graceful movement of Stringdrive turns the heads everywhere, every time.

				<h2>
					 noise
				</h2>
				<p>
					Totally silent biking.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unique experience: no chain drive noise, no free wheel rolling noise, the only noise is the sound of the tires.
				</p>
				<p>
					Enjoy the silent whoosh.

				<h2>
					 19 speeds
				</h2>
				<p>The Stringdrive system has 19 different non-overlapping transmission ratios within an integrated gearbox.
				</p>
				<p>Gears are selected by moving the rope wheels up and down. The upper position gives maximum and the lower gives minimum transmission ratio. 
				</p>
				<p>Gears can be easily changed even under heavy load.

				<h2>
					 it like a car
				</h2>
				<p>You can change gears in all riding situations: pedaling, rolling, and standing.
				</p>
				<p> You can start from a stationary position in low gear, and gradually change the gears up. True city lover.</p>
				<p>The strings will never fall off during gear change.</p>

				<h2>
					 made easier
				</h2>
				<p>Take full advantage of your body&#39;s natural strength. Gears are always turned in your favor, making it easier pedaling when you are weakest and harder when you are at your strongest.
				</p>
				<p>The asymmetrical characteristic of Stringdrive increases the usable gear during the power portion of the pedal stroke between the 1 and 5 o’clock positions of the crank.

				<h2>
					 dual drive
				</h2>
				<p>The Stringdrive is a dual drive which can be set asymmetrically to provide a different weight load for each leg, by changing the rear drums.  
				</p>
				<p>This way stringbike can be adapted to the needs of those having leg related injuries, or the needs of sportsmen wanting to develop muscles differently.

				<h2>
					 fashionable
				</h2>
				<p>Simply neat.</p>
				<p> Change the strings quickly and easily in 2 minutes, no tool required and no need to remove the wheel. Choose the color to match your outfit or mood.</p>
				<p>You can wash the strings anytime in your washing machine if they get dusty.</p>

				<h2>
					 off quick &amp; easy
				</h2>
				<p>Remove easily and quickly your bike&#39;s rear and front wheels for storage or carrying around.   
				</p>
				<p>Removing the rear wheel is almost as simple as removing the front wheel. It does not require special tools or knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>Putting your bike in the car shouldn&#39;t be a hassle any more. Improve your cleanliness, use the optional stringbike wheel bags.
