It hasn’t taken similar steps (yet) in 2025, but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-employees-petition-for-job-security-ahead-of-expected-cuts-.html">employees are fearing the worst</a>. And if the Platforms and Devices team is anything to go by, there’s ample reason for concern. Google has distributed a memo to all US employees working on Android, Pixel hardware, and other projects that offers a “voluntary exit program” guaranteeing severance for anyone willing to step away from their role at the company. The memo went out from platforms and devices SVP Rick Osterloh, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">according to <em>9to5Google</em></a>.</p><p>“This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year,” Osterloh wrote. “There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts can often be a precursor to layoffs if not enough employees take Google up on its offer and choose to leave.</p><p>Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">combined its Android and hardware teams</a> under Osterloh in April. Executives said the streamlined approach would help it integrate AI features across products and services more quickly.</p><p>A few months later in October, Alphabet’s chief finance officer Anat Ashkenazi said she would prioritize “cost efficiencies” throughout the company. “There’s really good work that was done, started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to re-engineer the cost base,” she said during her first earnings call as CFO. “But I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities.” The cost-cutting measures are partly designed to offset Google pouring so much money into AI.</p><p>Google’s Pixel phones have never come anywhere close to the sales numbers enjoyed by Apple and Samsung, but the company is at least trending in the right direction; <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-smartphone-market-q3-2024">Counterpoint Research reported</a> that Google recorded its highest-ever quarterly sales volume for smartphones in Q3 2024.</p><p>Some employees at Google have recently been circulating a petition that calls for CEO Sundar Pichai to offer exactly this type of optional buyout before resorting to involuntary layoffs. “Ongoing rounds of layoffs make us feel insecure about our jobs,” the petition said, according to CNBC. “The company is clearly in a strong financial position, making the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation hurt even more.”</p><p>At least for the time being, it appears the voluntary exit program hasn’t been extended to other divisions within Google like search or the DeepMind AI team.</p></div></div></div>
