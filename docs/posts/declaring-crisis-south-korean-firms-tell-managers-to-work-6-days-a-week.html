For much of his 30-plus years at Samsung, working on the weekends was normal — and legal under the nation’s labor laws. “I didn’t mind,” Mr. Lim said. “It was fun for me.”</p><p>Things are different now. South Korean labor laws cap working hours to 52 a week: 40 standard hours with up to 12 for overtime. Weekends are generally considered off limits, and younger employees are mindful of their work-life balance in a way their parents or grandparents weren’t.</p><p>But over the past few months, some influential South Korean companies have told executives to work longer hours, in some cases telling them to come to the office six days a week. Some people in South Korean business are predicting that lower-ranked employees and managers at smaller companies will feel pressure to follow suit.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It’s a signal that in South Korea, working six days a week is still acceptable,” said Kim Seol, a representative of the Youth Community Union, a labor group that represents workers between the ages of 15 and 39.</p><p>The pressure on workers, especially young workers, can be intense in South Korea, which has a shrinking, aging population with one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/world/asia/south-korea-fertility-rate.html" title="">lowest fertility rates</a>. Fears about job security and the rising costs of housing, child care and education have discouraged working-age Koreans from having children, contributing to a demographic crisis that looms over the economy.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lim Hyung-kyu, now retired, spent decades at Samsung Electronics, rising to chief technology officer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In South Korea, the five-day workweek is only a generation old, introduced by labor laws in 2004, starting with the public sector and larger companies before spreading to smaller firms. A 52-hour legal limit on the workweek is also relatively new: It was introduced in 2018, a reduction from 68 hours per week.</p><p>For much of South Korea’s postwar history, a time of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/sharing-seoul-s-prosperity.html" title="">rapid growth and reconstruction</a>, workers were expected to be in the office Monday through Saturday. “Back then, it was hard for people to get by,” said Mr. Lim, the retired Samsung executive. “Helping the company grow meant helping the country and, by extension, yourself.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Samsung, like South Korea’s other multinational giants, has tracked the country’s burst of development from poverty and war to an advanced, high-tech economy. It was founded in the late 1930s as a shop selling vegetables and dried fish, started making appliances and other electronics in the late 1960s, and is now a world leader in semiconductors, smartphones and other technologies with over 200,000 employees.</p><p>The companies now calling for executives to work longer hours have described the measures as a response to a downturn in business, citing a temporary crisis or emergency. Growth in South Korea has been patchy, with weak consumer spending putting a dent in corporate earnings. The economy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/south-korean-gdp-unexpectedly-shrinks-boosting-rate-cut-chances-2024-07-24/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unexpectedly shrank last quarter</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Office workers walking among bars and restaurants in a busy neighborhood in Seoul.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>At HD Hyundai Oilbank, the refinery and gas station unit of an industrial conglomerate, about 40 executives started coming to the office on weekends in recent weeks to “respond to the crisis caused by sluggish business conditions,” according to a company representative. HD Hyundai Oilbank’s sales and profit dropped sharply last year because of falling oil prices.</p><p>In July, SK On, the battery and electric vehicle unit of a technology group, announced that it would go into “emergency mode,” freezing executives’ salaries and making them start their workdays earlier.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Executives and leaders will lead by example and take on the large responsibility of navigating through a crisis,” Lee Seok-hee, SK On’s chief executive, said at a staff meeting, according to a company statement. The company, which has lost money in recent quarters,<strong> </strong>slowed production and warned of “unfavorable market conditions” in a financial report in April.</p><p>A spokesman from Samsung Electronics said that while it was not official company policy, “executives may voluntarily choose to work on weekends according to their professional needs.” The conglomerate has been in the middle of a dispute with its largest union, whose members last week said they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/asia/samsung-workers-end-strike.html" title="">go back to work</a> after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/samsung-strike.html" title="">strike</a> over pay and working conditions.</p><p>Labor groups claim the “crisis” and “emergency” measures are mostly for show. “There is a cultural mind-set here that the longer someone works, the better the outcome,” said Lee Sang Yoon, a policy deputy director at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the largest labor groups in the nation. “This is outdated.”</p><p>Although the calls for weekend work apply only to the executive tier of these companies, other employees may feel pressure to do the same.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kim Seol, a representative of the Youth Community Union, which represents younger workers, at his office in Seoul.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“Business culture in South Korea is a pyramid,” said Mr. Kim of the Youth Community Union, with large companies at the top setting the tone for the country’s business culture.</p></div><div><div><p>What’s written in labor laws also does not always reflect the actual experience of employees. Workers in South Korea log some of the highest hours among advanced economies, putting in about 100 hours more per year than the average American worker, <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/hours-worked.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to 2022 data</a> compiled by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>Eun Sung, a consultant in her 20s who lives in Seoul, said she often worked six days a week when on a project.</p><p>“We consider getting off at 2 or 3 a.m. decent,” she said. She sees friends only once every few months, and her health has been affected by a lack of sleep, she added. While she enjoys consulting, she said she would consider moving to a country where she could have a better work-life balance.</p><p>Some companies have ways to get employees to put in longer hours, according to Ryu Jae Kang, head of a policy unit at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions. They may pay fixed salaries that already incorporate overtime hours, and not all hours for all types of work may be tracked.</p></div></div><div><p>The legal reduction of working hours over the years has been a sign of South Korea’s development and a shift among people to focus more on their personal lives, said Joon Han, a sociology professor at Yonsei University.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 52-hour legal limit on the workweek in South Korea was introduced in 2018, a reduction from 68 hours per week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Last year, President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is considered pro-business, proposed raising the cap on the workweek to 69 hours.

In June, the government launched a work-life balance committee charged with exploring more flexible working practices.</p><p>“Times are changing,” said Mr. Han of Yonsei University. “Young people don’t want to be slaves to their companies anymore.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
