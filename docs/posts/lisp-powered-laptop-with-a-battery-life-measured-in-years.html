    <h1>Lisp-powered laptop with a battery life measured in years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Norwegian software developer Andreas Eriksen has put together a laptop, of sorts, which boasts &#34;a battery life measured in years&#34; â€” and is programmed in Lisp for good measure: the PotatoP.</p><p><span>&#34;The word &#39;Potato&#39; is often used to describe an underpowered/poorly performing device. &#39;This video must have been filmed with a potato!&#39; This device is intentionally underspecced to ensure long battery life,&#34; Eriksen explains of the project&#39;s unusual name. &#34;The &#39;toP&#39; suffix refers to the intended eventual laptop form factor. The suffix &#39;p&#39; is used for LISP predicates â€” functions that return true or false, like &#39;</span><code>evenp</code><span>&#39; or &#39;</span><code>primep</code><span>&#39; for numbers. Is it a potato or not? It depends on your point of view!&#34;</span></p><figure><figcaption>This sunlight-readable laptop prototype offers a two-year-plus battery life, with a little clever solar harvesting. (ðŸ“¹: Andreas Eriksen)</figcaption></figure><p>The PotatoP prototype, which is more of a luggable than a traditional laptop, is built using exclusively low-power parts. Its heart is a SparkFun Artemis module, which has a single low-power Arm Cortex-M4F core running at up to 96MHz and Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. On this, Eriksen runs a modified port of uLisp, a Lisp designed specifically with microcontrollers in mind, dubbed PotatOS.</p><p>With portable computers, the display is often the most power-hungry component. To avoid draining too much power there, Eriksen has opted for a compact 4.4&#34; SHARP Memory Display â€” a technology mid-way between ePaper and traditional liquid crystal displays (LCDs) that lacks a backlight and draws a minimum of power.</p><div><div><p><span>Eriksen is writing the software for the PotatoP himself, including a text editor and games. (ðŸ“·: Andreas Eriksen)</span></p></div></div><p>With a microcontroller heart and a low-power display, the resulting prototype is impressively energy efficient. With a 1.2Ah lithium-polymer battery inserted, and a small solar cell fitted to the right of the screen to top it up, Eriksen claims the prototype can run for &#34;up to two years, depending on ambient light&#34; â€” with a view to making the finished version operate indefinitely on ambient light harvesting alone.</p><p><span>More information on the project is available </span><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/184340-potatop" rel="nofollow">on Eriksen&#39;s Hackaday.io page</a><span>, with the PotatOS source code </span><a href="https://github.com/andreer/PotatoP/" rel="nofollow">published to GitHub</a><span> under the permissive MIT license.</span></p></div></section></div>
