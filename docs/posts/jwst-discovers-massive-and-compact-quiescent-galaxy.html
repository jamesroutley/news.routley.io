<p>Astronomers have reported the discovery of a new galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. The newfound object, designated JWST-ER1 is a massive and compact quiescent galaxy. The findings were detailed in a paper published September 14 on the pre-print server <i>arXiv</i>.

<p>Massive <a href="https://phys.org/tags/galaxies/" rel="tag">galaxies</a> that stopped forming stars (known as massive quiescent galaxies) are plausible progenitors of giant elliptical galaxies. Given that these objects formed stars earlier and assembled their <a href="https://phys.org/tags/stellar+masses/" rel="tag">stellar masses</a> more quickly, they could be key to improving our understanding of the process of galaxy evolution.
</p><p>Now, a team of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/astronomers/" rel="tag">astronomers</a> led by Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University reports the detection of a new galaxy of this type, which received designation JWST-ER1. The object was identified with JWST&#39;s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) as part of the ongoing wide and deep survey of up to 1 million galaxies—known as COSMOS-Web. One of the most remarkable features of JWST-ER1 is the so-called Einstein ring—a phenomenon in which the light appears as a ring due to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+lensing/" rel="tag">gravitational lensing</a>.
</p><p>&#34;The galaxy and its ring were identified in JWST NIRCam observations in the context of the COSMOS-Web project, a public wide-area survey using the F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W filters,&#34; the researchers explained.
</p><p>NIRCam observations show that JWST-ER1 consists of a compact early-type galaxy (JWST-ER1g) and a complete Einstein ring (JWST-ER1r) with two conspicuous red concentrations. The diameter of the center of the ring was measured to be approximately 1.54 arcseconds.
</p><p>The new galaxy was found at a redshift of 1.94, has a radius of about 21,500 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+years/" rel="tag">light years</a> and its mass is estimated to be 650 billion <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+masses/" rel="tag">solar masses</a>. The results point to an age of 1.9 billion years and a low star-formation rate at a level of four solar masses per year. Therefore, JWST-ER1 is a massive and quiescent galaxy. It is also quite compact, just like other quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts.
</p><p>When it comes to the ring JWST-ER1r, the astronomers found that it is produced by a background galaxy at a photometric redshift of 2.98. It joins a large number of known Einstein rings, although most of them are not complete.
</p><p>The study also found that JWST-ER1 is almost perfectly round and no obvious star-forming regions, tidal tails, or other irregularities have been identified in the NIRCam imaging.
</p><p>The authors of the paper propose further observations of JWST-ER1 in order to investigate whether nearby galaxies or structures along the line of sight could contribute to its mass and to also inspect whether JWST-ER1 is the central galaxy of the progenitor of a cluster.
