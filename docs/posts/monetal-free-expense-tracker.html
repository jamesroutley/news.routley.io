				<h2>
					Why Monetal is awesome?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Monetal allows you to create several accounts for cash, credit cards, electronic money, and then log
					 income and expenses for each account via plus and minus icons on the main screen.
					 You’ll be done before you get your change back.

			<div>
				<h2>
					Why Monetal is <span>free</span>?
				</h2>
				<p>
					This is indie project made by a single <a href="https://monetal.app/index_en.php#developer">developer</a>. App is available for free, doesn&#39;t contain any ads or in-app purchases. Registration also is not required,
					and that is why all your data completely anonymous and could be transfered to server only for app analytics
					(like most popular screens, which functions are frequently used, which can be removed etc).
