<p>I&#39;ve resigned from Intel and accepted a new opportunity. If you are an Intel employee, you might have seen my fairly long email that summarized what I did in my 3.5 years. Much of this is public:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/2024-10-29/ai-flame-graphs.html">AI flame graphs</a> and released them as <a href="https://github.com/intel/iaprof">open source</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/2025-05-01/doom-gpu-flame-graphs.html">GPU subsecond-offset heatmap</a></li>
<li>Worked with Linux distros to enable <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/2024-03-17/the-return-of-the-frame-pointers.html">stack walking</a></li>
<li>Was interviewed by the WSJ about eBPF for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-crowdstrike-tech-outage-reignited-a-battle-over-the-heart-of-microsoft-systems-72b62c90?utm_source=chatgpt.com">security monitoring</a></li>
<li>Provided leadership on the eBPF Technical Steering Committee (<a href="https://ebpf.foundation/bsc/">BSC</a>)</li>
<li>Co-chaired USENIX <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/2023-02-17/srecon-apac-2023.html">SREcon APAC 2023</a></li>
<li>Gave 6 conference keynotes</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s still early days for AI flame graphs. Right now when I browse CPU performance case studies on the Internet, I&#39;ll often see a CPU flame graph as part of the analysis. We&#39;re a long way from that kind of adoption for GPUs (and it doesn&#39;t help that our open source version is Intel only), but I think as GPU code becomes more complex, with more layers, the need for AI flame graphs will keep increasing.</p>

<p>I also supported cloud computing, participating in 110 customer meetings, and created a company-wide strategy to win back the cloud with 33 specific recommendations, in collaboration with others across 6 organizations. It is some of my best work and features a visual map of interactions between all 19 relevant teams, described by Intel long-timers as the first time they have ever seen such a cross-company map. (This strategy, summarized in a slide deck, is internal only.)</p>

<p>I always wish I did more, in any job, but I&#39;m glad to have contributed this much especially given the context: I overlapped with Intel&#39;s toughest 3 years in history, and I had a hiring freeze for my first 15 months.</p>

<p>My fond memories from Intel include 
meeting <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/images/2022/Brendan_Linus_Sep2022_01crop.jpg">Linus</a> at an Intel event who said &#34;everyone is using <em>fleme</em> graphs these days&#34; (Finnish accent),
meeting Pat Gelsinger who knew about my work and introduced me to everyone at an exec all hands,
surfing lessons at an Intel Australia and HP offsite (<a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/images/2024/Intel_HP_Urbnsurf_2024.mp4">mp4</a>),
and meeting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harshad-sane-56711a11_thrilled-to-meet-in-person-with-brendan-gregg-activity-6980768411198922753-Dw_k?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAA8VAMBqJml4viT3EVYGfzv-hLOE0rjdIE">Harshad Sane</a> (Intel cloud support engineer) who helped me when I was at Netflix and now has joined Netflix himself -- we&#39;ve swapped ends of the meeting table. I also enjoyed meeting Intel&#39;s hardware fellows and senior fellows who were happy to help me understand processor internals. (Unrelated to Intel, but if you&#39;re a Who fan like me, I recently met some other <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/images/2025/brendan_mccoy.jpg">people</a> <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/images/2025/brendan_hines.jpg">as</a> <a href="https://bytes.zone/blog/images/2025/brendan_ford.jpg">well</a>!)</p>

<p>My next few years at Intel would have focused on execution of those 33 recommendations, which Intel can continue to do in my absence. Most of my recommendations aren&#39;t easy, however, and require accepting change, ELT/CEO approval, and multiple quarters of investment. I won&#39;t be there to push them, but other employees can (my CloudTeams strategy is in the inbox of various ELT, and in a shared folder with all my presentations, code, and weekly status reports). This work will hopefully live on and keep making Intel stronger. Good luck.</p>
