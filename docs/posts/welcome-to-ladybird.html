              <h2>About <span>Ladybird</span></h2>
              <p>
                Ladybird is a brand-new browser &amp; web engine. Driven by a
                web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the
                modern web with good performance, stability and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS
                hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a
                cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other
                Unix-like systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a
                first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.

                  Linux and macOS. This will be aimed at developers and early

                  We have 3 new full-time engineers starting soon. Going
                  forward, we would like to grow the team at a reasonable pace.
                  Building the right team is more important than building it

                  The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser

                  WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser engine.

                  Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++.
                  The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience.
                  Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half
                  a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.
