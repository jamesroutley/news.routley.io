    <h1>Know Your Carrying Capacity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Take a second to think through all the &#34;stuff&#34; you have to personally maintain at your job. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical servers or virtual machines</li>
<li>Internal libraries</li>
<li>A handful of microservices</li>
<li>Some test cases you wrote</li>
<li>CI/CD stuff</li>
<li>Helper scripts</li>
<li>Open-source repos</li>
<li>Security/legal compliance</li>
<li>Software licenses</li>
<li>All of the tools on your computer (IDE+extensions, shell+extensions, CLI tools, SSH/GPG keys, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some less obvious ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Membership in ActiveDirectory groups or equivalent</li>
<li>Membership in an email alias or chat group</li>
<li>A chatbot (including the one-click installable ones)</li>
<li>All those little no-code, IFTT-type things</li>
<li>Some internal wiki pages</li>
<li>Meeting series&#39; or working groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on company size, pretty much any one of these bullet points could be someone&#39;s full-time job, but it&#39;s not uncommon to see one person having to do a little of all of these (I sure do).</p>
<p>I like to think of the collection of things that someone can reasonably maintain as their &#34;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity">carrying capacity</a></em>&#34;, to borrow the ecology term. If you take on more than your carrying capacity, something has to die (aka fall into disrepair). With modern software being so garbage, I think one big reason is that there are too many software professionals out there who don&#39;t know their carrying capacity.</p>
<p>Not knowing your carrying capacity can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security issues. All software rots under the deluge of new CVEs these days.</li>
<li>Productivity issues. That helper script you abandoned had a bug that your co-worker had to fix without any context.</li>
<li>Usability issues. That microservice you never optimized is making your users mad (but just subtly enough so they don&#39;t think to file a bug report, and they experience slow websites all the time so it doesn&#39;t affect your bottom line, just slowly eats away at their psyche instead)</li>
<li>Trust issues. That working group you established (and later neglected) dis-incentivizes future engagement. See also <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">the Google product graveyard</a>.</li>
<li>More fallout from turnover. When an over-capacity employee quits, they explode like a pi√±ata filled with responsibilities that everyone else has to scoop up. Over-capacity employees also likely don&#39;t even know the full extent of the responsibilities they do have, meaning some of them just don&#39;t get picked up.</li>
</ul>
<p>So hopefully this post can help avoid those things!</p>
<h2 id="odds-are-that-you-are-part-of-the-problem">Odds are that YOU are part of the problem</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not talking about people who have been pushed beyond their carrying capacity by other people. You don&#39;t need a ton of self-awareness to know when that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. But when <em>you</em> push <em>yourself</em> beyond your carrying capacity, you likely won&#39;t even notice. And since it&#39;s tough to notice (and since so much tech is under-maintained garbage), it&#39;s likely you are part of the problem!</p>
<p>Why is it hard to notice when you are beyond your carrying capacity? Well because you can&#39;t notice things deteriorating that you don&#39;t even actively/regularly think of. If you&#39;ve worked somewhere for long enough, there&#39;s bound to be something you&#39;ve forgotten about. So many of the building blocks of modern software simply can&#39;t alert you when they need maintenance. Documentation won&#39;t email you when it becomes obsolete. You won&#39;t get immediately sued for every lapse in compliance.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>All we can really do is to consciously think about our own carrying capacities whenever we take on a new task. Frequently re-visit that &#34;list of things you have to personally maintain&#34; in order to avoid blind spots. When you do this, you might be forced to jog your own memory by re-reading those docs or investigating that old VM. This has the (desireable) side-effect of taking up a lot of your time! If you are already responsible for so many things that you spend so much time re-checking them, you definitely can&#39;t take on new things!</p>
<p>All I ask is for just a little bit more conscientiousness when it comes to maintenance.</p>
