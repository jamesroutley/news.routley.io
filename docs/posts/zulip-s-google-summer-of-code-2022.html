            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This summer, <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/zulip">15 contributors</a> completed the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) program with the <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>. This was the 7th consecutive year that Zulip participated in GSoC; over 100 contributors have now completed one of our formal internship programs, primarily through <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>. Our experienced contributors, including many alumni of these programs, have dedicated thousands of hours to mentorship. As a result, many of the participants have told us that they learned more contributing to Zulip than in their 4-year formal computer science education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The lessons and feedback from the incredible experience as a GSoC participant with Zulip have shaped me into a better developer.” — Kartik Srivastava</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors">welcoming community</a> is fully committed to helping bring up the next generation of open-source contributors from a wide range of backgrounds. We have invested into making Zulip’s code uniquely readable, well tested, and easy to modify. Beyond that, we have written an extraordinary 150K words of documentation on how to contribute to Zulip, with topics ranging from <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html">practical Git tips</a> to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html">essays on important architectural decisions</a>. This is why our 2022 GSoC participants were able to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/zulip">contribute major improvements</a> to the Zulip product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The openness to constructive feedback, the super comprehensive developer documentation, coupled with the vibrant, helpful developer community, and the trust reposed in and the flexibility granted to contributors, makes for an incomparable experience.” – Nehal Sharma</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together, this year’s GSoC participants wrote over 650 commits that have already been merged into Zulip! It’s impossible to describe here all the great work that’s been done, but here are some highlights.</p>
