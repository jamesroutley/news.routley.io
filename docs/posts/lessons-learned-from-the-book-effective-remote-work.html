              <p>I enjoyed reading “Effective Remote Work” by <a href="https://twitter.com/jstanier">James Stanier</a>. I wrote down my lessons learned and posted them on <a href="https://twitter.com/philipp_hauer/status/1561610064208838657">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/philipp-hauer-677738135_as-promised-here-are-my-lessons-learned-activity-6967419878567739392-CaXG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn</a>. Surprisingly, the response was very positive which make me very happy. So I made a blog post out of the content to make it persist and easier to find later.</p>

<ol>
<li>The most fundamental principle is to <strong>treat everyone as remote.</strong> Period. Once again: Treat everyone as remote. That affects everything: tools, meeting setup,  information exchange, communication, documentation, and opportunities.</li>
<li>A key ingredient is to rely on asynchronous communication and to produce artifacts. Ideally, those artifacts should be developed collaboratively and shared with everyone. Every meeting should create an artifact (ideally, a shared document or at least a record).</li>
<li>On the importance of connecting as humans in a remote setup: We are all human beings and need social interaction to not feel isolated and to enjoy the feel-good aspects of work. So you should <strong>break the asynchronous-communication-rule occasionally</strong>, have face-time, and make room for socializing.
<ul>
<li><strong>“When leaders make time for fun, it gives permission for others too”.</strong></li>
<li>And a little <strong>‘How are you feeling?&#39;</strong> goes a long way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On onboardings: Have a dedicated “Contracting Session” where the manager and the new report answer questions about how they like their relationship.</li>
<li>I also like the idea of <strong>archiving e-mails</strong> instead of just marking them as read. “Empty inbox, empty mind, pure bliss”. I will give that a try!</li>
<li>I also want to try out the proposed <strong>daily journaling</strong>. Close each day with a short reflection and write down your findings. Research has shown that this improves your performance.</li>
<li>Inspirational: James explains why you should be brave and put boundaries between your work time and your personal time. I like the notion of <strong>strengthening your muscle of stepping away</strong> by “just doing it”. Step. Go!</li>
<li>As a manager, you should <strong>over-communicate</strong>. Why? Because repetition makes your message stick, and your message will be missed by someone at some time anyway.</li>
<li>James proposes a “Remote Working Test” similar to the Joel test. A couple of questions to find out if a company is remote-friendly. One question stuck in my head: <strong>Are the members of the executive team remote workers?</strong> If yes, they will improve the remote experience for all.</li>
<li>I also like the idea of writing a team handbook. In our last team, we created something similar, and I wrote a <a href="https://phauer.com/2021/tech-talk/">blog post</a> about it. I believe <strong>every guild/CoP should produce artifacts to avoid becoming a chit-chat round</strong>. <strong><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">GitLab’s Handbook</a></strong> is an excellent reference for that kind of handbook. They also wrote a lot about remote work.</li>
<li>I appreciate that James creates awareness of the negative impact remote work can have on our physical and mental health, like a bad diet, lack of movement, overwork, stress, social isolation, and burnout. This is real.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! I really enjoyed James’ book, learned a lot, and got many new impulses from it.</p>
