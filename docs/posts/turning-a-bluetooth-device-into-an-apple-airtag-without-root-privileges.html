                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                        Apple’s Find My network, leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, is the world’s largest
                        device-locating network.
                        We investigate the potential misuse of this network to maliciously track Bluetooth devices. We
                        present <em>nRootTag</em>,
                        a novel attack method that transforms computers into trackable “AirTags” without requiring root
                        privileges.
                        The attack achieves a success rate of over 90% within minutes at a cost of only a few US
                        dollars.
                        Or, a rainbow table can be built to search keys instantly.
                        Subsequently, it can locate a computer in minutes, posing a substantial risk to user privacy and
                        safety.
                        The attack is effective on Linux, Windows, and Android systems, and can be employed to track
                        desktops, laptops,
                        smartphones, and IoT devices.
                        Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates nRootTag’s effectiveness and efficiency across various
                        scenarios.

                        Figure illustrates the overview of Find My offline finding.
                        (1) Through pairing, an AirTag shares the public / private key
                        information with the owner’s device. (2) When the AirTag is
                        separated from the paired device, it advertises its public key
                        via BLE advertisements, known as lost messages. (3) Nearby
                        Apple devices, referred to as finders, generate encrypted lo
                        cation reports and send them, along with the hashed public
                        key, to the Apple Cloud. (4) The Apple Cloud allows anyone
                        to use a hashed public key to retrieve the associated location
                        reports, which can only be decrypted using the correct private
                        key. To ensure anonymity, finders do not authenticate whether
                        a lost message is sent from an Apple device.

                        <p>
                            Figure illustrates the architecture of our design.
                            (1) The Trojan code runs on the computer to be tracked. It retrieves the
                            advertising address, acquires the matching public key from our server, and then advertises
                            lost messages.
                            (2) The Server processes requests for acquiring public keys through rainbow table
                            lookup or online key search.
                            (3) The Database system, which contains a rainbow table of key information,
                            provides the corresponding public/private key pair for a given advertising address.
                            (4) The Key Generation and Search serves two purposes: it is used to precompute the
                            rainbow table,
                            and invoked to search for a matching public/private key pair on the fly.
                            Finally, given a public key, the server uses its hash value to query the Apple Cloud for
                            location reports, then decrypts the reports using the private key.

                        Our study examined several consumer-grade GPUs, such as the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and RTX 4090,
                        as well as data center-grade GPUs, the A100 (80GB) and H100 (80GB).

                        Although the H100 achieves the highest key generation speed, its prohibitively high cost makes
                        the RTX 3080 a more economical option for performance.
