            <p>I have a small car, and it has a dual-tank: gas and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas">LPG</a>, which is a great
way to reduce my car-related budget, as LPG is way cheaper. Unfortunately, when
the tank is starting to get depleted, the car will emit strident and loud beeps
to notify me about it. And every single time time, it startles me like Hell,
which isn&#39;t something I appreciate very much, especially when I&#39;m steering a 1
ton metal box to overtake a trailer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoroutes_of_France#Motorway_speed_limits">130km/h on the
highway</a>.
To make things even double-plus-good, a full-screen &#34;LPG tank almost depleted!&#34;
message will cover the whole dashboard. The very same dashboard that constantly
have at its bottom the current level of said LPG tank.</p>
<p>The only time I want my car to maybe make some noise is when some critical shit
is happening, like the oil level decreasing at an alarming rate. Having it yell
at me that I&#39;m only able to drive around 100 more kilometers on LPG, while I
have a <strong>full gasoline tank</strong> affording me a total autonomy of like 1000
kilometres is anything but. I hate this, I hate that it&#39;s not configurable, I
hate that it&#39;s waking everyone asleep in the car (especially toddlers), and I
fucking hate that my car is actively lowering the safety of its passengers by
scaring its driver. And of course, the notification will repeat a couple of
times, at seemingly random intervals, likely because the complete bellend who
designed this terrible scheme is taking the ever-lowering worldwide car-crash
statistics as a personal affront, and is on a mission from God to fix this.</p>
<p>This major papercut made me think about how making noise for anything but the
direst emergency should be an off-by-default privilege that only the user can
explicitly grant, instead if being the default for all electricity-powered
objects. I&#39;m a CyberSecurity Professional™, earning a living breaking into
computer and computer-adjacent systems, so I own the bare minimum in terms of
Smart Devices™, and yet, yet I realised that I still have a non-zero amount of
infernal noise-making crap.</p>
<p>For example, my washing machine has an obnoxious alarm when it completes a
cycle, that can fortunately be disabled via a (hidden!) menu. Now, I get it, it
might be useful to have some kind of alarm so that you don&#39;t forget your
soaking clothes and have them rot into a new variant of whatever medieval
disease. But, the alarm, while exceedingly loud, only lasts a handful of
seconds, making it close to useless. Moreover, if you forget your laundry long
enough for it to decay, you kind of deserve to have a Nurgle cult growing in
your basement. Even assuming for the sake of the argument that this
anti-feature could somehow be useful, this isn&#39;t the only yapping caused of
this fiendish machine: the fucking &#34;beep&#34; happening every time one turns the
knob or presses a button can&#39;t be deactivated. And don&#39;t you fucking dare talk
to me about accessibility: all buttons are touch-sensitive, so useless to
visual-impaired users, and all tones are exactly the same, making them
absolutely useless for anything but waking up/startling the sleeping and
unsuspecting house inhabitants. But this isn&#39;t everything, of course there is
more: it has a &#34;cute&#34; tone when it starts, for no fucking reason at all. Why is
this a thing? Who the fuck thought it would be a good idea? What&#39;s the
reasoning behind this? It&#39;s a washing machine, there is no complicated fragile
boot sequence, no hazardous warm-up shenanigans: I press the power-on button,
it starts. Imagine having this ludicrous behaviour on all your objects: Opening
your faucet? &#34;DUDUDUDUUUUUUUU!&#34; Unlocking your front-door?
&#34;LULULUUUUULULUUUUUU!&#34; Turning on the cooktop hood?
&#34;LALALAAAAAAALAAAAAALAAAAA!&#34; Maybe turning your lights on in your living room?
The Ride of the Valkyries starts blasting at full volume.</p>
<p>As electricity is green-ish and cheap-ish where I&#39;m living, I have the luxury
of having a drier as well, forming an unholy honky duo with the washing
machine: while it thankfully doesn&#39;t have a startup sound, the interaction-beep
can&#39;t be disabled there as well, nor can the alarm. You know, the alarm telling
me that my clothes are dry… There is no reasons, let alone urgency, that I
should get any form of audio notification about this. I could spent 6 months in
the hospital after a car crash because of the aforementioned LPG <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_trumpets">seven
trumpets</a>, come back to my place,
and find my cloths still impeccably dry.</p>
<p>The kitchen isn&#39;t spared either: my hotplates will try their very best to make
everyone deaf should something like a dishcloth, or perish the though, some
water be present on more than two touch-sensitive buttons at once. I fail to
conceptualize what the issue is here, and why this warrants all this racket:
doing nothing would be perfectly acceptable. Heck, if something really has to
be done for whatever regulation bullshit or whatnot, how about blinking the
lights used to convey that the plates are hot? Or, if you really need to take
action, just turn them off automatically. Really, anything but something that
would shame a car alarm in every way.</p>
<p>But the very best, my complete favourite, &#34;the world class, maybe even the
world champion&#34; (kudos if you know where this is coming from), is a fucking
baby-phone that beeps when you turn it on. The use-case is &#34;monitoring a
sleeping child&#34;, and the loud beep tends to wake the aforementioned kid up. May
the gormless cock-up who created this absolute potato of a device spend his
entire life walking on legos.</p>
<p>Fortunately, everything isn&#39;t complete garbage in this world, and I even have a
couple of examples at hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>My dishwasher: no sound whatsoever, it simply opens up when it&#39;s done.</li>
<li>My fridge: should I improperly close its door, it&#39;ll emit some faint noise
  for like 30 seconds. It&#39;s a totally valid important notification, as nobody
      wants to burn electricity to cold the room while the food goes bad.</li>
<li>My ebook reader: it&#39;s physically unable to produce any sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world is dire enough as it is without having me adding to my shopping
criteria &#34;does it shut the fuck up?&#34; to an already long list. If you&#39;re
designing objects, please take some time to test their notification mechanism
near an asleep toddler and/or a sleep-deprived lunatic, instead of making
piling more noisy interruptions to our already notification-saturated reality.</p>
