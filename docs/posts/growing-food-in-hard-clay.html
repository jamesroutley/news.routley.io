    <h1>Growing food in hard clay</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>I have the kind of garden plot where you’re lucky to even push a shovel into the ground. The rocky clay is so hard it’s not only exhausting to work, it broke my neighbor’s tractor when he tried to till it. That’s why I ended up building <a href="https://www.unprepared.life/p/why-we-recommend-raised-bed-gardens?s=w" rel="">raised beds</a> to grow food, and we offer them as a general recommendation to budding gardeners because it’s an easy, reliable method that works pretty much anywhere. And — very important in these times — they help you get growing fast.</p><p>However, raised beds won’t last forever. Wood rots — even pressure-treated wood. Metal rusts away. Stone beds can last nearly forever, but they’re a pain to build, and even then compost disappears and the beds sink unless you refill them every so often.</p><p>Long term, we want to build up our native soil so we don’t need the crutch of raised beds. Dumping a box of compost on top of the ground can go a long way toward improving the soil, as it adds organic matter and beneficial bacteria that loosen and liven up dead soils. At least in theory.</p><p>But some of us need more help. <a href="https://www.thesurvivalgardener.com/" rel="">David the Good</a>, one of my favorite gardening authors and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/davidthegood" rel="">YouTubers</a>, has been tracking the journey of his friend Elizabeth. She started with concrete-like soil and has successfully turned it into a beautiful and productive garden. Not only that, but she uses no commercial inputs and has thus closed her <a href="https://www.unprepared.life/p/closing-dependency-loops-for-sustainability?s=w" rel="">dependency loops</a>. Let’s see how she did it.</p><h2>Lasagna Gardening Fail</h2><p>No-till gardening is the hottest thing going in the horticultural world. In traditional gardening and farming, you use tools and machines to till or pulverize the ground until it’s loose enough for delicate human-cultivated plants to grow in it. That’s a lot of work, it’s energy-intensive, and it causes soil erosion.</p><p>In no-till gardening, you pile on organic matter and let it rot, and as it rots, it breaks down into rich soil while worms and beneficial bacteria loosen up the soil underneath. At least in theory.</p><p>Perhaps the most popular method of no-till gardening is lasagna gardening. In essence, you build a layered compost pile over your garden bed and then either wait for it to break down or throw soil on top and plant into it.</p><p>Elizabeth tried lasagna gardening on her rock-hard soil. While she built nice, fluffy soil on the top of her hard clay, the hardpan underneath remained hardpan. The dirt was so hard that not even organic matter could penetrate it. She pulled some up with a broadfork and as you can see in the video thumbnail, it was just one solid layer.</p><p id="youtube2-goUfl4x8URc" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;goUfl4x8URc&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/goUfl4x8URc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>The problem with soil like this is plant roots can’t penetrate deeply into the ground, which means they can’t draw as many nutrients as they otherwise could, and the plants are extremely sensitive to drought. The deeper roots can go, the healthier your plants will be.</p><h2>Attempt 2: JADAM</h2><p>Tilling in gypsum and adding organic matter on top let Elizabeth have a productive garden, and next she turned to JADAM to take things to the next level.</p><p id="youtube2--CcYaUvyQzc" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;-CcYaUvyQzc&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-CcYaUvyQzc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p><a href="https://en.jadam.kr/" rel="">JADAM</a> is an offshoot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_natural_farming" rel="">Korean Natural Farming</a> invented by Youngsang Cho and documented in the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3yWZlay" rel="">JADAM Organic Farming</a></em>. JADAM is similar to biodynamics in that it’s based around a number of preparations made from locally sourced natural materials. Unlike biodynamics, there are no <a href="https://www.biodynamics.com/conference/2020/family-and-childrens-resources" rel="">gnomes or sylphs</a> involved.</p><p>One example of a JADAM technique is soaking weeds or crop residues in water to make a nutrient tea, and then applying it to the soil. That’s a pretty common and reliable technique. David the Good calls it “fetid swamp water.”</p><p id="youtube2-6izQfXMO9nY" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;6izQfXMO9nY&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6izQfXMO9nY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>A more curious JADAM method is boiling potatoes, mixing them in a bag with leaf mold, soaking the bag in water until it foams up from the microbial activity, and then applying that to your garden soil. The idea is that it floods your garden with beneficial local microorganisms. I’ve tried this myself, and the only result I could see was the compost in my raised bed vanishing. Unfortunately, the soil underneath remained as hard as ever.</p><p>I continue to investigate both JADAM and Korean Natural Farming because the idea of growing food with inputs from my own property is too tempting to resist. The JADAM book is fascinating, but kind of hard to read due to poor translation. You might find Nigel Palmer’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ly405H" rel="">The Regenerative Grower&#39;s Guide to Garden Amendments</a> </em>a more accessible introduction, but I still remain skeptical of how effective these techniques are.</p><h2>What Eventually Worked</h2><p>After four long years, Elizabeth’s hard work and experiments paid off.</p><p id="youtube2-F3qjW8liBp4" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;F3qjW8liBp4&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F3qjW8liBp4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>So what worked in the end? Elizabeth…</p><ul><li><p>…first had the area tilled and she had <a href="https://amzn.to/3G7kZuk" rel="">gypsum</a> disced in. Gypsum is a mineral that helps loosen clay soil.</p></li><li><p>…covered the garden with ten large round bales of hay.</p></li><li><p>…spread chicken run dirt on the garden. Chicken manure is loaded with nitrogen.</p></li><li><p>…added more gypsum over the years.</p></li><li><p>…planted cover crops. A cover crop is something you grow not for food, but to protect and improve the soil. Good examples include clover, peas, sorghum, and winter rye. Many cover crops have dense roots that help break up compacted soil. You then later chop or till those cover crops into the soil to add organic matter.</p></li><li><p>…spread wood chips over the garden.</p></li><li><p>…added rabbit manure when they had <a href="https://www.unprepared.life/p/why-you-should-consider-raising-rabbits?s=w" rel="">rabbits</a>.</p></li><li><p>…mixed chicken run dirt with water and sprayed it over the garden. You wouldn’t want to do this over food, especially leafy greens. She sprayed cover crops and mulch with it. She identified that as a turning point.</p></li><li><p>…also tossed in alfalfa pellets. You can buy these at Tractor Supply or any feed store. Alfalfa is a nitrogen-fixing crop, so the pellets make a nice fertilizer.</p></li></ul><p>When the soil recompacted, she broadforked the area, which helped break up the soil, but it also mixed in some of her wood chips into the soil. When high-carbon materials like wood chips are mixed into soil, bacteria consume a great deal of nitrogen to break those down, so it slowed down her garden output for a season.</p><p>The key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Organic matter on its own won’t loosen up clay soil, as evidenced by Elizabeth’s lasagna gardening fail.</p></li><li><p>To really loosen up clay soil, you need to add gypsum, and it may be worth tilling it in when starting out.</p></li><li><p>Once gypsum is added, add in as much organic matter as possible to bring life and nutrients to the soil. Elizabeth added alfalfa pellets, chicken dirt, hay, rabbit manure, and wood chips, but you could also add grass clippings, shredded leaves, and even kitchen scraps.</p></li><li><p>Always be growing something. If you’re not growing food, grow a cover crop instead to discourage weeds and improve your soil.</p></li></ul><p>I’ll definitely be using some of Elizabeth’s methods in my garden. I have plenty of chickens and rabbits and a big pile of woodchips.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1092,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:5792700,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa73291-8493-42f2-88d6-21cbc9373359_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a></figure></div><p>Be sure to subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/davidthegood" rel="">David the Good’s YouTube channel</a> for more survival gardening knowledge.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
