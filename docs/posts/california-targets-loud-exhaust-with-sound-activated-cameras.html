			<ul><li><strong>In an effort to reduce noise pollution, California is set to implement camera-automated exhaust noise enforcement.</strong></li><li><strong>The pilot program will span from January 2023 to December 2027 and will be tested in six different cities across the state.</strong></li><li><strong>Camera-enforced fines will be issued only after subsequent violations of the 95- and 80-decibel ceiling for cars and motorcycles, respectively.</strong></li></ul><ol></ol><hr/><p>Well known for <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a39738488/california-wants-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a39738488/california-wants-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035/">stringent emissions and modification regulations</a>, the California State Legislature has approved a five-year automated enforcement<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1079&amp;showamends=false" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1079&amp;showamends=false"><u> pilot program </u></a>targeting <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a1866256/your-exhaust-sound-real-or-digital-0/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a1866256/your-exhaust-sound-real-or-digital-0/">loud exhaust from cars</a>. If signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the camera-enforcement program will begin January 1. The bill specifies six undisclosed cities throughout California to take part in this experimental program.</p>

<p>A &#34;sound-activated enforcement system&#34; means sensors are activated when noise levels exceed legal limits, and smart cameras are used &#34;to obtain a clear photograph of a vehicle license plate,&#34; the text of Senate Bill 1079 reads. Similar to speed-camera thresholds found around the world, these cameras are triggered by high decibel levels and can zero in on the offender&#39;s plate. It is not immediately clear how these cameras will pinpoint vehicles in traffic, or how they will differentiate between cars and motorcycles.</p><div data-align="center" data-size="medium">

<p>These cameras will pose a conundrum for manufacturers and enthusiasts alike. <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28659341/loudest-cars-tested-decibels/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28659341/loudest-cars-tested-decibels/">Some cars</a> and many motorcycles, depending on the road and driving style, will easily exceed the 95 and 80 decibel limits straight from the factory. <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28659341/loudest-cars-tested-decibels/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28659341/loudest-cars-tested-decibels/">Based on <em>Car and Driver</em> testing</a>, examples include the 2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS (108 decibels) and the 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and 2019 McLaren 720S Spider, both at 99 decibels. </p><p>It will be curious to gauge the accuracy of the enforcement devices, how manufacturers will continue to alter vehicles for California markets, and if the progressive penalty policies become a blueprint for more equitable traffic enforcement. In the meantime, California residents will be making the switch over to the high-pitched hum of <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a39738488/california-wants-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a39738488/california-wants-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035/"><u>electric power </u></a>anyway.</p>
