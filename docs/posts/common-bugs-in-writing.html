    <h1>Common Bugs in Writing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>Preface <small>(suggested by Bob Briscoe)</small></p>

<ul>
<li>Be clear what you&#39;re trying to say before you write it.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get attached to words you have written; be prepared to scrap
what you wrote while you were thrashing around trying to work out what
you wanted to say, even if its a whole paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like almost all rules, there are cases where breaking them is a good
idea and seasoned writers may well object with &#34;but&#34; responses for some
of these.  Thus, consider the rules below as mental rumble strips - you
should probably slow down and think if you encounter these cases.</p>

<ol>
<li>Avoid use of passive tense if at all possible.  Example:  &#34;In each
reservation request message, a refresh interval used by the sender is
included.&#34; reads better and shorter as &#34;Each ...  message includes ...&#34;</li>

<li>Use strong verbs instead of lots of nouns and simple terms
rather than fancy-sounding ones. Examples:
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>verbose, weak verbs, bad
</th><th>short, strong, good

</th></tr><tr>
<td>make assumption
</td><td>assume

</td></tr><tr>
<td>is a function of
</td><td>depends on

</td></tr><tr>
<td>is an illustration
</td><td>illustrates, shows

</td></tr><tr>
<td>is a requirement
</td><td>requires, need to

</td></tr><tr>
<td>utilizes
</td><td>uses

</td></tr><tr>
<td>had difference
</td><td>differed
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</li><li>If you find yourself saying &#34;In other words,&#34; it means you didn&#39;t say
it clearly enough the first time.  Go back and rewrite the first
attempt.</li>

<li>Avoid filler words, e.g., by converting sentences into a simple
actor-action-object phrasing.</li>

<li>Check for missing articles, particularly if your native tongue
doesn&#39;t have them.  Roughly, concepts and classes of things don&#39;t, most
everything else more specific does.  (&#34;Routers route packets.  The
router architecture we consider uses small rodents.&#34;) Don&#39;t use articles
in front of proper nouns and names (&#34;Internet Explorer is a popular web
browser.  The current version number is 5.0.  Bill Gates did not write
Internet Explorer.&#34;) [NEED POINTER HERE]</li>

<li>Each sentence in a paragraph must have some logical connection to
the previous one.  For example, it may describe an exception (&#34;but,&#34;
&#34;however&#34;), describe a causality (&#34;thus,&#34; &#34;therefore,&#34; &#34;because of
this&#34;), indicate two facets of an argument (&#34;on the one hand,&#34; &#34;on the
other hand&#34;), enumerate sub-cases (&#34;first,&#34; &#34;secondly&#34;) or indicate a
temporal relationship (&#34;then,&#34; &#34;afterwards&#34;).  If there are no such
hints, check if your sentences are indeed part of the same thought.  A
new thought should get its own paragraph, but still clearly needs some
logical connection to the paragraphs that preceded it.</li>

<li>Protocol abbreviations typically do not take an article, even if the
expanded version does.  For example, &#34;The Transmission Control Protocol
delivers a byte stream&#34; but &#34;TCP delivers a byte stream,&#34; since it an
abstract term. (&#34;The TCP design has been successful.&#34; is correct since
the article refers to the design, not TCP.)</li>

<p>Note that abbreviations for organizations do take a definite article,
as in &#34;The IETF standardized TCP.&#34;</p>

<p>Since the &#34;P&#34; in TCP, UDP and similar abbreviations already stands
for &#34;protocol,&#34; saying the &#34;the TCP protocol&#34; is redundant, albeit
common.  (LCD, Liquid Crystal Display, is another common case where many
are tempted to incorrectly write LCD display.  Indeed, Google references
2,060,000 instances of that usage.)</p>

<li>Use consistent tense - present, usually, unless reporting results
achieved in earlier papers.</li>

<li><b>None</b>:  None can take either singular or plural verbs,
depending on the intended meaning (or taste).  Both <i>none of these
mistakes are common</i> and <i>none of these mistakes is common</i> are
<a href="http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-non2.htm">correct</a>,
although other sources <a href="http://www.llrx.com/columns/grammar1.htm">only lists the
singular</a> and <a href="http://grammar.uoregon.edu/agreement/singplr.html">The Tongue
untied</a> makes finer distinctions based on whether it refers to a unit
or a measure.</li>

<li>Use hyphens for concatenated words:  &#34;end-to-end architecture,&#34;
&#34;real-time operating system&#34; (but &#34;the computer may analyze the results
in real time&#34;), &#34;per-flow queueing,&#34; &#34;flow-enabled,&#34; &#34;back-to-back,&#34;
...</li>

<p>In general, hyphens are used
</p><ul>
<li>adding prefixes that would result in double vowels (except for co-,
de-, pre-, pro-), e.g., supra-auditory;</li>

<li>all-: all-around, all-embracing;

</li><li>half-: half-asleep, half-dollar (but halfhearted, halfway);

</li><li>quasi-: quasi-public

</li><li>self-: self-conscious, self-seeking (but selfhood, selfless)

</li><li>to distinguish from a solid homograph, e.g., re-act vs. react,
re-pose vs. repose, re-sign vs. resign, re-solve vs. resolve, re-lease
vs. release

</li><li>A compound adjective made up of an adjective and a noun in
combination should usually be hyphenated.  (WiT, p.  230) Examples: 
cold-storage vault, hot-air heating, short-term loan, real-time
operating system, application-specific integrated circuit,
Internet-based.

</li><li>words ending in -like when the preceding word ends in &#39;l&#39;, e.g.,
shell-like

</li></ul>

<li>Don&#39;t overuse dashes for separation, as they interrupt the flow of
words.  Dashes may be appropriate where you want to contrast thoughts
very strongly or the dash part is a surprise of some sort.  Think of it
as a very long pause when speaking.  In many cases, a comma-separated
phrase works better.  If you do use a dash, make sure it&#39;s not a hyphen
(- in LaTeX), but an em-dash (--- in LaTeX).

</li><li>Avoid <a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/local/doc/punctuation/node31.html"><i>scare
quotes</i></a>, as they indicate that the writer is distancing himself
from the term or the term is meant to be ironic.</li>

<li>Numbers ten or less are spelled out: &#34;It consists of three
fields,&#34; not &#34;3 fields&#34;.</li>

<li>Use until instead of the colloquial <i>till</i>.</li>

<li>Use. <i>Eq. 7</i>, not <i>Equation (7)</i>, unless you need to fill
empty pages.</li>

<li><i>Optimal</i> can&#39;t be improved - <i>more optimally</i> should be
<i>better</i> or maybe <i>more nearly optimal</i>.</li>

<li>Avoid in-line enumeration like:  &#34;Packets can be (a) lost, (b)
stolen, (c) get wet.&#34; The enumeration only interrupts the flow of
thought.  (There are exceptions, e.g., when you later refer to these
cases.)</li>

<li>Avoid itemization (bullets) in most cases, as they take up extra
space and make the paper read like PowerPoint slides.  Bullets can,
however, be used effectively to emphasize key points, if used sparingly. 
If you want to describe components or algorithms, often the LaTeX
description environment works better, as it highlights the term,
providing a low-level section delineation.</li>

<li>Avoid bulleted lists of one-sentence paragraphs.  They make your
paper look like a slide presentation and interfere with smooth
reading.</li>

<li>Instead of &#34;Reference [1] shows&#34; or &#34;[1] shows,&#34; use &#34;Smith [1]
showed&#34; or &#34;Smith and Jones [1] showed&#34; or &#34;Smith <i>et al.</i> [1]
showed&#34; (if more than two authors).  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/writing/style/topic_76.html">&#34;et
al.&#34;</a> is generally used for papers with more than two authors.  (Note
that &#34;et al.&#34; makes the subject plural if the authors are the subject of
the sentence <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/99886/is-et-al-used-as-a-singular-or-plural-subject">rather
than the paper</a>, so it is &#34;Smith et al.  [1] show&#34; not &#34;shows&#34;.  Some
authors prefer to treat the article as the, singular, subject, but this may
sound peculiar to some readers, so the construction is probably best avoided
or rephrased to make the article more clearly the subject. For example, &#34;Section
3 of Smith and Wesson [42] claims that...&#34; or &#34;Smith and Wesson claim that
... [42]&#34; or &#34;In [42], Smith and Wesson claim that...&#34;.) Or,
alternatively, &#34;the foobar protocol [1] is an example ...&#34;.  This keeps
the reader from having to flip back to the references, as they&#39;ll
recognize many citations by either author name or project name.  No need
to refer to RFC numbers in the text (except in RFCs and Internet
Drafts).  Exception for very low-level presentation:  &#34;RFC822-style
addresses&#34;. While there is no firm rule, it seems preferable to include
the reference immediately after the author name, rather than at the end
of the material describing the citation. This keeps the reader from
having to look ahead on encountering the reference and avoids
inconsistent phrasing and guessing when multiple papers are cited for a single fact,
as in &#34;Hertz [1] and Marconi [2] worked on radio waves&#34;, rather than
&#34;Hertz and Marconi worked on radio waves [1,2].&#34;</li>

<li>Use normal capitalization in captions (&#34;This is a caption,&#34; not
&#34;This is a Caption&#34;) unless your style guide requires heading-style
capitalization.</li>

<li>All headings must be capitalized consistently, either in heading
style, capitalizing words, or sentence style, across all levels of
headings.</li>

<li>Parentheses or brackets are always surrounded by a space:  &#34;The
experiment(Fig.  7)shows&#34; is wrong; &#34;The experiment (Fig.  7) shows&#34; is
right.</li>

<li>Avoid excessive parenthesized remarks as they make the text hard to
read; fold into the main sentence.  Check whether the publication allows
footnotes - some magazines frown upon them.  More than two footnotes per
page or a handful per paper is a bad sign.  You probably should have
applied to law school instead.</li>

<li>The material should make just as much sense without the footnotes.
If the reader constantly has to look at footnotes, they are likely to
lose their original place in the text. As a matter of taste, I find URLs
better placed in the references rather than as a footnote, as the
reader will know that the footnote is just a reference, not material
important for understanding the text.</li>

<li>There is no space between the text and the superscript for the
footnote.  I.e., in LaTeX, it&#39;s <tt>text\footnote{}</tt> rather than
<tt>text \footnote{}</tt>.</li>

<li>Check that abbreviations are always explained before use. 
Exceptions, when addressed to the appropriate networking audience:  ATM,
BGP, ftp, HTTP, IP, IPv6, RSVP, TCP, UDP, RTP, RIP, OSPF, BGP, SS7.  Be
particularly aware of the net-head, bell-head perspective.  Even basic
terms like PSTN and POTS aren&#39;t taught to CS students...  For other
audiences, even terms like ATM are worth expanding, as your reader might
wonder why ATM has anything to do with cells rather than little green
pieces of paper.</li>

<li>Never start a sentence with &#34;and&#34;. (There are exceptions to this
rule, but these are best left to English majors.)</li>

<li>Don&#39;t use colons (:) in mid-sentence. For example, &#34;This is possible
because: somebody said so&#34; is wrong - the part before the colon must be
a complete sentence.</li>

<li>Don&#39;t start sentences with &#34;That&#39;s because&#34;.</li>

<li>In formal writing, contractions like <i>don&#39;t</i>, <i>doesn&#39;t</i>,
<i>won&#39;t</i> or it&#39;s are generally avoided.</li>

<li>Be careful not to confuse <code>its</code> with <code>it&#39;s</code>
(it is).</li>

<li>Vary expressions of comparison:  &#34;Flying is faster than driving&#34; is
much better than &#34;Flying has the advantage of being faster&#34; or &#34;The
advantage of flying is that it is faster.&#34;.</li>

<li>Don&#39;t use slash-constructs such as &#34;time/money&#34;.  This is acceptable
for slides, but in formal prose, such expressions should be expanded
into &#34;time or money&#34; or &#34;time and money,&#34; depending on the meaning
intended.</li>

<li>Avoid <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/businesscliches">cliches</a>
like &#34;recent advances in ...,&#34; &#34;exponential growth,&#34; and &#34;paradigm&#34;. 
You do not want readers of your work to play <a href="http://lurkertech.com/buzzword-bingo/">buzzword bingo</a>.  Other
words should be <a href="http://www.lssu.edu/banished/">banished</a>.</li>

<li>Don&#39;t use symbols like &#34;+&#34; (for &#34;and&#34;), &#34;%&#34; (for &#34;fraction&#34; or
&#34;percentage&#34;) or &#34;-&gt;&#34; (for &#34;follows&#34; or &#34;implies&#34;) in prose, outside of
equations.  These are only acceptable in slides.</li>

<li>Avoid capitalization of terms.  Your paper is not the U.S. 
Constitution or Declaration of Independence. Technical terms are in
lower-case, although some people use upper case when explaining an
acronym, as in &#34;Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)&#34;.</li>

<li>Expand all acronyms on first use, except acronyms that every reader
is expected to know. (In a research paper on TCP, expanding TCP is
probably not needed - somebody who doesn&#39;t know what TCP stands for
isn&#39;t likely to appreciate the rest of the paper, either.)</li>

<li>Each paragraph should have a lead sentence summarizing its content.
If this doesn&#39;t work naturally, the paragraph is probably too short. Try
reading just the first lines of each paragraph - the paper should still
make sense. For example,
<blockquote>
There are two service models, integrated and differentiated service. 
Integrated service follows the German approach that anything that isn&#39;t
explicitly allowed is verboten.  It strictly regulates traffic, but also
makes the trains run on time.  Differentiated service follows the Animal
Farm appraoch, where some traffic is more equal than others.  It seems
simpler, until one has to worry about proletariat traffic dressing up as
the aristocracy.
</blockquote>

</li><li><tt>$i$th</tt>, not <tt>$i-th$</tt>.</li>

<li>Units are always in roman font, never <i>italics</i> or LaTeX math
mode.  Units are set off by one (thin) space from the number.  In LaTeX,
use ~ to avoid splitting number and units across two lines.  <tt>\;</tt>
or <tt>\,</tt> produces a thin space.</li>

<li>For readability, powers of a 1,000 are divided by commas.</li>

<li>Use &#34;kb/s&#34; or &#34;Mb/s,&#34; not &#34;kbps&#34; or &#34;Mbps&#34; - the latter are not
scientific units.  Be careful to distinguish &#34;Mb&#34; (Megabit) and &#34;MB&#34;
(Megabytes), in particular &#34;kb&#34; (1,000 bits) and &#34;KB&#34; (1,024
bytes).</li>

<li>It&#39;s always kHz (lower-case k), not KHz or KHZ.</li>

<li>It&#39;s Wi-Fi, not WiFi (or wifi), since this is a trademark.</li>

<li>Operating systems such as Android, (Mac)OSX, Linux or Windows are
typically capitalized.</li>

<li>It is not common to use the trademark symbol ® (or its country cousins
<sup>SM</sup> and <sup>TM</sup>) unless you are the owner of the mark
and then only on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2014/03/12/when-and-how-do-i-have-to-use-trademark-symbols/">first
use</a>.</li>

<a href="http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictK.html">Units and
Measurements</a>, <a href="http://pcroot.cern.ch/TaligentDocs/TaligentOnline/DocumentRoot/1.0/Docs/books/SG/SG_28.html">Taligent
style guide</a>

<li>Use &#34;ms,&#34; not &#34;msec,&#34; for milliseconds.</li>

<li>Use &#34;0.5&#34; instead of &#34;.5,&#34; i.e., do not omit the zero in front of
the decimal point. (<i>Words into Type</i> recommends that &#34;for
quantities less than one, a zero should be set before the decimal point
except for quantities that never exceed one.&#34;)</li>

<li>Avoid &#34;etc.&#34;; use &#34;for example,&#34; &#34;such as,&#34; &#34;among others&#34; or,
better yet, try to give a complete list (unless citing, for example, a
list of products known to be incomplete), even if abstract. See also
Strunk and White:

<blockquote>
Etc.:  Not to be used of persons.  Equivalent to <b>and the rest, and so
forth</b>, and hence not to be used if one of these would be
insufficient, that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any
important particulars.  Least open to objection when it represents the
last terms of a list already given in full, or immaterial words at the
end of a quotation. 

At the end of a list introduced by <b>such as</b>, <b>for example</b>,
or any similar expression, etc.  is incorrect. 
</blockquote>

</li><li>If you say, &#34;for example&#34; or &#34;like,&#34; do not follow this with &#34;etc.&#34;.
Thus, it&#39;s &#34;fruit like apples, bananas and oranges&#34;. The &#34;like&#34; and &#34;for
example&#34; already indicate that there are more such items.</li>

<li>Avoid excessive use of &#34;i.e.&#34;.  Vary your expression:  &#34;such as,&#34;
&#34;this means that,&#34; &#34;because,&#34; ....  &#34;I.e.&#34; is not the universal
conjunction!</li>

<li>Remember that &#34;i.e.&#34; and &#34;e.g.&#34; are <i>always</i> followed by a
comma.</li>

<li>Do not use ampersands (&amp;) or slash-abbreviations (such as s/w or
h/w) in formal writing; they are acceptable for slides.</li>

<li>&#34;respectively&#34; is preceded by a comma, as in &#34;The light bulbs lasted
10 and 100 days, respectively.&#34;</li>

<li><i>Therefore</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>hence</i> and <i>thus</i> are
usually followed by a comma, as in &#34;Therefore, our idea should not be
implemented.&#34;</li>

<li>Never use &#34;related work<b>s</b>&#34; unless you are talking about works
of art.  It&#39;s &#34;related work&#34;.</li>

<li>Similarly, &#34;code<b>s</b>&#34; refer to encryption keys, not multiple
programs. You would say &#34;I modified multiple programs,&#34; not &#34;multiple
codes&#34;.</li>

<li>Use &#34;in Figure 1&#34; instead of &#34;following figure&#34; since figures may
get moved during the publication or typesetting process.  Don&#39;t assume
that the LaTeX figure stays where you put it.</li>

<li>Text columns in tables are left-aligned, numeric columns are aligned
on the decimal or right-aligned.</li>

<li>Section, Figure and Table are capitalized, as in &#34;As discussed in
Section 3&#34;.  Figure can be abbreviated as Fig., but the others are not
usually abbreviated, but that&#39;s a matter of taste - just be consistent.</li>

<li>Section titles are <em>not</em> followed by a period.</li>

<li>In LaTeX, tie the figure number to the reference, so that it doesn&#39;t
get broken across two lines:
<pre>Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}
</pre>

</li><li>Do not use GIF images for figures, as GIFs produce horrible print
quality and are huge.  Export into PostScript.  At that stage, you&#39;ll
learn to &#34;appreciate&#34; Microsoft products.  <tt>xfig</tt> and
<tt>gnuplot</tt> generally produce PostScript that can be included
without difficulties.</li>

<li>Only use line graphs when you are trying to show a functional or
causal relationship between variables.  When showing different
experiments, for example, use bar graphs or scatter plots.</li>

<li>Figures show, depict, indicate, illustrate. Avoid &#34;(refer to Fig.
17)&#34;. Often, it is enough to simply put the figure reference in
parenthesis: &#34;Packet droppers (Fig. 17) have a pipe to the bit bucket,
which is emptied every night.&#34;</li>

<li>If you quote something literally, enclose it in quotation marks or
show it indented and in smaller type (&#34;block quote&#34;).  A mere citation
is not sufficient as it does not tell the reader whether you simply
derived your material from the cited source or copied it verbatim.</li>

<li>Do not refer to colors in graphs.  Many people will print the paper
on a monochrome (black and white) printer and will have no idea what you
are talking about when referring to the red or blue line.  Also, 1 in 12
men and 1 in 200 women are color blind.  Thus, make sure that graph
lines are easily distinguishable when printing on a monochrome printer. 
&#34;Use both color and shape to convey the same meaning; for example, solid
and dashed lines or different fill patterns can help readers understand
the figure without relying solely on color.  Each line of your line
graph should be a thick line with a unique data point symbol.  Connect
the data label to the data line rather than relying on a color key.&#34;
(IEEE)</li>

<li>Avoid numbers with artificial precision.  Unless you have done
enough experiments to be sure that the value measured is indeed
meaningful to five digits after the decimal point, you&#39;re overstating
your results.</li>

<li>Do not forget to acknowledge your funding support.  If you do
forget, you may not have any to acknowledge in the future.</li>

<li>All references must use consistent capitalization for the paper
titles, i.e., either all title-case or all sentence-case.</li>

<li>Technical report citations must have the name of the organization
such as the university or company.  Conferences must cite the
location.</li>

<li>Check your references to make sure they are up to date. For example,
Internet Drafts might have been replaced by RFCs and technical reports
or workshop papers by conference or journal papers.</li>

<li>References should be consistent: all authors should either be given
with their full name (John Doe) or abbreviated (J. Doe), but not
combinations.</li>

<li>Conference references should contain the location of the conference,
the month and some indication such as &#34;Proc.  of&#34; or &#34;Conference&#34;. 
Journal references always contain the volume, issue number and pages. It
must be obvious from the citation whether an article was in a journal or
in a conference.</li>

<li>Only include the year of the publication once, rather than multiple
times in different contexts.  For example, avoid something like &#34;A. 
Doe, &#34;Performance of IEEE 802.11ac in a Rayleigh channel,&#34; in <em>Proc. 
2015 ACM Intern.  Conf.  on Mobile Computing</em>, Rome, Italy, May
2015.  ACM Press, 2015.</li>
