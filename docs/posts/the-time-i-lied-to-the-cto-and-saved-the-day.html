    <h1>The Time I Lied to the CTO and Saved the Day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This was several years back.  Keep in mind that early in my
career, my father had told me that doing a good job
often meant doing what needed to be done in spite of your boss.
And by that he meant that you can either make your boss successful
and happy or you can run every decision by your boss. In which
case no one is successful or happy.</p>
<p>I was working at the time for a Fortune 500 company and our CTO had
signed up to deliver a big project for an important client with
whom he had personal connections.  He also decided to outsource a
key part of it to a large tech services firm who claimed they had a product that would do most of the heavy lifting for us.</p>
<p>As has been typical in my career, when the vendor said they had a
product, what they really meant was they had something vaguely
resembling a product that vaguely matched what we needed, and with
heavy customization they could torture it into doing what we
needed.  Of course by customizing their “product” we cleverly
combined all the downsides of vendor software with all the
downsides of custom software.  We simultaneously achieved the holy
grail of bad ideas: an inflexible vendor package that would
have to be forced into doing something it wasn’t designed to do
but would also be forked from their main product codebase  - guaranteeing sooner or later it would be end-of-lifed once the
vendor realized how expensive it was to keep maintaining.
We grumbled to each other about what a horrifically
bad idea this was, especially considering the vendor’s proven
track record in not delivering anything on time.</p>
<p>Because the CTO had a yearly turnover of his direct reports,
every status call about the
project took some variation of “great idea, boss” even though
literally no one involved thought it was even a good idea.</p>
<p>The rest of the project required heavy development in-house
for all the other pieces, so we had our own challenges keeping us
busy.  But even so, as project dates through the summer slipped
and the vendor promised that any day now their product would be
ready to integrate for an October launch date,
it became more and more
obvious to everyone but the CTO that the project was in trouble.
Finally in August the vendor delivered their “product” and
we began the death march to integrate with it.</p>
<p>In September we encountered a show stopper bug.  The vendor
product stored every customer transaction as a json record in a
giant json document.  So as test data accumulated, performance of
the product got slower and slower.  Adding a new transaction
involved reading the entire json document out of the database,
then appending the new record to the end.  The vendor claimed they
could fix this by indexing the transaction fields, and that seemed
to help for a bit until we ran into problem number two.</p>
<p>The database they chose was MongoDB and at the time Mongo had a
record limit of 16MB per document.  So in October when the conversion team started putting real customer data in, we
started hitting the 16MB limit and things took a really
interesting turn.  A decision was made to hide this limitation from
the client and go live a month late, but in the meantime start a
skunkworks project to replace the vendor integration.
Without telling the vendor, either.  So we were simultaneously lying
to our clients <em>and</em> our valued technology partners.</p>
<p>Grumpy Old Dev at the time was
more Enthusiastic Young Dev and so he set his team to building the
replacement.  The vendor had roughtly 70 people engaged on the
project.  Grumpy Young Dev assigned 3 people to replace it. One
to design the database, one to build the back end to interface
with the database, and one to build the business logic/web services.</p>
<p>The client was told we would have a new version in January for them
to test.  It would fix the most critical defects they had
accepted in the original go-live.  But they weren’t told we were
rewriting the entire core system. In just under 2 months. When
the original project had taken over a year to launch.  With only 3
people. Over the holidays.  (You see where this is going.)</p>
<p>And so around about middle of December everyone working on the
project was told (not asked) to work through the holidays.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re reading and you’re not a delivery driven
technical person, you’re probably thinking this is crazy and
it’s time to quit. And you’d be right.  But.  Many of us who really
enjoy software development feel a bit like rock stars.  You spend
months or even years putting the show together, and then your
launch date is like a performance. And you want to hit your launch
date. Part of it is like theater people: the show must go on.  But
you also want to feel like a rock star when all your hard work hits
real users for the first time and you feel that thrill of <em>I did
that</em>.  <em>People like what I did.</em>  I overcame the impossible.  A software launch is like performing live theater for introverts.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/FhNCzZkupJwAAAAC/goldengod-golden.gif" alt="i am a golden god"/></p>
<p>So, by this point it’s almost Christmas. The team has basically
built the replacement software in one month of work.  There are
still some features to hash out.  But these are clever developers
and they’ve been hitting their marks and I know we are going to
make the testing date if they don’t burn out.</p>
<p>So when the CTO comes to me and says holidays are cancelled, I say
“OK.”…</p>
<p>And then for one of the proudest moments of my life, thinking back to my dad’s advice about getting the job done in spite of the boss…</p>
<ul>
<li>“The team is working hard. Today
we hit milestone integration point #73.”</li>
<li>“The team made good progress yesterday, we finished another web
service.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Every day I showed up and told the big boss that we were
hard at work on stuff that we had already completed over the
previous month.</p>
<p>The guys came back a week later, refreshed.</p>
<p>And we hit our dates in January, went live with a great launch, and
were rock stars for a bit.  Maybe more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman&#39;s_Hermits">Herman’s Hermits</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beatles</a>. But it still felt good.</p>

<p>And that’s the time I lied to the CTO.</p>
