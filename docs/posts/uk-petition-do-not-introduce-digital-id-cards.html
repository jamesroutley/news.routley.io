<p>We demand that the UK Government immediately commits to not introducing a digital ID cards. There are reports that this is being looked at.</p>
  <details>
    <summary><span>More details</span></summary>
    <p>We think this would be a step towards mass surveillance and digital control, and that no one should be forced to register with a state-controlled ID system. We oppose the creation of any national ID system.
