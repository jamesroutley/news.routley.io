Gemini is a protocol that supports a world-wide web, much like HTTP/S that we all use today. Gemini sites, or ‚ÄúCapsules‚Äù as they are officially called, use <code>gemini://</code> as the prefix. It‚Äôs the descendant of an even older protocol called Golpher. All of these protocols were created to support different aspects of web browsing and features sets (or lack of features) that were important to their creators and to early web users. Gemini (and Golpher) were reactions in part to the growing bloat in HTTP websites. It‚Äôs not meant to replace the HTTP web, but to offer alternatves for users!</p><p>Permit me to quote their <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/faq.gmi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> summary here, which puts it better than I could:</p><blockquote><p>Gemini is a group of technologies similar to the ones that lie behind your familiar web browser. Using Gemini, you can explore an online collection of written documents which can link to other written documents. The main difference is that Gemini approaches this task with a strong philosophy of ‚Äúkeep it simple‚Äù and ‚Äúless is enough‚Äù. This allows Gemini to simply sidestep, rather than try and probably fail to solve, many of the problems plaguing the modern web, which just seem to get worse and worse no matter how many browser add-ons or well meaning regulations get thrown at them.</p></blockquote><h2 id="why-host-this-blog-on-gemini">Why host this blog on Gemini?</h2><p>In short: For fun! It‚Äôs a pretty neat, text-focused protocol that should align well with my Static Site Generator setup I‚Äôm running in HTTP-land. Gemini is a great option for folks that are more privacy-focused (no ads or JavaScript trackers) and/or desire an quieter web browsing experience, allowing the text content to take center stage. More importantly, it is a statement of support for a more democratic, non-commercialized web. It also provides a lower payload size per page, as most of the blog‚Äôs webpages (being only text) for users who are on low bandwidth connections and/or are concerned about their carbon footprint.</p><h2 id="gemtext-markup">Gemtext markup</h2><p>Posts on gemini pages are written in a markup format. That aligned itself pretty well with my Zola markdown files (blog post files, especially so). There‚Äôs some pre-processing work needed to convert some things over to a Gemfile specific format, but it is very minimal. The biggest changes required are related to:</p><ul><li>links (<code>=&gt; &lt;url&gt; &lt;label&gt;</code> vs. <code>[label](url)</code>)</li><li>replacing/removing custom Zola shortcode blocks</li></ul><p>Markdown elements like blockquotes, headings and general text blocks can all be used without any changes. Getting a script together to process my new Zola posts into Gemini format took some time. I will polish and clean it up some more before publishing it as a tool for other Zola bloggers to use if they want.</p><h2 id="setting-up-gemini-server">Setting up Gemini server</h2><p>After first researching options for Gemini servers, I ended up going with <a href="https://pages.sr.ht/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SourceHut Pages</a>. It was the least setup friction to get going, as it follows the same flow as publishing my HTTP blog with them. I only add a <code>-p GEMINI</code> to the curl command when I push the tar archive up. I also figured that I can always shift to a self-hosted server like <a href="https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Agate</a> once I am confident I‚Äôve worked out the markup conversion tool enough to support posts and that would come with self-hosting the HTTP version of the blog as well.</p><p>You can check out the Gemini Capsule for this blog at <a href="gemini://bugwhisperer.dev">gemini://bugwhisperer.dev</a>. I recommend the <a href="https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lagrange Browser</a> for exploring the Gemini space. Enjoy!</p></div></div>
