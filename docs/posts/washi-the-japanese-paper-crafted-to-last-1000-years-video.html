    <h1>Washi: The Japanese paper crafted to last 1000 years [video]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="video-page-video-section"><p>Japan&#39;s washi paper has been crafted by hand for over 1,500 years and is prized for its beauty, strength, and distinct natural textures. If kept correctly, some varieties can last more than a thousand years. Ancient documents made with washi are proof of its remarkable longevity. BBC presenter Paul Carter visited Echizen to learn about the art of washing paper making.</p><p><time datetime="2025-09-24T09:01:30.643Z">7 days ago</time></p></div></div>
