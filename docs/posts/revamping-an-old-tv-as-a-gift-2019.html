                    <p>This entry is a summary of what I built for my dad&#39;s 50th birthday, in 2017.</p>

<p>The plan was to get a vintage TV to play some shows from the 70s-80s, and
operation should be seamless.</p>

<p>The sacrificial lamb, found in the flea market:</p>

<p>The tuner

<hr/>

<p>The attack plan:</p>



<p>Because the raspberry only outputs composite video, I needed a &#39;composite RF
modulator&#39; that&#39;d convert the signal to a format that this TV can display.</p>

<p>These modulators output different channels at different frequencies.
<img alt="" src="https://blog.davidv.dev/images/old-tv/rca-rf.jpg"/></p>

<p>These frequencies are what you &#39;tune&#39; to by rotating the tuner&#39;s knob (<a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/07/11/not-quite-101-uses-for-an-analog-uhf-tv-tuner/">learn more about tuners here</a>).
I left the tv tuner in a fixed channel, the same as what the modulator outputs.</p>

<p><em>Let there be video!</em></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.davidv.dev/images/old-tv/firstboot.jpg"/></p>



<p>With the Pi&#39;s output being displayed on the TV the next step was to get back the
functionality of being able to rotate the knob to change channels.</p>

<p>Switch connected to GPIO

<p>The raspberry pi needs a 5v power source, and the RF modulator needed 9v.</p>

<p>LM7809 and LM7805 placed using part of the TV as a heatsink
<img alt="" src="https://blog.davidv.dev/images/old-tv/7805.jpg"/></p>

<hr/>



<p>Initially, the idea was to have a large set of shows/chapters (and
advertisements) per channel, and pick from them randomly.</p>

<p>I had just recently started to get familiar with <code>gstreamer</code> and could not get
my player to continuously play seamlessly -- either changing pads or containers
or something else would always make it get stuck after a while.</p>

<p>I opted to go with a massive hack: each channel is a single 8-hours long video,
with the advertisements baked in.</p>

<p>On poweroff, the timestamp of the nearest keyframe is saved and on power-on,
playback resumes from there.</p>

<p>When a video reaches the end of playback, it will start again from the
beginning.</p>

<p>The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/DavidVentura/old-tv">here</a>, but be
warned, it is very bad.</p>

<hr/>

<p>First time I got it working -- the black spots are an artifact my phone&#39;s
recording..</p>



<p>Final version</p>





<p>I also made a fake parcel-tracking website that&#39;d display the status of the package.

Our approaches are quite different, as I wanted to have the TV be &#39;stand alone&#39;.</p>
