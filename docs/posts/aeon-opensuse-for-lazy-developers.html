<p>The openSUSE project recently <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2024/05/28/aeon-desktop-brings-new-features-in-rctwo-release/">announced</a>
the second release candidate (RC2) of its <a href="https://aeondesktop.github.io/">Aeon Desktop</a>, formerly known
as MicroOS Desktop GNOME. Aside from the new coat of naming paint,
Aeon breaks ground in a few other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide
automated system updates using snapshots that can be applied
atomically, removing the burden of system maintenance for
&#34;<q>lazy developers</q>&#34; who want to focus on their work rather than desktop
administration. System-tinkerers need not apply.</p>

<p>The idea behind Aeon, as with other immutable (or <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/946526/">image-based</a>) Linux
distributions, is to provide the core of the distribution as a read-only image or
filesystem that is updated atomically and can be rolled back if
needed. Google&#39;s ChromeOS was the first popular Linux-based desktop
operating system to follow this model. Since the
release of ChromeOS a number of interesting immutable
implementations have cropped up, such as <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/">Fedora
Silverblue</a>, <a href="https://projectbluefin.io/">Project Bluefin</a>
(<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954059/">covered here</a> in
December 2023), 
openSUSE&#39;s <a href="https://microos.opensuse.org/">MicroOS</a> (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/927373/">covered here</a> in March
2023), and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core</a>.</p>

<p>What makes up the core software and how the immutable bits are
composed, deployed, and managed varies quite a bit between distributions.
Aeon uses a utility called <a href="https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html">transactional-update</a>
(with openSUSE&#39;s Zypper package manager under the hood) and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:BTRFS">Btrfs subvolumes</a> to
<a href="https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/transactional-update-guide/transactional-update.html">create
and update system snapshots</a>. Basically, instead of installing and
updating a system with individual packages while it is running,
the updates are applied in the background to a separate Btrfs snapshot
and then the system is rebooted into that snapshot. The <tt>/home</tt>
and <tt>/var</tt> directories are, of course, writable Btrfs volumes;
<tt>/etc</tt> uses <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">overlayfs</a>
to apply local changes on top of the default configuration files.</p>

<p>User-installed software for these distributions is separated from the rest of the system
software on a mutable filesystem using some type of application-containerization technology like <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>, or <a href="https://snapcraft.io/about">Snap</a>. In Aeon&#39;s case, user
applications are generally installed via Flatpak, or using a
traditional package manager inside a containerized Linux distribution
of the user&#39;s choice that is managed with <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox">Distrobox</a>. 
(On Aeon, Distrobox uses Podman to run containers.)</p>

<h4>Installation and updates</h4>

<p>The openSUSE YaST team has been <a href="https://yast.opensuse.org/blog/2024-05-17/agama-8">working
on</a> a new installer called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/agama">Agama</a>, but Aeon has its
own installer, the <a href="https://github.com/sysrich/tik">Transactional Installation
Kit</a> (tik). The tik installer is designed to deploy operating
system images to UEFI hardware, which means that users with older
hardware are (at least currently) out of luck when it comes to
installing Aeon. It can also make use of the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Ignition">Ignition</a>
and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Combustion">Combustion</a>
configuration tools to create users, enable services,
install SSH keys, and more, automatically at install time.</p>

<p>As with the rest of the distribution, the philosophy for tik is
&#34;minimal&#34;. Tik does not ask the user to make any
choices about software, how disk partitions should be laid out, or
much else, except to confirm that the installation should
proceed. Users are prompted to choose <em>which</em> disk to use,
when a system has multiple disks. If the target system has a existing MicroOS
installation, tik will offer to back up (and restore) existing users and data as
long as the USB stick with the installer has more free space than the
data stored in the home directory.</p>

<p>After installation, there is a first-run wizard to perform system
configuration. It asks for the usual information: the language
and keyboard layout to use, wireless network connection information,
time zone, and user information. Aeon does not configure a root user,
so the first system user is set up as an administrator and can use
<tt>sudo</tt> to perform any administrative tasks.</p>

<h4>Truly minimal desktop</h4>

<p>Aeon is composed from packages in the openSUSE Tumbleweed and
MicroOS repositories, so Aeon RC2 provides users with an up-to-date <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966187/">GNOME 46</a>
desktop using Wayland. (GNOME 46.2, to be exact.) It also includes Linux
6.9.3, systemd v255, and glibc 2.39.</p>

<p>Many Linux distributions offer &#34;minimal&#34; desktop package
selections, but openSUSE Aeon takes this farther than most. Aside from
some basic applications one would expect with GNOME—such as the
file manager, settings application, and other utilities—Aeon
comes with almost no software installed as part of the base
system. Firefox and GNOME&#39;s text editor, calculator, and terminal
application are all installed as Flatpaks as a second step after the
desktop user logs in the first time. If a user wants a media player,
office suite, email application, or even image and PDF viewers, they
have to be installed separately. That <em>may</em> be taking
minimalism a bit too far, but it does give users a lot of control over
what is installed on their system.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/978229/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/openSUSE-Aeon-sm.png" alt="[openSUSE Aeon minimal
install]" title="openSUSE Aeon minimal install"/></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Aeon is touted as a distribution for users who do not want to
hassle with system administration, but its sparse selection of
software ensures that some up-front work is required to reach the
payoff. For example, aside from having to
install expected utilities like a PDF viewer, the <tt>man</tt> command
and man pages are not part of the default software. Probably the best
way to deal with that is to create a Distrobox container to do one&#39;s work in,
though having the Distrobox man pages available would be
helpful when doing so. (Distrobox <a href="https://distrobox.it/#quick-start">documentation</a> is available
online, of course, but I&#39;ve always reached for man pages first.)</p>

<p>One attractive, and seemingly unique, feature that Aeon offers is
automatic updates for the operating system, installed Flatpaks, and
any distroboxes that one may have set up. It&#39;s not unusual to offer
system and Flatpak updates, but updating distroboxes is usually a task
left to the user. It can become unwieldy quickly if one has several
distroboxes set up that need to be updated manually.</p>

<p>According to the RC2 announcement: there are a few features
targeting better performance. Aeon is the first openSUSE
edition to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram">zram</a> kernel module for
system swap. This is supposed to improve system performance by
avoiding swapping to disk. Aeon&#39;s transactional update system is also
supposed to automatically choose packages compiled with <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2023/03/02/tw-gains-optional-optimizations/">x86-64-v3
optimizations</a> for CPUs with Advanced Vector Extensions version two
(AVX2) extensions, if they are available and the system supports them.</p>

<p>Overall, Aeon looks like a good choice for users who want a
minimal, immutable openSUSE GNOME desktop system. It would be
especially attractive for users who want a distraction-free system
with just a few applications, like an IDE and web browser for
development work. It is probably not a great choice for openSUSE users
who are happy with Tumbleweed or Leap and installing software with Zypper.</p>

<p>Readers interested in trying openSUSE Aeon should check out the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Aeon/InstallGuide">install
guide</a> and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Aeon">overview</a>. The
distribution is still in a release-candidate stage, so rough edges are
to be expected—but it is solid enough to test drive and <a href="https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=openSUSE+Aeon&amp;format=guided">report
bugs</a> if they&#39;re found.</p></div></div>
