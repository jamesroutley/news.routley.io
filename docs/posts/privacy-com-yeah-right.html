        <p>At the behest of <a href="https://www.nickzana.dev">a friend of mine</a>, I decided to get myself a <a href="https://privacy.com">Privacy.com</a> account. I filled it out with my personal information, activated the account, and proceeded to not use it for a couple of months.</p>
<p>There were no suspicious charges (or charges whatsoever) on this account.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, I decided that I finally had a use for Privacy.com, and finally decided to use it. I open up the website, press &#34;add funding source&#34;, and lo and behold!</p>
<p><em><strong>Only active accounts can activate funding cards</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh dear. I go ahead and contact support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>My Privacy.com account is deactivated because of disuse. I am ready to start using Privacy.com again. Please let me know what steps I must take to continue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply back the next day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi XXXXXX,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out! I&#39;m happy to assist you with this. It looks like we were unable to verify your identity using your signup information.</p>
<p>As an alternative, we can verify your identity using a form of US government-issued photo ID (Driver&#39;s license, US passport, etc.)</p>
<p>This information helps us keep Privacy secure, fight fraud, and more—and it&#39;s something you&#39;ll only have to do once!</p>
<p>Please follow this link to complete this step: https://privacy.com/signup/verify</p>
<p>You will be prompted to take or upload photos of yourself &amp; your government issued photo ID. Please make sure your face and the entire ID are visible and clear in the photos.</p>
<p>Note that this can only be completed using this link and is currently not available directly through our mobile app.</p>
<p>This information is treated with the utmost security and is fully encrypted. Your ID will never be shared with a merchant or anyone else who uses Privacy. After this step is completed, we can get you up and running!</p>
<p>Don&#39;t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Privacy Support</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m feeling a little apprehensive as I read that email. Passport? Driver&#39;s license? Ehhhh, might as well give it a shot.</p>
<p>After all, Privacy.com should respect my privacy, right?</p>
<p>I navigate to that link, and I see a little box on my screen with the words &#34;Onfido&#34; written on it. As someone who cares about their privacy, I decide to do a quick check on what Onfido is.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfido">Wikipedia</a>, &#34;Onfido is a technology company that helps businesses verify people&#39;s identities using a photo-based identity document, a selfie and artificial intelligence algorithms.&#34;</p>
<p>If I wasn&#39;t put off before, I definitely was now. But, I&#39;ve heard lots of good things about Privacy.com, so I was willing to give them a shot.</p>
<p>After reading Onfido&#39;s privacy policy first, of course. I&#39;m sure you can see where this is going.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of Onfido’s and/or Provider’s third-party vendors may have access to the facial scan data </li>
<li>Onfido is in no way linked to or responsible for the practices of other Providers. Onfido encourages you to read Company’s privacy policies and terms and conditions, as well as those of other Providers, which may apply to the use of facial scan data extracted from photos and videos.</li>
<li>Onfido may disclose your personal information to an actual or potential buyer (note &#34;potential&#34;)</li>
<li>Onfido may disclose your personal information... or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary... to protect your vital interests or those of any other person</li>
</ul>
<p>There are taken from their <a href="https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/">facial scan policy and release</a> and <a href="https://onfido.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>. As I am not a lawyer, I probably missed some more bits as well.</p>
<p>Not willing to give up hope just yet, I ask Privacy.com&#39;s support team if there was an alternate way for me to verify my identity without Onfido.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I picked Privacy.com to improve my, well, privacy. Is there any way to verify my identity or remove the lock on my account <em>without</em> using Onfido?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I also inserted the lines from the ToC in this email).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey XXXXXX,</p>
<p>I understand your concern here.</p>
<p>Please note that any photos uploaded to Privacy through our online portal will be deleted from Onfido&#39;s system automatically in 30 days.</p>
<p>You can find more information about Onfido by viewing their Privacy Policy (https://onfido.com/privacy/)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is the only way to submit the requested identification photos.</p>
<p>Let me know if this doesn&#39;t work for you and you&#39;d like to have your account closed instead.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>[Privacy.com Support Representative]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirty days? That doesn&#39;t sound right.</p>
<p>&#34;<em>Consistent with directions from the Company, Onfido will permanently destroy your facial scan data when directed to do so by the Company, or within one year of your last interaction with Onfido, whichever occurs first, unless otherwise required by law or legal process to retain the data.</em>&#34;</p>
<p>In that case, I would prefer if my account were closed. Thanks for the help, I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At your request, I&#39;ve closed your account.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I can assist with anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern &#34;Know Your Customer&#34; solutions are broken. There must be a way to follow local laws and regulations to prevent financial fraud without violating their privacy to this extent, right?</p>
<p>I hope someone figures it out soon and lets &#34;Privacy&#34;.com know.</p>
