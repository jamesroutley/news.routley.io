<li>hello internet friends! i hope you&#39;re having a fantastic week.</li>
<li>this week i have been tired, but i am surviving and that&#39;s what counts! it&#39;s frustrating when i&#39;m getting a normal amount of sleep to still be lord, mayor and protector of sleepy town, but what can i do? go back to the sleep clinic so they say &#34;you snore a normal amount actually, go away&#34; again? i think not! suffering sounds easier!</li>
<li>i worry a lot i talk about the same stuff every week, so for a few now i actually read <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-39/">the last weeknotes</a> part way through writing the most recent! you&#39;re so welcome, i know you could definitely tell, and didn&#39;t assume i read my notes already. that&#39;s why i appreciate you so much!</li>
<li>writing process stuff improved somewhat in the wake of reading <a href="https://markcarrigan.net/2024/04/30/how-to-enjoy-writing/">all those blog posts</a> for like a few days... i realise now/learnt about myself that leaving juice in the tank â€”Â aka stopping writing with stuff left to say, so you can pick up from where you were â€”Â doesn&#39;t really work for me, as i still harbour a lot of resentment towards the process of Starting To Write that must be overcome each session, at least if i&#39;m writing for You, the wonderful Public. i think stuff described in a <a href="https://jimhorton.substack.com/p/the-nonwriters-guide-to-writing-a">different post</a> (excuse the substack, sorry) helps a lot. a lot of it is sort of getting over yourself, and the rest is just writing a lot and drawing from your vast, never-seen-by-public-eyes reserves to feed your writing. i know i was down on the zettlekasten people, but i get where they are coming from more now. still, zettlekasten as a note-taking system will never take me alive!</li>
<li>another realisation is that i <em>do</em> write every day if i count the most bog-standard definition; did i type something into my laptop or phone screen that wasn&#39;t a password? i think i have a tendency to say stuff doesn&#39;t &#34;count&#34;. when i was on my 65-day-or-so morning pages streak, that was &#34;journalling&#34;, not &#34;writing&#34;. silly distinctions like that aren&#39;t really helping. even if i refuse to place the bar in hell (is writing a whatsapp message &#34;writing&#34; to anyone?) i can at least not place it squarely on the moon or some other heavenly body? crimes against metaphor, sorry.</li>
<li>i&#39;m getting back into <a href="https://workflowy.com/invite/77722f18.lnx">workflowy</a> (that&#39;s a referal link, innit) as a text editor and quick capture system, as my obsidian runs a 3-hour mile at best on my phone at the minute. this is definitely my own fault as i use a lot of plugins on desktop, and haven&#39;t optimised which ones are on my mobile even a little. i know i can turn off a bunch of stuff but i can&#39;t be bothered. this way works for me, for now.</li>
<li>reading <em>designing an internet</em> and really enjoying it. i&#39;m still very early on, no spoilers.</li>
<li>trying to find the elusive &#34;looks cool, doesn&#39;t make my very flat feet feel like death&#34; trainer. i love these <a href="https://www.storymfg.com/collections/clothing-accessories/products/story-mfg-x-asics-gel-venture-6-vanilla-violet-quartz?_pos=1&amp;_fid=1834692aa&amp;_ss=c">gingham asics</a>, but i don&#39;t actually know if asics fit the &#34;foot hurty&#34; bill! there&#39;s also these gorgeous <a href="https://shop.doverstreetmarket.com/collections/asics/products/cdg-shirt-mens-mens-sneakers-x-asics-2-ss25-fo-k101-s25-2">Â£344 comme des garcons ones</a>, in case anyone is <a href="https://olu.online/coffee">feeling generous</a> lol.</li>
<li>i want to learn to cycle! this is partly in anticipation of moving cities at some point, and partly cos it would be cool to go on long cycles outside london. i&#39;d like to have a way to go a long distance that doesn&#39;t rely on me walking anyway, aforementioned hurty feet hurt often even with a small amount of walking. i have applied for my local council&#39;s lessons so fingers crossed, or <a href="https://olu.online/contact">tell me</a> of your fave private lessons or ways of learning if you also learnt as an adult please?</li>
<li>been thinking about social media/smartphone usage so much for the youTube script. i want to build some stuff with atproto to get into the social media game at least, so if you know any cool projects that want front-end help <a href="https://olu.online/contact">let me know</a>!</li>
<li>i think never graduate week at the <a href="https://recurse.com">recurse center</a> has really inspired me this week, even if i didn&#39;t get to participate as much as i would&#39;ve liked. for those unaware, it&#39;s a place to have a coding sabbatical, to be super-super brief. never graduate week is a celebration of their motto (er, never graduate is the motto!) and community. all alumni are invited back more formally (it&#39;s weird to talk about as you can kind of hang around recurse indefinitely if you have the correct geographic and/or time requirements, but it&#39;s more official than that, and less official than doing a whole new sabbatical, which you can also apply to do!). it&#39;s cool seeing everyone so driven to work on their code and happy to be around each other!</li>
<li>been eating ice cream, sour cream and chive potato snacks, beef pad thai, dal, custard cream biscuits, and drinking copious amounts of tea! oh, and vanilla lattes.</li>
<li>see you next week! ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
