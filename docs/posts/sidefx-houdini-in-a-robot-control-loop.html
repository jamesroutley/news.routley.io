<p><a href="https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/">SideFX Houdini</a> is a tool from the visual effects industry which is used for
tasks which involve procedurally generating or manipulating geometry, like simulating explosions using fluid dynamics or
synthesizing a city based on geometric rules. It provides a node-based visual programming environment with a large
library of common operations built in, but also makes it easy to drop in custom code using its own C-like language
called Vex or Python. The networks of nodes generally flow downward, where each node is outputting modified geometry
based on its inputs, so the results of operations can be aggressively cached. The usual way of working in Houdini is to
build up to a result incrementally, and then when you have what you need you can render out the full, high fidelity
result (images or geometry) as quickly as your available hardware allows. It’s not a tool intended for real-time effects
(like Touch Designer, for example).</p>

<p>But what if you tried to use it in a real-time application anyway? Would that be particularly useful for anything? I
know the answer is yes for at least one application: rapid-prototyping algorithms for controlling robots.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple end-to-end example of doing this with Houdini.</p>



<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/slug.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I have a mobile robotics platform I call Slug that I’ve been hacking on. It’s the bottom half of an electric wheelchair
stuffed with a large DIY 18650-based LiPo battery, drive electronics, and a big inverter so I can plug in my UR5 robot
arm. It’s held together with scrap plywood and hardware store parts. There are a few specific projects that I want to
use it for but it’s also just an excuse to try solving various robotics problems myself.</p>

<p>One of those problems is motion planning. Let’s say I wanted Slug to go over to an object and pick it up. It needs to be
able to figure out where it is relative to the object and then navigate to it through an environment that might have
various obstacles. An old, intuitive, and easy to implement means for accomplishing this is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">dynamic window
approach</a>.</p>

<h2 id="motion-planning-with-the-dynamic-window-approach">Motion Planning with the Dynamic Window Approach</h2>

<p>The basic idea of is to generate (dynamically) a bunch of paths (a window) that the robot could follow from the place
where it currently is, then compute costs for them based on how “good” they are, and finally pick the one that has the
lowest cost. The robot can then follow that path for a little while before repeating the process to adjust its path.
Optimization-based approaches like this can be very pleasant to work with because they allow for a smooth creative
space. You can start out with a naive approach for each part and get something that sort of works, then replace it in
bits and pieces to incrementally improve. Plus it gives you a few knobs that you can turn to explore solutions, like the
relative scales of your costs or how long the candidate paths you generate are, or how often you run the process to
update your plan.</p>

<p>Slug is what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot">differential wheeled robot</a> - it moves forward if the wheels turn together and if they rotate
at the same speed opposite each other then it turns in place. A simple way to think about generating the candidate paths
is to imagine that we take the speeds that the robot is currently turning the wheels and just calculate the path that
the robot would take if those speeds were fixed at slightly different values. That path will look like an arc. Sweep
across a range of speeds and you’ll have a collection of candidate arc paths that the robot could follow in the near
future. Then to score them you can walk along each and see how far away the robot is from obstacles and the goal at
every point. Being close to an obstacle or being far from the goal adds cost to the path. Then you just pick the
candidate path with the lowest total cost and that gives you the new speed for each of the wheels.</p>

<h2 id="building-it-up-in-houdini">Building it up in Houdini</h2>

<p>What does an implementation of this look like in Houdini?</p>

<p>First, to set up the problem I needed some obstacles. I made a square and scattered some points on it. I copied a
cylinder onto each of the points and then shifted the points in all these cylinders by a noise function just for fun.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/making_obstacles.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Then I needed a point for where the robot would start in the scene and a point for where the robot should end up (the
goal). I set a 4 element vector attribute on the robot point and assigned it a quaternion orientation so I could keep
track of what direction the robot was pointing in. I used photogrammetry to 3D scan Slug’s wheeled base and copied that
model onto this point. The goal got an X.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/setting_robot_start_and_goal.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>There is some information about the robot that will be needed to know how to move it and to generate the paths in each
window. For that I attached a few more attributes to note down the radius of the wheels, their physical separation, and
their current rotational velocity.</p>

<p>That’s all that is needed to be ready to implement the algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/dwa_network.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Here is the network which handles one iteration of the algorithm. As a reminder in case you’re not familiar with
Houdini, geometry flows downward through these nodes and each one makes some modifications to it that are passed further
along. At the top are inputs for the point representing the robot with the information about it attached, a point
representing the goal position, and points representing the positions of obstacles.</p>

<p>The <code>gen_possible_paths</code> node is responsible for looking at the current velocities of the robot’s wheels and the
physical information about them and using that to generate a collection of paths that could be followed by adjusting the
wheel speeds. The speeds are just swept linearly over a range relative to their current values and for each a certain
number of points along the path are computed and added to a polyline which will be included in the output of the node.
The polylines are labeled with the wheel speeds that were used to generate them, so that those can be plucked from
whichever one turns out to be the best and used to set the new wheel speeds.  It’s implemented using some Vex code:</p>

<p>A ramp channel (lookup table with a GUI) plus a float channel (slider GUI) are used to tune how the distance to the
obstacles is turned into the actual cost. After we have the costs we just order the paths by them and only keep the one
with the lowest cost.</p>

<p>Here the candidate paths and their costs are visualized (via the <code>viz_cost</code> node) with higher cost paths getting darker
colors. We can see that the robot is going to end up continuing a wide turn past the obstacle to its left. The paths
that would take it into collision with the obstacle have been assigned a high cost.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/candidate_paths.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The last step is to apply the wheel velocities of the lowest cost path to the robot’s state in the <code>use_best_result</code>
node:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>best_path</span> <span>=</span> <span>findattribval</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;prim&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;pt&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>@</span><span>ptnum</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>best_path</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>f</span><span>@</span><span>left</span> <span>=</span> <span>prim</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;left&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>best_path</span><span>);</span>
<span>f</span><span>@</span><span>right</span> <span>=</span> <span>prim</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;right&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>best_path</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All that remains is to move the point representing the robot based on the wheel velocities (the <code>move_robot</code> node below)
and repeat everything over and over. In Houdini you do this with a node called a Solver, which evaluates a network and
then allows you to feed its result back into itself to compute a new output for the next frame. The network we were
looking about above is contained inside of the <code>dwa</code> Subnetwork node inside the Solver here:</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/dwa_solver.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>With that, it works! At least virtually:</p>

<video src="/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/dwa_trajectory_candidates_viz.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>Now let’s do it on the real robot!</p>



<p>We have a new challenge to overcome if we want to do the same thing with the real robot. In the simulation we just
directly compute where the robot is each frame, but with the real robot we can’t directly know where it is in space
relative to the goal point. We need some way to capture its location and inject that into Houdini.</p>

<p>Because this is just an experiment for learning and fun I decided to cheat and use a Vive Tracker, which is a 6 DoF
motion tracker that uses the Lighthouse tracking system from the Vive. It’s relatively easy to use Python to stream high
speed and accurate position and orientation data from the tracker. The more fiddly aspect is getting that data stream
into Houdini. Even though at the start I explained how Houdini is not really meant for real-time applications, it
actually does have some functionality that explicitly supports it inside of a special kind of network called a CHOP
network.</p>

<h2 id="streaming-vive-tracker-data-into-houdini-using-chops">Streaming Vive Tracker Data into Houdini using CHOPs</h2>

<p>CHOPs = Channel Operators. They work very similar to the Surface Operators (SOPs) that I showed for manipulating
geometry in the sections above. But CHOPs are intended for manipulating time-series sequences like animation data or
audio. They support recording inputs from the user or external systems to use to drive animations. But it’s implemented
in a flexible way that let’s you use it pretty much anywhere you would like to.</p>

<p>For pulling in the Vive Tracker data I made CHOP network with a Pipe In node with its source set to network. There’s a
<a href="https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/chop/pipein.html">somewhat clunky network protocol</a> that can be used to
stream data from external software into this node. I slapped together
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jmpinit/fe7188b9e99d928449ae82c50ac1ad24">some Python code</a> for sending in values this way.
Then I wrote some more Python code to plug in the tracker data. After that it was short work to get a model of the
tracker to follow the real one in Houdini:</p>

<video src="/assets/sidefx-houdini-in-a-robot-control-loop/houdini_vive_tracker.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<h2 id="moving-the-real-robot">Moving the Real Robot</h2>

<p>I attached the Vive Tracker to the UR5 and then added a few more nodes to get my virtual robot to have an offset that
matched the real offset between the base and the Vive Tracker. Then when I moved the real Vive Tracker around my
apartment I saw the virtual robot follow the same motion. With that the problem of letting Houdini know where the robot
is was solved.</p>

<p>What remained was to take the wheel velocities computed in Houdini and make it so the actual robot used them.  Houdini
lets you drop down a Python node and run arbitrary code so this task was pretty straightforward. I dumped the wheel
velocity values into some JSON and spat that over the network to another Python script running on a computer on the
robot which then wrote them to the motor controller, making the actual wheels turn.</p>

<p>At this point there are no more challenges to overcome. I set up a chair as a real world obstacle and made a point in
Houdini to mark its position, which was fed into the network in place of the original scattered points I used initially.
I adjusted the goal point to a real world location some distance from the robot. Then I just hit play in Houdini and let
it do its thing:</p>
