</code></pre><p>In terms of binary size, it adds about 330KB (2%) to the compiler executable.</p><p>Jacob made some pretty neat architectural decisions with this one. For instance, it uses the actual machine code instruction encoding for the compiler’s internal MIR structure. This means that instruction encoding is done on the N codegen threads instead of the 1 linker thread.</p><p>All of the previous backends used a shared two-pass liveness analysis. This new backend has its own similar bespoke two-pass liveness analysis, except that the second pass also happens to generate all of the Mir in reverse at the same time! Besides cutting down on the number of passes that need to iterate over each function, making this backend speedier than other backends at generating code, this will allow backend-specific instruction lowerings that match multiple Air instructions to affect liveness and cause earlier instructions to become unused and end up not producing any code. This means that none of the incredibly complex deferred value tracking from the x86_64 backend is needed, allowing the tracking state machine to be vastly simplified.</p><p>It’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison due to missing features, but so far it is significantly faster than the x86 backend:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (117 runs): zig build-exe hello.zig -fno-llvm -OReleaseSmall -target x86_64-linux

        <p>Author: Matthew Lugg</p><p>Less than a week ago, we finally turned on the x86_64 backend by default for Debug builds on Linux and macOS. Today, we’ve got a big performance improvement to it: we’ve parallelized the compiler pipeline even more!</p><p>These benefits do not affect the LLVM backend, because it uses a lot more shared state; in fact, it is still limited to one thread, where every other backend was able to use two threads even before this change. But for the self-hosted backends, machine code generation is essentially an isolated task, so we can run it in parallel with everything else, and even run multiple code generation jobs in parallel with one another. The generated machine code then all gets glued together on the linker thread at the end. This means we end up with one thread performing semantic analysis, arbitrarily many threads performing code generation, and one thread performing linking. Parallelizing this phase is particularly beneficial because instruction selection for x86_64 is incredibly complex due to the architecture’s huge variety of extensions and instructions.</p><p>This worked culminated in a <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/24124" target="_blank">pull request</a>, created by myself and Jacob, which was merged a couple of days ago. It was a fair amount of work, because a lot of internal details of the compiler pipeline needed reworking to completely isolate machine code generation from the linker. But it was all worth it in the end for the performance gains! Using the self-hosted x86_64 backend, we saw anywhere from 5% through to 50% improvements in wall-clock time for compiling Zig projects. For example, Andrew reports being able to build the Zig compiler itself (excluding linking LLVM, which would add a couple of seconds to the time) in 10 seconds or less:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (32 runs): [... long command to build compiler with old compiler ...]

</code></pre><p>By the way, I’m a real sucker for some good <code>std.Progress</code> output, so I can’t help but mention how much I enjoy just <em>watching</em> the compiler now, and seeing all the work that it’s doing:</p>
<p>Even with these numbers, we’re still far from done in the area of compiler performance. Future improvements to our self-hosted linkers, as well as in the code which emits a function into the final binary, could help to speed up linking, which is now sometimes the bottleneck of compilation speed (you can actually see this bottleneck in the asciinema above). We also want to <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/24144" target="_blank">improve the quality of the machine code we emit</a>, which not only makes Debug binaries perform better, but (perhaps counterintutively) should further speed up linking. Other performance work on our radar includes decreasing the amount of work the compiler does at the very end of compilation (its “flush” phase) to eliminate another big chunk of overhead, and (in the more distant future) parallelizing semantic analysis.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly of all, incremental compilation – which has been a long-term investment of the Zig project for many years – is getting pretty close to being turned on by default in some cases, which will allow small changes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxjn7L0hEfN1XLfH1soaUdCksG3FvJkXIS" target="_blank">rebuild in milliseconds</a>. By the way, remember that you can try out incremental compilation and start reaping its benefits <em>right now</em>, as long as you’re okay with possible compiler bugs! Check out <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/21165" target="_blank">the tracking issue</a> if you want to learn more about that.</p><p>That’s enough rambling – I hope y’all are as excited about these improvements as we are. Zig’s compilation speed is the best it’s ever been, and hopefully the worst it’ll ever be again ;)</p>

        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Now, when you target x86_64, by default, Zig will use its own x86 backend rather than using LLVM to lower a bitcode file to an object file.</p><p>The default is not changed on Windows yet, because more COFF linker work needs to be done first.</p><p>The x86 backend is now passing 1987 behavior tests, versus 1980 passed by the LLVM backend. In reality there are 2084 behavior tests, but the extra ones there are generally redundant with LLVM’s own test suite for its own x86 backend, so we only run those when testing with self-hosted x86. Anyway, my point is that Zig’s x86 backend is now <em>more robust</em> than its LLVM backend in terms of implementing the Zig language.</p><p>Why compete with LLVM on code generation?

        <p>Author: Alex Rønne Petersen</p><p>Pull requests <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/23835" target="_blank">#23835</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/23913" target="_blank">#23913</a> have now been merged. This means that, using <code>zig cc</code> or <code>zig build</code>, you can now build binaries targeting FreeBSD 14.0.0+ and NetBSD 10.1+ from any machine, just as you’ve been able to for Linux, macOS, and Windows for a long time now.</p><p>This builds on the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/libc-abi-tools" target="_blank">strategy</a> we were already using for glibc and will soon be using for other targets as well. For any given FreeBSD/NetBSD release, we build libc and related libraries for every supported target, and then extract public symbol information from the resulting ELF files. We then combine all that information into a very compact <code>abilists</code> file that gets shipped with Zig. Finally, when the user asks to link libc while cross-compiling, we load the <code>abilists</code> file and build a stub library for each constituent libc library (<code>libc.so</code>, <code>libm.so</code>, etc), making sure that it accurately reflects the symbols provided by libc for the target architecture and OS version, and has the expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname" target="_blank">soname</a>. This is all quite similar to how the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-ifs.html" target="_blank">llvm-ifs tool</a> works.</p><p>We currently import <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0" target="_blank">crt0</a> code from the latest known FreeBSD/NetBSD release and manually apply any patches needed to make it work with any OS version that we support cross-compilation to. This is necessary because the OS sometimes changes the crt0 ABI. We’d like to eventually <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23875" target="_blank">reimplement the crt0 code in Zig</a>.</p><p>We also ship FreeBSD/NetBSD system and libc headers with the Zig compiler. Unlike the stub libraries we produce, however, we always import headers from the latest version of the OS. This is because it would be far too space-inefficient to ship separate headers for every OS version, and we realistically don’t have the time to audit the headers on every import and add appropriate version guards to all new declarations. The good news, though, is that we do accept patches to add version guards when necessary; we’ve already had many contributions of this sort in our imported glibc headers.</p><p>Please take this for a spin and report any bugs you find!</p><p>We would like to also add support for <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2878" target="_blank">OpenBSD libc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23880" target="_blank">Dragonfly BSD libc</a>, but because these BSDs cannot be conveniently cross-compiled from Linux, we need motivated users of them to chip in. Besides those, we are also looking into <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23879" target="_blank">SerenityOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23906" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23877" target="_blank">Fuchsia</a> libc support.</p>

        <p>Author: Loris Cro</p><p>The official Zig website now builds using standalone Zine. A lot of code got rewritten so if you see regressions on the website, please open an issue. Regressions only please, thanks!</p><p>Normally a Zine update would not be worthy of a devlog entry, but the recent update to it was pretty big as Zine went from being a funky Zig build script to a standalone executable. If you were interested in Zine before but never got the time to try it out, this milestone is a great moment to <a href="https://zine-ssg.io" target="_blank">give it a shot</a>. Run <code>zine init</code> to get a sample website that also implements a devlog for you out of the box.</p><p>P.S. I’ve also added dates to each entry on the page, people were asking for this for a while :^)</p>

We didn’t get the release notes done yet, and I’m calling it a day.</p><p>Tomorrow morning I’ll make the tag, kick off the CI, and then work to finish the release notes while it builds.</p><p>I know there were a lot of things that sadly didn’t make the cut.

        <p>Author: David Rubin</p><p>Lately, I’ve been extensively working with C interop, and one thing that’s been sorely missing is clear error messages from UBSan. When compiling C with <code>zig cc</code>, Zig provides better defaults, including implicitly enabling <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code>. This has been great for catching subtle bugs and makes working with C more bearable. However, due to the lack of a UBSan runtime, all undefined behavior was previously caught with a <code>trap</code> instruction.</p><p>For example, consider this example C program:</p><pre><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>foo</span>(<span>int</span> <span>x</span>, <span>int</span> <span>y</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>foo</span>(<span>0x7fffffff</span>, <span>0x7fffffff</span>)<span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span>(<span>&#34;%d\n&#34;</span>, <span>result</span>)<span>;</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this with <code>zig cc</code> used to result in an unhelpful error:</p><pre><code>$ zig run test.c -lc
fish: Job 1, &#39;zig run empty.c -lc&#39; terminated by signal SIGILL (Illegal instruction)
</code></pre><p>Not exactly informative! To understand what went wrong, you’d have to run the executable in a debugger. Even then, tracking down the root cause could be daunting. Many newcomers ran into this <code>Illegal instruction</code> error without realizing that UBSan was enabled by default, leading to confusion. This issue was common enough to warrant a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/zig-cc-compatibility-with-clang#ubsan-and-sigill-illegal-instruction" target="_blank">Wiki page</a>.</p><p>With the new <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/22488" target="_blank">UBSan runtime merged</a>, the experience has completely changed. Now instead of an obscure <code>SIGILL</code>, you get a much more helpful error message:</p><pre><code>$ zig run test.c -lc
thread 208135 panic: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 2147483647 cannot be represented in type &#39;int&#39;

</code></pre><p>Now, not only do we see <em>what</em> went wrong (signed integer overflow), but we also see <em>where</em> it happened – two critical pieces of information that were previously missing.</p><h2>Remaining Limitations</h2><p>While the new runtime vastly improves debugging, there are still two features that LLVM’s UBSan runtime provides which ours doesn’t support yet:</p><ol><li>In C++, UBSan can detect when an object’s vptr indicates the wrong dynamic type or when its lifetime hasn’t started. Supporting this would require replicating the Itanium C++ ABI, which isn’t worth the extreme complexity.</li><li>Currently, the runtime doesn’t show the exact locations of attributes like <code>assume_aligned</code> and <code>__nonnull</code>. This should be relatively straightforward to add, and contributions are welcome!</li></ol><p>If you’ve ever been frustrated by cryptic <code>SIGILL</code> errors while trying out Zig, this update should make debugging undefined behavior a lot easier!</p>

        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Alright, I know I’m supposed to be focused on issue triage and merging PRs for the upcoming release this month, but in my defense, I do some of my best work while procrastinating.</p><p>Jokes aside, this week we had CI failures due to Zig’s debug allocator creating too many memory mappings. This was interfering with Jacob’s work on the x86 backend, so I spent the time to <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/20511#issuecomment-2638356298" target="_blank">rework the debug allocator</a>.</p><p>Since this was a chance to eliminate the dependency on a compile-time known page size, I based my work on contributor archbirdplus’s patch to add runtime-known page size support to the Zig standard library. With this change landed, it means Zig finally works on Asahi Linux. My fault for originally making page size compile-time known. Sorry about that!</p><p>Along with detecting page size at runtime, the new implementation no longer memsets each page to 0xaa bytes then back to 0x00 bytes, no longer searches when freeing, and no longer depends on a treap data structure. Instead, the allocation metadata is stored inline, on the page, using a pre-cached lookup table that is computed at compile-time:</p><pre><code>

<p>It’s pretty nice because you can tweak some global constants and then get optimal slot sizes. That assert at the end means if the constraints could not be satisfied you get a compile error. Meanwhile in C land, equivalent code has to resort to handcrafted lookup tables. Just look at the top of malloc.c from musl:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>uint16_t</span> <span>size_classes</span>[] <span>=</span> {

<p>Not nearly as nice to experiment with different size classes. The water’s warm, Rich, come on in! 😛</p><p>Anyway, as a result of reworking this allocator, not only does it work with runtime-known page size, and avoid creating too many memory mappings, it also performs significantly better than before. The motivating test case for these changes was this degenerate ast-check task, with a debug compiler:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (3 runs): master/bin/zig ast-check ../lib/compiler_rt/udivmodti4_test.zig

</code></pre><p>I didn’t stop there, however. Even though I had release tasks to get back to, this left me <em>itching</em> to make a fast allocator - one that was designed for multi-threaded applications built in ReleaseFast mode.</p><p>It’s a tricky problem. A fast allocator needs to avoid contention by storing thread-local state, however, it does not directly learn when a thread exits, so one thread must periodically attempt to reclaim another thread’s resources. There is also the producer-consumer pattern - one thread only allocates while one thread only frees. A naive implementation would never reclaim this memory.</p><p>Inspiration struck, and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/42dbd35d3e16247ee68d7e3ace0da3778a1f5d37/lib/std/heap/SmpAllocator.zig" target="_blank">200 lines of code later</a> I had a working implementation… after Jacob helped me find a couple logic bugs.</p><p>I created <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/CarmensPlayground" target="_blank">Where in the World Did Carmen’s Memory Go?</a> and used it to test a couple specific usage patterns. Idea here is to over time collect a robust test suite, do fuzzing, benchmarking, etc., to make it easier to try out new Allocator ideas in Zig.</p><p>After getting good scores on those contrived tests, I turned to the real world use cases of the Zig compiler itself. Since it can be built with and without libc, it’s a great way to test the performance delta between the two.</p><p>Here’s that same degenerate case above, but with a release build of the compiler - glibc zig vs no libc zig:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (32 runs): glibc/bin/zig ast-check ../lib/compiler_rt/udivmodti4_test.zig

        <p>Author: Alex Rønne Petersen</p><p>One of the major things <a href="https://github.com/jacobly0" target="_blank">Jacob</a> has been working on is good debugging support for Zig. This includes an <a href="https://github.com/jacobly0/llvm-project/tree/lldb-zig" target="_blank">LLDB fork</a> with enhancements for the Zig language, and is primarily intended for use with Zig’s self-hosted backends. With the self-hosted x86_64 backend becoming much more usable in the upcoming 0.14.0 release, I decided to type up a <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/LLDB-for-Zig" target="_blank">wiki page</a> with instructions for building and using the fork.</p><p>If you’re already trying out Zig’s self-hosted backend in your workflow, please take the LLDB fork for a spin and see how it works for you.</p>
