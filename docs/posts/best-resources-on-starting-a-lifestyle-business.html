    <h1>Ask HN: Best resources on starting a lifestyle business?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After working in RevOps and sales for VC-backed startups for a few years, I&#39;m considering creating a SaaS business that helps solve problems for a particular niche industry that interests me.</p><p>What are some resources that are useful to look at while I consider embarking on this journey?</p><p>My experience in RevOps &amp; sales the last few years has been that so many influencers are trying to pitch you their guides and resources for a fee. It&#39;s made me suspicious of pretty much anyone selling their insights and made it hard to determine which are of actual value.</p></div></div></div>
