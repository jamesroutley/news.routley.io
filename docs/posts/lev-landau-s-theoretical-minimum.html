<p>The great russian physicist Lev Landau developed a famous entry exam to test his students. This &#34;Theoretical Minimum&#34; contained everything he considered elementary for a young theoretical physicist. Despite its name, it was notoriously hard and comprehensive, and in Landau&#39;s time, only 43 students passed it.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone can provide the list of topics, or even a copy of the exam?</p>

<p>(I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have no chance to pass, but I&#39;d like to see it out of a sense of sportmanship ;-). Also, I think it would make quite a good curriculum of theoretical physics (at least pre 1960).)</p>

<p>The list of topics can be found <a href="http://chair.itp.ac.ru/index.php?sub=minimum" rel="noreferrer">here</a> (in Russian, of course). Nowadays students are examined by collaborators of <a href="http://itp.ac.ru/en/" rel="noreferrer">Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>. Each exam, as it was before, consists of problems solving. For every exam there is one or several examiners with whom you are supposed to contact with to inform that you&#39;re willing to pass this particular exam (they will make an appointment). Everyone can pass any exam in any order. Today Landau&#39;s theoretical minimum (not all 11 exams, but at least 6 of them) is included in the program for students of Department of General and Applied Physics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology" rel="noreferrer">Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</a>).</p>

<p>The program for each exam, as you can see from the link above, corresponds to the contents of volumes in the Course of Theoretical Physics by L&amp;L (usually you have to master almost all paragraphs in the volume to pass the exam).</p>

<p>In the following arXiv article <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0204295v1">Landau&#39;s Theoretical minimum</a>, the author details personal experiences on being one of 42 students ever who passed it, as well as some details of the examination. He also mentions some questions in passing, from which I gather most of them were similar to the exercises and examples of his famous books. </p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Landau gave me the programs of eight courses on theoretical physics.
  Besides, there was one more examination on mathematics — complex
  variables, special functions, the Laplace transformation, etc. By that
  time only a few books of the famous Landau course were published:
  Mechanics, Classical Field Theory, The Theory of Continuous Media and
  the first (classical) part of Statistical Physics. One had to study
  all other courses by reading various books and original papers. For
  example, let me display the list of books/papers which we were
  supposed to study for the Quantum Mechanics course:</p>
