    <h1>Spotify&#39;s Car Thing, due for bricking, is getting an open source second life</h1>

          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify&#39;s idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a> due to &#34;several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues.&#34; A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant &#34;to learn more about how people listen in the car,&#34; and now it was &#34;time to say goodbye to the devices entirely.&#34; Spotify indicated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit&#39;s blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>
