        The destruction of the Amazon rainforest through human activities such as logging, mining and burning to clear land for agriculture are contributing to the devastating effects of climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invest in scaling the Junglekeepers program to protect an additional 250,000 hectares of land in the Peruvian Amazon, building upon Junglekeepers’ established pillars of operation. Empower local communities and create a continuous corridor of protection for a vulnerable part of the Amazon ecosystem.

        The Amazon Jungle stretches across parts of nine South American nations. In Peru, the administrative region of Madre de Dios houses the most mysterious, uncharted and biodiverse area of the Amazon.  Las Piedras River begins in Alto Purus National Park and runs some 650 km. The Las Piedras river is a major tributary of the Madre de Dios River which flows into the Amazon River. The remote headwaters of Las Piedras is the connective tissue between  several of Peru’s most important protected areas, the Alto Purus National Park, Manu National Park and Bahuaha-Sonene National Park.  These areas are home to indigenous communities such as the Yora, Mascho-Piro, Matsigenka, Harakmbt, Yine and some of the last voluntarily isolated nomadic tribes.

        The Las Piedras watershed, which is part of the Tropical Andes hotspot, is one of the most biodiverse places in the world. Species recorded on the existing protected lands include more than 480 bird species, 11 species of monkeys, and at least 19+ IUCN Redlist threatened and endangered species including the Giant Otter, the Jaguar and the Harpy Eagle.  The middle Las Piedras River is a global conservation priority due to its biodiverse rainforests and increasing threats, including the paving of the nearby Interoceanic Highway and increased agricultural expansion.

        After more than a decade of work on the ground and research, Junglekeepers has provided proof of concept of what it takes to sustainbly protect more than 55,000 acres of land.
        For more than 2 years we&#39;ve been protecting the land, pushed back on illegal logging, documented number of unique species endemic to the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our methods work.</strong> Within the current boundaries of the reserve we have seen incidents of illegal logging drop by over 90% and incidents of illegal land acquisition drop to almost zero. Our rangers patrol hundreds of kilometers per year. Within the Junglekeepers protected land, the animals are safe, the ancient trees are safe, and the forest is free to function as it has for millions of years.

          For each $100 donated to Junglekeepers, we use:
          </p><ul>
            <li>$60 for direct land acquisition: the best way to guarantee the land is protected is to own it. This is the only way to fight against illegal logging and land grabs</li>
            <li>$24 for expanding our ranger program: buy food, equipment, maintain our boats and ranger station and other operational expenses</li>
            <li>$10 for salaries for our rangers and administrative staff</li>
            <li>$4 for legal &amp; administrative fees</li>
            <li>$2 for our science &amp; research program</li>
          </ul>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          What do you get when you donate $100?
          </p><ul>
            <li>Updates from the field as we make vital progress</li>
            <li>Your name on a plaque at our ranger station commemorating everyone who contributed to make this dream possible</li>
            <li>And a guilt free life where you know you contributed directly to saving millions of animal heartbeats, endangered species, indigenous communities, undiscovered medicines, and one of the best natural climate change defense biomes on earth!</li>
          </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>$30,000,000</strong>. That feels like a lot, but it&#39;s only 300,000 people donating $100 each. That&#39;s 20 coffees, a night out with friends at a bar or the movies, a nice dinner for 2, ... It&#39;s also the cost of making a real impact for the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens if we raise 30,000,000? We&#39;ll be protecting more than 300,000 acres of pristine wilderness, connecting 3 national parks and creating the biggest protected wildlife corridor on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we don&#39;t achieve our goal? Well we&#39;ll keep trying. We&#39;ve been at this more than 10 years. We&#39;re not stopping anytime soon.
