    <h1>VS Code deactivates IntelliCode in favor of the paid Copilot</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

        <p>With the release of VS Code 1.107, it became known that Microsoft has deactivated the popular IntelliCode extension, which had over 60 million downloads: The extension is now deprecated and the gray inline suggestions no longer work.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/2537" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft refers in the well-hidden announcement</a> from mid-November to the AI extension of Copilot in VS Code, which, however, only offers a free volume of 2,000 suggestions – a limit that developers quickly reach, as Copilot makes a suggestion with every input. From then on, users will need a paid license. The use of IntelliCode required a local model, but was therefore unlimited and free.</p>
<p>The classic IntelliSense with language server for the used language is still free – but without AI support. The following extensions are affected by the shutdown:</p>
<ul><li>IntelliCode</li><li>IntelliCode Completions</li><li>IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit</li><li>IntelliCode API Usage Examples</li></ul>

<h3 id="nav_typescript_7__0"><strong>TypeScript 7 and more agents for VS Code</strong></h3>
<p>Nothing about IntelliCode can be found in the announcement for VS Code 1.107. However, new is the experimental support <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">for TypeScript 7 with the new compiler written in Go</a>. This can be updated with:</p>
<p><code>npm install @typescript/native-preview</code></p>

<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>It is called with</p>
<p><code>npx tsgo</code></p>
<p>instead of <code>tsc</code>. Configuration in VS Code is done with</p>
<p><code>{ &#34;typescript.experimental.useTsgo&#34;: true }</code></p>
<p>Further innovations in the editor concern agents, which can now be controlled via the chat. They continue to run even if the user has closed the chat. Developers can also move agents to other environments, enrich them with context, or classify them as sub-agents. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_107#_agents" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">The blog speaks militarily</a> of an Agent Head Quarter (HQ).</p>
