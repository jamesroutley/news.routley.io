    <h1>SF vs NYC as a Solo AI Founder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    
      <p>Last week, I moved to New York and joined the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a>.</p>

<p>This is after being in San Francisco for a month, staying next to the Embarcadero and attending <a href="https://www.joinodf.com/" target="_blank">On Deck Founders</a>.</p>

<p>I’m living in Downtown Brooklyn now, fortunate to find a place that’s just a five minute walk away from the Recurse Center.</p>

<p>It’s been a pleasure to stay in both the cities. Some differences:</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="san-francisco">San Francisco</h3>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>90%+ people breathe tech &amp; startups. I had an uber driver give me tips on B2B sales since he had a sales job in the past and I talked to him about my <a href="https://gigamind.dev">product</a>.</li>
  <li>Nature is quite accessible. I used to visit a different park every day, some of my favorites being the Salesforce Park and the area around the Presidio.</li>
  <li>Healthier food options than Brooklyn.</li>
  <li>Barely saw one smoker.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Food tastes good (but not great). Less variety.</li>
  <li>Too spread out. I was ubering or cycling from my place at the Embarcadaro to SOMA/Fort Mason every day.</li>
  <li>“Microclimates” are annoying, had to carry around multiple layers in my bag.</li>
  <li>Many places are poorly lit and actively dangerous at night.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="brooklyn">Brooklyn</h3>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Walkable. I’ve got multiple option to shop and eat around me.</li>
  <li>Global food. There’s Chinese, Korean, Polish, Caribbean, Japanese, Italian, and Indian food all within a ten minute walk.</li>
  <li>Excellent public transport. Haven’t felt the need to take an uber once yet, and subway vs cabs usually take similar times.</li>
  <li>Well lit and busy at night, haven’t felt unsafe once.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><span>Dirtier</span> Grimier</li>
  <li>Behind on tech and startups (exception: legaltech)</li>
  <li>Too much noise and chaos (I hear sirens and honking pretty often)</li>
  <li><em>Why does everyone keep jaywalking?!</em></li>
  <li>A smoker at every corner</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next">Next?</h2>

<p>I think I’m going to be heading back to SFO sometime soon. Despite its cons, it is the best place to build in AI. Plus, the consistently good weather &amp; sunlight is a excellent for my mood and productivity.</p>

<p>I also have a larger network there, because all the smartest people seem to move there for work.</p>

<p>What are your experiences in NYC and SFO? Any recommendations for things to do while I’m here on the east coast?</p>
