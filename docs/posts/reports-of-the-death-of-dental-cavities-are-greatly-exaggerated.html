<p>We don’t typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease—in part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry—but it is. And it doesn’t just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process.</p>

<p>I write the word “cavity,” but the phrase “dental caries” is actually more encompassing. First documented in <u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fcaries&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885498770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fV6hWm531mY5HNCQA%2BOggVL5LPnX%2Bz3lcHYc0E7KwWY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries.

<p>Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially—through interviews and social media endorsements—promises to do just that. It’s a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself.</p>

It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, or <i>S. mutans </i>for short.</p>

<p>A few decades later, <i>S. mutans </i>had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but <i>S. mutans </i>secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game.

This opened the door to <i>replacement therapy</i>. A destructive approach to the problem of dental carries would be to use an antibiotic to kill the culprit; with replacement therapy, the idea is to <i>replace </i>the culprit with a version of it that is harmless. An example of this has been explored recently with <u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithsonianmag.com%2Fsmart-news%2Fwhy-the-us-plans-to-release-24-billion-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-180979833%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885539183%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=hknDY4tC3WK%2BdRlBVR66h6LPlY2P6heJe2%2BFQlaPlLw%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-the-us-plans-to-release-24-billion-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-180979833/.

Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated <i>S. mutans </i>and thus bid goodbye to cavities?</p>

<p>A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov’s fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn’t grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated <i>S. mutans </i>did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path.</p>

<p>For a few decades, they laboured to find (or engineer) a strain of <i>S. mutans </i>that apparently checked all of the right boxes.

What would be the consequences of millions of bacteria in the mouth releasing this compound?

BCS3-L1 also had the possibility to disturb the microbiome in the mouth in ways that were not predicted and allow disease-causing microorganisms to grow and thrive. And the fact that this bacterium did not produce acid could theoretically be reversed if it acquired the gene from a neighbouring bacterium.</p>

<p>Still, a new drug application was filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and thus began a decade of back-and-forth.

<p>Goodbye, dentist!</p>

<p>Only, there is a slight problem.</p>

<h2><b>Beyond<i> Streptococcus mutans</i> </b></h2>

<p>This whole technology is predicated on the assumption that dental caries are caused only (or, at the very least, mostly) by <i>S. mutans. </i>That was, after all, the accepted theory in the 1970s when Hillman got the ball rolling.

<p>Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth’s bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop <i>S. mutans </i>from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why <i>S. mutans </i>became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and <i>S. mutans</i>grows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then. But now, with DNA technology, scientists have been able to detect <u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fsj.bdj.2018.81&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885653066%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oeq755JLwoV%2FJ2idF4TbFM3KKRrT%2BimJMp8hU%2BcOcmQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2018.81.

<p>We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system? Will it upset the oral microbiome in ways that have not been tested for? I wish I had answers.</p>

But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it’s fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That’s why fluoride is so good for our teeth.</p>

<p>Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens.</p>
