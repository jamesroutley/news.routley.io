<p>TwoSet Violin, the musical comedy duo comprising Australian violinists Brett Yang and Eddy Chen, has announced the end of its creative output.</p>
<p>On social media, the pair wrote: ‘This will be the last piece of content we post as TwoSet Violin.  It’s been a wild ride with you all for the last 11 years. We’ve all grown up together and it’s kinda surreal that we’re ending our chapter here.   </p>
<p>‘Thank you for all the laughs, the genuine encounters in real life and all the special moments we’ve had with you online and offline. Much love, Brett and Eddy.’</p>
<p>The pair’s post has garnered messages of thanks and appreciation from fans and followers. Violinist Hilary Hahn commented on Instagram: ’So many congrats on a job well done! And thank you for everything you have done for the musical community. Not just classical! You guys rock.’</p>
<p>The post has also been met with confusion and disbelief among the TwoSet Violin community. The duo has pulled the majority of its video content from YouTube, leaving only 29 videos on the platform. Meanwhile, the group’s Instagram account has been left with two posts, with the majority of posts from Yang and Chen’s personal accounts also removed.</p>
<p>The TwoSet Apparel clothing brand has also posted a message stating ‘It’s time to say goodbye,’ inviting fans a final chance to buy their favourite pieces.</p>
<p>TwoSet Violin rose to fame through its YouTube videos that aimed to bring classical music to new audiences. The pair made content often poking fun of themselves and classical music, while also bringing to light issues such as mental health awareness in the classical music industry.</p>
<p>The duo appeared on the cover of <a href="https://www.thestrad.com/featured-stories/digital-double-act-twoset-violin/10939.article"><em>The Strad</em> in August 2020</a>, where they spoke about their success on social media and YouTube, as well as their foray into staging live shows.</p>
<p>In November 2022, the duo achieved a milestone of <a href="https://www.thestrad.com/playing-hub/a-dream-come-true-twoset-violins-4-mil-subs-concert/15740.article">four million YouTube subscribers</a>. They celebrated with a performance with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, for which the pair were loaned two 1708 Stradivari violins from the maker’s ‘Golden Period’.</p>
