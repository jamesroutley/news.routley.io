    <p>Since Anthropic launched <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a> we&#39;ve been using it at <a href="https://molin.ai">Molin</a> a lot. It&#39;s the best programming agent I&#39;ve seen so far: it gives concise answers, it can run shell tools as well as edit files, and it&#39;s smart enough to make the right call — most of the time. The UX is excellent, too: most times you just press Enter to approve or Esc to give it a new instruction.</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve started automating some processes from our engineering team. Some of them were already optimised and thus quick, but less manual work is always better.</p>
<p>We release 1-3 times per week. This involves creating a PR, checking the diff, and then deploying our backend. If we modified the widget script that gets embedded on our merchants&#39; websites then we need to publish that JS bundle too. Not that slow, but not that quick either.</p>
<p>Now Claude can do everything for us thanks to this file stored in <code>.claude/release.md</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>I need your help to create a new release PR.

Releases always happen from branch <span>`staging`</span> into branch <span>`main`</span>.
Release PRs are always prefixed with <span>`Release: `</span> and include a succinct but exhaustive list of what changed, e.g. <span>`Release: refactored A, new B, fixed C`</span>.
To generate the list of changes, simply look at the commit messages that are new in <span>`staging`</span> since <span>`main`</span> was last updated.
Do not create a new branch for the release, unless instructed.

So please:

<span>1.</span> Check if there exists a release PR already. When you check, do not grep, just list ALL PRs.
<span>2.</span> If not, create a new PR from <span>`staging`</span> to <span>`main`</span> as explained above and show me the PR URL. Then stop and ask me if I want to merge it.
<span>3.</span> If I say &#34;next&#34; or &#34;merge&#34;, then you must check if the PR has been merged. If it has been merged already, just say so.
<span>4.</span> If it has not been merged, then you must also check if all checks pass. List them for me.
<span>5.</span> If all checks passed, or I tell you to merge it anyway, then you must merge it.
<span>6.</span> If I say &#34;deploy&#34;, then you must deploy the <span>`main`</span> branch to production. Do so by triggering the GitHub Actions workflow called <span>`Deploy worker`</span>.
</pre></div>
<p><em>Note: Edited for brevity. Claude always reads our <code>README.md</code> first for extra context.</em></p>
<p>When I run it, Claude will use <code>gh</code> and <code>git</code> and follow our checklist. Leverage!</p>
<p>We have similar commands for debugging product feeds, deployments, and more. Here&#39;s <code>bootstrap.md</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>We need to verify that the current dev environment is correctly set up.

<span>-</span><span> </span>verify that we have <span>`node`</span> + <span>`npm`</span> installed and which versions — if not installed then run <span>`brew install node`</span>
<span>-</span><span> </span>ensure the <span>`OrbStack.app`</span> macOS app is installed - if not installed, then suggest the user to install it using <span>`brew install orbstack`</span> because it&#39;s the best way to run Docker on macOS
