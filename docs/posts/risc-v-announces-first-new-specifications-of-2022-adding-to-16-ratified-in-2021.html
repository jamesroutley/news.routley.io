		<h2><i><span>Efficient Trace, Supervisor Binary Interface, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, and Zmmul Multiply-Only Extension Accelerate Embedded- and Large-System Design.</span></i></h2>
<h3><i><span>Six Additional Specifications Already In the Pipeline As Development Extends Into Vertical Applications.</span></i></h3>

<p><b>Nuremberg, Germany – June 21, 2022</b><span> – </span><a href="https://riscv.org/"><span>RISC-V International</span></a><span>, the global open-design standards pioneer, announced its first four specification and extension approvals of 2022 – Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace), RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI), RISC-V Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specifications, and the RISC-V Zmmul multiply-only extension. The news builds on momentum from 2021, in which 16 specifications representing more than 40 extensions were ratified. </span></p>
<p><span>“The RISC-V culture of contribution and collaboration continues to produce impressive and strategic results,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V. “RISC-V members are leaders in the era of open compute, proving that collaboration accelerates innovation through shared investment while growing global opportunity.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“These new specifications accelerate embedded and large-system design,” said Mark Himelstein, CTO of RISC-V. “Debugging is one of the hardest things to do on a chip,” he explained. “E-Trace for RISC-V creates a standard way to do processor trace that’s extremely efficient and is especially useful in embedded system design.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-trace-spec"><span>E-Trace for RISC-V</span></a><span> defines a highly efficient approach to processor tracing that uses a branch trace, ideal for debugging any type of application from tiny embedded designs to super powerful computers. E-Trace for RISC-V </span><a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-trace-spec/blob/main/riscv-trace-spec.pdf"><span>documentation</span></a><span> specifies the signals between the RISC-V core and the encoder (or ingress port), a compressed branch trace algorithm, and a packet format to encapsulate compressed branch trace information. Development and ratification of this specification was led by Gajinder Panesar of Picocom and RISC-V’s E-Trace Task Group.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“RISC-V SBI offers developers a similarly critical resource,” Himelstein added. “The ability to port supervisor-mode software across all RISC-V implementations, essentially allowing developers to write something once and apply it everywhere.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc"><span>RISC-V specification for SBI</span></a><span> architects a firmware layer between the hardware platform and the operating system kernel using  an application binary interface in supervisor mode (S-mode or VS-mode).  This abstraction enables common platform services  across all RISC-V operating system  implementations. Many RISC-V members have already implemented the RISC-V SBI specification in their RISC-V solutions, so ratifying the specification will ensure a standard approach across the entire RISC-V ecosystem, ensuring compatibility. Development and ratification of this specification were led by Atish Patra of Rivos, with work conducted in the Platform Horizontal Steering Committee. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“UEFI is a critical element of any system,” said Himelstein, “In some applications, it may replace basic BIOS software.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-uefi/releases"><span>RISC-V UEFI Protocols</span></a><span> bring existing UEFI standards onto RISC-V platforms. Development and ratification of this specification were led by Sunil V L, Ventana Micro and Philipp Tomsich, VRULL GmbH, with work conducted in the Privileged Software Technical Working Group. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“For many microcontroller applications, division operations are too infrequent to justify the cost of divider hardware,” explained Himelstein. “The RISC-V Zmmul extension will benefit simple FPGA soft cores in particular.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>RISC-V Zmmul Multiply Only enables low-cost implementations that require multiplication operations but not division, and is part of the RISC-V Unprivileged Specification. Development and ratification of this extension were led by Allen Baum, with work conducted in the Unprivileged ISA Committee. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>RISC-V announced the ratifications at Embedded World here, where RISC-V is the </span><a href="https://riscvew22.sched.com"><span>focus of several talks</span></a><span>. RISC-V International is also hosting a pavilion of member-company innovations in the exhibition hall through June 23rd.

<p><b>About RISC-V International</b></p>
<p><span>RISC-V International is the non-profit home of the open standard RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), related specifications, and stakeholder community. More than 2,800 RISC-V members across 70 countries contribute and collaborate to define RISC-V open specifications as well as convene and govern related technical, industry, domain, and special interest groups. RISC-V combines a modular technical approach with an open, royalty-free license model — meaning that anyone, anywhere can benefit from the IP contributed and produced by RISC-V. RISC-V enables the community to share technical investment, contribute to the strategic future, create more rapidly, enjoy unprecedented design freedom, and substantially reduce the cost of innovation.
