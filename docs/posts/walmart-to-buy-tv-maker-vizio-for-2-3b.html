The big-box retailer announced the acquisition as it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/walmart-wmt-q4-2024-earnings-.html">reported its fourth-quarter earnings</a>.</p><p>Vizio shares, which spiked after reports of the deal first emerged last week, closed at $9.53 on Friday. They jumped 15% during early trading Tuesday.</p><p>Walmart and its Sam&#39;s Club warehouse chain have long been major sellers of Vizio devices. But in buying the company, Walmart touted the potential to boost its ad business through Vizio&#39;s SmartCast Operating System, which allows users to stream free ad-supported content on their TVs.</p><p>As it pushes for higher profits, the retail titan has tried to expand its media business Walmart Connect, which comes with bigger profit margins than selling groceries or clothing. The segment&#39;s advertising sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter.</p><p>&#34;We believe VIZIO&#39;s customer-centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points. We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling,&#34; said Seth Dallaire, executive vice president and chief revenue officer of Walmart U.S., in a statement.</p><p>The move comes as Walmart tries to compete with Amazon&#39;s growing ad segment.</p><p>Walmart&#39;s control of the Vizio platform will give companies that advertise with the retailer a greater reach. In a news release, Walmart said Vizio&#39;s SmartCast system has 18 million active accounts.</p><p>The retailer also said it could offer &#34;innovative television and in-home entertainment and media experiences&#34; after it acquires the TV maker.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/18/buffetts-berkshire-keeps-new-stock-pick-secret-again-what-it-means.html"><em>Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire keeps new stock pick secret — again.
