          <div><p><span>Caltrain announced at its monthly Board of Directors meeting that regenerative braking on the new trains is generating and sending back to the electric grid approximately 23% of the energy consumed by the system. The new electric trains are outperforming Caltrain’s original projections, which is welcome news for a public agency that holds sustainability as a core value. </span></p><p><span>Originally estimated to cost approximately $19.5 million annually, Caltrain’s electricity use since the launch of electric service averages 207 MWh on weekdays and 175 MWh on weekends, revising cost estimates to $16.5 million. With the agency expecting approximately $6 million annually in energy credits from the California Air Resources Board’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program, the first year of electric service will have lower fuel costs than the previous diesel service. Currently, Caltrain is providing that power to the grid free of charge as there is no legal requirement for the agency to be reimbursed for the energy generated.</span></p><p><span>Regenerative braking is a technology first introduced to electric trains in 1886. They work by driving an electric motor in reverse to recapture energy rather than losing it as heat during braking. Caltrain’s fleet is designed to return that power to the Overhead Contact System (OCS), which feeds it to the nearest traction power facility. From there, it can be used to power other trains on the system or returned to the grid.</span></p><p><span>“Caltrain is running its service on 100% renewable energy and is returning nearly a quarter of that energy to the grid,” said Michelle Bouchard, Caltrain Executive Director. “The new electric fleet is delivering on its promise of state-of-the-art service, living up to our mission of providing sustainable transportation that enhances quality of life for everyone.”</span></p><p><span>###</span></p><p><em><span>About Caltrain: Owned and operated by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, Caltrain provides rail service from San Francisco to San Jose, with commute service to Gilroy. Serving the region since 1863, Caltrain is the oldest continually operating rail system west of the Mississippi and the first railroad to convert from diesel to electric power in a generation. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Follow Caltrain on </span></em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/caltrain"><em><span>Facebook</span></em></a><em><span> and </span></em><a href="https://twitter.com/caltrain"><em><span>X</span></em></a><em><span>.    </span></em></p><p><em><span>Free translation assistance is available.
