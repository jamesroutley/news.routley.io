    <h1>To Ruby from Python</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    <p>Python is another very nice general purpose programming language. Going
from Python to Ruby, you’ll find that there’s a little bit more syntax
to learn than with Python.</p>

<h3>Similarities</h3>

<p>As with Python, in Ruby,…</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s an interactive prompt (called <code>irb</code>).</li>
  <li>You can read docs on the command line (with the <code>ri</code> command instead
of <code>pydoc</code>).</li>
  <li>There are no special line terminators (except the usual newline).</li>
  <li>String literals can span multiple lines like Python’s triple-quoted
strings.</li>
  <li>Brackets are for lists, and braces are for dicts (which, in Ruby, are
called “hashes”).</li>
  <li>Arrays work the same (adding them makes one long array, but composing
them like this <code>a3 = [ a1, a2 ]</code> gives you an array of arrays).</li>
  <li>Objects are strongly and dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Everything is an object, and variables are just references to objects.</li>
  <li>Although the keywords are a bit different, exceptions work about the
same.</li>
  <li>You’ve got embedded doc tools (Ruby’s is called rdoc).</li>
  <li>There is good support for functional programming with first-class
functions, anonymous functions, and closures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Differences</h3>

<p>Unlike Python, in Ruby,…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strings are mutable.</li>
  <li>You can make constants (variables whose value you don’t intend to
change).</li>
  <li>There are some enforced case-conventions (ex. class names start with a
capital letter, variables start with a lowercase letter).</li>
  <li>There’s only one kind of list container (an Array), and it’s mutable.</li>
  <li>Double-quoted strings allow escape sequences (like <code>\t</code>) and a special
“expression substitution” syntax (which allows you to insert the
results of Ruby expressions directly into other strings without having
to <code>&#34;add &#34; + &#34;strings &#34; + &#34;together&#34;</code>). Single-quoted strings are like
Python’s <code>r&#34;raw strings&#34;</code>.</li>
  <li>There are no “new style” and “old style” classes. Just one kind.
(Python 3+ doesn’t have this issue, but it isn’t fully backward
compatible with Python 2.)</li>
  <li>You never directly access attributes. With Ruby, it’s all method
calls.</li>
  <li>Parentheses for method calls are usually optional.</li>
  <li>There’s <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code> to enforce access,
instead of Python’s <code>_voluntary_</code> underscore <code>__convention__</code>.</li>
  <li>“mixins” are used instead of multiple inheritance.</li>
  <li>You can add or modify the methods of built-in classes. Both languages
let you open up and modify classes at any point, but Python prevents
modification of built-ins — Ruby does not.</li>
  <li>You’ve got <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> instead of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> (and <code>nil</code>
instead of <code>None</code>).</li>
  <li>When tested for truth, only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> evaluate to a false
value. Everything else is true (including <code>0</code>, <code>0.0</code>, <code>&#34;&#34;</code>, and <code>[]</code>).</li>
  <li>It’s <code>elsif</code> instead of <code>elif</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s <code>require</code> instead of <code>import</code>. Otherwise though, usage is the
same.</li>
  <li>The usual-style comments on the line(s) <em>above</em> things (instead of
docstrings below them) are used for generating docs.</li>
  <li>There are a number of shortcuts that, although give you more to
remember, you quickly learn. They tend to make Ruby fun and very
productive.</li>
  <li>There’s no way to unset a variable once set (like Python’s <code>del</code>
statement). You can reset a variable to <code>nil</code>, allowing the old
contents to be garbage collected, but the variable will remain in the
symbol table as long as it is in scope.</li>
  <li>The <code>yield</code> keyword behaves differently. In Python it will return
execution to the scope outside the function’s invocation. External
code is responsible for resuming the function. In Ruby <code>yield</code> will
execute another function that has been passed as the final argument,
then immediately resume.</li>
  <li>Python supports just one kind of anonymous functions, lambdas, while
Ruby contains blocks, Procs, and lambdas.</li>
</ul>
