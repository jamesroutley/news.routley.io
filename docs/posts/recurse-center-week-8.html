    <h1>Recurse Center: Week 8</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Personal life got in the way for 2 of the 5 days of Week 8, which is unfortunate but happens. I only had time to focus on one project this week, but it was a chunky one: I wrote a linker for <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/brick">Brick</a>’s toolchain.</p>
<p>This isn’t my extremely cursed <a href="https://ryanisaacg.com/posts/wasmtime-dl">wasmtime-dl project</a>. It’s a crate that takes multiple WASM modules, resolves any exports that match imports, smooshes them all together, and outputs a single standalone module. This is crucial for Brick’s compilation process, because I need to combine the user’s compiled program with the runtime I wrote in Rust. I rolled my own linker for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I thought it would be fun (it was)</li>
<li>I wanted to avoid taking a massive C++ dependency</li>
<li>If I write the code, I know it’s doing exactly what I need and nothing else</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two major alternatives I considered, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen?tab=readme-ov-file#tools"><code>wasm-merge</code></a> or <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/WebAssembly.html"><code>wasm-ld</code></a>. The first is part of the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">binaryen</a> project, which is a WASM toolkit; the second is a port of <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/"><code>lld</code></a>. Taking dependencies on either of these major projects would conflict with goal #2 and #3 above. Keeping my dependency tree purely Rust makes building and running the compiler simpler, especially if I want to build the compiler itself to WASM and embed it in a webpage.</p>
<p>Avoiding large dependencies decreases the overall complexity of the project; currently the only dependencies I’m taking are Rust ecosystem mainstays (<code>rayon</code>, <code>anyhow</code>, <code>thiserror</code>, <code>serde</code>) or protocol-specific crates that I <em>could</em> rewrite myself if necessary (<code>wasm-encoder</code>, <code>wasmparser</code>, <code>lsp-server</code>, <code>lsp-types</code>).  If a newcomer wanted to understand the project end-to-end, they would be confronted with around 20,000 lines of Rust. That sounds like a lot, but Binaryen is hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and LLVM is in the <em>millions</em>.</p>
<p>Also, this is probably minor in the scheme of things for performance, but <code>wasm-merge</code> and <code>wasm-ld</code> both work with objects on disk. I wanted to do the linking in-memory before I write out the final binary, for convenience and speed.</p>
<p>Over the weekend between Weeks 8 and 9 I also hacked on an Obsidian plugin. It was a pretty fun experience, and my web background made it very straightforward. I now have a plugin which allows me to review my diary notes from the past week, which I like to do as part of my journaling practice. You can <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/obsidian-diary-review">check it out on Github</a>, but it’s not documented or configurable in the slightest. I might come back and clean it up at some point, but no promises - it’s already doing everything I need.</p>
