<p>So I have finally been accepted to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> Fall 2, 2023 batch. I am super excited to spend the next 6 weeks learning, collaborating and growing as an engineer. RC has been a dream for a long time and I canâ€™t wait to immerse myself in the community. Infact, this was my second attempt trying to get in. I will probably write another post reflecting on my initial rejection, lessons learned and contrasting with the second attempt. For now, I am just celebrating this milestone and looking forward to the retreat. Let the learning begin!</p>
<p>My major plan is to dive deep into Databases, Distributed Systems and pick up Rust. I also want to explore the low level world of Machine Learning (tinygrad, Mojo).</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases
<ul>
<li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf">CMU Intro to DB videos</a></li>
<li>Either complete the <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/assignments.html">CMU Assignments</a> in Go or work on the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan">pingcap talent plan TinySQL and TinyKV</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rust
<ul>
<li>Read the Book</li>
<li>Complete Rustlings</li>
<li>Pick up some interesting projects - to be figured out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distributed Systems
<ul>
<li>Continue reading DDIA</li>
<li>Discuss System Design Case Studies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some exploratory work in low level ML</li>
<li>Apart from this pair program a lot, meet interesting people, build my volitional muscles and have fun!</li>
</ul>
