    <h1>Severance payments at Wikimedia Foundation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>The Wikimedia Foundation <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/LUM4FS6ABPG4TBUFF6QHYJD3FT36W2AU/">released</a> its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_990" title="Form 990">Form 990</a> tax return for 2021 on 9 May 2023. This shows that outgoing CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Maher" title="Katherine Maher">Katherine Maher</a> was paid a severance package of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_2021_Form_990.pdf#page=50">US$623,286</a> in 2021 – slightly more than one-and-a-half times her <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/e/e4/Wikimedia_Foundation_2020_Form_990.pdf#page=48">base compensation</a> in her last full year at the Wikimedia Foundation. So Maher – who left Wikimedia at the end of April 2021 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/katherine-maher/">to join</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council" title="Atlantic Council">Atlantic Council</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-affairs-policy-board/">currently serves</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_department_of_state" title="US department of state">US Department of State</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Policy_Board" title="Foreign Affairs Policy Board">Foreign Affairs Policy Board</a> – earned a total of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_2021_Form_990.pdf#page=49">US$798,632</a> in the 2021 calendar year.</span>
</p>
</div><div>
<p><span>COO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeen_Uzzell" title="Janeen Uzzell">Janeen Uzzell</a>, who was hired by the Wikimedia Foundation in <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/AFWG4HFMPCMTF4YSR3TZ3BIBHEXJP5LW/">late January 2019</a> and left at the end of June 2021 to become the CEO of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_of_Black_Engineers" title="National Society of Black Engineers">National Society of Black Engineers</a> on  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nsbe.org/Articles/june-2021/janeen-uzzell-ceo">7 July 2021</a> (see also the profile in this issue&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2023-05-22/In_the_media" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2023-05-22/In the media">In the media</a> section), received a severance package of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_2021_Form_990.pdf#page=50">US$324,748</a> in 2021. This is roughly equivalent to her <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/e/e4/Wikimedia_Foundation_2020_Form_990.pdf#page=48">last full annual salary</a>; she earned a total of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_2021_Form_990.pdf#page=49">US$515,553</a> from the Wikimedia Foundation in 2021.</span>
</p><p><span>The severance payments made in 2021 set a new record for the Foundation. The highest previous severance payment was <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/6/67/Form_990_FY_2016-2017_-_Public.pdf#page=50">US$262,500</a>. Paid to outgoing CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila_Tretikov" title="Lila Tretikov">Lila Tretikov</a> in 2016, this was about 75% of her <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/44/Wikimedia_Foundation_2015_Form_990.pdf#page=49">last full year&#39;s salary</a>. </span>
</p><p><span>The Foundation noted in its <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/LUM4FS6ABPG4TBUFF6QHYJD3FT36W2AU/">post</a> on the Wikimedia-l mailing list that it would in future use a new, standardised severance policy for staff at all levels, described in a <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/04/06/wikimedia-foundation-global-guidelines-policies-practices/">Diff post</a> published last month. </span>
</p><p>The new policy sets a cap on severance pay of one month&#39;s salary for each year worked at the WMF, up to a maximum of nine months (unless local law dictates otherwise). Under this scheme both Maher and Uzzell, who spent less than two-and-a-half years at the WMF, would have qualified for much smaller severance payments. But even the new scheme allows for &#34;exceptions&#34;: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>The guidelines have also provided an opportunity to better align our processes globally when staff leave the Foundation. This includes a new standardized severance policy for staff at all levels of one month of severance pay for every year of their employment, up to nine months (unless local laws require otherwise) – any exceptions require a joint recommendation by the Head of Talent &amp; Culture and the General Counsel, with final approval from the CEO.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So it seems by no means assured that the new policy will prevent the recurrence of such large severance payments – which are ultimately paid from global Wikipedia donations.

<p><span>Former WMF Board of Trustees Chair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anthere" title="User:Anthere">Florence Devouard</a> asked some <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/62ZB2GLRRQGXGFUUU7SRPJGP6BUGKPHO/">further questions</a> about the new severance policy on the mailing list, which she then also submitted as discussion topics for the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Community_Affairs_Committee/2023-05-18_Conversation_with_Trustees" title="m:Wikimedia Foundation Community Affairs Committee/2023-05-18 Conversation with Trustees">Conversation with Trustees</a> that took place on 18 May 2023 and is available on YouTube.</span>
</p><p><span>The discussions related to executive pay took up about 15 minutes of the 80-minute meeting, beginning <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=1422s">here</a> at time code 23:42 and ending at time code 38:36. First, WMF trustee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NTymkiv_(WMF)" title="User:NTymkiv (WMF)">Nataliia Tymkiv</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=1422s">took</a> the following question: </span>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;I would like to know the trustees&#39; characterisation of the growth of executive compensation and whether they think reducing it to historical levels is preferable to layoffs.&#34;
</p></blockquote> 
<p><span>Nataliia said that while US compensation may seem high to someone from Europe, it was data-based rather than based on fundraising success and always reflected local salary levels, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=1552s">adding</a> that going back to past compensation levels was not feasible: </span>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;There is also no way of returning back to historical, unless we actually start hiring people who are really rich, and they can just allow to be philanthropic, and you know, not receiving salaries, but I think that&#39;s also not sustainable to just expect that rich people who don&#39;t need to care for their bread in the morning can just come and work for us.&#34;
</p></blockquote>

</div><div>
<p>Next came some of the questions about the severance policy that Florence had submitted before the meeting:
</p>
<ol><li>Is the one month of severance pay entirely based on the last month&#39;s salary, the last year or previous years?</li>
<li>Will this policy affect severances for executives?</li>
<li>For staff that are &#34;exceptions&#34;, are there particular staff members that are able to negotiate exceptions when they join the Foundation, do they negotiate their exception when they depart, or is it something that can be discussed during their tenure?</li>
<li>How many staff are considered &#34;exceptions&#34; and will there be a maximum number of exceptions?</li></ol>
<p><span>These questions were partially <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=1727s">answered</a> (time code 28:47) by CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryana_Iskander" title="Maryana Iskander">Maryana Iskander</a>. Maryana explained at length that the new severance policy was part of an effort to harmonise the Foundation&#39;s approach as much as possible across different countries, including for executives, but allowed that there would always be exceptions for various reasons. The policy might also need adjusting in the light of experience. However, she confirmed that the policy will take the last month of paid salary as the basis for calculating the severance.</span>
</p><p><span>This is an important point, as there have already been cases of Wikimedia executives being awarded steep pay rises towards the end of their tenure with the Foundation (see <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_salaries" title="m:Wikimedia Foundation salaries">Wikimedia Foundation salaries</a> on Meta-Wiki). Indeed, according to the Form 990, Katherine Maher was paid <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/14/Wikimedia_Foundation_2021_Form_990.pdf#page=49">US$164,567</a> in base compensation for four months&#39; work in 2021. This would appear to be equivalent to an annual base compensation of US$493,701, considerably more than her <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/e/e4/Wikimedia_Foundation_2020_Form_990.pdf#page=48">US$404,053</a> base compensation in 2020. Questions <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/2UPUBAEZWDP532QSDHPP53VASTEHTPBL/">submitted by Florence</a> that remained unanswered in the meeting were:</span>
</p>
<ol><li>When severance packages would be negotiated or re-negotiated</li>
<li>Whether the WMF would report the numbers or percentages of staff qualifying for an &#34;exception&#34;</li>
<li>Whether there were plans for a maximum severance for those in the exception segment (for example, at most x months per year of employment)</li>
<li>Whether anything is being done to better address the serious escalation of severance packages of the high-level executives</li></ol>
<p>Next, Maryana answered a question on whether there was an incentive system in place to invite Foundation staff to make donations to the Foundation or other Wikimedia entities. She said there was no such system in place, but some staff did voluntarily make such monetary contributions; many of course also volunteered on the projects.
</p>
<h3><span id="Who_approved_these_severance_packages.3F"></span><span id="Who_approved_these_severance_packages?" data-mw-thread-id="h-Who_approved_these_severance_packages?-signpost-article-title"><span data-mw-comment-start="" id="h-Who_approved_these_severance_packages?-signpost-article-title"></span>Who approved these severance packages?<span data-mw-comment-end="h-Who_approved_these_severance_packages?-signpost-article-title"></span></span></h3>
<p><span>The next question was about who approved the above severance packages. Nataliia <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=2141s">explained</a> that the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s Board of Trustees approved them (with input from the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_Talent_%26_Culture_Committee" title="m:Wikimedia Foundation Board Talent &amp; Culture Committee">Talent and Culture Committee</a>), but that severance agreements and related Board votes and resolutions were confidential and not made available to the public. </span>
</p><p><span>The last question in this section of the meeting concerned Maryana Iskander&#39;s and Selena Deckelmann&#39;s compensation. While their salaries were not yet reflected in the 2021 Form 990 (both only joined in 2022, and the 2022 data will only need to be reported in 2024), they were proactively <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan/2023-2024/Foundation_Details#Compensation_Principles" title="m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2023-2024/Foundation Details">disclosed</a> a few weeks ago on Meta: Iskander&#39;s base compensation is currently US$453,000 and that of Selena Deckelmann, Chief Product and Technology Officer, is US$420,000. When <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajgxbZ-E9cA&amp;t=2247s">asked</a> if it was planned to make this kind of proactive disclosure of <i>current</i> executive compensation a regular practice, Iskander gave a non-committal answer:</span>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;It&#39;s not clear that this type of disclosure will be necessary – now that it has been disclosed – in future years. But the intent certainly is to continue to use the Annual Plan as a place to increase visibility, transparency and accountability of information from the Foundation, I think with the intentionality that we, I hope, demonstrated this year.&#34;
