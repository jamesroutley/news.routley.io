		<p>This week sees the start of a course on security engineering that Sam Ainsworth and I are teaching. It’s based on the third edition of my <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">Security Engineering</a> book, and is a first cut at a ‘film of the book’.</p>
<p>Each week we will put two lectures online, and here are the first two. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1x_Oa0XiDI">Lecture 1</a> discusses our adversaries, from nation states through cyber-crooks to personal abuse, and the vulnerability life cycle that underlies the ecosystem of attacks. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDwbNs3J4ec">Lecture 2</a> abstracts this empirical experience into more formal threat models and security policies.</p>
<p>Although our course is designed for masters students and fourth-year undergrads in Edinburgh, we’re making the lectures available to everyone. I’ll link the rest of the videos in followups here, and eventually on the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">book’s web page</a>.</p>
