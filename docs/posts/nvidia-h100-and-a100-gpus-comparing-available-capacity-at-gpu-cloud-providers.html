    <h1>Nvidia H100 and A100 GPUs – comparing available capacity at GPU cloud providers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Capacity info is as of June 14 2023. This covers H100 and A100 available capacity, as well as some comparisons/reviews of the different cloud providers. 

I&#39;d like to write a follow up on building your own GPU datacenter - if you have experience with that and would be happy to give me feedback on that over email, please [email me](mailto:<a href="https://llm-utils.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="ee8d828f97ae9d9a9b8a8781809b838c8b9c948b9c81c08d8183">[email protected]</a>).

## Summary
* If you want access to H100s, use Lambda Labs. (I was wrong here by initially saying Lambda required talking to a sales rep, thanks HN for correcting)
* If you want access to A100s without talking to anyone, use Runpod or Vast.ai.
* If you want access to more than 8xA100s, you&#39;ll need to talk to sales. Lambda Labs or FluidStack are probably your best options. Maybe Google Cloud or Oracle Cloud if you&#39;re comfortable dealing with their more &#34;enterprise&#34; approach.
