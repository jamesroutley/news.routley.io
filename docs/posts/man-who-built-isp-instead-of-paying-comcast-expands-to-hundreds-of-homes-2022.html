    <h1>Man who built ISP instead of paying Comcast expands to hundreds of homes (2022)</h1>

<p>Under the contract terms, Mauch will provide 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data for $55 a month and 1Gbps with unlimited data for $79 a month. Mauch said his installation fees are typically $199. Unlike many larger ISPs, Mauch provides simple bills that contain a single line item for Internet service and no extra fees.</p>
<p>Mauch also committed to participate in the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/isps-must-accept-govt-subsidy-on-all-plans-no-more-upselling-fcc-chair-says/">Affordable Connectivity Program</a>, which provides subsidies of $30 a month for households that meet income eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The contract requires all project expenses to be incurred by the end of 2024, and for the project to be completed by the end of 2026. But Mauch aims for a much quicker timeline, telling Ars that his &#34;goal is to build about half of it by the end of this year and the other half by the end of 2023.&#34; The exact funding amount is $2,618,958.03.</p>
<h2>Comcast wanted $50K, AT&amp;T offers just 1.5Mbps</h2>
<p>Operating an ISP isn&#39;t Mauch&#39;s primary job, as he is still a network architect at Akamai. He started planning to build his own network about five years ago after being unable to get modern service from any of the major ISPs.</p>
<p>As we wrote last year, AT&amp;T only offers DSL with download speeds up to 1.5Mbps at his home. He said Comcast once told him it would charge $50,000 to extend its cable network to his house—and that he would have gone with Comcast if they only wanted $10,000. Comcast demands those up-front fees for line extensions when customers are outside its network area, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/couple-bought-home-in-seattle-then-learned-comcast-internet-would-cost-27000/">even if the rest of the neighborhood already has Comcast service</a>.</p>
<p>Mauch was using a 50Mbps fixed wireless service before switching over to his own fiber network. In addition to his home Internet customers, Mauch told us he provides free 250Mbps service to a church that was previously having trouble with its Comcast service. Mauch said he also provides fiber backhaul to a couple of cell towers for a major mobile carrier.</p>

<h2>County touts “historic” broadband investment</h2>
<p>Mauch has already hooked up some of the homes on the list of required addresses. Washtenaw County issued a <a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/civicalerts.aspx?aid=2210">press release</a> after the first home was connected in June, touting a &#34;historic broadband infrastructure investment&#34; to &#34;create a path for every household to access high-speed broadband Internet.&#34;</p>
<p>The county said it is investing $15 million in broadband projects by combining the federal funds with money from the county&#39;s general fund. Between Washtenaw Fiber Properties and the other three ISPs selected by local government officials, &#34;over 3,000 Washtenaw County households will be connected as a result of this investment in the next few years,&#34; the press release said.</p>
<p>One of the areas covered by Mauch&#39;s funding is around a lake in Freedom Township, where he plans to begin construction on August 22, he said. &#34;Generally speaking, it&#39;s a lower income area as well as an area that has been without service for a very long time, aside from cellular or wireless,&#34; he said. &#34;The goal is to close the gap on them very quickly.&#34;</p>
<p>As for the other three ISPs, the county was <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-approves-15-million-arpa-funds-countywide-broadband">reportedly</a> negotiating with cable giants Comcast and Charter, and Midwest Energy and Communications. Those three companies ended up getting the deals with the county, a contractor working on the overall project confirmed to Ars.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.baller.com/wp-content/uploads/BallerStokesLideStateBarriers7-1-20.pdf">state law</a>, &#34;Municipalities in Michigan are not simply able to decide to build and operate their own networks, they must first issue an RFP for a private provider to come in and build,&#34; the Institute for Local Self-Reliance&#39;s Community Broadband Networks Initiative <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-takes-another-step-toward-countywide-broadband-equity">wrote</a>. &#34;Only if the RFP receives less than three viable offers can a municipality move forward with building and owning the network. There are also additional requirements that municipalities have to follow, such as holding public forums and submitting cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies.&#34;</p>
<p>The county&#39;s <a href="https://imlive.s3.amazonaws.com/Washtenaw%20County/ID227054715951590824298930519180001578145/RFP%20-%208119%20PUBLIC-PRIVATE%20PARTNERSHIP%20FOR%20FILLING%20BROADBAND%20GAPS.pdf">RFP</a> set 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds as the minimum acceptable tier but stated a strong preference for &#34;at least 100Mbps download speeds, ideally with symmetrical upload speeds, from wireline technology to accommodate present and future bandwidth-hungry applications.&#34;</p>
<h2>Mauch faces increasing equipment costs</h2>
<p>Mauch has made some upgrades to his operation. In our previous story, we described how Mauch was renting an air compressor to blow fiber through his conduits. He recently bought an industrial air compressor at a government liquidation auction, spending under $4,000 for equipment that often costs about $20,000, he said. He had previously spent $8,000 on a directional drill machine that installs cables or conduits under driveways and roads without digging giant holes.</p>
<p>Increasing prices have been a problem. Mauch said he used to buy fiber conduit for 32 cents a foot but that he&#39;s paying more than double that now. The <a href="https://www.hubbell.com/hubbell/en/Products/Data-Communications/Underground-Construction/Handholes-Vaults/cl/2863332">handholes</a> that are buried underground at various points throughout Mauch&#39;s network used to cost $300 and are now about $700, he said.
