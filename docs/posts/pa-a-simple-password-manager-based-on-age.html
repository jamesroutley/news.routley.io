  faq
    &gt; how does this differ from pass, passage, etc?

      pa is smaller. simpler. cleaner. plainer.
      harder. better. faster. stronger.
      more than ever, hour after hour
      work is never over

    &gt; why u make this?

      if you&#39;re curious, i wrote a whole blog post about my reasons[2]

    &gt; where are my keys?

      probably in the default locations:
        secret: ~/.local/share/pa/identities
        public: ~/.local/share/pa/recipients

    &gt; where are my passwords?

      probably the default location:
        ~/.local/share/pa/passwords

    &gt; how can i rename a password?

      cd ~/.local/share/pa/passwords
      mv foo.age bar.age
