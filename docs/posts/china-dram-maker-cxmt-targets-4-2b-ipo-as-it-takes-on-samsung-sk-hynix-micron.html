    <h1>China DRAM Maker CXMT Targets $4.2B IPO as It Takes on Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron</h1>

    	        <p><span>On the evening of December 30, Chinese DRAM leader ChangXin Memory Technologies Group Co., Ltd. (CXMT) formally submitted its prospectus to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, applying for a listing on the STAR Market. The offering is being sponsored by state-backed investment bank CICC and Chinese securities firm CSC Financial.</span></p><p><span>CXMT plans to raise up to CNY 29.5 billion, equivalent to approximately USD 4.22 billion, with proceeds earmarked for three core projects: upgrading mass-production DRAM wafer manufacturing lines, advancing DRAM process technologies, and funding forward-looking research and development for next-generation dynamic random-access memory.</span></p><p><span>The company said its current capacity already ranks first in China and fourth globally, but still lags the world&#39;s top three DRAM makers. With China remaining the world&#39;s largest DRAM consumption market, CXMT said the planned investments will accelerate process upgrades, reduce unit costs, enhance profitability, and better meet strong downstream demand, helping the company secure a more favorable position in the global DRAM market.</span></p><p><span>Founded in 2016, CXMT was established against the backdrop of heavy global DRAM concentration, with more than 90% of the market long dominated by Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology. CXMT said it has since broken through key DRAM technologies and achieved independent design, development, and commercial mass production, filling a long-standing gap in mainland China&#39;s DRAM industry.</span></p><p><span>Today, CXMT is China&#39;s largest and most technologically advanced integrated DRAM manufacturer, operating under an IDM model that spans R&amp;D, design, and fabrication. Its product portfolio covers DDR and LPDDR families, including DDR4, DDR5, LPDDR4X, and LPDDR5/5X, serving applications such as servers, mobile devices, PCs, smart vehicles, and AI-related systems.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.ic-pcb.com/web/uploads/image/20260102/3slhtXY513zF37159k01G76nkoFni74s.webp"/></p><p><span>The company launched its first self-developed 8Gb DDR4 product in September 2019, marking what it called a &#34;from zero to one&#34; breakthrough for China&#39;s DRAM sector. Its latest LPDDR5X products reach speeds of up to 10,667 Mbps, a 66% increase over LPDDR5, while its domestically developed DDR5 chips deliver speeds of up to 8,000 Mbps with single-die capacity reaching 24Gb. CXMT said its overall DRAM product roadmap is now broadly on par with global leaders.</span></p><p><span>CXMT operates three 12-inch DRAM fabs in Hefei and Beijing. According to Omdia, Samsung held 40.35% of the global DRAM market by revenue in 2024, followed by SK Hynix at 33.19% and Micron at 20.73%. Based on Omdia estimates, CXMT&#39;s global DRAM market share rose to about 3.97% in the second quarter of 2025, positioning it as an emerging player among major manufacturers.</span></p><p><span>Financially, the company has reported rapid revenue growth but remains loss-making due to heavy capital and R&amp;D investment. From 2022 through the first half of 2025, CXMT generated cumulative revenue of nearly CNY 57 billion, or about USD 8.16 billion. Over the same period, cumulative net losses attributable to shareholders exceeded CNY 40.86 billion, or roughly USD 5.85 billion, reflecting large depreciation charges from capacity expansion, sustained R&amp;D spending, inventory write-downs, and sharp DRAM price volatility.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://www.ic-pcb.com/web/uploads/image/20260102/5GoHk217307v221bB0QcoKZj35P6LeC2.webp"/></span></p><p><span>CXMT said it expects a turnaround in 2025, forecasting full-year revenue of CNY 55 billion to CNY 58 billion, equivalent to USD 7.87 billion to USD 8.3 billion, and net profit of CNY 2 billion to CNY 3.5 billion. The company attributed the expected rebound to surging AI-driven memory demand, tight DRAM supply, rising prices, and the release of inventory accumulated earlier in the cycle.</span></p><p><span>Customer concentration remains relatively high, with the top five customers accounting for more than 60% of revenue during the reporting periods. However, CXMT said it does not rely excessively on any single customer. End customers include major cloud, consumer electronics, and device makers such as Alibaba Cloud, ByteDance, Tencent, Lenovo, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, and others.</span></p><p><span>On the supply side, CXMT said its dependence on major suppliers is limited, with the top five raw material suppliers accounting for less than one-third of total procurement in each reporting period.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://www.ic-pcb.com/web/uploads/image/20251224/7mUxc7eF9X8l7g2U6p3C504wAV611M6I.webp"/></span></p><p><span>R&amp;D remains central to the company&#39;s strategy. From 2022 through the first half of 2025, CXMT invested CNY 18.87 billion in R&amp;D, or about USD 2.7 billion, representing more than 33% of cumulative revenue. As of June 30, 2025, the company employed 4,653 R&amp;D personnel, accounting for over 30% of its workforce, and held 5,589 patents worldwide.</span></p><p><span>The IPO is also notable as the first STAR Market application accepted under China&#39;s new pre-review mechanism for companies engaged in critical core technology development. The system, introduced in mid-2025, aims to shorten review timelines and reduce early disclosure risks for strategically sensitive technologies. CXMT completed two rounds of pre-review inquiries in November 2025, significantly accelerating its listing process.</span></p><p><span>CXMT has a diversified shareholder base and no controlling shareholder. Major investors include state-backed Big Fund Phase II, regional government investment vehicles, and strategic partners such as Alibaba and Tencent.</span></p><p><span>The company said the listing will not only support its own capacity expansion and technology upgrades, but also drive coordinated growth across China&#39;s domestic memory ecosystem, including chip design, equipment, materials, packaging, and downstream applications. As China&#39;s flagship DRAM maker moves closer to public markets, its IPO is widely seen as a milestone for the country&#39;s ambition to build a globally competitive memory semiconductor industry.</span></p>
