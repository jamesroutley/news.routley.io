    <p>Without shooting yourself in the foot, learning lacks motivation. Complexity without reason is really confusing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At the Recurse Center Feb 2020: I watch a talk during presentations about someone optimizing a database engine. It was really complicated, and I remeber nothing about the talk itself. What I do remember is thinking to myself “this seems really complicated for no good reason.” Keep in mind, I had never made a web application at that time and when I needed to store data, I just used a csv file or a python pickle file on the disk. I thought that a filesystem was sufficient for storing data.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months and I’m building my first web application. I don’t remember what it was for, but I remember using a csv file as the database. I had to load the file into memory every time I wanted to look something up and it was just a big pain. I now understood why using a database is (sometimes) a good idea.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Learning Rust, July 2020: I start learning about the borrow checker. It prevents you from keeping a pointer to an item of a vector (<code>&amp;vec[i]</code>) if you pass the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> as a <code>&amp;mut</code>. I don’t really get why this is necessary. I have never done low-level programming before, never used pointers, and now I am being told that following the borrow checker is ‘safe’. It is still very confusing to me.</p>

<p>Fast forward to when I am writing Zig code. I take <code>&amp;array_list.items[i]</code>, append to the <code>array_list</code> and then try to write to the stored pointer. I get a segfault. Ahh, now I get the problem Rust solves.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Learning Vue, July 2020: Why are there all of these complicated ways to represent state? Shouldn’t developing a web app be simpler than this?</p>

<p>After writing a bunch of vanilla JS, I can see why these frameworks could be useful. I have never made a very big web app, but I could see that keeping track of state and what is or isn’t rendered is hard and gets much harder with a bigger web app.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To fully understand a “best practice” or why something is necessary, it’s important to experience how things go wrong without it. When teaching programming, we should let people make these mistakes, and <em>then</em> show them the tools to correct them. Just giving someone a complicated tool without a salient reason to explain its complexity will just make them really confused.</p>

<p>Some opinions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should store stuff in csv files before using a database</li>
  <li>You should learn Zig (or C) before you learn Rust</li>
  <li>You should write a web app in vanilla JS before you learn a framework</li>
  <li>You should write a game from scratch before using Unity</li>
  <li>You should use <code>javac</code> from the command line before using an IDE</li>
</ul>
