<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	  I am posting this assortment of notes and observations as
	a kind of &#34;thank you&#34; to the numerous people who have replied
	to my posts in the past.  The free flow of information is
	the life-blood of the internet community, and this is my feeble
	attempt to maintain that flow, while at the same time repaying
	the kindness shown me by other members of the community in my
	rather obsessive attempts to revive a defunct 4D professional
	series machine.

</p><p>
	I have posted a number of messages concerning my project, and 
	I can say that all the replies I have received have been quite
	helpful. One of the things you learn early on as a denizen of
	the net is the utility of Usenet posts. You also learn that
	the volume of answers can convey almost as much information
	as the content of those answers. If I post a question and
	receive a significant number of replies, then I can be relatively
	certain that others have run across (and possibly solved) the
	same class of problem. If, however, I receive no responses, it
	indicates that this is a new problem not previously encountered
	(quite unlikely, due to the age of the equipment in this case),
	the problem represents a true hardware-level failure (usually
	at the IC level) or the problem is due to some fundamental stupidity
	on my part (by far the most likely scenario!). This means that
	it&#39;s time to re-evaluate the procedure which caused the problem,
	which usually leads to an alternate approach which inevitably
	works. During this project, I have only had 2 genuine hardware
	failures, both of which had very little usenet response. The
	rest of the low-response questions were solved by re-reading
	the documentation available, or using my common sense when
	it was at last evident that this was not a common bug.

</p><p>
	The point of this diatribe is that if you don&#39;t receive an
	immediate response to a usenet post, don&#39;t immediately repost
	it! Think the problem out. If none of the other half-million or so
	people who have seen your post have run across your particular
	problem, then the odds are that it&#39;s due to some fundamental
	mistake or misunderstanding on your part. Step back and look at
	the whole procedure again. Then, if you still can&#39;t think of
	a way around it, repost the problem with more info, or describe
	the event from an earlier point in the timeline. 

</p><p>
	Now, back to my main topic. This whole adventure started when
	when I developed a craving to have my &#34;own&#34; SGI at home.  I use
	one quite frequently at my job, and it did not take very long for me
	to fall in love with the critter :-}. Unfortunately, prices being
	what they are, I decided to piece one together from parts obtained
	via the net (being a hardware hacker at heart!) This proved to be
	quite a challenging project. Cost-wise it was a toss-up between a Professional IRIS
	or Personal IRIS, depending on what I could lay my hands on (At this point
	in my project, I wasn&#39;t about to get picky :-). The first machine to come
	my way turned out to be a Professional series 4D/70GT. Machines in the
	Professional IRIS series are relatively obsolete right now, and their bulk,
	slow speed  and power
	requirements have made them unattractive to their original owners.
	As a result of this, a number of them are most likely heading for the dumpster as we speak!.
	Fortunately, I was able to locate one of these scrapyard refugees
	via the net.  Needless to say, it was nonfunctional and incomplete.
	This resulted in a rather unique learning experience. 

</p><p>
	Because of the size and weight involved, shipping is not an option
	with these critters! After a marathon 400 mile drive, I finally arrived
	back home with the beast in the back of my vehicle. I strongly suggest
	that you get a friend (or three!) to help you unload. I tried it myself.
	Hopefully, my physical therapy sessions will end soon.

</p><p>
	The following document started out as a &#34;how-to&#34; file centered around
	the 4D/70GT. I am currently trying to expand it into a &#34;used-sgi-hardware&#34;
	reference, similar to the excellent one available for older Sun systems. It is not
	my intention to &#34;compete&#34; with the official SGI hardware FAQ! Quite to the contrary,
	I intend this document to serve as an unofficial hardware hacker&#39;s supplement to the
	official SGI FAQs. I have tried to avoid duplicating information available in
	the official FAQs, except where such duplication serves to enhance the clarity
	of a topic being discussed. Along a similar vein, I have tried to avoid including
	information available via IRIX man pages, except where such information may aid
	in the initial boot stages where the man page facility is not available to the poor
	fool <strong>^h^h^h^h^h</strong> experimenter trying to boot a system for the first time.

</p><p>

	I would eventually like to include information about the Indigo and Power series 
	machines. Needless to say, my main emphasis has been (and will continue to be)
	on machines which  I currently own and can tinker with, so information about
	these and other IRIS series may not show up until I can locate enough hardware
	tidbits to bring up a machine in that series. 
	
</p><p>
	This is a work-in-progress, so please excuse any errors. If you do spot a
	problem, or have some info that would be useful to include, please <a href="mailto:acorda@geocities.com">email</a>
	it to me and I will try to incorporate it here. Please note that this
	is an <strong>experimenter&#39;s</strong> document. Whenever you tinker
	with hardware, you run the risk of damaging the hardware, yourself,
	or <strong>both</strong>! Some of the information presented in this
	document comes from old usenet posts of questionable veracity.
	Some comes from my experiments and observations (and even guesses!)
	Where possible, I have tried to	indicate the reliability of the source.
	Never trust anything you read... <em>Always</em> verify it with a O&#39;scope or meter.
	Please pay heed to the following:
</p><blockquote>
	<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong>WARNING!:</strong></SPAN>
	 I am <strong>not</strong> responsible for whatever damage you inflict on your <em>system</em>
	or <em>yourself</em>! I am providing this information in good faith, and in the
	hope that it may help someone else through the hurdles that I had
	to leap. I <em>ferverently</em> hope that common sense will prevail in
	it&#39;s application!  I am <em><strong>not responsible</strong></em> if you toast your system,
	blow up your house, barbecue your cat or fry yourself! Please use <strong>COMMON SENSE</strong>
	when playing with electrical systems. If you have the slightest doubts of your ability in
	these matters, <strong>DON&#39;T TRY!</strong> Find a professional or friend with experience to help you!   
	</blockquote>

<h2><a name="pointers">Pointers to other information sources</a></h2>


<p>

	There are a number of very good information sources on the net.
	To start with, you should print out a copy of the official SGI
	Hardware FAQ. this and other official
	 <a href="https://words.filippo.io/www-viz.tamu.edu/~sgi-faq/index.htm">SGI FAQs</a> will
	 be invaluable to anyone trying to revive a defunct SGI.
</p><p>

	Another useful source of information is the
	 <a href="https://words.filippo.io/sgi.com/Archive/comp.sys.sgi/index.htm">comp.sys.sgi Usenet archive</a>.
	 This archive can be extremely helpful if you simply want to browse
	 through older postings looking for material that might have some
	 bearing on your problem. A good deal of the material in this document
	 was derived from this archive.

	If you would rather use a search engine on the archives, try 
	<a href="https://words.filippo.io/hornet.mmg.uci.edu/~hjm/projects/sgi.wais.html">Harry Mangalam&#39;s SGI WAIS page</a>
	or the
	<a href="https://words.filippo.io/sgi.com/cgi-bin/form_search_archive/SGI">Silicon Graphics Search</a>
	page.
	
</p><p>
	SGI has recently expanded the number of on-line manuals which are
	available through their website. Check out the <a href="https://words.filippo.io/sgi.com/techpubs">SGI Technical Publications Library</a> for
	more information.
</p><p>
	Scott Henry has an excellent page describing the trials and tribulations
	of <a href="https://words.filippo.io/reality.sgi.com/scotth/dialup-support.html">Configuring and Debugging SLIP and PPP Connections</a>. You
	will also find a very useful discription of the <a href="https://words.filippo.io/reality.sgi.com/employees/scotth/remac/modem.config.html#serial_des">Serial Port Design History</a> of
	the ports on Personal IRIS and Indigo systems. I strongly recommend reading
	this if you are trying to use Macintosh peripherals (such as MIDI adaptors)
	on your Personal IRIS 4D/30-35 or Indigo.
</p><p>
 
	If you are considering the purchase of an older SGI system, you
	should take a look at 
	<a href="https://words.filippo.io/cgi.amazing.com/internet/old-sgi-faq.html">The Buying an SGI System FAQ</a>
	<strong>before</strong> you buy. It is very well done, presents quite a bit of information on the Personal IRIS series, and
	in addition will give you some idea of what
	kind of problems you are letting yourself in for :-)

</p><p>

	If none of the above information deters you, then you are truly a
	hardware hacker! Read on!

<h2><a name="sources">Sources for SGI systems and parts</a></h2>
<p>

	Finding both complete (used) SGI systems and repair parts can sometimes
	be an intimidating process. There are a large number of vendors
	specializing in workstation hardware on the net, but many are only
	interested in corporate or medium sized business accounts. Often, the
	hobbyist is left in a quandry as to where to look. The following source
	list is divided into 2 parts. The first part consists of vendors that
	I have dealt with personally, and with whom I feel comfortable in recommending.
	The second part consists of vendors that I have not dealt
	with, but who seem to have a decent net reputation (i.e. I haven&#39;t run
	across pages of &#34;Don&#39;t deal with xxxx, they&#39;ll $%#$# you over...&#34; posts.)
	
</p><h3>Sources I have dealt with:</h3>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://words.filippo.io/reputable.com/index.htm">Reputable Systems</a>: I have dealt with Greg Douglas a number
	of times, and have always been quite satisfied with the outcome. He is	an excellent
	source for complete systems, and keeps an inventory of
	spare parts. He also welcomes business from individual hobbyists as
	well as small business owners.
	
	</li><li> <a href="https://words.filippo.io/mce.com/index.htm">The Minicomputer Exchange</a>: They have a large selection of parts for
	various and diverse systems, and, although their market focus and pricing
	seems to be oriented towards small and medium sized business owners, They are still quite
	happy to deal with individual hobbyists.
</li></ul>

<h3>Sources I have not dealt with:</h3>

<ul>
	<li> More to come...
</li></ul>	

	
<hr/>

<h2><a name="CDC">CDC Rebadged SGI Systems</a></h2>


<p>
	Apparently, SGI supplied a number of complete systems to
	CDC for resale (or possibly internal use?) as CDC products in
	the late &#39;80s. As far as
	I have been able to determine, the only change CDC made to
	these systems was to rebadge them, and possibly equip them
	with CDC-sourced peripherals such as hard disks, etc. The
	following is an incomplete (and probably inaccurate :-)
	list of CDC system part numbers and the closest equivalent
	SGI system.

<h2><a name="irixplat">IRIX Platform-Dependent Support Notes</a></h2>


<p>


	Because of the graphics and memory limitations, certain versions
        of IRIX seem more suited to some of the older platforms than others.
	The two recommended versions of IRIX for older hardware are the
        various flavors of IRIX 4.0.5 (with 4.0.5f being the most recent
        general hardware support release), and IRIX 5.3 (with patches applied?).

	</p><h3>General Considerations:</h3>


	If your system has <strong>16 Mb</strong> or less of memory, definitely consider
	using IRIX 4.0.5.  It is still quite a nice OS.


	If your system has <strong>32 Mb</strong> or more of memory, and can run at a
	cpu speed of &gt;20 Mhz, consider trying IRIX 5.3. Note however, that
	IRIX 5.3 does not support the &#34;G&#34; graphics option for the Professional
	series, and may not support OpenGL on some of the older graphics hardware
	platforms such as the Personal Iris TG or the Professional series GT. If you
	want to try using IRIX 5.3 on a system with 16 Mb of memory, you might want
	to turn off the objectserver (use <kbd><SPAN color="FF0000"> chkconfig objectserver off </SPAN></kbd>). This will
	help conserve memory, but will also cause some problems when using the
	admin tools.

<p>
        <em>(anyone have more details as to OpenGL vs. Graphics hardware support?).</em>

	</p><h3>Recommended OS Versions:</h3>

<dl compact="">
<dt><strong>IRIX 4.0.5</strong></dt><dd>	Disk space required (System ONLY w/IDO): ~300 Mb</dd>
<dt><strong>IRIX 5.3</strong></dt><dd>Disk space required (System ONLY w/IDO):  ??? Mb</dd>

<h3><a name="serialports">4D Series Serial Port Pinouts</a></h3>

	There is quite a bit of information available via the IRIX man pages

	you are trying to revive a system, the IRIX man pages are usually
	not available to you! It is often advantageous in such a situation
	to connect a terminal to serial port 1 of the system in question and
	bring it up in diagnostic mode by disconnecting the keyboard. The following
	table provides both the pinout for the 9-pin SGI DB9 serial connector and the
	proper DB25 pin numbers needed to construct a <em>SGI to ASCII terminal

<h2><a name="cdromboot">4D Series CDROM Boot-Up and Software Installation</a></h2>



	<h4><a name="bootsash">Booting SASH and installing the miniroot</a>:</h4>

<p>


	Yes, you can boot and install from CDROM on all the 4D series machines. Unfortunately,
	on some of the earlier machines in the series (such as the Professional Series and Personal IRIS
	4D/20 and 4D/25) the PROM monitor is totally ignorant of how to handle a CDROM drive,
	so you need to treat it like a SCSI disk. For the rest of this chapter, we will
	assume that we are installing on a machine that does not support CDROM boot
	from the PROM monitor menu.  For the sake of our discussion, we
	will assume that we are installing on a 4D/70 (although the procedure is virtually identical
	for any of the 4D series),  that the CDROM drive
	has been installed via the procedures described in the SCSI HACKS
	section (if needed), the SCSI ID for the CDROM is set to 4, and you have already
	inserted the IRIX distribution CDROM in the drive (I recommend doing
	this before trying to access the CDROM from sash. Sometimes sash will
	get confused if it sees an empty CDROM drive.) 

</p><p>

	To boot up sash (Stand Alone SHell), enter the monitor&#39;s command
	mode and type:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>boot dksc(0,4,8)sash.IP4</kbd></strong></SPAN>

</p><p>

	if this gives you an error, try replacing &#34;sash.IP4&#34; with &#34;/&#34;,
	which is an invalid file name. This should cause the monitor to
	display the valid filenames on the partition. If &#34;sash.IP4&#34; is not
	present, then the CDROM that you are using is not bootable on a
	4D/70. Versions that I know are bootable are 4.0.1, various flavors
	of 4.0.5 (A and F),  5.2 &amp; 5.3.  I recommend the use of 4.0.5 due
	to it&#39;s smaller memory requirements.

</p><p>

	Once sash is up and running, you will have access to a limited number
	of unix-like shell commands, including ls, cp, etc.  At this point,
	you will need to copy the miniroot from the CDROM to the swap partition
	of the target&#39;s hard-disk (let&#39;s say it&#39;s SCSI ID is 1).
	To do this, type:

</p><p>

<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>cp -b 32k dksc(0,4,8)mr dksc(0,1,1)</kbd></strong></SPAN>

</p><p>

	This will produce a whole series of dots. When the copy is finished,
	you can boot the miniroot by typing:

</p><p>

<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>dksc(0,1,1)unix</kbd></strong></SPAN>

</p><p>

	This should start the boot-up procedure, and bring up the
	miniroot and the standalone inst program.


</p><h4><a name="clearpass">Gaining root access when you don&#39;t know the password</a>:</h4>
	
	This is another one of those frustrating situations. You&#39;ve just
	carted one of these critters home from a hamfest, you power it up,
	and it sits there and asks for a password. Now what? Well, if the NVRAM
	password hasn&#39;t been set (only possible for
	Personal IRIS 4D/30 and later systems, covered under
	 <a href="#peririspasswd">How to defeat the NVRAM password</a>) you simply have to bring the system up in single
	user mode and reset the root password. For newer systems, simply enter
	the command monitor and type the command:
<p>	
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>single</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>
	For older systems, you&#39;ll have to do it manually. First, boot
	up sash by typing:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>boot dksc(0,1,8)sash</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>
	Then set the <kbd><strong>initstate</strong></kbd> 
	environment variable to &#34;<strong><em>s</em></strong>&#34; by typing:

</p><p>	
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>setenv initstate s</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>

	And finish the boot process:
		
</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>dksc(0,1,0)/unix</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>				

	This should bring you up in single user mode.  Change the root
	password by typing:
	
</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>passwd root</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>
	You can then bring the system back down by typing:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>init 0</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>
	Or, alternately, you can finish bringing it up to multiuser
	mode by typing:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>init 2</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>			
	Note that once you power the system off, the <strong>initstate</strong> variable
	is cleared, and the system will boot using the default init state
	defined in <strong><em>/etc/inittab</em></strong>
		
</p><h4><a name="savedisk">Attempting to recover a currently formatted disk</a>:</h4>
	
	
<p>
	If your system came with a hard disk and it won&#39;t boot from the
	monitor menu, there is still a good chance
	that IRIX might be present and bootable. Your <kbd><strong>bootfile</strong></kbd> and
	<kbd><strong>root</strong></kbd> environment variables might simply have been trashed. For the sake
	of the discussion, let&#39;s assume we&#39;re talking about a SCSI disk set to address 1. First,
	see if SASH is on the disk. try typing:
	
</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>boot dksc(0,1,8)sash</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>

	if sash is there, it should start loading. Once sash is loaded,
	you should be able to load IRIX (assuming it&#39;s still intact). At
	this point, you might want to try bringing IRIX up in single
	user mode so that you can examine the root filesystem, etc. You
	can force singe user mode by setting the <kbd><strong>initstate</strong></kbd> 
	environment variable to &#34;<strong><em>s</em></strong>&#34;. This
	is acomplished by typing:
</p><p>	
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>setenv initstate s</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>

	You can then try to boot up IRIX by typing:
		
</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>dksc(0,1,0)/unix</kbd></strong></SPAN>
</p><p>
		
	If none of this works, try taking a look at the disk partition
	structure with <strong>fx</strong> (booted from CDROM). The partition
	table should look something like the following:
	
</p><center>
<table>
<caption><SPAN color="#EE0000"><em><strong>Hard Disk Partition Table</strong></em></SPAN></caption>

<h4><a name="formdisk">Formatting and installing a new hard disk</a>:</h4>

	If you happen across a machine in dire mechanical and electrical
	condition as I did, you may find that the original hard disk
	has long since vanished. In order to install and format a new
	hard disk, you will need to run the stand-alone version of <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong>.
	<strong><kbd>Fx</kbd></strong> is SGI&#39;s disk format/label/testing utility.  There are 2
	versions. One can be run from IRIX, while the other is intended
	for stand-alone use. The first step in loading <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> is to boot
	sash, as described above. Since your disk has not yet been labeled
	properly, don&#39;t attempt to copy the miniroot to it yet. From sash,
	you can boot <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> from the CDROM by typing:

<p>

<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>dksc(0,4,7)/stand/fx.IP4</kbd></strong></SPAN>

</p><p>

	Fortunately, <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> is a pretty complete menu-driven utility. The only
	oddity occurs if you select automatic disk installation using the
	standard defaults.  In this mode, fx will re-format the hard drive,
	label it, and set up default partitions.  For ESDI drives, this is
	just fine.  For SCSI drives, however, it is not usually a good
	idea to re-format unless absolutely necessary. If you are trying
	to install a SCSI drive, I suggest you go through the menus manually,
	selecting the defaults for the partition and label commands. When you
	are done, you should write the changes to disk, reboot sash, and continue
	installing the miniroot. If this fails, go ahead and try the autoconfigure
	mode on the SCSI disk. What could it hurt at this point :-)

</p><h4><a name="anatdisk">The anatomony of an IRIX bootable disk</a></h4>

	One of the mysteries that first besets a beginning hobbyist consists
	of trying to understand the IRIX bootable disk structure. I will
	try to shed some light on this rather confusing (to a beginner) subject.
	Please realize that I myself am not an expert, but simply a fellow
	hobbyist who has had to travel this bumpy road before.
<p>
	In order to create a bootable IRIX filesystem on a hard disk, you
	need a couple of things. First, you need access to <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong>, the IRIX
	disk formatting and partitioning utility. There are both standalone
	and IRIX versions of this utility. The standalone version is used
	when you have a copy of the IRIX installation media, and you wish
	to install a fresh new copy of IRIX on a virgin disk. The IRIX version
	can be used to format a 2nd hard drive from an up-and-running IRIX
	system.
</p><p>	
	Information on <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> and other installation matters can be obtained from
	SGI via their on-line libary (you can find a pointer to this in the
	section on <a href="#pointers">Pointers to other information sources</a>),
	so I won&#39;t go into too much detail on this. What I want to concentrate
	on is the partition structures themselves. A typical IRIX bootable file system
	consists of the following partitions:
	
	</p><ul>
	<li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 0</strong></em> - Root Filesystem partition.</SPAN>
	</li><li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 1</strong></em> - Swap partition.</SPAN>
	</li><li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 6</strong></em> - Usr Filesystem partition (optional).</SPAN>
	</li><li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 7</strong></em> - Volume Body partition.</SPAN>
	</li><li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 8</strong></em> - Volume Header partition.</SPAN>
	</li><li><SPAN color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Partition 10</strong></em> - Whole Disk partition.</SPAN>
	
	</li></ul>
	
<p>

	Lets take a look at the following partitions in detail.  Rather than decribing the partitions
	in numberic order, we will describe them in the order in which they appear on the disk.
</p><h5>Partition 8: Volume Header partition</h5>
	The <em>Volume Header</em> partition must start at the first sector on the disk. It contains the <em>disk label</em>
	in the first sector, and a rudimentary filesystem (readable by the PROM Monitor) in the rest of the partition. The <em>disk label</em> is
	also duplicated in the first sector of every track on the first cylinder in the partition. The <em>disk label</em>
	identifies the disk&#39;s architecture to IRIX, i.e. how many cylinders, tracks, sectors, etc.
	The <em>disk label</em> also includes a directory <em>table of contents</em> consisting of file names, sizes and offsets for the
	rudimentary file system. The first entry in the <em>table of contents</em> is the file <em><strong>sgilabel</strong></em>, pointing to the <em>disk label</em>
	sector itself. The remaining entries can point to whatever files are resident in the rudimentary filesystem.
	These files usually include <em><strong>sash</strong></em> (the standalone shell),<strong><kbd> fx</kbd></strong> (the standalone version) and <strong><kbd>ide</kbd></strong> (a stanalone testing/diagnostic
	tool).  The <em>disk label</em> is usually created by <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> when it initializes and partitions the disk, but the label directory
	should only be modified using the dvhtool utility. Dvhtool will let you add, remove and copy files to and from the
	Volume Header filesystem. Using <strong><kbd>dvhtool</kbd></strong>, you can install standalone copies of <strong><kbd>sash</kbd></strong> and <strong><kbd>fx</kbd></strong> from the <em>/stand</em> directory
	into the <em>Volume Header</em> Partition filesystem (assuming there is sufficient space there.)
<h5>Partition 1: Swap partition</h5>

	The swap has no filesystem structure, It is simply raw disk space. It serves two purposes; a place to copy and boot the
	<em>miniroot</em> from during software installation, and a raw swap area for IRIX after full system bootup. During IRIX system software
	installation a small virtual IRIX filesystem called the <em>miniroot</em> is copied into the swap partition. The <em>miniroot</em> is then
	booted and used to install a valid EFS based IRIX filesystem in partition 0. The <em>miniroot</em> may also be used to install
	new versions of critical IRIX kernel files that can&#39;t be modified during runtime. Once the software is installed and the
	full IRIX system is booted off of partition 0, the <em>miniroot</em> in the swap partition will be overwritten by swap data.
	

	
<h5>Partition 0: Root Filesystem partition</h5>	

	Partition 0 holds the root filesystem. It is an EFS (Extent File System) partition, and holds the IRIX kernel and the
	files accessed under the <strong>/</strong> directory. You can create an EFS partition using the<strong><kbd> mkfs </kbd></strong>utility, which is exactly what the
	<em>miniroot</em> does when you perform a first-time system software installation on a virgin disk.

<h5>Partition 6: Usr Filesystem partition</h5>

	On large disks, it is often preferable to provide a second EFS partition for non-system related files. This partition
	can be backed up seperately from the root (<strong>/</strong>) partition, saving backup tapes, etc.

<h5>Partition 7: Volume Body partition</h5>

	Partition 7 is what I refer to as a housekeeping partition. It does not have any unique disk space mapped to itself. It
	is simply an overlay that points to all the sectors on the disk that are not in the <em>Volume Header</em> partition.	
	 
 
<h5>Partition 10: Whole Disk partition</h5>
		
	Partition 10  is another housekeeping partition. It maps to the entire disk. It can be used as a pointer to the entire
	disk from <strong><kbd>sash</kbd></strong> or the PROM monitor when using the<strong><kbd> cp </kbd></strong>command to clone a hard disk.
	
<h4><a name="zipdisk">Building a bootable IRIX filesystem on a small (Zip) disk</a>:</h4>


	One of the major problems facing a hobbyist with a newly accquired
	SGI is that of backing up that precious installed operating
	system. If you have been lucky enough to latch onto the installation
	media for your system, all well and good. This is the <em>ideal</em> situation,
	and you can simply use <em>tar</em>, <em>bru</em> or whatever backup utility you prefer to
	make a complete hard disk backup, safe in the knowledge that if a
	micro-meteorite ever punctures your hard disk, you can use the
	installation media to create a miniroot on a new hard disk, and
	reinstall IRIX, etc.

<p>
	
	If, however, you are in that sorry group of hobbyists that did
	<strong>not</strong> receive a copy of the installation media, then you are well acquainted
	with that fearful feeling in the pit of you stomach (akin to
	rolling dice) that occurs every	time you power your SGI off and on.

</p><p>
	
	The problem is basically that of a lack of a <em>miniroot</em> to facilitate
	disk repair and restoration of savesets. When you install IRIX off
	of the installation media, <em>inst</em> copies the <em>miniroot</em> from
	the installation media to the swap partition of the target hard disk. This
	copy is usable until the installed version of IRIX is booted,
	at which time the <em>miniroot</em> is overwritten by swap data.
	<em>Inst</em> does not, unfortunately, store a bootable copy of the miniroot on the
	target hard disk for future use. In order to recover from a completely
	obliterated hard disk, You will need to boot the miniroot off
	of a copy of the installation media in order to reinstall the system or
	restore the complete hard disk saveset.

</p><p>

	There are a couple of ways around this dilemma. First, you can use
	the PROM Monitor <kbd>cp</kbd> command	to completely copy one hard disk to
	another, as long as the two hard disks are of identical manufacture.
	Second, you can make a complete saveset of the current root hard disk, and
	restore it to another hard disk (of equal or larger capacity) configured to a different SCSI <em>id</em> 
	Unfortunately, both these approaches lead to the undesirable requirement of holding
	a relatively large (and otherwise useful) hard disk in reserve, solely as a backup boot disk.
	
</p><p>
	
	After a little bit of experimentation, I think I may have come up with another
	alternative to this dilemma. I have attempted to create an ersatz <em>miniroot</em>
	from the IRIX files currently present on the root hard disk. Now, don&#39;t get too
	excited about this yet...;-)  This ersatz miniroot is quite restricted in it&#39;s
	capabilities, and is completely unlike the miniroot provided on the installation
	media. What I have done is to create a shellscipt that copies a minimal single-user
	bootable IRIX filesystem to a small SCSI hard disk (<em>~100 Mb</em>). The shellscript
	performs the following functions:
</p><ul>
	<li> Initializes the target as an <em>fx</em> <em><strong>ROOTDISK</strong></em>
	</li><li> Constructs a proper volume header partition containing
	     <em>sash</em>, <em>ide</em> and <em>fx</em>.
	</li><li> Creates filesystem on the root partition of the target.
	</li><li> Generates the device directory of the target.
	</li><li> Modifies the /dev links to allow the target disk
	     to boot from a SCSI <em>ID</em> other than <em>0</em>.
	</li><li> Copies critical files needed for the system to boot.
</li></ul>
	The ersatz miniroot is <em>limited</em> in that it can only be used to boot a system
	with an <em>identical</em> hardware configuration to that of the system it was generated
	from. (by <em>identical</em>, I mean the same <em><strong>CPU</strong></em> and <em><strong>Graphics Cardset</strong></em> configuration).
	
<p>
	The purpose of this ersatz miniroot is as follows;
	If the bootable kernel on your root disk is wiped out, you simply boot up off of
	the small hard disk and use <em>tar</em>, <em>bru</em>, or whatever to do a complete reinstall from
	your backup saveset.
	If the filesystem is really hosed, you can use <em>fx</em> to reinitialize the disk,
	<em>dvhtool</em> to rebuild the disk label partition directory, and
	then restore your system.
	

</p><p>
	My original intent was to use a Zip disk for the bootable ersatz <em>miniroot</em>.
	This does indeed work on some platforms. Unfortunately, there are other platforms
	which do not seem to like using <em>removable</em> SCSI media as a boot target from the
	PROM Monitor. In either case, a small SCSI disk salvaged from an older Macintosh
	or Sun3 should be adequate and acceptable to the platforms that seem to be more
	picky as to their boot target. You will find more info on platform-dependent behavior
	in the <strong>README</strong> files included in the release.

</p><p>
	<em><strong>!!!WARNING!!!</strong></em>	
	Please note that I am releasing this shellscript in Alpha form. This means that
	it is only minimally debugged, and will most likely need extensive hacking. Also,
	the ersatz miniroot may not be fully functional in that critical dynamic libraries
	may still be missing. I have tried my best to include what I thought was necessary,
	but it is very likely that I may have forgotten something. If you decide to experiment
	with this approach, please drop me an email note with your results. I would prefer

<h2><a name="rommon">4D Series PROM Monitor Commands and Environment Variables</a></h2>

<h3><a name="rommoncom">PROM Monitor Commands</a>:</h3>
<p>
	The PROM monitor commands and environment variables are documented
	in the various 4D Series Owners Guides. Since the 4D series machines are
	relatively old, and this document is for experimenters who are
	relatively poor, and are most likely trying to revive/restore
	a machine for which documentation has been either lost or trashed, I
	will summarize them below. Note that your particular machine may
	have some extra commands, such as passwording, etc. Use the <kbd>help</kbd>

	(or <kbd>?</kbd>) command to determine the monitor capabilities of your
	particular machine.


</p><p>

	There are a number of ways to bring up the PROM monitor.  If you
	are not certain of the condition of the graphics system or video
	monitor, you can bring up the PROM monitor from a terminal on
	serial port 1. Simply disconnect the system keyboard, and the
	bootcode will default to the serial port <em>(9600, N, 8, 1)</em>.

<h3><a name="devfilnam">Device and File Names</a>:</h3>


<p>
	   File names at the monitor level follow unix standards, with
	the exception that the file name must be less than 20 characters.
	Device names are specified differently in the monitor than they
	are in IRIX. The following list describes the devices supported
	by the monitor. The general format is:

</p><center>
<kbd>
	    &lt;driver name&gt; (&lt;controller id&gt;, &lt;device id&gt;, &lt;partition&gt;)
</kbd>
</center>

<p>

	Note that there are 3 arguments to most of the disk device
	names. For Example, if we wanted to specify ESDI controller
	#0, device #1, partition #2, we would use the following:
</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Monitor/SASH</th><th>IRIX</th></tr>
<tr><td><kbd>dkip(0,1,2)</kbd></td><td><kbd>ips0d1s2</kbd></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>Device ID Conventions:</h4>

	  Most older SGI systems utilize SCSI ID 1 for the first hard disk,
	and SCSI ID 4 for the first CDROM drive. For ESDI drives,
	the first drive is 0, the second is 1.
<p>

	<strong><em>Important note:</em></strong> 

	On SGI systems, the SCSI disk controller (and tape
	controller?) ID is 0.  This is a SGI
	peculiarity. This limits
	the number of usable SCSI IDs to 1-7.

<h3><a name="envvarnam">Environment Variables stored in NVRAM</a>:</h3>

<h3><a name="graphconf">Graphics Configurations</a></h3>

<p>
	I have noticed that the graphics subsystems seem to be interchangeable
	across the 4D/50-85 family.  This would imply that it should be possible
	to &#34;mix and match&#34;, although I haven&#39;t tried it with anything except the
        &#34;G and &#34;GT&#34; cardsets. Also, it appears that the color of the top and
	decorative trim panels of this series reflected a &#34;color code&#34;  that can
	be used to quickly identify the graphics engine in that system.

<h3><a name="profstereo">3-D Stereo connections</a></h3>


	It is apparently possible to connect a set of LCD Shutter
	glasses to a GT or GTX graphics system. The LCD glasses will require
	a TTL level square-wave signal indicating which eye to blank for
	alternate frames of video. On a GT or GTX system, this signal
	is apparently available, and can be tapped from the <em>3rd pin
	from the bottom right</em> of the <em>240 pin connector block</em> on the
	graphics cardset. Use a 75 Ohm COAX cable, and ground the outer
	shield. BTW, this information was gleaned from old Usenet posts
	in the  comp.sys.sgi archives, so I am not quite comfortable with it&#39;s accuracy
	or with the possible consequences to your equipment from it&#39;s use
	(or misuse). Until I can
	verify this, proceed with <strong>CAUTION</strong>. I suggest you probe this signal
	out with an Oscilloscope (and possibly buffer it with a TTL driver?)
	before you try to use it.(Whats that, you say? You don&#39;t have an
	Oscilloscope? Then what are you doing fiddling with the hardware
	at this level! shame on you! :-) Again, I am <strong>NOT</strong> responsible
	if you toast your graphics cardset.<em> You have been warned!</em>.

<p>
	Another interesting thing to note is that the IRIX man page <kbd> serial </kbd>
	indicates that a <strong><em>Stereo Field Sync</em></strong> signal is available from pin 3 of
	the DIN-8 powered serial port (a Professional/Power Series option.)
	I haven&#39;t come across any further reference to this signal. It <em>might</em>
	be intended for use with LCD shutter glasses, but your guess is as good
	as mine! If anyone has any further info, drop me an email note and
	I&#39;ll include it here.

<h3><a name="profpwr">Power Requirements/Interlocks/Cooling</a></h3>

<p>

	Note that the 4D series require 20 amp service. Ahem. Of course,
	if you don&#39;t really load it up with lots of option cards, 4 Full
	Height hard disks, 2 tape drives, etc. you might be able to get away 
	with swapping the 20 Amp plug for a plain old 15 Amp plug, and connecting
	it to a standard wall outlet (for testing purposes only!). Do try to place
	it on a circuit that is carrying a minimal load (cut off the circuit breaker
	for the selected outlet, see what other outlets/lamps die, etc. and try
	to move those other loads to a different circuit.) Note that the
	system has a built-in 16 amp circuit breaker, which will be of little
	protective use if you use this approach on a 15 amp wall outlet. If you
	intend to keep the 4D up continuously, you should run a separate 20 amp
	circuit for it.
</p><p>
	<strong>!!!PLEASE NOTE!!!</strong>, I am not _recommending_ that you do this! In a home
        with inadequate wiring, this approach can be a fire hazard! I do not
        want to have people chasing me around with axes because their house
        burned down. I accept NO liability for any damage you may incur to
	yourself, your home or your system!  You have been warned! I STRONGLY
	recommend that you have a certified electrician install a building code
	compliant 20-amp receptacle.

	<h4>Twin Tower Enclosures:</h4>


<p>

	The following notes apply only to the Professional series twin-tower
	enclosures. The Power series are similar, however I believe that they
	use a different power supply and cooling system.  There may also be
	differences in the SCSI cabling system used in the smaller drive tower.

</p><p>

	The 4D/70 and other of it&#39;s ilk (Professional series twin tower cardcages)
	use an interlock system to shut down the power if a panel is open.  This 
	can sometimes be a pain in the posterior when troubleshooting.  The
	interlock system consists of 3 door switches and a 1 amp breaker ganged
	to the 16 amp main breaker on the back panel of power-module (at the base
	of the drive tower.) Two of the switches are located at the top of the main
	tower near the threaded mount that the door thumb-screw screws into. When the
	thumb-screw is fully engaged, it&#39;s tip depresses the interlock switch opening
	it. These two switches are obvious to anyone who examines the system
	superficially. The third switch is hidden insidiously inside the
	power-module on the right-hand side. It is operated via a mechanical
	linkage through each of the stacked drive/tape modules, and is depressed
	only when the top vanity cover of the drive tower is in place. All three
	switches seem to be wired in parallel, and operate by shorting a voltage
	through the 1-amp circuit breaker, which throws both circuit breakers open.
	To disable the interlocks, simply pull off one of the two switch-wires (they
	use press-on spade connectors) at the switch you wish to disable. To get
	to the switch in the drive tower, you&#39;ll have to remove the power module
	cover. I suggest you cover the wire you pull off with electrical tape.
	I also strongly suggest that you re-connect the interlocks when you
	are done troubleshooting. I&#39;m only guessing, but I think part of the
	reason they are there is to insure that the front and rear panels of
	the main tower are in place during operation. This probably has a
	significant effect on the flow of cooling air over the cardset.
	My guess is that prolonged operation with either of the panels open
	could lead to card/component overheating and failure!.

</p><p>

	Incidentally, a number of people sent me warnings about the two
	squirrel-cage fans in the base of the main tower.  Apparently, these
	are in the habit of failing on a random basis. Failure of just one
	of the fans can lead to overheating and card/component failure! Check
	to insure that both fans are operating!	Mine seem to be fine, so I
	haven&#39;t developed a service/replacement hack for &#39;em yet.

<h3><a name="memreq">Memory Requirements</a></h3>

<h4>Professional Series:</h4>
<p>
	I have run across 3 different CPU cards for the 4D/(50-80) series
	of machines. These consist of a 8 Mhz IP4 (030-0121-001) used in the
	4D/50, a 12 Mhz IP4 (030-0011-001) used in the 4D/70, and
	a 16 Mhz IP4.5 (030-0122-007) used in the 4D/80. A lot of the net
	messages I received, as well as the SGI Hardware FAQ,  indicated      
        that SGI systems need SGI-specific SIMMS. I have not observed
	this for the three CPU cards mentioned above. I have no doubt that
	it is true for other 4D series machines such as the 4D(30-35). The
	IP4 series of CPU cards seem to be much more forgiving than their
	faster and newer brethren, however. I have successfully used plain
	old PC type simms in all three CPU cards. These were 1 Mb 9-chip
	30-pin simms (parity, 100 ns or faster.)  I have even used simms from
	a Sun 3/80 (sacrilege!).  I can not say that _all_ 9-chip simms
	will work, but I have had good luck with all the various ones that
	I have tested.  The simms supplied by SGI seem to be of Toshiba 
	manufacture, so if you are concerned, stick to those. But before you
	go out and spend wads on that SGI-specific memory, try pirating a
	few simms from that old PC you&#39;ve been using as a door-stop the past
	two years. If they work, send me a beer.  Note that I have _not_ tried
	3-chip simms. Some of these have refresh address requirements which
	are different than those of the 9-chip variety, so I doubt they will work.

</p><p>

	For testing purposes, you can bring the system up with only 8 Mb of
	memory. Simply populate every other pair of simm slots (i.e. 2 in,
	2 out, 2 in, 2 out, etc.)

</p><p>

	A number of sources indicate the the Professional series could make
	use of SGI-proprietary VME memory expansion cards in order to expand
	the IP4 beyond it&#39;s normal 16 Mb limit. An examination of the <a href="#backplane">Professional
	series backplane</a>
	reveals the interesting fact that the VME P2 connector provides a small
	bussed segment across VME slots 1-4. If I were a bettin&#39; man, I&#39;d bet
	that the P2 connector on the VME backplane is used as a memory
	expansion bus by the IP4. Another interesting observation is that
	the IP4.5 has a large bus-type connector on the front of the card
	which is not found on an IP4. It seems that the IP4.5 made use of
	this connector	(in conjunction with? ... in place of ?) the P2 bus
	to provide for memory expansion. As I have never run across a
	VME memory expansion card for either CPU card, and documentation
	for this feature seems to be as scarce as hen&#39;s teeth, I can&#39;t really
	elaborate any further about it. If anyone has any information
	on the VME memory expansion capabilities of either CPU card, or what
	VME memory cards would work with either CPU, please drop me an email
	note!
</p><p>

	Recently, for lack of something better to do (Yeh, I know, I should
	get a life :-), I dragged out the ole&#39; DVM and did some random
	circuit tracing on an IP4 card.  One of the things I looked at
	was the (supposedly unused) 4 Mb MSB going to the SIMM array (I was
	having vague and idealistic dreams about hacking the board to handle
	4-Mb SIMMS.)  To my complete surprise, it appeared that the 4-Mb SIMM
	MSB was already routed by way of a buffer to some select logic. Could
	it be that the card could already handle 4-Mb SIMMS?  Unfortunately,
	I have never gotten around to testing this. Will it work? I don&#39;t
	know at this time, but if someone else happens to  have some spare
	4-Mb SIMMS, and wants to try this out, let me know the results and
	I&#39;ll include them here.  A recent version of the SGI Hardware FAQ
	actually mentions that some versions of the IP4 could handle 4-Mb
	SIMMS, with a max capacity of 64 Mb on board.  It also mentions that
	the IP4.5 could support 4-Mb SIMMS by changing 2 PALS.  I tried to
	pursue this, but was told by an SGI source that, although this is
	probably true, SGI never actually produced the 2 updated PALS.  If
	anyone knows more about this, let me know.

The Professional IRIS backplane seems to be divided into 3 logical segments,
a CPU segment (slots 1-4), a CPU/VME segment (slots 5-7) and a Graphics segment(slots 8-12.) Note that the <em>P2ac</em> portion of the backplane does <em>not</em> extend
across the 3 segments, but is divided into 2 separate busses, <SPAN color="#00FF00"><strong>P2ac(CPU)</strong></SPAN> and <SPAN color="#367000"><strong>P2ac(GRAPHIC)</strong></SPAN>.
The <em>P2b</em> portion of the <em>P2</em> connector
<em>does</em> extend across all 3 segments of the backplane. 
</p><p>

	The rule of thumb for most VME systems is to install
	backplane jumpers in unused slots. The only exception
	to this rule for the 4D appears to be for the GE4 card.

</p><p>

	Note that the <SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong>P1</strong></SPAN> connector is bussed across all three segments
	of the VME cardcage. The <strong>P3</strong> connector on the IP4 CPU card (which
	must reside in slot 0) is
	used to provide a connection to the local SCSI bus and 4D control
	panel. On the Graphics segment of the backplane, the <SPAN color="#007FFF"><strong>P3</strong></SPAN> connector
	is bussed.

<h3><a name="keyboard">Keyboard and Mouse</a></h3>


	Unfortunately, my system came sans everything (keyboard, mouse,
	monitor, hard disk, memory, you name it, I didn&#39;t have it :-).
	The result of this is a series of improvisations which were quite
	interesting to devise. Unfortunately, only the keyboard did not
	yield easily to improvisation. At first, I contemplated building
	a small Intel 8051 based keyboard translator to adapt a generic
	IBM keyboard to the SGI. While this is quite possible, I decided
	against this approach for the time being,  since I had too many
	other unknowns in my system already. Checking with resellers, I was
	able to locate a number of keyboards suitable for use with the
	4D/70 professional series, but the prices were a bit out of
	my acceptable range (&lt;$100). Finally, a net query on &#34;netted&#34;
	me (heh heh :-) an SGI keyboard I could use for a reasonable price.
<hr/>

	The keyboard is documented quite thoroughly in the SGI man pages.
	Of course, if you don&#39;t have your SGI up and running yet, that
	won&#39;t quite help :-)  For expediency, I will summarize the
	keyboard interface below:

</p><p>

<h4><a name="sunsgimouse">How to convert a Sun-3 Mouse to an SGI mouse</a></h4>
<p>

	Internal examination of a real (borrowed) SGI professional-series
	optical mouse revealed a very interesting fact. The innards (plus or minus
	a few discrete components) were identical to that of the older Sun M4
	optical mouse used on Sun-3 series systems. This mouse can be identified by
	the <strong>MSC</strong> part number <em><strong>901589-001/C</strong></em> on
	the  bottom label. For quick identification
	(when sorting through a box of orphan mice at a fleamarket) look for
	a mouse with a cable terminated with a modified RJ11 (telephone-type)
	connector. Sun modified
	the connector by adding 2 brass alignment pins to it&#39;s sides.
	
</p><p>
	The Sun3 M4 mouse transmits data conforming to the Mouse Systems format.
	The only real differences between the SGI optical 9-pin mouse and the
	Sun3 mouse consist of baud-rate (The Sun3 mouse operates at 1200 baud,
	whereas the SGI mouse uses 4800 baud) and electrical interface (the Sun3
	mouse requres only +5Vdc, and provides a 0-5 Volt data signal swing. The
	SGI mouse, on the other hand, uses a bipolar supply, and provides a
	bipolar data swing.)
	
</p><p>
 
	  Upon opening the Sun-3
	mouse, you should be
	able to find the numbers <em><strong>301276-001 Rev B</strong></em>
	silkscreened on the pc board somewhere near the center screw hole mount.
	Be aware that there is also a newer Sun M4 mouse that is used on Sun 3/80 and Sun-4
	systems. This mouse can be identified by it&#39;s use of a mini-din connector.
	Unfortunately, the Sun-4 mouse uses a different PC board, and won&#39;t
	work in this application.
</p><p>

	The following modifications will convert a Sun-3 series mouse to
	an SGI Professional series compatible mouse. If you have problems
	after the modification, you may need to try experimenting with
	different optical mouse pads. The one I converted worked fine, but
	I needed to add some extra light-baffling to isolate the X and Y
	sensors (I used a piece of black electrical tape.)

<h3><a name="scsihacks">SCSI Hacks</a></h3>

<p>

	Although the 4D/50-80 (Professional twin-tower series) does not include
	an external SCSI connector like the power series, it is relatively simple to hack one in. the
	SCSI bus is accessible via each drive module on the smaller tower. I simply
	disassembled a drive module and fabricated a new backplate with a standard
	IDC Centronix-style SCSI connector (mounted diagonally, in order to fit
	on the plate.) Simply connect this via a short piece of ribbon cable to
	the internal SCSI connector.  It is important that this module remain 
	the last one in the SCSI cable chain, i.e. it must be the top module.
	In addition, you need to install a SCSI termination plug on the connector
	(and disable whatever termination was being provided by the last device
	previously in the chain) in order to terminate the SCSI chain properly.
	This modification will allow you to connect an external SCSI CDROM or
	tape drive.

<h3><a name="profpwrsply">Professional Series Power Supply Problems</a></h3>

<p>


	Before I begin this section, a few words of<em> caution:</em> If you
	don&#39;t feel comfortable troubleshooting high-amperage switching
	supplies, <strong>don&#39;t try!!!</strong> Have a qualified service technician do
	the repair.  You could very easily injure yourself and/or
        your system, and start a fire to boot! <strong>you have been warned!!!</strong>
	I will not be held liable for the consequences! <strong>Proceed
	at your own risk!!!</strong>

</p><p>

	I have run across bad supplies in 3 of the 4 systems I have
	access to (These are Professional series twin-tower systems.
	I don&#39;t know think the &#39;85 or the Power series twin-tower
	systems use the same supply.)  All the supplies failed in the
	same manner, which could indicate a long-term failure mode
	with this particular power supply(or just my bad luck :-)

</p><p>

        This was a @#$% problem to diagnose!  The CPU and logic
        in both systems seemed fine, but neither would format or
        access a hard disk without horrible errors.  Of course,
        the first thing I did was put a DMM on the 12v and 5v
        supply lines, which both looked fine! I then tried both
        ESDI and SCSI hard disks, and both acted as if they were
        bad! Finally, in desperation, I put the SCSI disk in a
        separate powered enclosure, and it worked like a charm!
        Grumbling to myself, I dragged out the old O&#39;scope, and
        sure enough, both the 5V and 12V lines looked like
        an EKG trace! On the 5V side, spikes as low as 4.5V and
        as high as 5.3V appeared. A DMM could not detect this
        crud.

</p><p>

        I pulled the supply. This is a nice blue box made by
        <em>LH Research</em>, model # <strong>MMA44-E192B</strong>, which puts out
        about 5V @200A (Screwdriver-melting stuff! be careful
      	if you try this!)  After opening it up, I found a bad
	electrolytic, one of a pair joined by a plastic plate
	across the top (2900 Uf @ 200VDC, 250V Surge). Note
        the this pair is somewhere in the input side of the
	supply, not on the output as you might suspect.

</p><p>

        As I said previously, I had 3 systems that have failed
        in exactly the same manner. All three used <em>LH Research</em>
        power supplies.  I pulled  one good electrolytic
        from one of the other supplies and used it to replace the bad one
        in the supply I was working on. Voila! A working supply!
        no disk errors!.

</p><p>

        I called the nice lady at LH Research to see if I could
        purchase a replacement electrolytic. They cost about $40.00
        each, but the  kicker is the lead time, which is about 6 months!
        Apparently we are in the middle of a high-voltage electrolytic
        shortage :-) If this turns out to be your problem, you might
        be able to lean on her a bit harder than I did, though.
        (Note that this is being written in Sept &#39;95. The situation at
         the current time might have improved.)

<h3><a name="rtcprblms">Real time clock &amp; non-volatile memory problems</a></h3>

<p>

	I recently received a message from a fellow net resident asking about
	a problem he had with his 4D/70 IRIX system clock. Apparently,
	his IRIX software system clock was being reset to zero every time
	he rebooted. The question prompted me to investigate my own
	system a bit further, revealing a potential failure mode for
	these dinosaurs. Anyone who has ever played with Sun hardware
	(perish the thought! :-) will recognize this problem, as it is
	quite common in some of the older Sun3 and Sun4 series systems.
	
</p><p>
	Even though I&#39;m not privy to the internals of IRIX, I don&#39;t
	believe it&#39;s a stretch of the imagination to assume that IRIX
	initializes it&#39;s software system clock from the hardware real
	time clock (RTC) on board the IP4 or IP4.5. On these CPU cards,
	the RTC is implemented with a <em>Dallas Semiconductor
	</em> <strong>DS1216</strong> (or <strong>DS1216B</strong>)<em> SmartWatch</em>. The <em>SmartWatch</em>
	is a 28-pin DIP socket with a built-in RTC chip and lithium back-up
	battery. A Static RAM chip is plugged into the <em>SmartWatch</em>, and the
	<em>SmartWatch/RAM</em> assembly is then plugged into a 28-pin DIP socket
	on the CPU card. The <em>SmartWatch</em> is designed to supply back-up power to
	both it&#39;s internal clock chip and the piggybacked static RAM chip.
	While this is a neat idea, there will invariably come a time
	when the built-in lithium cell becomes exausted. When this happens,
	the built-in clock will begin to act flaky, and the static RAM
	chip (used to store the monitor-rom <em>nvram</em> enviroment variables) will
	become unreliable in that  it&#39;s contents may become scrambled 
	when the system is powered down. How long will the lithium cell
	last?	The manufacturer&#39;s data sheet indicates a nominal lifetime
	of greater than 10 years. Now the discouraging part... the date
	code on the <em>SmartWatch</em> in my system is &#39;<strong>85</strong>. (I guess
	this means that my system is living on &#34;borrowed time&#34; :-)
	
	
</p><p>
	Fortunately, unlike Sun hardware, SGI does not keep it&#39;s system
	ethernet MAC address in <em>nvram</em> on the Professional series machines, so a <em>nvram</em> failure is not
	quite as devastating on a 4D/70 as it would be on a Sun3 or Sun4.
	I would, however, recommend keeping a paper copy of the contents
	of your <em>nvram</em> (use the
	<SPAN color="#FF0000"><kbd>printenv</kbd></SPAN> monitor command)
	in case a powerdown leaves you stranded. The Professional series
	monitor will recognize a corrupted <em>nvram</em> and will still
	allow you to enter monitor mode and correct the contents. 
</p><p>
	If I locate a source for
	the SmartWatch modules, I&#39;ll  include a reference to it here.
	If no source is available, it might be possible to attack the
	SmartWatch module with an Xacto knife and mini-soldering iron
	and kludge in a replacement battery. When or if I try this, I&#39;ll
	update this chapter to include the modifications.

<h3><a name="hotclock">CLOCK SPEED-UP EXPERIMENTS</a></h3>



<p>
		Well, I have some good news, and some bad news. The
	good news is that for one specific case, hot-clocking the IP4
	works well. The bad news is that you probably aren&#39;t using
	this particular version of the CPU.  The results with the 12 Mhz
	IP4 were particularly disappointing, since it appears that some
	versions of this board are capable of using 4Mb SIMMS. If this
	board were capable of 16 Mhz, it could be preferable to an IP4.5,
	which requires a memory expansion card (verrry hard to find!) in
	order to exceed 16 Mb of memory.

</p><p>

	The CPU oscillator is the oscillator closest to the RTC module.
	It&#39;s frequency should be twice that of the actual CPU frequency. 

</p><p>

	I have tried hot-clocking 2 versions of the IP4, and also played
	with an IP4.5. The results were as follows:

</p><dl>

<dt>	<strong>4D/50 8 Mhz IP4</strong> <em>(030-0121-001)</em>:</dt>

<dd>
<p>
		Here is the good news! Don&#39;t throw away those old 8 Mhz
	4D/50 IP4 CPUs!  All that seems to be needed in order to get one
	of these up to 12 Mhz (the clock rate of an IP4 in a 4D/70) is a
	simple Xtal Oscillator swap. I have seen no ill effects in the
	system I have converted.

</p></dd><dt>	<strong>4D/70 12 Mhz IP4</strong> <em>(030-0011-001)</em>:</dt>

<dd>
<p>
		Here the picture is much more gloomy.  I have tried to
	boost this to 16 Mhz, in the hope that I could get performance
	equivalent to an IP4.5.  No go... I&#39;m not quite certain what
	is causing the problem, but more than a mere Xtal osc. change is
	needed.  Unfortunately, my supply of Xtal oscillators is limited,
	and I was unable to test any values between 12 and 16 Mhz. As far
	as differences between the IP4 and IP4.5, the only noticeable one
	appears to be the speed the the CACHE chips. The same chips are
	used in both boards, but the IP4 chips appear to be 15 ns, and the
	IP4.5 appear to be 10 ns.  I don&#39;t believe this is the cause of
	the problem however, since total removal of the CACHE chips followed by
	a subsequent attempt to boot (at 12 Mhz) leads to a failure of the
	power-up self test, which is reported correctly via a diagnostic
	terminal on serial port 1.  It is possible that a frequency somewhere
	between 12 and 16 Mhz might work... if anyone out there tries
	it, let me know your results, and I&#39;ll include them here.


</p></dd><dt>	4<strong>D/80 16 Mhz IP4.5</strong> <em>(030-0122-007)</em>:</dt>

<dd>
<p>
		The results here were a bit more ambiguous.  I managed
	to get this CPU board operating as fast as 18 Mhz without any initial
	problems. One problem did crop up later, however.  A short time after
	the mod, I tried to power up/boot the system (which I had been able
	to do successfully quite a number of times since the Xtal swap).
	Unfortunately, the system hung on boot-up.  Power cycling did not
	help, and the CPU card remained in a hung state.  I finally made
	a last-ditch feverish white-knuckled attempt restore functionality
	by removing the NVRAM chip, in the hopes that it&#39;s select control
	or contents had glitched somehow.  This worked! the system booted
	without a problem. I did have to re-initialize the NVRAM, however.
	This leads me to believe that the memory-access cycle timing for
	the NVRAM is on the hairy edge at 18 Mhz, and it must be possible
	to glitch the chip in such a manner that it locks up.  As a result
	of this hair-raising experience, I dropped my system back down to
	16 Mhz, and have not had a recurrence of the problem. It is conceivable
	that one could replace the NVRAM with a newer version (with a possibly
	faster access time), but I haven&#39;t looked into it yet.

<h3><a name="profaudio">Audio Capabilities</a></h3>


<p>

	What&#39;s that, you say? Audio? On a 4D/50-85 or Power Series Machine?
	 No Way! ...Well
	actually, Both the 4D/50-85 series and the Power Series do have some rudimentary audio
	capability.  Unfortunately, it seems that this capability has never
	been documented or exploited. I&#39;ll give you a brief rundown of what
	I&#39;ve discovered, and let you be the judge as to it&#39;s usefulness. 

</p><p>

		The IP4 and IP4.5 have a small audio section consisting of
	a <em>Philips SAA1099</em> Stereo Sound Generator and 2 <em>LM386</em> Audio Amps.
	Note that the Philips chip has no DSP capabilities.  It is simply
	a sound generator. Don&#39;t expect to do anything complicated with it.
	As sound generators go, it&#39;s actually not that shabby.  It supports
	the following:

</p><ul>

<li>			Six 8-octave (256 tones per octave) frequency generators
</li><li>                    Six frequency/noise mixers
</li><li>			Twelve amplitude controllers
</li><li>                    Two noise generators
</li><li>			Two envelope generators
</li><li>			Two 6-channel mixers
 
</li></ul>

<p>
	
		The output from the audio section is provided by two 1/8&#34; audio
	jacks on the IP4. The IP4.5, on the other hand, uses a 4-pin connector.
	Both are located on the upper back-edge of the board (as seen from the 
	back of the cardcage.)

</p><p>

		For some unknown reason SGI never documented this capability,
	or provided a software driver for it&#39;s use.  If one examines the include
	file for the IP4 cpu <kbd>(/usr/include/sys/IP4.h)</kbd>, you will find the following
	definitions:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><code>
	   <strong>#define SOUND_DAT_ADDR  0xbf60000   /* SAA1099 stereo sound generator */</strong>
</code></SPAN>
</p><p>

	Also, under <kbd>(/usr/include/sys/clover2.h)</kbd>, you will find the following
	definitions under defines for the IO2 board:

</p><p>
<SPAN color="#FF0000"><code>
<strong>	   #define SOUND_DAT_ADDR  0xb7f00000  /* SAA1099 stereo sound generator */</strong>
</code></SPAN>
</p><p>

	The IO2 board is a single port IO board for the 4D power series. After physically
	examining an IO3 card, I can definitely say that the chip is present on this
	card also. 
</p><p>

	Well, now that we know about it, how do we use it? As far as I have been
	able to determine, no one has developed any driver code to access this chip.
	Part of the reason for this may be lack of documentation on the chip itself.
	Hopefully, I can remedy this.  I have been able to locate the register
	definitions for the SAA1099, and have included a summary of them in
	appendix B. Unfortunately, as of this writing, I have not had the chance
	to try my hand at writing a driver. If anyone out there cares to give this a
	try, let me know and I&#39;ll include a pointer to your code here.

<h3><a name="profdebug">Hardware Debugging Experiences</a></h3>



<h4><a name="profdebgen">General Hardware Debugging Hints</a></h4>



        First, a few notes as to the hardware configuration of the
        IP4 and IP4.5.  The IP4 PROM monitor appears to use the RAM
        in the RTC module during the first stages of initialization. Even
        if you pull all your SIMM memory and CACHE chips (Both data and
        instruction), you should still see the monitor attempt to boot
        via serial port 1. (It won&#39;t get very far, though! :-).  Note
        that in a normally functioning system, immediately after powerup
	or reset the LED display on the power supply will cycle, displaying
	the codes &#34;F&#34;,&#34;B&#34;,&#34;D&#34;, and then will cycle continuously from  &#34;1&#34; to &#34;9&#34;.

<p>

	I have assembled the following debugging tips by generating
	&#34;fake&#34; failures (i.e. removing chips, memory, etc.)  This map
	has already helped me to repair a bad IP4 with a blown DUART.  If
	you happen across any other debugging tips, please let me know. I&#39;ll
	include them in this section.

</p><p>

	The following LED codes refer to the LED single-digit display
	on the power-supply control panel, located at the bottom-front of
	the I/0 (smaller) tower.

If the LED display never gets beyond the initial &#34;F&#34;, something serious

(F7N8) on the IP4 (This is the &#34;middle&#34; DUART).  This is a Signetics
SCN2681AC1N40 40-pin DUART. Apparently this DUART is critical to system
operation. As a test, try exchanging it with the other 40-pin DUART,
which doesn&#39;t seem to be quite as critical. If serial port 1 comes alive and
the PROM monitor wakes up, then the DUART is bad. If not, check the Xtal
oscillator for the DUARTs and the other glue logic around them.

	them here.

</p><h4><a name="profledcode">Power-On LED Test Codes</a></h4>


<p>
	If you examine the front panel on a twin-tower machine, you will
	notice an 8 position DIP switch.  This switch enables the power-on
	diagnostic routines. You must have switches 3 or 7 closed in order
	to enable power-on diagnostics.
</p><p>	
	Recently, a fellow hobbyist emailed me a list of the actual
	single-digit LED code meanings for the professional series. Note
	that the display cycles through the tests listed below, hence
	some codes have duplicate meanings depending on where they occur
	in the power-up test cycle. There also seems to be a correspondence
	with each of the tests and the LED array found on the edge of the
	IP4 and IP4.5 CPU cards.

</p><p>

	Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to determine just how every
	 LED array code corresponds to it&#39;s single-digit LED code (They
	 flash by too #$%@$ fast, even with two people watching... As a last ditch
	 attempt I tried slowing the CPU clock down to 1 Mhz in the hope that we
	 would be able to catch &#39;em. No dice. If anyone knows these codes, drop
	 me an email note and I&#39;ll complete the table below. </p><center>

<h4><a name="profdebgm1">The Hidden World of the GM1 PROM Monitor</a></h4>
<p>

	Buried deep within the GT graphics subsystem is a little-known
	interface which resides on the GM1 card. The GM1 appears to be
	built around a <em>MC68020</em> CPU running at 16 Mhz. If you examine the
	card, you will notice a female DB9 connector. This connector
	provides an RS232C serial interface <em><strong>(9600,N,8,1)</strong></em>
	 with more or less
	the same pinout	as the standard SGI DB9 Serial connector. The
	only difference is that this serial interface doesn&#39;t support
	any of the hardware handshaking lines, so you can get away with
	simply connecting pins 2,3 and 7 via an appropriate adaptor
	cable (or you can use the same type of adaptor cable needed to
	connect an ASCII terminal to serial port 1 for debugging purposes.
	See the chapter on <a href="#serialports">4D Series Serial Port Pinouts</a>
	for more details.)
	
</p><p>
	If you connect this interface to an ASCII terminal, you will observe
	an interesting series of events. Upon hardware reset, the GM1 card
	will proceed through a series of power-up self tests, displaying
	the results on the terminal. The card will then display a monitor
	prompt (&#34;<em><strong><kbd>gm&gt;</kbd></strong></em>&#34;) and wait for input. If you type either
	&#34;<kbd><SPAN color="#EE0000">?</SPAN></kbd>&#34; or
	&#34;<kbd><SPAN color="#EE0000">help</SPAN></kbd>&#34;, it will list a series of commands which will allow
	you to do the following:
</p><ul>
<li>	<SPAN color="#FF0093"><em>Test memory.</em></SPAN>
</li><li>	<SPAN color="#FF0093"><em>Set or list breakpoints.</em></SPAN>
</li><li>	<SPAN color="#FF0093"><em>Display memory.</em></SPAN>

</li><li>	<SPAN color="#FF0093"><em>Disassemble memory contents (i.e. display memory
                                  contents as 68020 instructions.)</em></SPAN>
</li></ul>
		

<p>
	As 680x0 monitors go, this isn&#39;t bad! This monitor was apparently
	intended for field service debugging of the graphics subsystem. Unfortunately,
	without more detailed documentation on the GT graphics subsystem (such
	as overall GT architecture documentation, a physical memory map, card
	interface specifications, etc.) the utility of this monitor is limited.	
	The power-on self tests might still be of use, as they will probabily
	allow you to diagnose GM1 on-board problems (or rule out the GM1 board
	as a the failure point.)
	
</p><p>

	If you look in <em><strong>/usr/include/sys/gtx.h</strong></em>, you
	will discover that the GM1 acts as the gateway into the
	graphics subsystem. As far as I have been able to determine, the MIPS based
	CPU board apparently communicates with	the graphics
	subsystem by submitting buffered requests through a shared memory
	interface managed by the GM1. I find it interesting that the basic
	architecture of the entire SGI 4D seems to be that of a MIPS based
	system wrapped around a MC68020 based graphics subsystem. Perhaps there
	is some evolutionary history to the development of this architecture, based
	on previous IRIS 3000 design experience? Since I don&#39;t have an IRIS 3000 to
	perform a design comparison on,	this all is mere speculation, but it is
	interesting nonetheless :-)

</p><p>
	 
	 If anyone has more detailed information on  the G, GT, GTX or other graphics architectures,
	 board diagnostic/repair/substitution guidelines or common failure modes (i.e. the <em>pinstriped screen of death</em> failure on the G and GT
	 :-) drop me an email note with the info and I&#39;ll include it here.

<p>

        I have noticed that the graphics subsystems (except for the &#34;Elan&#34; ?)
	seem to be interchangeable across the 4D/20-35 family.  This would imply
	that it should be possible to &#34;mix and match&#34;. Note that the values
	for Polygons refer to 10x10 (100 pixel) full 24-bit color, Lighted

<h4>General graphics hardware notes:</h4>


<p>


   There are apparently 2 flavors of GR1. These are referred to as &#34;RE1&#34; and &#34;RE2&#34;.
GR1.0 and GR1.1 are of the RE1 variety, while GR1.2 and above are RE2 boards. The
advantages of RE2 over RE1 are listed below:
</p><ul>

<li>	<strong>RE2</strong> is faster than <strong>RE1</strong>
</li><li>	<strong>RE2</strong> performs bitplane logic operations in hardware.
</li><li>	<strong>RE2</strong> is capable of writing 8-bit images in one write operation.
	    (i.e. 4 pixels can be written from 1 32-bit word. Apparently
	     the RE1 can only work with 1 pixel per word.)
</li><li>	<strong>RE2</strong> seems to handle X-based applications much faster.
</li><li>	<strong>RE2</strong> supports <em>STR_BOT</em> and <em>STR_TOP</em> modes.

<h3><a name="peririschassis">Chassis Configurations</a></h3>

	The Personal IRIS series consists of 4 basic machines which utilize
	the same general chassis/power supply. The Personal IRIS chassis
	was apparently designed with modularity in mind, since almost all
	the electronics reside in a subchassis or <em>E-module</em>. This E-module
	may be replaced as a unit, and contains the CPU and Graphics boards.
	Interestingly enough, SGI decided to design most of their systems
	so the the system ID hardware would &#34;follow&#34; the main chassis, rather than
	the CPU board. The ID module is located on inner front face of the
	main chassis. It connects to the E-module via a 10-pin IDC connector and
	ribbon cable.
<p>
	To remove the E-module, you only need to remove 1 (or possibly 2) screws
	on the lip of the module near the top of the chassis. You then lift the lip up,
	carefully tilting the E-module out of the chassis until the SCSI,
	system-ID, and power supply cable connectors are visible. Disconnect
	these cables, and the E-module should lift right out.
	
	The &#34;outer&#34; or main chassis and power supply for all 4 machines are
	virtually identical and exchangable, with the possible exception of
	the cooling fan	(see the chapter on <a href="#peririscool">Cooling</a>.)
	As far as I can determine, there were 2 variants of this main chassis.
	An early version provided rail-based drive bays for only two accessory drives
	which were installed from the top/front of the machine. The main hard
	drive was installed via a metal bracket which can only be accessed by
	removing the left-hand &#34;skin&#34; and cover. The newer (and more common)
	variant of the main chassis provides a rail-based drive bay for the
	main drive, accessible from the front of the unit via a large brown
	hinged access cover directly below the access cover for the 2 accessory
	drive bays. Although the older version of the main chassis may seem
	less flexible, in actuality it is preferable, since the main drive
	mounting hardware in this version uses a standard 40-pin IDC SCSI
	connector, eliminating the need to cludge up a SCSI/Power adaptor for
	the rail connectors. These rail drive-mounting kits (which are the same
	ones used for the SGI Crimson series) are available from 3rd party
	suppliers, but they are still a bit pricey.

</p><p>
	
	The E-module consists of a metal sub-chassis housing the CPU and Graphics
	boards. The E-Module also provides a single 6U VME slot for accessory VME
	cards. Note that the E-Modules for the 4D/(20-25) and 4D/(30-35) are
	quite different!  The &#39;35 E-module is deeper than the &#39;25, and the bottom
	has a slight slope in order to accomodate the power supply cabling harness
	that runs under the E-module when it is installed in the main chassis. This
	difference precludes using the metal housing of the &#39;25 E-module when
	upgrading to a &#39;35.  The &#39;35 E-module also provides a &#34;mixer fan&#34; on the
	inside CPU cover of E-module. Apparently, this cludge was added to eliminate
	thermal hot spots from forming over the R3000 and/or FP Math chip. Make <strong><em>certain</em></strong>
	that this small mixer fan is operating! failure of this fan could result in your
	system cooking itself to death!

<h3><a name="perirismemory">Memory Configurations</a></h3>

	The <a href="https://words.filippo.io/www-viz.tamu.edu/~sgi-faq/faq/html/hardware/index.htm">Official SGI
	Hardware FAQ</a> covers memory configuration matters for the Personal IRIS
	series in an relatively complete manner, and should be considered the
	authoritative reference on memory matters. Nevertheless, I have included
	the following information for the sake of completeness.
<p>
 
	There are two main architectures within the Personal IRIS series, and both
	use completely different SIMM designs. The 4D/(20-25) systems use
	industry standard 30-pin true parity SIMMS. The 4D/(30-35) (and also the
	Indigo R3000) make use of SGI-developed proprietary 64-pin SIMMS. 

</p><h4><a name="perirismem35">4D/(30-35) Systems</a></h4>

	The 4D/(30-35) architecture uses a SGI proprietary 64-pin SIMM. It
	can usually be identified by the large ASIC (responsible for memory
	interleave?) which is present on the back of each SIMM. Note that
	no other 64-pin SIMM (such as the ones used in COMPAQ systems) will
	work.
<p>
	SGI <em>R3000</em> SIMMS usually come in 2Mb, 4Mb, 8Mb and 16Mb flavors,
	and may	be used in any combination (as long as you observe the restriction
	that SIMMS must be installed in banks of 4, all of the same size.) Note that
	there is one peculiarity that you should watch out for when using <em>4Mb
	SIMMS</em>. Due to a memory initialization bug in the &#39;35 boot EPROM,
	<em><strong>only one set</strong></em> (i.e. 4)
	of 4Mb SIMMS may be installed in any one machine. This restriction
	applies only to	the 4Mb flavor. You can then fill out the rest of the
	available banks with any of the other SIMM sizes.
	

</p><h4><a name="perirismem25">4D/(20-25) Systems</a></h4>

	The 4D/(20-25) architecture uses industry standard 30-pin true
	parity SIMMS :-)  I recommend using 9-chip SIMMS, as people seem
	to have had the most luck with this variety. Supported SIMM sizes for the
	4D/25 are 1Mb, 2Mb and, with any luck, 4Mb. The 4D/20 supposedly
	supports 1Mb and 2Mb.  4Mb support on the 4D/20 seems open to
	question.  Some of the older postings to the SGI archive indicate
	conflicting opinions on this, with the general impression being that
	4Mb SIMM support on the 4D/20 may depend on the boot PROM version.

<h4><a name="perirismem4meg">Getting 4Mb SIMMS to work in a 4D/25</a></h4>

	Although the 4D/25 supports 4Mb SIMMS, this support can, at times,
	be a bit flakey. Apparently there is a bug in the memory initialization
	code of the &#39;25 boot EPROM.  Somewhere during the memory sizing/test
	phase, the &#39;25 reads memory and checks for a known pattern <em>before</em>
	initializing it. This results in memory being sized incorrectly if
	the 4Mb SIMMS do not power-up with the expected memory bitpattern. Many
	older <em>Toshiba</em> 4Mb SIMMS power-up with the correct pattern. Many
	Hitachi (and various other manufacturer&#39;s) 4Mb SIMMS do not. This
	failure mode is covered in much greater detail by the <a href="https://words.filippo.io/www-viz.tamu.edu/~sgi-faq/faq/html/hardware/index.htm">Official SGI
	Hardware FAQ</a>.  There is a quick and dirty fix if you encounter
	this problem. After booting the &#39;25 up in monitor mode, check the
	reported memory size via the <kbd>hinv</kbd> command. If it reports
	an incorrect value for installed memory, try the following command:

<p>
		<SPAN color="#FF0000"><strong><kbd>
	fill -v 0 0xa0400000
		</kbd></strong></SPAN>	<br/>

</p><p>

	Then press the reset button (do NOT power the system off). This command
	will initialize memory to a known and expected bitpattern, and during
	the next boot cycle the memory will retain this pattern (if you haven&#39;t
	powered your system off.) The &#39;25 should now size memory properly, and
	should continue to do so as long as you don&#39;t power the &#39;25 off
	between system resets.

<h3><a name="peririsaudio">Audio Capabilities</a></h3>

	The audio capabilities of the Personal IRIS series are outlined
	below. You should check the official SGI <kbd>man audio</kbd> pages for more detailed
	information. For the benefit of those who don&#39;t yet have access
	to the man pages (some versions of IRIX considered audio support
	as part of the optional IDO) I have summarized some of the important points
	below.
<p>
	 The capabilities of the &#39;30 and &#39;35 are significantly
	improved over those of the &#39;20 and &#39;25, owing to the complete
	redesign of the audio subsystem for the later machines. Some
	early versions of the &#39;35 may not have the audio &#34;option&#34;, however,
	as the audio subsystem was not ready in time for the initial
	release of the &#39;35.  
</p><h4><a name="peririsaudio35">4D/(30-35) Systems</a></h4>

	The audio subsystem for &#39;30 and &#39;35 machines was referred to
	as the &#34;Magnum&#34; audio option. This consisted of a CPU daughter
	board containing a <em>Motorola 56000 DSP</em> chip and associated D/A, A/D and glue
	logic. This audio subsystem is quite similar, if not
	identical, to that present on the Indigo. It is capable of sampling
	at the following rates; <em><strong>8 Khz</strong></em>, <em><strong>11.025 Khz</strong></em>, <em><strong>16 Khz</strong></em>, <em><strong>22.05 Khz</strong></em>, <em><strong>32 Khz</strong></em>,
	<em><strong>44.1 Khz</strong></em> and<em><strong> 48 Khz</strong></em>, and supports <em><strong>8</strong></em>, <em><strong>16</strong></em> and <em><strong>24 bit</strong></em> audio sample sizes.
	Interfacing to the audio subsystem is accomplished via
	2 analog channels and one digital channel. All I/O connections
	are made using miniature (1/8&#34;) stereo phone plugs.
	The pinouts are below:

<h4><a name="peririsaudio25">4D/(20-25) Systems</a></h4>
	
	The audio subsystem for the &#39;20 and &#39;25 machines was based
	on an 8-bit ulaw encoding/decoding scheme. The samples are
	8-bit 2&#39;s complement (signed char). A 0x00 represents minimum (0) Amplitude,
	and 0x7F (or 0x80) represents maximum Amplitude.
	A similar scheme
	was used on the Sun <em>Sparc2</em>, and it may be possible to play
	files interchangably on both machines (I have <strong>not</strong> tried this,
	and you may have to address byte-ordering differences between
	the two platforms, but I have heard of people getting this
	to work.) To access the audio subsystem, you simply read
	or wrote a ulaw encoded file to <strong><em>/dev/audio</em></strong>.
	You will need to connect an 8 Ohm speaker and a 600 Ohm microphone. The
	output is AC coupled. If anyone happens to have more detailed specs
	for the audio subsystem on the &#39;20 and &#39;25, drop me an email note
	with the details and I&#39;ll include them here.

<h3><a name="peririsupgrade">Upgrading a 4D/2x to a 4D/3x</a></h3>	

	It is possible to upgrade a 4D/2<em>x</em> to a 4D/3<em>x</em>. You will need to swap
	out the E-module and replace it with an E-module from a 4D/3<em>x</em> series.
	You can re-use the graphics board, however. At a minumum, you&#39;ll need
	a new CPU board and a new &#39;3<em>x</em> E-module metal sub-chassis (see the
	chapter on Personal IRIS <a href="#peririschassis">Chassis Configurations</a>.)
	 You might also
	have to upgrade the cooling fan in the main chassis if it happens to
	be undersized (see the chapter on Personal IRIS <a href="#peririscool">Cooling</a>.)

<h3><a name="peririspasswd">How to defeat the NVRAM password</a></h3>

	Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve just located this neat fully loaded 4D/35TG at a hamfest for
	$25.00 :-) You drag it home happily mumbling to yourself, pleased
	with your bargaining acumen. You hoist the critter up onto the
	kitchen table, ignoring your wife&#39;s screams of indignation. You connect
	the monitor and keyboard and power it up. Up comes IRIX! Woopee! Now to
	log in...password? what&#39;s that you say? I need a PASSWORD???. Hastily
	thumbing through some old usenet posts, you finally realize that you
	can boot the beast up from the monitor in single user mode and reset
	the root password. After a hasty reset, you try to enter the NVRAM monitor...
	password? what? What? PASSWORD AGAIN??? ARRGHH!!! (This is where you
	start pulling your hair out :-)
<p>

	You&#39;ve just been bitten	by the NVRAM password option available on some of
	the 4D/3x and later series.  Fortunately, there are a couple of ways around
	this, so go get a dust pan, sweep up your hair, and read on...

</p><h4><a name="peririspwdroot">Root Access Method</a></h4>

	If you are lucky enough to have root access to a system that has a
	NVRAM password set, you can reset it from root simply by using the <kbd>nvram</kbd>
	command. The NVRAM environment variable you need to change is <kbd>passwd_key</kbd>.
	For example, the command:</div>
  </body>
</html>
