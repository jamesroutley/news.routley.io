    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Or, <em><strong>the one in which we hand-craft nano Unix tools using Bash functions.</strong></em></p>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="https://evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-1-doug-mcilroys-pipeline">previous post</a>,
functions obey stdio and we can mix and match them with built-ins (grep, sed,
cat etc.) and other installed tools (like jq, pandoc, babashka etc.). We used
functions to name parts of Douglas McIlroy’s pipeline and mess around a bit.</p>
<p>I tend to make libraries of pure functions that I can source in shell sessions
and use just like any other shell tool, complete with tab-completion. e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit">bash-toolkit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite">shite</a>.</p>

<p>Last time, we wrote functions like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">flatten_paragraphs<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    tr -cs A-Za-z <span>&#39;\n&#39;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The syntax may look familiar, but their behaviour and semantics differ in
many ways from functions in the more modern languages like Python or JS etc.</p>
<h3 id="bash-functions-are-compound-commands">Bash functions are compound commands<a href="#bash-functions-are-compound-commands" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p><code>man bash</code> describes functions as follows (online manpage: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html%5Fnode/Shell-Functions.html">shell functions</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Function Definitions</strong></p>
<p>A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and
executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.
Shell functions are declared as follows:</p>
<p><code>name () compound-command [redirection]</code></p>
<p>… and more stuff …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will do names last, because names are hard :) Let’s start with the
“compound command” part.</p>
<p>There are several ways to write <em>compound commands</em>, each serving a different
purpose. To define functions, we only need the <code>{ list; }</code> form. So we will
ignore the others. Some context from the Bash manpage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Compound Commands</strong></p>
<p>A compound command is one of the following. In most cases a list in a
command’s description may be separated from the rest of the command by
one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon.</p>
<p><code>(list)</code>
list is executed in a subshell environment …</p>
<p><code>{ list; }</code>
list is simply executed in the current shell environment. list
must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known as
a group command. The return status is the exit status of list.
Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved
words and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be
recognized. Since they do not cause a word break, they must be
separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.</p>
<p><code>((expression))</code>
Arithmetic expressions …</p>
<p><code>[[ expression ]]</code>
Compound conditional expression …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bash manual page can feel a little obtuse at times. Hopefully the examples
and discussion in this post will serve as useful illustrations.</p>
<h3 id="function-definitions-live-in-a-global-namespace">Function definitions live in a global namespace<a href="#function-definitions-live-in-a-global-namespace" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This means function definitions are isolated, and don’t override any alias,
builtin, variable, or reserved keyword of the same name.</p>
<p>To see what that means, let’s bind the same name to different things.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">$ sed<span>()</span> <span>{</span> echo lol; <span>}</span> <span># will the function override the sed built-in?</span>

$ sed<span>=</span><span>&#34;phew!&#34;</span> <span># will the variable override the function we defined?</span>

$ alias sed<span>=</span>cat <span># will the alias override everything?</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can query all objects that the name <code>sed</code> is bound to. (Note: the variable
meaning won’t show up in this listing.)</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">$ type -a sed
sed is aliased to <span>&#39;cat&#39;</span>
sed is a <span>function</span>
sed <span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    echo lol
<span>}</span>
sed is /bin/sed
</code></pre></div><p>And we can invoke or evaluate each meaning of the word <code>sed</code>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">$ man bash | sed <span># Oops. Boy, are we in trouble now.</span>
<span># Bash interprets the unquoted word as an alias, which is &#39;cat&#39;.</span>

$ man bash | command sed 1q <span># execute as a command (not function, or alias)</span>
BASH<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>           General Commands Manual              BASH<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>


$ <span>&#39;sed&#39;</span> <span># quoting prevents interpretation as alias. Function meaning gets used.</span>
lol

$ echo foo | <span>&#39;sed&#39;</span> <span># works fine in pipes too</span>
lol

$ echo $sed <span># the variable remains intact too</span>
phew!
</code></pre></div><p>This namespacing is certainly merciful, but it is not quite enough. As you
may have guessed, it can get very confusing if we reuse names willy-nilly.
If there was one thing I could improve about Bash, it would be adding “real”
namespaces. That would help write modular code. Alas, that ship sailed long ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, I drop Bash after the code starts getting too involved; beyond about
1,000 LoC (of clean FP-style Bash). In large scripts, the sharp corners of Ye
Olde Shell start poking holes and forcing bugs (quoting, expansion, trap/error
handling etc.).</p>
<p>That said (or um, sed), under 1K LoC clean FP-style Bash can do a crazy amount
of work sufficiently fast <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That sweet spot is what this series
is all about. Like <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite">shite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/oxo">oxo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-design-good-functions">How to design good functions<a href="#how-to-design-good-functions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Bash functions provide certain highly functional features like obeying stdio,
thus being streaming-friendly units of program design. Several other creature
comforts of functional style are not automatic. <em>However</em> we can get plenty
functional with <em>some</em> care and manual effort.</p>
<p>Here are things I do to keep my functions, well, functional.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-domain-concepts-in-single-purpose-functions">Wrap domain concepts in single-purpose functions<a href="#wrap-domain-concepts-in-single-purpose-functions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Previously, we wrapped invocations of Unix tools and pipelines in functions,
gave them domain-specific names, to achieve domain-specific compositional power.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">sort_dictionary<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    sort -b -d -k2
<span>}</span>

sort_rhyme<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    rev | sort -b -d | rev
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Small functions are absolutely fine! In fact, we prefer our functions be small,
single-purpose, and as general as possible, just like any other Unix tool.</p>
<h3 id="use-parameter-substitutions-and-local-scope-variables">Use parameter substitutions and local scope variables<a href="#use-parameter-substitutions-and-local-scope-variables" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Functions only accept positional parameters, like regular shell scripts. And
like regular scripts, we can send input for evaluation as well as to control
behaviour of the function, as well will see later in this post.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, positional-only params make optionality hard. The following
techniques help mitigate this limitation. Compare them with the example below.</p>
<ul>
<li>I tend to keep my functions small and avoid API design that requires more
than 3 parameters. This is just a nonscientific thumb rule.</li>
<li>Next, I use Bash parameter substitution to provide sane fallbacks, and/or
enforce API contracts (fail and die if param not provided).</li>
<li>I always assign positional params to local variables inside the function
body, which is a bit verbose, but improves readability and traceability.
And it makes any parameter substitution explicit.</li>
<li>I also declare all named params as <code>local</code>, which ensures variable scope
and mutation is local to the function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of my parameter-accepting functions are designed with just one optional
parameter. Here is a motivating example from my little <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit">bash-toolkit</a> library.
The ones copied here help with ad-hoc log analysis tasks.</p>
<p>Accept optional parameter, with a sane default.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the latter two functions reuse the earlier functions to create
completely different log processing tools, yet retain flexibility to deal with
arbitrary parts of log files, as well as compose together any way we please
(not all of which will be sensible, but that’s besides the point :).</p>
<p>There are many ways to do <a href="https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/posparams">parameter handling</a>; a whole topic of its own.
Play around to get a sense for it, but keep your actual usage simple.</p>
<h3 id="partial-application-of-functions">Partial application of functions<a href="#partial-application-of-functions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial%5Fapplication">Partial application</a> is not automatic in Bash,
but that does not mean we can’t do it.</p>
<p>In the example below, a utility function <code>__with_git_dir</code> knows something
about a git directory, but nothing about a git subcommand that we wish to run.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">__with_git_dir<span>()</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>These functions <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit/blob/7cbac8bd6a7970481f6f62e5a2a604afcaf804ea/bulk-git-ops.sh#L99">belong to some git utilities</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that
help me conveniently run git commands against any repo on my file system,
without cd-ing to the repo.</p>
<p>See? Functions can be dead-simple yet super useful. If you accumulate wee
functions for your git needs, you get executable documentation. You can <code>source</code>
them in your Bash terminal on any computer and be on your way. Likewise, any
other command-line-y need of yours.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-injection-with-functions">Dependency injection with functions<a href="#dependency-injection-with-functions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>The previous section brought us close to dependency injection. We passed in
git subcommands as argument to the <code>__with_git_dir</code> utility. <em><strong>We can do the
same with our own functions.</strong></em> This is a form of “higher order” Functional
Programming; viz. making functions that accept functions as arguments.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit/blob/7cbac8bd6a7970481f6f62e5a2a604afcaf804ea/bulk-git-ops.sh">see the same git utilities file</a> for usages such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>xgit</code> utility fn to apply simple git commands to the given repos.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">ls_git_projects ~/src/bitbucket | xgit fetch <span># bitbucket-hosted repos</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>proc_repos</code> to apply custom functions to the given repos.</p>

</ul>
<p>I’ve also used this design technique in <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite">shite</a>
(the little static site generator from shell :).
This is baaasically what its <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite/blob/f8d2d22316a8c2fc04c92c1390abb77c69377f6f/shite%5Futils.sh#L237">“main” function</a> does.</p>

assigned to function names we pass from the outside. Also notice the use of
sane fallbacks for the positional params in this case.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-functions-pure">Keeping Functions pure<a href="#keeping-functions-pure" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>The <code>return</code> statement in Bash returns exit codes, not values. So we have to
pause a bit to figure out how to “return” values. Well, we have to rely on
stdio, and the fact that the Unix tools philosophy encourages us to emit data
in the same format as we receive it.</p>
<p>The <code>identity</code> function is the simplest example. By definition, it returns
its input unchanged. That’s just <code>cat</code>! Thus we can write this streaming
<em>identity</em> function.</p>
<p>This definition of <em>identity</em> is surprisingly useful, as we will see below.</p>
<p>Note that I strongly favour pipeline-friendly domain modeling and functional
programming, to profit from the naturally streaming nature of Unix.</p>
<p>Under such architecture, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em> are automatic, and I
only need to write a pure “step” or single-item processing function.</p>
<p>My “step” functions are simply transforms of input text (or data structure)
to output text (or data structure). This can be anything; in case of plain
text lines I do line transforms with <code>sed</code> or <code>printf</code>, or line selects
with <code>grep</code>, or line-munging with <code>tr</code> etc. I do the equivalent with <code>jq</code>
for JSON-formatted lines. <a href="http://evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-1-doug-mcilroys-pipeline/">The previous post</a> featured such “step” functions
for <em>map</em> (<code>tokenise_lowercase</code>, <code>bigram</code>), <em>filter</em> (<code>drop_stopwords</code>), and
<em>reduce</em> (<code>frequencies</code>, <code>sort_dictionary</code>).</p>
<p><em>shite</em> has a <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite/blob/f8d2d22316a8c2fc04c92c1390abb77c69377f6f/shite%5Futils.sh#L89">more interesting example</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to make a blog site. For each blog post, only the content
changes. The surrounding HTML wrapper remains constant (head, body, header,
footer etc.). If we tease apart wrapper HTML construction and body HTML
construction, then we can write a “page builder” function like this. Note
the <code>cat -</code> in the middle. Our identity function appears!</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">shite_build_page<span>()</span> <span>{</span>

</span><span>    &lt;/body&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/html&gt;
</span><span>EOF</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Observe that <code>$(cat -)</code> blindly injects content in the <code>&lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</code> block,
received via stdin of the <em>function</em> <code>shite_build_page</code>. Thus, for the same
input it will always produce the same output, making it a pure function.
This choice also makes the caller responsible for passing it HTML, because
the output is HTML.</p>
<p>Further, by the single responsibility principle, our function’s job is simply
to punch HTML content into an HTML wrapper and return the composite. So it is
vital that this function <em>not know or care</em> how the HTML it receives is made.</p>
<p>And here’s the cherry… By making this design choice, we have in fact made
a step function that we can <em>map</em> over many blog posts.</p>

<p>Now, how do we apply functional programming principles to the next level up,
viz. to design our programs?</p>
<p>If you’ve seen shell scripts in the wild, you’d have observed they are often
written as sequences of statements and imperative control flow that evaluates
top to bottom. I think that practice is a bit tragic, because it produces
needlessly complex code, because people reach for flags and global variables
and traps and suchlike.</p>
<p>Functions obviate a lot of that icky stuff. We still need the ick, but we can
constrain it to very specific tightly controlled bits of our program, and only
when the ick makes absolute sense.</p>
<p>I will also say that if we can make programs that are themselves functional
compositions, then we can chain entire programs together into still larger
scale functional structures. Further, since stdio includes named pipes, and
sockets, we can compose multi-process as well as multi-machine pipelines,
with a great economy of code. And this is <em>not</em> insane at all. Seriously.</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. Here is how I try to keep my programs functional.</p>
<h3 id="writing-pipeline-friendly-functions">Writing Pipeline-friendly Functions<a href="#writing-pipeline-friendly-functions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Frequently, an imperative algorithm can also be expressed in data-flow terms.
That is, instead of if-else-y code, think in terms of map/filter/reduce.</p>
<p>Once again, recalling the git utility functions referenced above. Suppose you
had to return a list of “stale” repositories from a given directory, you may
be tempted to write something like this. (Here “stale” means “not worked on
for the last N hours”).</p>

<p>Given the fact that functions respect <code>stdio</code>, we can pull apart our imperative

<p>“Don’t be chatty” is an important design principle. This means don’t pollute
your stdout values with non-values. Sometimes though, we want to emit process
information (like logs) <em>along</em> with emitting process output. For example,
a structured process log becomes handy when we want to design idempotent jobs.</p>
<p>Going back to my <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit/blob/7cbac8bd6a7970481f6f62e5a2a604afcaf804ea/bulk-git-ops.sh#L49">bulk-git-ops example</a>,
suppose I want to process a whole bunch of git repos. This may fail any time
if my network flakes, or laptop battery dies, or some weird condition occurs.
Sh*t happens when processes run for a long time <em>and</em> need networks. So I
usually want to log each repo as it is being processed.</p>

<p>I like to write my code in groups and sequences that help a reader acquire
context easily, and I call it in sequences that make sense from a process
point of view. Functions help me do this, because they group statements in
the scope of the script, <em>without</em> causing the interpreter to evaluate them.</p>
<p>For example, scripts I wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>to <a href="https://gitlab.com/nilenso/cats/-/blob/c26bcd7e6618843690070b8bf38cf7adb553a0d2/bin/cicd-deployment.sh#L122">perform build/deploy steps</a> for a study project</li>

<p>Pun intended. This is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">a very useful design technique</a>.</p>
<p>We lift out as much work as possible into lots of small, pure, single purpose
functions, and compose these separately to do composite work and/or to cause
effects (perform I/O, set/reset globals, mutate in-process state etc.).</p>
<p>You may observe it applied in all my code:</p>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/bash-toolkit/blob/7cbac8bd6a7970481f6f62e5a2a604afcaf804ea/usage-trap.sh#L109">usage-trap file</a>
is a template for how I tend to go about that for single-file scripts.</li>
<li>The whole game design of <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/oxo">oxo</a>:
<ul>
<li>The <code>oxo_logic.sh</code> file is the “functional core”.</li>
<li>The <code>oxo</code> file is the “imperative shell” (and is the game’s entry point).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite">shite</a> is being developed exactly this way.</li>

<p>This technique helps me develop scripts incrementally, in terms of highly
reusable, testable, composable functional “lego blocks”.</p>

<p>Now the really hard part…</p>
<p>I write all my function names as follows, because it is the most portable
syntax. Bash accepts several ways to define functions, but POSIX sh strictly
expects this syntax, and I prefer to maintain as much compatibility as I can.
Also I find it is the neatest of the alternatives.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">namespace_func_name<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    statement <span>1</span>
    statement <span>2</span>
    statement <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Sometimes I write short one-liners as follows. The semicolon is essential
for one-liners. So is the space between the braces and the statement.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">namespace_func_name<span>()</span> <span>{</span> statement ; <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>There is no such thing as a “private” or locally-scoped function, so I resort
to marking these “private” by convention with a <code>__</code> (double underscore) prefix.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">__namespace_private_func_name<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    statement1
    statement2
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The following syntax is legal Bash, but I do not use it.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span>function</span> namespace_func_name <span>{</span>
    statement1
    statement2
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> namespace_func_name<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    statement1
    statement2
<span>}</span>

<span># OR one-liner variants</span>
<span>function</span> namespace_func_name <span>{</span> statement ; <span>}</span>
<span>function</span> namespace_func_name<span>()</span> <span>{</span> statement ; <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Bash accepts <code>.</code> and <code>-</code> in function names, but that is also a no-no for me.
A linter like Shellcheck will complain in strict mode.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">namespace.funcname<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    statement <span>1</span>
    statement <span>2</span>

    statement <span>1</span>
    statement <span>2</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ok, we covered a lot of ground, so I’ll stop for now. There are more aspects
of FP in bash (idempotence, declarative programming etc.), for future posts.
But even this much will elevate your shell-fu, and let you write nontrivial
scripts incrementally, safely, and maintainably.</p>
