    <h1>Kyoto University team develops pain reliever comparable to morphine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                      <p>A Kyoto University research team has developed a pain-reliever that is comparable to morphine but does not have serious side effects.</p>

<p>Morphine, often administered to cancer patients, has serious adverse effects such as breathing issues and addiction.</p>

<p>According to the team, the newly developed drug, Adriana, is a groundbreaking painkiller, which works on a completely different mechanism to morphine and other existing synthetic opioids. The drug has the potential to revolutionize pain control in the medical field, the team said.</p>

<p>The team also expects that the drug will help resolve the so-called opioid epidemic, in which a large number of deaths occur mainly due to overdoses of opioids.</p>

<p>Its findings were published in the online edition of the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>When a person encounters a life-threatening situation, norepinephrine, an organic chemical secreted from the brain, suppresses pain.</p>

<p>For its study, the team focused on the human body regulating oversecretion of norepinephrine. By introducing a new research technology, the team succeeded in developing a drug blocking such a control function for the first time in the world.</p>

<p>In a clinical trial conducted at the Kyoto University Hospital between January 2023 and December 2024, the team confirmed the new drug&#39;s efficiency to a certain extent for patients including 20 who underwent lung cancer surgery.</p>

<p>The team plans to conduct a clinical trial in the United States for 400 postsurgery patients in 2026, aiming to put Adriana into practical use in 2028.</p>

<p>&#34;We hope that the new drug will help cancer patients who previously had no choice but to use opioids live their lives without pain as well as a need to worry about addiction or serious side effects,&#34; Masatoshi Hagiwara, a professor at the university, said.</p>
