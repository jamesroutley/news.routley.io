    <h1>What&#39;s up in the Python community? – April 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><ul><li><p><em>Most new Python projects are still about AI</em></p></li><li><p><em>Flask&#39;s author new project, a Python installer, made waves</em></p></li><li><p><em>Python 3.12 improves the language perf by 4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Urllib3 v2 is out, removing support for loads of things</em></p></li><li><p><em>Textual, the TUI library, runs in a web browser now</em></p></li><li><p><em>Pydantic 2 alpha shows a 5X increase in speed</em></p></li><li><p><em>Pycon US is over, now wait for the videos</em></p></li></ul><p>We have been inundated with the LLM craze for a few months now, and I must say I don&#39;t get tired of it. It&#39;s so damn fun, and feels like the 2000&#39;s again, when the internet was new, full of promises and silly things.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/trending/python?since=monthly" rel="">Github trending projects</a><span> reflect that very well, with AI-related repositories taking most of the listing real estate. A good chunk of it didn&#39;t exist last month, and who knows if it will exist next month?</span></p><p>Twitter still got a few punchlines about this:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tunguz/status/1649442898537254914" rel="">https://twitter.com/tunguz/status/1649442898537254914</a></p><p>And if you haven&#39;t given it a try yet, just calling the Open AI API from Python is a ridiculously entertaining way of draining your wallet.</p><p>I personally coded the most expensive telegram bot ever.</p><p>Worth it.</p><p><span>It&#39;s true, large language models are kinda omnipresent, but for a brief moment in time, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1650856079583248385" rel="">packaging took over the spotlight</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>You may have noticed that this blog recently talked about packaging quite a lot, and there was a lot of debates elsewhere as well. This surfaced the work of Trio&#39;s author, </span><a href="https://github.com/njsmith/posy" rel="">posy and pybi</a><span>, respectively an Python installer and a standardized Python distribution format.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Flask&#39;s author released a tool with a similar goal, that he had so far used internally: </span><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye" rel="">rye</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The announcement made a big wave, that may lead up to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1651164453847564289" rel="">some quite positive turn of events</a><span>.</span></p><p>So why is it a big deal?</p><p><span>Well, those projects are trying to solve the problem that &#34;</span><a href="https://bitecode.substack.com/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain" rel="">Relieving your packaging pain</a><span>&#34; addresses, meaning bootstrapping Python correctly.</span></p><p>A huge number of Python packaging problems come from bootstrapping Python, not packaging per se.</p><p>But those projects target the pain with tooling, and that&#39;s much better.</p><p>How do they do this?</p><p><span>In short, they attack directly the issues you may have read about in our previous article, &#34;</span><a href="https://bitecode.substack.com/p/why-is-the-python-installation-process" rel="">Explaining why the Python installation process is such a mess</a><span>&#34;. </span></p><p>TL;DR:</p><ul><li><p>they make the Python installation experience the same on all machines (no more fiddling with the dependencies, the PATH, command names, etc.);</p></li><li><p>they provide precompiled binaries of python on all platforms (no pyenv with is missing headers);</p></li><li><p>the binaries are standardized (no more missing tk);</p></li><li><p>they promote the use of virtual environments. </p></li></ul><p>Now those projects are not ready for production, as they have plenty of rough edges, but pack the potential to bring a new era to the language.</p><p>I&#39;m not exaggerating.</p><p>Python is massively successful despite those pain points, so imagine if you can get a cargo like experience.</p><p>Before ChatGPT, there was only one thing that was more subject to debate than packaging in the community, and that’s Python performances. So it&#39;s no surprise that when Guido van Rossum announced he was going to work on making CPython faster, people got excited.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/plan.md" rel="">The plan</a><span> was to incrementally gain about 50% of perfs for four releases in a row (starting with Python 3.10), leading to what was, at the time, hoped to become a 5x increase in general speed of the language.</span></p><p><span>The transition to 3.11 </span><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/" rel="">brought</a><span> a very honorable 1.22X, but couldn&#39;t reach the 1.5x that many were hyped about.</span></p><p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/928437/" rel="">The latest reports</a><span> on 3.12 are only talking about a 1.04x so far, or a 4% improvement. Given that this release was going to introduce the foundation of a JIT in CPython, it&#39;s easy to find that underwhelming.</span></p><p><span>But let&#39;s remember the release is </span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0693/" rel="">scheduled for October</a><span>, and a lot can happen in 6 months. Especially since the internal representation of integers is </span><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120a6/" rel="">touted to have been changed</a><span> with performances in mind, hinting that the team is laying out the groundwork for a just-in-time compiler to do a better job.</span></p><p><span>My absolute favorite improvement of the last 2 releases were </span><a href="https://realpython.com/python311-error-messages/" rel="">the incredibly better error messages</a><span> and Python 3.12 continues with that excellent trend.</span></p><p>However, we all would like a pony, wouldn&#39;t we?</p><p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/" rel="">urllib3</a><span> is the backbone of the Python ecosystem, it&#39;s the curl of the language, it&#39;s everywhere. It&#39;s virtually </span><a href="https://pypistats.org/top" rel="">the most downloaded package on pypi</a><span>. Ok, technically it&#39;s boto, but it&#39;s automatically installed constantly by AWS servers so it&#39;s cheating.</span></p><p>This lib is why &#34;requests&#34; can even exist; it is vendored with every machine that has &#34;pip&#34; on it.</p><p><span>This new release bumps the major digit because it&#39;s breaking things, by removing </span><a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.0.0" rel="">a long list of deprecated stuff</a><span>, starting with support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6, </span><a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" rel="">all of them having reached end of life</a><span>.</span></p><p>So what should you do?</p><p>Well, if you are a library author that touches HTTP even with a 10-foot pole, now is time to fire up your testing machinery.</p><p>And if you are not, now is time to slow down your upgrades. Give the Pypi crowd the time to catch up.</p><p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/textual/" rel="">Textual</a><span>, everyone&#39;s favorite Python TUI library in 2022, keeps improving. We just had a peek of it running the browser (yes, a terminal application that also runs natively  in the browser), but it is now </span><a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1650526209464311808" rel="">playing inside a jupyter notebook</a></p><p><span>I used to be a great fans of </span><a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="">Marshmallow</a><span>, but </span><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" rel="">Pydantic</a><span> won me over with the type hints and the FastApi integration.</span></p><p>The lib has always been slow. I&#39;m currently working for a client that receives inputs of several 10k lines JSON files. Validating them can slow down the program startup by up to 2 seconds. Not great, not terrible.</p><p><span>However, these days, thanks to the amazing </span><a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin" rel="">Maturin project</a><span>, Python and Rust are BFF and lots of projects are getting a boost through oxidation.</span></p><p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2/" rel="">Pydantic V2</a><span> was expected to follow this trend, with the hope of shedding some weight.</span></p><p><span>And it did, with a minimum of </span><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2-alpha/" rel="">5x perfs gain</a><span>, and up to 50x.</span></p><p>Of course, things are going to break. To jump in just yet unless you want to prepare your library for it.</p><p><span>All the PyCon are a bit special, but </span><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/" rel="">PyCon US</a><span> is specialer. You can read </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tiangolo" rel="">the most famous Pythonic mustache on Tweeter</a><span> to have an idea of how many people from cool projects got to hang out together.</span></p><p><span>If you didn&#39;t attend, I encourage you to check out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS" rel="">the official YouTube page</a><span> as they will publish the talks in the near future.</span></p><p>Though with those videos, sometimes the future is nearer and sometimes it is mucher lesser nearer, so be patient.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
