    <h1>Facebook tracking is illegal in Europe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Meta&#39;s business model - to force users to agree to tracking via their terms - has been declared illegal in the EU. 
Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp can no longer run personalized ads without **active** user consent.
</p><div><div><p><strong>TL;DR: Meta&#39;s practice of 
requiring users to consent to tracking via their terms is not legal according to the GDPR.
Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp must offer a Yes &amp; No option so that users can actively give consent - or refuse. This
is a huge blow to Meta&#39;s business model of surveillance-based advertising.</strong></p>
<h3 id="decision-of-eu-privacy-regulators">Decision of EU privacy regulators</h3>
<p>In a far-reaching decision on Monday, EU privacy regulators, said that Meta Platforms Inc. must not force users to agree
to personalized ads based on their online activity. The ruling could enormously limit the data that Meta can use to sell
targeted ads.</p>
<p>Simply putting a paragraph into the terms of service - to which users have to agree - is not sufficient according to the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Such terms are no justification to collect data and post targeted ads. Instead,
Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp must give users a clear Yes &amp; No choice where they can actively agree 
to being tracked - or refuse.</p>
<p>The tech giant’s so-called forced consent to continue tracking and targeting users by processing their personal data 
to build profiles for behavioral advertising has been added to Meta&#39;s terms after the publication of the GDPR in 2018. Now
it has been declared illegal by EU privacy watchdogs.  </p>
<p><img height="3898" width="5703" alt="EU decision makes requiring tracking via terms illegal." src="https://tutanota.com/blog/images/max-schrems-noyb-privacy-shield.jpg"/></p><p>This decision followed complaints that were filed by European privacy NGO <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> as soon as the GDPR came into force in May 2018.
It took the EU about 4.5 years to finally decide on the issue. </p>
<p>The reason for this lengthy process is that the 
Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has originally declared that Meta&#39;s updated terms meet the requirements by the
GDPR. Ireland is Meta&#39;s main privacy regulator in the bloc because that is where Meta’s 
European headquarters is based.</p>
<p>Meta explained that its updated terms rely on the GDPR concept of &#34;contractual necessity&#34;. The GDPR mostly prohibits companies from forcing users 
to turn over personal information to use their services. The only exception is when that information is necessary to execute a contract: 
For instance, a car sharing app needs to know your location so that it can show cars near you.</p>
<p>Meta relied on that contractual provision of the GDPR, to which the Irish privacy regulator initially agreed.</p>
<p>But now, the EU privacy regulators are passing the decision back to the DPC saying that the &#34;contractual necessity&#34; is not
met by apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and that it is the DPC&#39;s obligation to enforce proper
privacy rights for European citizens.</p>
<p><strong>The DPC now has one month to issue a final decision, along with 
significant fines.</strong></p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of the EU&#39;s decision that Facebook&#39;s current tracking practice is illegal is huge: It directly affects
Facebook&#39;s business model. Right now, Facebook and Instagram profit a lot from the fact that people <strong>must</strong> give them
their private data to use the service. In turn, Meta uses this data to create profiles and to post targeted ads, a gold
mine for the Silicon Valley giant.</p>
<p><strong>However, the EU&#39;s decision will limit Facebook&#39;s access to this gold mine and, thus, directly impact revenue.</strong></p>
<p>A sign of how bad this decision is for Meta&#39;s profits is last year&#39;s decision by Apple. In 2021, Apple required 
iPhone app developers to ask users whether they want their usage to be tracked. And - unsurprisingly - lots of
iPhone users declined being tracked and profiled. </p>
<p>As a consequence Meta&#39;s revenue in 2021 was reduced by 8% just because iPhone users were not willing to share their 
private data with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Facebook&#39;s tracking online hugely benefits the privacy of users and simultaneously harms Meta&#39;s revenue. People&#39;s
data is worth much more to Big Tech than many think.</strong></p>
<h3 id="eu-limits-facebook-tracking">EU limits Facebook tracking</h3>
<p>The latest EU decision is another sign of a growing interest of EU authorities to limit <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/ban-targetedads">surveillance-based tracking</a>.
Finally, people and politicians are waking up to the dangers of behavioral advertising, and EU officials are starting to
regulate it in a way to protect people&#39;s privacy.</p>
<p>To companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, this business, however, is worth billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p><strong>Learn <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/profiling-what-it-is-and-how-stop-it">here</a> how your are being profiled online and how you can stop it.</strong></p>
<p>Regardless, even California - where most Big Tech companies are located - has adopted great privacy laws that allow
users to opt out of what it calls cross-contextual behavioral advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe the reason for this legislation is that Californians know best how harmful tracking and behavioral advertising
is as this business model originated there.</strong></p>
<h3 id="consequences-for-users">Consequences for users</h3>
<p>The EU decision will not have direct consequences for users, unfortunately, as it can be appealed to. Such an appeal would lead to
a lengthy judicial process.</p>
<p>If upheld, though, this decision will make it much harder for Facebook and other platforms to show users ads based on what they click,
like, share and watch within 
these platforms&#39; own apps. </p>
<p>While Meta is already allowing users to opt out of personalizing ads based on data from other websites and apps,
it has never given any such option for ads based on data about user activity on its own platforms.</p>
<p>For Facebook - and other Big Tech companies - limiting the access to user tracking would be a huge blow as building
audiences for personalized ads make up the bulk of revenue for such companies.</p>
<p>&#34;This is not the final decision and it is too early to speculate,&#34; said a Meta spokesman to the
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/metas-targeted-ad-model-faces-restrictions-in-europe-11670335772?mod=hp_lead_pos1">Wall Street Journal</a>, adding that EU 
law could allow for other legal justifications for targeting its ads. &#34;We’ve engaged fully with the DPC on their
inquiries and will continue to engage with them as they finalize their decision.&#34;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the GDPR allows for large fines for major violations — up to 4% of global annual turnover.</p>
<h3 id="growing-privacy-enforcements">Growing privacy enforcements</h3>
<p>While the EU&#39;s GDPR started being enforceable already in May 2018, political enforcement has only started to ramp up
in the last couple of months. By now, many Big Tech companies have been hit with hefty fines.</p>
<p>The Irish DPC has fined Meta more than $900 million in four other cases in the last 15 months, and currently has 10 additional 
inquiries into the company.</p>
<p>Meta&#39;s Irish subsidiary had allotted nearly 3 billion Euros for privacy fines in the EU last year - up
by €1.97 billion from a year earlier, according to Irish corporate filings.</p>
<p>Regardless, up to now it seems much more profitable for Silicone Valley giants to just pay the fines - instead of changing
their business model.</p>
