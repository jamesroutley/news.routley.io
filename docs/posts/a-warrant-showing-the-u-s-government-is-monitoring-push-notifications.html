<p><em>This article was produced in collaboration¬†</em><a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><u>with Court Watch</u></em></a><em>, an independent outlet that unearths overlooked court records.</em></p><p>The U.S. government is demanding that tech companies provide information related to push notifications in order to identify a target‚Äôs specific device, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24192651-push-notification-search-warrant-application?ref=404media.co"><u>according to a court record</u></a> reviewed by 404 Media. The finding comes as Senator Ron Wyden published a letter on Wednesday warning that the U.S. and foreign governments are making such surveillance demands around push notifications to Apple and Google.¬†</p><p>It is not totally clear if the demand for data related to push notifications mentioned in the court record is one and the same as that described at a high level in Wyden‚Äôs letter. Regardless, the court record provides more clarity on the legal mechanisms being used in at least some cases to request information related to push notifications, and what sort of crimes this novel surveillance technique is being used against.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúIn the spring of 2022, my office received a tip that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone ‚Äòpush‚Äô notification records from Google and Apple. My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google,‚Äù <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed?ref=404media.co"><u>the letter</u></a> from Senator Wyden to Attorney General Merrick B. Garland reads. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/?ref=404media.co"><u>Reuters was first to report</u></a> the letter.</p><div><p>üì±</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about push notification surveillance? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>As the letter explains, push notifications are not sent directly from an app provider to a user‚Äôs smartphone. Instead, ‚Äúthey pass through a kind of digital post office run by the phone‚Äôs operating system provider,‚Äù typically meaning Apple or Google.¬†</p><p>When a user gets a push notification on their phone, Apple or Google receive a lot of information, including metadata that shows which app received a notification, and which phone and associated Google or Apple account it was to be sent to, Wyden says in his letter. In some cases, unencrypted content like the actual text displayed in the notification may be included too, Wyden adds.</p><p>The letter does not disclose the legal mechanism used by governments to demand this data from Apple or Google. But the court record reviewed by 404 Media does include some specifics around push notification demands. <a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?ref=404media.co"><u>Court Watch</u></a> shared the record with 404 Media. The record is a search warrant application from May 2020 related to the investigation of a person suspected of theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.</p>

<p>In the search warrant application for information associated with a specific Yahoo email account, an FBI Special Agent writes under a section of the record entitled ‚ÄúBackground Information Regarding Provider Services‚Äù that when a user of a mobile app installs and launches an app, the app will direct the device to obtain a ‚ÄúPush Token.‚Äù This is ‚Äúa unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application [...] to locate the device on which the application is installed.‚Äù</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png" width="1064" height="538" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png" width="1040" height="422" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1040w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>Screenshots from the search warrant application.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The court record then points specifically to Apple and Google, adding ‚ÄúAfter the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application‚Äôs server/provider.‚Äù When a company then sends push notifications, it sends both the token itself and what the court record describes as the ‚Äúpayload‚Äù associated with the notification, ‚Äúthe substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device.‚Äù</p><p>The Special Agent adds that these Push Tokens are stored on the relevant tech company‚Äôs servers, and that these may help identify a specific phone or computer used by the target. Or, as the Special Agent puts it, ‚ÄúAccordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber‚Äôs PROVIDER account via the mobile application.‚Äù</p><p>It is not clear if this is boilerplate language that has been included in the search warrant application or whether the agent was specifically seeking this information from Yahoo.</p><p>As Wyden‚Äôs letter continues, ‚Äúas with all of the other information these companies store for or about their users, because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.‚Äù</p><p>Wyden concludes the letter by saying that Apple and Google should be permitted to ‚Äúgenerally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice,‚Äù and to publish aggregate data on the number of demands they have received. When Reuters contacted Apple for comment, the company told the outlet that Wyden‚Äôs letter gave them the opening needed to share more details about how governments monitor push notifications.</p><p>‚ÄúIn this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,‚Äù Apple told Reuters in a statement. ‚ÄúNow that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.‚Äù Reuters cited a source familiar with the matter who described the foreign governments involved in making the requests as democracies allied to the U.S. government.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to 404 Media‚Äôs request for comment on the legal mechanisms used against push notification-related data. A Google spokesperson told 404 Media in an emailed statement that ‚ÄúWe were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden. We share the Senator‚Äôs commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.‚Äù</p>

<p>The full section of the court record discussing push notifications is included below.</p><blockquote><em>PROVIDER also allows its subscribers to access its various services through an application that can be installed on and accessed via cellular telephones and other mobile devices. This application is associated with the subscriber‚Äôs PROVIDER account. In my training and experience, I have learned that when the user of a mobile application installs and launches the application on a device (such as a cellular telephone), the application directs the device in question to obtain a Push Token, a unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application (such as PROVIDER) to locate the device on which the application is installed. After the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application‚Äôs server/provider. Thereafter, whenever the provider needs to send notifications to the user‚Äôs device, it sends both the Push Token and the payload associated with the notification (i.e., the substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device). To ensure this process works, Push Tokens associated with a subscriber‚Äôs account are stored on the provider‚Äôs server(s). Accordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber‚Äôs PROVIDER account via the mobile application.</em></blockquote>
