      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>edit: I love this community!  Thank you so much for all the insight.  For those who complained, I&#39;m sorry if this post comes across as complainy or redundant, I respect the HN hive-mind and was genuinely curious about everyone&#39;s thoughts on the matter.<p>Hello fellow travelers, I&#39;ll do my best to keep this brief(ish).</p><p>I&#39;ve been in IT professionally since Y2K, data entry-&gt;QA-&gt;SysAdmin-&gt;PM-&gt;consultant-&gt;founder-&gt;sold and with the money took some years off, bought some property and a fixer upper and went to school and got a BSBA degree (never graduated from high school but wanted to show my kids the importance of a degree).    I missed working and creating things with people so decided to reenter the job market in the PM space.  So now that my hat is in the ring I have been told by recruiters what I need to &#34;expect&#34; in this &#34;new market.&#34;</p><p>I was told &#34;5 to 7 interviews is normal&#34;.  What?  I genuinely feel like I&#39;m having a &#39;Blast from the Past&#39; moment in this whole thing (good 90s romcom kids, look it up).</p><p>When did a hiring manager lose their authority and the trust of the organization to do their job?  Am I just out of touch?  How is a process like this in any way shape or form efficient or productive? Am i missing something?  HN, please help!</p></td></tr>
