<p>Some follow-up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/27/slopibus">the looks-like-AI-slop “painting”</a> Tim Cook <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/2003873311504130173">posted</a> on Twitter/X on Christmas Eve to promote the <em>Pluribus</em> season finale. <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/12/28/2048225/did-tim-cook-post-ai-slop-in-his-christmas-message-promoting-pluribus">Slashdot contacted the credited artist</a>, Keith Thomson, and quoted this interaction with him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slashdot: I just wanted to confirm that that’s your work... If it
is your work, can you say anything about what software you used
when creating the image?</p>

<p>Thomson: I’m unable to comment on specific client projects. In
general, I always draw and paint by hand and sometimes incorporate
standard digital tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a non-denial denial that he used generative AI to create the image.</p>

<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/26/apple-tim-cook-christmas-art-ai-debate-keith-thomson/">Dwayne Cubbins at PiunikaWeb also contacted Keith Thomson and got this statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The artist, Keith Thomson, responded to my request for a comment,
stating that they “always draw by hand and sometimes incorporate
standard digital tools.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the same non-denial denial, because “standard digital tools” might include generative AI.</p>

<p><a href="https://spyglass.org/apples-pluribus-ai/">MG Siegler wonders</a> if it’s a deliberate allegory to some of the themes from the show, writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keith Thomson using AI to produce art that’s like Keith Thomson’s
art because it’s trained on Keith Thomson’s art. How’s that for a
mindfuck?</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m reading wayyyy too much into that tweet (and
retweet), but given <a href="https://spyglass.org/pluribus-as-ai-allegory/">my previous post about <em>Pluribus</em> as an AI
allegory</a>, I think it’s sort of interesting to think about
in that context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MG’s posts have some spoilers re: <em>Pluribus</em>, so follow those links at your own risk. <em>Pluribus</em> is best enjoyed if you start watching it knowing as little about it as possible. But without spoiling anything, I think MG didn’t put enough <em>y</em>’s in the <em>wayyyy</em> in “I’m sure I’m reading wayyyy too much into that tweet”. There is no 3D chess being played here.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/16/oatmeal-ai-art">I wrote just a few months ago</a> that I firmly believe generative AI tools not only can be, but already <em>are</em>, used to create genuine art. My problem with AI slop isn’t the <em>AI</em>, it’s the <em>slop</em>. Whatever “standard digital tools” Keith Thomson used to create <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/milk-and-cookies-tim-cook-keith-thomson.png">this</a>, the result is a turd.</p>

<p><em>Pluribus</em>, among numerous other merits, is a beautifully filmed show. <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/">Thomson’s published paintings</a> are beautiful. The image Tim Cook posted on Twitter/X (and which the Apple TV account retweeted) is ugly and awkward. It either <em>is</em> AI-generated slop or it looks like AI-generated slop for no artistic or thematic reason whatsoever. Occam’s razor would suggest the conclusion that it simply is AI-generated slop, and Keith Thomson suckered Apple into paying for it.</p>
