<p>At my job at Camden Council, we recently updated our fonts to have character disambiguation, so you can tell your upper case I (for &#34;isn&#39;t it&#34;) from your lower case l (from &#34;look, lower case&#34;), amongst other improvements. We did this by enabling <code>font-feature-settings</code> across the codebase for the font we use, Inter.</p>
<p>Later, whilst testing print improvements for the site, a few of my Windows-using colleagues noticed something weird. The font wasn&#39;t Inter, and also <del>was strange and unsettling</del> didn&#39;t look like any of the fallback fonts.</p>
<p>It turned out I could replicate it on other sites by having the <code>font-feature-settings</code> we were using enabled in a Windows VM.</p>

<p>I was a bit confused; why would the settings effect a font that didn&#39;t have the OpenType features? At this point I suspected it was a bug and started <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-feature-settings-prop:~:text=Feature%20tags%20not%20present%20in%20the%20font%20are%20ignored%3B%20a%20user%20agent%20must%20not%20attempt%20to%20synthesize%20fallback%20behavior%20based%20on%20these%20feature%20tags">looking at the specs for CSS</a>, but people on Bluesky eventually helped me discover that it was to do with different system versions of Arial.</p>
<p>Arial <em>does</em> have <code>sso2</code> (stylistic set 2) feature settings capability in some versions of  the variants of it that exist. It does in the Windows 11, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_11_font_list">at version 7.0.0</a>. It doesn&#39;t exist on MacOS&#39; version, which is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/">5.01.2x</a>.</p>
<p>I had never considered that system fonts would be different versions - beyond them simply not existing, anyway - as I was probably putting too much mental weight on the idea of a &#34;web safe&#34; font meaning &#34;safe&#34; as in &#34;exactly the same everywhere&#34;. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Fundamentals#:~:text=test%20your%20knowledge.-,Web%20safe%20fonts,-Speaking%20of%20font">Reading more about them</a> it seems like &#34;web safe&#34; only really means &#34;will probably (&gt;95% chance) exist on the user&#39;s device&#34;. Another fun spec dive is brewing to learn more about web safe fonts!</p>
<p>To solve the issue, we moved the <code>font-feature-settings</code> declaration to where the font is imported, into the <code>@font-face</code> rule. I assumed there were ways to say &#34;if this font exists, apply this setting&#34;, but apparently not!</p>
<p>Have you had any weird CSS things recently?</p>
