If you&#39;re really torn on Proposals 2, 3, and 4, it may be worth paying $7 for a single month just to read this article.

During the 1920s, according to the <a href="https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/new-yorks-housing-crisis-self-inflicted-and-solvable">Vital City</a> think tank, New York built nearly 730,000 homes, more than quadruple the city’s current, anemic pace. Even in the 1960s, production moved twice as fast as at present. By comparison, project approvals take only <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3743-1.html">30 days</a> in Houston, compared to 15 months in San Francisco, according to a RAND study — but in New York, it takes <a href="https://cbcny.org/research/improving-new-york-citys-land-use-decision-making-process">an average of 2.5 years</a> to secure zoning changes before a project can break ground, which adds an estimated 11 to 16 percent to the cost of building housing. There is broad agreement that these delays contribute to our current 1.4 percent vacancy rate, the lowest level since 1968.</blockquote><p data-block-key="4muqt"><a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2025/10/20/three-new-york-city-ballot-proposals-aim-to-change-the-affordable-housing-approval-process-some-west-harlem-advocates-are-pushing-back/">Eve Rosenblum in the <i>Columbia Spectator</i>: &#34;Three New York City ballot proposals aim to change the affordable housing approval process.
