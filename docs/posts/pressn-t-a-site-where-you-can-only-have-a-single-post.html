    <h1>Show HN: Pressn&#39;t ‚Äì a site where you can only have a single post</h1>

<h2 id="_1">üêõ?</h2>
<p>Turn&#39;s out I may have left some fields unprotected from xss worm attacks <em>a la Samy</em>. This meant that there were particularly virulent posts and comments. </p>
<p>I replaced all malicious content with a üêõ emoji for now. I won&#39;t ban anyone yet since the attacks were mostly my fault.</p>
<p>Sorry for everyone that lost their posts, but the vulnerability should be corrected now. Shame on me. </p>
<p>PD: img tags will be sanitized until further notice. for now you&#39;ll need to use <code>![alttext](img_url)</code></p>
<h2 id="the-gist">The gist</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can only have a single post</li>
<li>You can update your post</li>
<li>People can follow other posts</li>
<li>You can read your followed posts&#39; latest updates</li>
<li>You can upvote posts</li>
<li>You can find trending posts (depends on upvotes and last time updated)</li>
<li>There are also comments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of reasons, and they range from why I made <strong>a</strong> site,  to what I want this site to be. But first, let&#39;s dig into <strong>why you would want to have a single post</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="why-a-single-post">Why a single post?</h2>
<p>Modern social media is great. You can satisfy dopamine cravings like never before. Videos of derpy cats and dogs are just a few taps away. Same with the opinions of celebrities you like. You don&#39;t even need to tap anymore! Just Let the endless TikTok wall fill your dopamine tank...</p>
<p>But sometimes I don&#39;t want dopamine, I want to consume content with meaning. I want to read into other people&#39;s mind like I can do when <a href="http://paulgraham.com/read.html">reading</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham&#39;s</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a>. But those are hard to get by, and a bit harder to set up for non-tech people. There&#39;s twitter (and mastodon), yes. its product isn&#39;t fit for meaningful writing. It&#39;s meant to match short written content with that dopamine hit we all crave. Blogging websites also exist but there&#39;s just too much noise.</p>
<p>But I do agree with the microblogging site&#39;s idea that limits foster creativity and communication. In their case, the character limit fosters quick and effective idea-sharing, and that&#39;s great. But here I want to foster <strong>noise-free</strong> and <strong>meaningful</strong> content.</p>
<p>The solution: A single post where you have to <strong>be thoughtful</strong> about what you write. </p>
<p>It&#39;s the only thing people will read from you. Of course, you may want to edit everything later and change the post completely, but that&#39;s the point: <strong>you are encouraged to write whatever you think is meaningful enough to share at the moment</strong>. And for that, you need easy and full control over what you&#39;re currently sharing.</p>
<p><em>That&#39;s what I want this site to be.</em></p>
<h3 id="so-the-tldr-here-is">So the TLDR here is...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Less noise</li>
<li>Thoughtful content</li>
<li>Control what people see of you</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-i-made-this-site">Why I made this site</h2>
<p>These are more personal growth reasons. And I might write them down here later on. But I think the focus now should be on <strong>Pressn&#39;t</strong> mission.</p>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix dark mode css</li>
<li>Fix mobile css</li>
<li>Ask a friend to pentest the site</li>
<li>Use a CDN</li>
<li>Investigate ranking algorithms</li>
</ul></div></div>
