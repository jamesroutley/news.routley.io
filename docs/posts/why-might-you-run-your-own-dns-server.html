    <h1>Why might you run your own DNS server?</h1>
    
    

<p>One of the things that makes DNS difficult to understand is that it&rsquo;s
<strong>decentralized</strong>. There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don&rsquo;t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least
<a href="https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/ten-million-dns-resolvers-on-the-internet-22-3-2012-en">10 million resolvers</a>.
And they&rsquo;re running lots of different software! All these different servers
running software means that there&rsquo;s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works,
which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems.</p>

<p>But instead of talking about the problems, I&rsquo;m interested in figuring out &ndash;
why is it a good thing that DNS is decentralized?</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-good-that-dns-is-decentralized">why is it good that DNS is decentralized?</h3>

<p>One reason is <strong>scalability</strong> &ndash; the decentralized design of DNS makes it
easier to scale and more resilient to failures. I find it really amazing that
DNS is still scaling well even though it&rsquo;s almost 40 years old. This is very
important but it&rsquo;s not what this post is about.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to talk about how the fact that it&rsquo;s decentralized means that
you can have <strong>control</strong> of how your DNS works. You can add more servers to the
giant complicated mess of DNS servers! Servers that you control!</p>

<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1478490484406468614">asked on Twitter</a> why you might
want to run your own DNS servers, and I got a lot of great answers that I
wanted to summarize here.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-run-2-types-of-dns-servers">you can run 2 types of DNS servers</h3>

<p>There are 2 main types of DNS servers you can run:</p>

<ol>
<li>if you own a domain, you can run an <strong>authoritative nameserver</strong> for that domain</li>
<li>if you have a computer (or a company with lots of computers), you can run a <strong>resolver</strong> that&rsquo;s resolves DNS for those computers</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dns-isn-t-a-static-database">DNS isn&rsquo;t a static database</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the &ldquo;phone book&rdquo; metaphor for DNS a lot, where domain names are like
names and IP addresses are like phone numbers.</p>

<p>This is an okay mental model to start with. But the &ldquo;phone book&rdquo; mental model
might make you think that if you make a DNS query for <code>google.com</code>, you&rsquo;ll
always get the same result. And that&rsquo;s not true at all!</p>

<p>Which record you get in reply to a DNS query can depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>where you are in the world (maybe you&rsquo;ll get an IP address of a server that&rsquo;s physically closer to you!)</li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re on a corporate network (where you might be able to resolve internal domain names)</li>
<li>whether the domain name is considered &ldquo;bad&rdquo; by your DNS resolver (it might be blocked!)</li>
<li>the previous DNS query (maybe the DNS resolver is doing DNS-based load balancing to give you a different IP address every time)</li>
<li>whether you&rsquo;re using an airport wifi captive portal (airport wifi will resolve DNS records differently before you log in, it&rsquo;ll send you a special IP to redirect you)</li>
<li>literally anything</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of the reasons you might want to control your own server are related to
the fact that DNS isn&rsquo;t a static database &ndash; there are a lot of choices you
might want to make about how DNS queries are handled (either for your domain or for your organization).</p>

<h3 id="reasons-to-run-an-authoritative-nameserver">reasons to run an authoritative nameserver</h3>

<p>These reasons aren&rsquo;t in any particular order.</p>

<p>For some of these you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to run your own authoritative
nameserver, you can just choose an authoritative nameserver service that has
the features you want.</p>

<p>To be clear: there are lots of reasons <strong>not</strong> to run your own authoritative
nameserver &ndash; I don&rsquo;t run my own, and I&rsquo;m not trying to convince you that you
should. It takes time to maintain, your service might not be as reliable, etc.</p>

<p><strong>reason: security</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1478503078680838153">this tweet phrased it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[There&rsquo;s a] risk of an attacker gaining DNS change access through your vendor&rsquo;s customer
support people, who only want to be helpful. Or getting locked out from your
DNS (perhaps because of the lack of that). In-house may be easier to audit and
verify the contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>reason: you like running BIND</strong></p>

<p>One reason several people mentioned was &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to writing zone files and
running <code>bind</code>, it&rsquo;s easier for me to just do that&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>reason: user interface</strong></p>

<p>You might not like the user interface (or API, or lack of API) of the DNS
service you&rsquo;re using. This is pretty related to the &ldquo;you like running BIND&rdquo;
reason &ndash; maybe you like the zone file interface!</p>

<p><strong>reason: you can fix problems yourself</strong></p>

<p>There are some obvious pros and cons to being able to fix problems yourself
when they arise (pro: you can fix the problem, con: you have to fix the
problem).</p>

<p><strong>reason: do something weird and custom</strong></p>

<p>You can write a DNS server that does anything you want, it doesn&rsquo;t have to just return a static set of records.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replit has a blog post about <a href="https://blog.replit.com/dns">why they wrote their own authoritative DNS server to handle routing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nip.io">nip.io</a> maps 10.0.0.1.nip.io to 10.0.0.1</li>
<li>I wrote a custom DNS server for <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/15/mess-with-dns/">mess with dns</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>reason: to save money</strong></p>

<p>Authoritative nameservers seem to generally charge per million DNS queries. As
an example, at a quick glance it looks like Route 53 charges about $0.50 per
million queries and <a href="https://ns1.com/plans">NS1</a> charges about $8 per million queries.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the best sense for how many queries a large website&rsquo;s
authoritative DNS server can expect to actually need to resolve (what kinds of
sites get 1 billion DNS queries to their authoritative DNS server? Probably a
lot, but I don&rsquo;t have experience with that.). But a few people in the replies
mentioned cost as a reason.</p>

<p><strong>reason: you can change your registrar</strong></p>

<p>If you use a separate authoritative nameserver for your domain instead of your
registrar&rsquo;s nameserver, then when you move to a different registrar all you hvae
to do to get your DNS back up is to set your authoritative DNS server to the
right value. You don&rsquo;t need to migrate all your DNS records, which is a huge
pain!</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to run your own nameserver to do this.</p>

<p><strong>reason: geo DNS</strong></p>

<p>You might want to return different IP addresses for your domain depending on
where the client is, to give them a server that&rsquo;s close to them.</p>

<p>This is a service lots of authoritative nameserver services offer, you don&rsquo;t
need to write your own to do this.</p>

<p><strong>reason: avoid denial of service attacks targeted at someone else</strong></p>

<p>Many authoritative DNS servers are shared. This means that if someone attacks
the DNS server for <code>google.com</code> or something and you happen to be using the
same authoritative DNS server, you could be affected even though the attack
wasn&rsquo;t aimed at you. For example, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS_attack_on_Dyn">DDoS attack on Dyn</a> in 2016.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-to-run-a-resolver">reasons to run a resolver</h3>

<p><strong>reason: privacy</strong></p>

<p>If someone can see all your DNS lookups, they have a complete list of all the
domains you (or everyone from your organization) is visiting! You might prefer
to keep that private.</p>

<p><strong>reason: block malicious sites</strong></p>

<p>If you run your own resolver, you can refuse to resolve DNS queries (by just
not returning any results) for domains that you consider &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few examples of resolvers that you can run yourself (or just use):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> blocks advertisers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quad9.net/">Quad9</a> blocks domains that do malware/phishing/spyware. Cloudflare seems to have a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/1.1.1.1-for-families">similar service</a></li>
<li>I imagine there&rsquo;s also corporate security software that blocks DNS queries for domains that host malware</li>
<li>DNS isn’t a static database. It’s very dynamic, and answers often depend in
real time on the IP address a query came from, current load on content
servers etc. That’s hard to do in real time unless you delegate serving those
records to the entity making those decisions.</li>
<li>DNS delegating control makes access control very simple. Everything under a
zone cut is controlled by the person who controls the delegated server, so
responsibility for a hostname is implicit in the DNS delegation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>reason: avoid malicious resolvers</strong></p>

<p>Some ISPs run DNS resolvers that do bad things like nonexistent domains to an
IP they control that shows you ads or a weird search page that they control.</p>

<p>Using either a resolver you control or a different resolver that you trust
can help you avoid that.</p>

<p><strong>reason: resolve internal domains</strong></p>

<p>You might have an internal network with domains (like
<code>blah.corp.yourcompany.com</code>) that aren&rsquo;t on the public internet. Running your
own resolver for machines in the internal network makes it possible to access
those domains.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all-for-now">that&rsquo;s all for now</h3>

<p>It feels important to me to explore the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of DNS, because it&rsquo;s such a
complicated messy system and I think most people find it hard to get motivated
to learn about complex topics if they don&rsquo;t understand why all this complexity
is useful.</p>
