	<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The PineNote is one of the world’s most advanced e-paper tablets. The device features a 1404 x 1872 resolution panel with a fast refresh rate and 16 grayscale levels. The Wacom EMR and capacitive layers are protected by scratch-resistant screen with an anti-glare coating.  The device features a frontlight with 36 levels of white or amber illumination settings.</p>
<p>Powered by the fast and efficient RK3566 SoC with four A55 cores, backed by 4GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage, this is a capable yet portable device capable of taking notes, writing and reading documents, reading books, browsing the internet, and terminal usage — all at the same time.</p>
<p>The OS build on this PineNote production batch contributed by PINE64 community developers. The Community Edition PineNote will be great for early adopters and should still be considered as BETA phase product.</p>
<p><span>NOTICE</span></p>
<p>Due to restrictions placed on shipment of Lithium-ion battery operated devices, the PineNote needs to be shipped and purchased separately to other items in the store. Having other items in your store basket at the time of purchase will return an error.</p>
