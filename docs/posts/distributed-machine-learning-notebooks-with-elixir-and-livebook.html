    <h1>Distributed² Machine Learning Notebooks with Elixir and Livebook</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>Welcome to the second day of Livebook Launch Week! 🎉</span></p><p><span>Today we will discuss all the new Machine Learning capabilities in Elixir and Livebook. First, we will discuss some of the new Neural Network tasks in Livebook v0.9. Then we will show how easy it is to make an existing model run concurrently and then distributed across multiple machines and multiple GPUs.</span></p><p><span>Let’s get started!</span></p><h2><span>Distributed² Machine Learning with Elixir</span></h2><p><span>This new Livebook release has many new Machine Learning models you can use with just a few clicks. But there is more exciting news about the Machine Learning story in the Elixir world.</span></p><p><span>Not only can you do Machine Learning with Elixir, but you can also do Distributed² Machine Learning!</span></p><p><span>But what does that “Distributed²” means?</span></p><p><span>It means that when executing a Machine Learning model with Elixir’s </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nx/Nx.Serving.html#module-stateful-process-workflow" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Nx</span></a><span>, the distribution can happen on two dimensions:</span></p><ul><li><span>it can be distributed to multiple machines</span></li><li><span>inside each machine, it can be distributed to multiple GPUs</span></li></ul><p><span>This can lead to increased performance and better utilization of your hardware resources. And it only takes very few changes to your code.</span></p><p><span>Do you want to see an example? Watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MSMyRBJAoSs?t=232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>this part of our video</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>We are very excited about these features because we are starting to marry the benefits of Nx with the capabilities for building fault-tolerant and distributed software from the Erlang Virtual Machine. Case in point: </span><a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/pull/1090" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>adding distribution support to Nx took only 400 lines of code</span></a><span>, including docs and tests!</span></p><h2><a href="https://hackmd.io/l6qrM81HQzy0J1f0zydDEg#New-Machine-Learning-models-available" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><span>New Machine Learning models available</span></h2><p><span>Neural network tasks were initially </span><a href="https://news.livebook.dev/announcing-bumblebee-gpt2-stable-diffusion-and-more-in-elixir-3Op73O" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>added to Livebook version 0.8</span></a><span> with the idea of giving you the power to use modern Machine Learning models with just a few clicks.</span></p><p><span>This 0.9 release comes with more models.
