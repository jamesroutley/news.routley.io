    <h1>Coaching for “Normals”?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;m interested in finding an executive/startup coach, but I&#39;m neither a c-suite executive or a successful founder. Does coaching exist (and at a relevant price point) for folks that maybe aren&#39;t quite at &#34;that level&#34; yet, but are hoping coaching might help them get to the next level?</p></div></div>
