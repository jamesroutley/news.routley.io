    <h1>SignalGate Is Driving the Most US Downloads of Signal Ever</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>SignalGate, as it&#39;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signalgate-isnt-about-signal/">come to be called</a>, may be the biggest scandal to hit the Trump administration in its first months in power. But it&#39;s been great for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/">Signal</a>.</p><p>Since the <a data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/&#34;}" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">news broke</a> on Monday that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-officials-signal-chat-candlelight-dinner-mar-a-lago-yemen/">senior Trump administration cabinet members</a> accidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a group chat on the Signal encrypted messaging platform where the officials were making secret plans to bomb Yemen, the ensuing news cycle and the constant mentions of Signal have led to the encrypted messaging platform doubling its usual rate of new downloads, the nonprofit organization that runs Signal tells WIRED. Given that 2025 has already been a “banner year” for Signal&#39;s growth, according to Signal&#39;s leadership, that makes this week the single biggest bump in US adoption of the app in Signal&#39;s nearly 11 years of existence.</p><p>“In Signal’s history, this is the largest US-growth moment by a massive margin,” says Jun Harada, Signal&#39;s head of growth and partnerships. “It’s mind-blowing, even on our side.”</p><p>Harada declined to give absolute numbers for Signal&#39;s user growth beyond saying that its total downloads are in the “hundreds of millions,” which has been the case for several years. But he said that the week’s rate of adoption has been twice that of a typical week for 2025, which in turn was twice that of a typical week the same time last year. “It happened immediately” after The Atlantic broke the story of Signal&#39;s use in the Yemeni bombing, Harada says. “And it’s been sustained. We’ve been maintaining that rate every day.”</p><p>In Signal&#39;s history, the only comparable spike in adoption occurred when WhatsApp <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-privacy-policy-facebook-data-sharing/">changed its privacy policy in 2021</a>, Harada says, leading to millions of users abandoning that communications app. But that incident mostly brought non-Americans to Signal, unlike the current, US-focused SignalGate bump.</p><p>Numbers from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower largely align with Signal&#39;s own analysis of that growth: The company says that Signal downloads in the US increased 105 percent compared to the prior week—and 150 percent compared to an average week in 2024. Outside of the US, Sensor Tower saw only a 21 percent increase in Signal downloads compared to the prior week.</p><p>The Atlantic&#39;s revelation on Monday that secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz, vice president JD Vance, and other Trump administration officials used a Signal group chat to plan an air strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen—and that Waltz accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to that group in a shocking breach of confidentiality—has raised serious questions about the security practices of the Trump administration that are still resonating days later.</p><p>The scandal has called into question whether the executive branch officials were planning the air strike using vulnerable non-approved or even personal devices rather than the secure machines intended for classified conversations. Screenshots of the group chat <a data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/&#34;}" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published by The Atlantic on Wednesday</a> indicate that the officials were using Signal&#39;s disappearing messages feature to delete their communications, potentially in violation of US record retention laws.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
