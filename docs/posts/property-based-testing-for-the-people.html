Best practices around testinghelp to improve software quality, but not all testing tools are created equal.
In recent years, automated testing, which helps to save time and avoid
developers&#39; blind-spots, has begun to improve this state of affairs. In particular, property-based testing is a powerful automated testingtechnique that gives developers some of the power of formal methods without
the high cost. PBT is incredibly effective at finding
important bugs in real systems, and it has been established as a go-to
technique for testing in some localized developer communities. To bring the power of PBT to a larger demographic, I shift focus to PBTusers. My work is motivated by conversations with real PBT users,
accentuating the benefits that they get from PBT and reducing the drawbacks.
My work begins with Property-Based Testing in Practice. This in-depth
user study establishes a rich set of observations about PBT&#39;s use in practice,
along with a wide array of ideas for future research that are motivated by the
needs of real PBT users. The rest of the work in the dissertation is informed
by these results.
One critical observation is that PBT users struggle with the random data
generation that is a key aspect of PBT&#39;s operation. To address this problem, I
establish a new foundation for random data generators in Parsing
Randomness and extend that foundation to be more flexible and powerful in
Reflecting on Randomness. These projects contribute new algorithms that
increase developers&#39; leverage during testing while decreasing developer
effort.
I also observed that PBT users are not always good at evaluating whether their
testing was effective. In Understanding Randomness, I establish a new
PBT paradigm that gives developers critical insights into their tests&#39;
performance and enables new ways of interacting with a PBT system. The Tyche
interface developed in that project is now an open source tool with real-world
users. By blending tools from programming languages, human-computer interaction, andsoftware engineering, my work increases the reach and impact of PBT and builds
a foundation for a future with better software assurance.</p>
