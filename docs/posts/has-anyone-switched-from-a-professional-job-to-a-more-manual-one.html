    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone switched from a professional job to a (more) manual one?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m considering a big career change. Early 30s, male, Physics degree and I have a good job in sales in finance in the UK. Earn 100k GBP in a good year and I had a startup before were a more a good cash lump sum.</p><p>I think like many people I find more work uninspiring, pointless and eroding. However, it&#39;s well paid, high status and hard to break into.</p><p>I have an interview next week for a coffee engineer role which pays around a third of what I currently earn and would involve being on the road four out of five days.</p><p>Has anyone else made a change like this? How did you find it? Did you miss the money and status?</p><p>I know that office work is desirable for a reason   (people like to sit down!!) but I think there might be something inspiring and rewarding about working with me hands. Am I being na√Øve because I&#39;ve never really had to work with my hand?</p><p>Thanks for your help and honest feedback.</p><p>W</p></div></div></div>
