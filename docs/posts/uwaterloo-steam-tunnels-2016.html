<p>A couple years ago I took my camera down with me for a tour of the UWaterloo
steam tunnels.</p>
<p>The only photos I&#39;ve ever been able to find online are <a href="http://matt.wandel.ca/tunnels/tunnels.html">Matt Wandel&#39;s,</a>
but they long predate DSLR technology. While things haven&#39;t changed much since
the 1990s, I wondered if people wouldn&#39;t appreciate a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>I am both an amateur photographer and a weird free software zealot who doesn&#39;t
understand how to use a Mac or proprietary software in general, so these were
all processed using software called <a href="http://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a>, an Adobe Lightroom
clone.</p>
<p>I assert my copyright on all these photos, but I&#39;m pleased to distribute them
in unwatermarked format for the viewer&#39;s enjoyment. If you&#39;d like to request
copies of the higher resolution originals for some reason, please get in touch.</p>
