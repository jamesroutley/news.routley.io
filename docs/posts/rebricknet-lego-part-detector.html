  <h3>How does RebrickNet work?</h3>

  <p>
    RebrickNet learns by looking at images of LEGO parts and discovering the features that make each part unique.
    AIs like RebrickNet use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a>
    to discover relevant features. This learning process requires millions of images under a wide variety of
    lighting conditions.</p>
  <p>We can accept two types of submissions for training data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(Preferred) Images of a pile of LEGO parts, all of a single type. This makes labelling very easy, provides a better quality
    source image for training, but requires more submissions to get the same quantity as a video.</li>
    <li>Videos of rotating LEGO parts. A single 10 sec video can contain ~50 usable frames, making it an efficient way to get
      the images needed. However, it requires significant processing prior to training, and the final result is not as
      high quality as a photo of multiple parts taken together.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to create RebrickNet images for submission?</h3>

  <p>Submitting images is far easier than videos. Simply grab a bunch (~ 10 to 20) of a single part type and place them
    on a flat surface. You can take many photos of the parts (aim for at least 10), shuffling them in between each time.
    The background can be anything as long as it doesn&#39;t contain LEGO images or other parts. Using a variety of
    backgrounds helps too.</p>

  <h3>What LEGO Parts do we need?</h3>

  <p>We are starting simple and slowly growing in complexity. To achieve this, we are splitting the parts into batches.</p>
  <p>Each batch represents a new milestone in how many LEGO parts RebrickNet can predict. You can submit any of the parts
  below (including any mold variations), from any batch. But please look at the <a href="https://rebrickable.com/rebricknet/submissions/videos/">RebrickNet Submission Stats</a>
  page to determine which parts are in more need of submissions than others.</p>

  <ul>
    
      <li><a href="#tab_1" data-toggle="tab"><span>Batch 1</span></a></li>
    
      <li><a href="#tab_2" data-toggle="tab"><span>Batch 2</span></a></li>
    
      <li><a href="#tab_3" data-toggle="tab"><span>Batch 3</span></a></li>
    
      <li><a href="#tab_4" data-toggle="tab"><span>Batch 4</span></a></li>

    Watch <a href="https://forum.rebrickable.com/t/rebricknet-updates/32941">this forum topic</a> to be notified of the
    changes to requirements. As RebrickNet evolves, we will change what parts/colors are needed and will only be
    accepting uploads of the ones we need. This is to keep this project at a manageable level and
    keep costs to a minimum.
