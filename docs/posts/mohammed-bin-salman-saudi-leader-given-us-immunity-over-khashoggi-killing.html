But this change is largely academic. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In Saudi Arabia power rests with the King, the crown prince and the immediate, blood-related royals. MBS, as the crown prince is known, has been all-powerful since soon after he became crown prince in 2017. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was always highly unlikely that the US, as Saudi Arabia&#39;s strategic partner and arms supplier, was ever going to facilitate the arrest of MBS. But granting him immunity in this way will cause some relief in the Saudi royal court and has provoked a storm of protest from human rights groups as well as Mr Khashoggi&#39;s fiancée. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Underlying all this is Washington&#39;s desire to improve its poor relations with the Saudi leadership. It&#39;s no secret that MBS and President Biden dislike each other and the Saudis&#39; recent refusal to pump more oil to lower US fuel prices was taken as a snub in Washington. Added to that, the Saudis have an increasingly warm relationship with both Russia and China. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There will be many in the royal court who will be quietly hoping for the return of Donald Trump to the White House, who chose Riyadh for his first overseas visit as President.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prince Mohammed was named crown prince by his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, in 2017. The 37-year-old was then handed the role of prime minister in September this year. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He denies any role in the killing of Mr Khashoggi. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Justice Department lawyers said that as &#34;the sitting head of a foreign government,&#34; the crown prince &#34;enjoys head of state immunity from the jurisdiction of US courts as a result of that office.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The doctrine of head of state immunity is well established in customary international law,&#34; Justice Department lawyers said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the Biden administration was keen to emphasise that the ruling was not a determination of innocence. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This is a legal determination made by the State Department under longstanding and well-established principles of customary international law,&#34; a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a written statement. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It has nothing to do with the merits of the case.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>President Biden fist bumped the Saudi crown prince in July</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Saudi Arabia said the former Washington Post journalist had been killed in a &#34;rogue operation&#34; by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, US officials said the CIA had concluded, &#34;with a medium to high degree of certainty&#34;, that MBS was complicit.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The murder caused a global uproar and damaged the image of Prince Mohammed and his country.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It also led to a major downturn in US-Saudi relations, with Mr Biden vowing to make Saudi Arabia a &#34;pariah&#34; while he was campaigning for the presidency in 2019.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Biden declined to talk to Mohammed bin Salman when he first became president.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But over the summer, President Biden said he wanted to &#34;reorient&#34; relations, ahead of a visit to Saudi Arabia in July. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His visit - in which he was pictured fist-bumping the crown prince - was criticised as validating the Saudi government following Mr Khashoggi&#39;s murder.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Dawn, wrote on Twitter that it was &#34;beyond ironic that President Biden has single-handedly assured MBS can escape accountability when it was President Biden who promised the American people he would do everything to hold him accountable&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Thursday&#39;s decision gave the Saudi leader &#34;a license to kill&#34;, according to the son of exiled former Saudi security official Saad al-Jabri, who has accused Prince Mohammed of targeting his family and of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-53677869">sending a hit squad to Canada to kill him</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;After breaking its pledge to punish MBS for Khashoggi&#39;s assassination, the Biden administration has not only shielded MBS from accountability in US courts, but rendered him more dangerous than ever with a license to kill more detractors without consequences,&#34; Khalid al-Jabri said in quotes cited by AFP.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Amnesty&#39;s Agnes Callamard wrote on Twitter: &#34;This is a deep betrayal.
