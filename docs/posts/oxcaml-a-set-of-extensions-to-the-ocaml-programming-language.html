        <h2>OxCaml is a fast-moving set of extensions to the OCaml programming language.</h2>
        <p>It is both Jane Street’s production compiler, as well as a laboratory for experiments focused towards making
            OCaml better for performance-oriented programming. Our hope is that these extensions can over time be
            contributed to upstream OCaml.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>to provide <span>safe, convenient, predictable</span> control over performance-critical

            <li>but <span>only where you need it,</span></li>
            <li>and…<span>in OCaml!</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Let’s talk about what this means!</h2>

        <p>OxCaml’s extensions are meant to make OCaml a great language for performance engineering. Performance
            engineering
            requires control, and we want that control to be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Safe. Safety is a critical feature for making programmers more productive, and for shipping correct
                code.
                Languages that are pervasively unsafe are too hard to use correctly.</li>
            <li>Convenient. We want to provide control without bewildering programmers, or drowning them in endless
                annotations.
                To achieve this, we aim to maintain OCaml’s excellent type-inference, even as we add considerable
                expressiveness
                to the type-system.</li>
            <li>Predictable. One of the great features of OCaml today is that it’s pretty easy to look at OCaml code and
                understand how it’s going to perform. We want our extensions to maintain and improve on that property,
                by
                making
                key performance details explicit at the type-level.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By &#34;only where you need it&#34;, we mean that OxCaml’s extensions should be pay-as-you-go. While OxCaml aims to
            provide
            more power to optimize, you shouldn’t need to swallow extra complexity when you’re not using that power.</p>
        <p>By &#34;in OCaml&#34;, we mean that all valid OCaml programs are also valid OxCaml programs. But our more profound
            goal
            is
            for OxCaml to feel like OCaml evolving into a better version of itself, rather than a new language. For
            that,
            OxCaml
            needs to honor OCaml’s basic design sensibility, and to preserve the safety, ease, and productivity that are
            hallmarks of the language.</p>

        <h2>OxCaml’s extensions </h2>
        <p>Our extensions can be roughly organized into a few areas:</p>

        <div>
            <div>
                <h2>Fearless concurrency</h2>
                <p>Writing correct concurrent programs is notoriously difficult. OxCaml includes additions to the
                    type
                    system to
                    statically rule out data races.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Layouts</h2>
                <p>OxCaml lets programmers specify the way their data is laid out in memory. It also provides native
                    access
                    to
                    SIMD processor extensions.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2>Control over allocation</h2>
                <p>OxCaml gives programmers tools to control allocations, reducing GC pressure and making programs
                    more
                    cache efficient and deterministic.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Quality of life </h2>
                <p>OxCaml also contains some extensions that aren’t specifically about systems programming, but
                    which
                    we’ve
                    found helpful in our day-to-day work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polymorphic parameters</li>
                    <li>Include functor</li>
                    <li>Labeled tuples</li>
                    <li>Immutable arrays</li>
                </ul>
            </div>



        </div>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Using OxCaml</h2>
        <p>OxCaml is open-source, and we’re excited to welcome experimental users, especially researchers and tinkerers
            who
            can
            kick the tires and provide feedback on the system. We put the emphasis on experimental because OxCaml makes
            no
            promises of stability or backwards compatibility for its extensions (though it does remain backwards
            compatible
            with
            OCaml).</p>
        <p>OxCaml is intended to be easy to use, and to that end comes with modified versions of the standard OCaml
            tool-set,
            including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Package management, compatible with dune and opam</li>
            <li>Editor integration via the LSP-server</li>
            <li>Source code formatting</li>
            <li>Documentation generation</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Jane Street has long open sourced a bunch of useful libraries and tools. These are now released in two forms:
            one
            for
            upstream OCaml, in which our extensions have been stripped, and one for OxCaml, where the extensions are
            fully
            leveraged.</p>

        <p>Not all extensions are erasable, so some libraries will be available only for OxCaml. We’ll export
            OCaml-compatible
            versions of these libraries when the necessary extensions are integrated upstream.</p>
