There, the core team of about ten people, including programmers, level designers, and artists lived and worked intensely for seven months in a cramped three bedroom apartment, putting in long hours to bring Legacy of the Fallen to life. The development was powered by Monolith’s LithTech engine, which the team praised for its flexibility despite some early challenges. <a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/2025/06/legacy-of-the-fallen/#more-35728">Continue reading <span>→</span></a></p></div></article><article id="post-35744"><h3><a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/2025/06/the-last-stuntman/">The Last Stuntman</a></h3><p><span>Posted: <span><time datetime="2025-06-19 00:00:00">19-06-2025</time></span>, last updated: <span><time datetime="2025-06-20 00:00:00">20-06-2025</time></span></span> <span>by</span> <span><a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/author/fgasking/" title="View all posts by Frank Gasking">Frank Gasking</a></span></p><div><h4>1989 Actual Screenshots</h4><h5>Platform: Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (<a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/the-last-stuntman/">GTW64 entry</a>)</h5><p>The Last Stuntman was a game that was due for release from one of CRL’s sub-labels in the late 1980s via Actual Screenshots.
