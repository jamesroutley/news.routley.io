    <h1>Earthquake in Japan yesterday may have shifted land 1.3 meters</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The powerful earthquake that rocked Ishikawa Prefecture on Monday may have shifted land in the Noto region near the epicenter up to 1.3 meters to the west.</p>
                <p>Japan&#39;s Geospatial Information Authority, known as GSI, analyzed GPS data following the 7.6 magnitude quake.</p>
                <p>GSI says preliminary figures indicate that an observation point in Wajima City in Ishikawa Prefecture saw the biggest shift, moving horizontally about 1.3 meters to the west.</p>
                <p>The analysis also indicates a westward shift of about 1 meter in Anamizu Town and 80 centimeters in Suzu City. An observation point in Nanao City&#39;s Notojima moved 60 centimeters northwest toward the Sea of Japan coast.</p>
                <p>Land appears to have shifted about 20 centimeters to the northwest in the prefectures of Toyama and Niigata. Several centimeters of land shifts were also observed in the Kanto-Koshin region and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>GSI plans to continue analyzing the data for other movements.</p>
