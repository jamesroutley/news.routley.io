<p><strong>TEXAS</strong> - Today, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced the upcoming sale of the Federal Helium System assets, currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as directed by Congress under the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013. In accordance with that law, BLM is required to sunset its management of the system and report any excess helium and helium assets to GSA to follow the statutory disposal process. </p>

<p>The sale process, planned to start July 12, 2023, will include the Cliffside Gas Plant, Federally owned Plant Equipment, Mineral Rights, Helium Storage Reservoir, Natural Gas Wells, and Federal Helium Pipeline. GSA expects the sales process will take between 8 and 9 months, and will engage with industry and stakeholders throughout to ensure an orderly and efficient transfer of assets.</p>

<p>The Cliffside Gas Plant, located at 13301 Brickplant Road, Amarillo, TX, is situated on two leased parcels of land totaling 8.108 acres near Amarillo, Texas. The property encompasses a range of primary and support buildings, including offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, laboratories, and storage areas. </p>

<p>The Federal Helium System is also comprised of plant equipment, including a booster compressor, natural gas chiller skid, metering equipment, spare parts, emergency generators, storage tanks, and other machinery critical to the helium enrichment process. Some of the plant equipment is privately owned, with the BLM maintaining operational and minor maintenance responsibilities through a lease agreement.</p>

<p>In addition to the facilities, the sale encompasses Mineral Rights acquired by the Federal Government from 1930 to 1942. These subsurface ownership interests cover approximately 38,000 acres of gas and approximately 60 acres of oil resources, providing an opportunity for future exploration and development.</p>
