    <h1>Ask HN: Are there any working ReCAPTCHA bypass plugins for Firefox?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I use a VPN all day long and lately I&#39;ve been getting stuck filling out 2-5 reCAPTCHAs each time I want to view a site or login or perform a function. In the distant pass during my bot-making days there were a number of CAPTCHA solving services that cost a small fee per CAPTCHA successfully solved. I see there are still many of these services today. I checked the Mozilla extension store and there&#39;s one that looks very sketchy but possibly works - reCAPTCHA solver by DoZz. Half the reviews are 5* and the other half are 1* and &#39;scam&#39; or &#34;doesn&#39;t work.&#34;</p><p>Are there other less-known extensions?</p></div></div></div>
