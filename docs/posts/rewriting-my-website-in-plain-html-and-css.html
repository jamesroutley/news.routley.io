    <p>January 15, 2025</p>
    <p>This week, I decided to rewrite my website using plain HTML and CSS.
When I <a href="https://github.com/arnath/arnath.github.io">originally
made it</a>, I used SvelteKit for simplicity. It was a more interesting
project than I was expecting when I started working so I wanted to share
my thoughts on the experience.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons I decided to do the rewrite. One is
that I’m currently unemployed so I have a lot of free time for side
projects. Another is that, as you can see, this website is pretty simple
so I wasn’t gaining a lot from using SvelteKit. I also wanted to move
the site over to Cloudflare Pages so this was an opportune time to make
some changes.</p>
<p>However, the primary reason I decided to make some changes is that I
find the Javascript bundler and building ecosystem <em>incredibly</em>
aggravating to use. For example, one of the things I set up my old
website to do was build the blog section from the set of Markdown posts.
I assumed this would be easy to do. SvelteKit and Vite allow you to
prerender your website and I had a set of files at build time - I just
needed to add some logic to transform them. Instead, it was
infuriatingly difficult to figure out a way to just get a handle to a
set of files in my tree at build time (let me caveat that I’m not a
frontend dev and maybe I missed something obvious). It took me hours of
Googling and trying out different options to come up with this awful
piece of code that worked to load the contents of a file and give them
to my page:</p>
<pre><code>import type { PageLoad } from &#34;./$types&#34;;

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params }) =&gt; {
  const file = await import(
    `../../../../lib/assets/posts/${params.slug}.md`
  );

  return { content: file.default, ...file.metadata };
};</code></pre>
<p>I was tired of dealing with things like this for the tiny amount I
was gaining from using SvelteKit. And so, I finally decided it was time
for a rewrite.</p>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<p>I think spending too much time on Hacker News gave me the
misconception that writing a website using plain HTML and CSS would be a
relatively well-paved path in 2025. I spent some time looking around for
guides or a “canonical” way of doing this and found that there isn’t
really one. Because of that, I decided to just start from scratch with
an empty directory and go from there. My website is small enough that I
was able to remake a lot of the pages as static HTML.</p>
<p>However, I prefer writing blog posts in Markdown. It’s easier to
write than HTML, I can pull posts out of my existing Obsidian vault, and
I just find it more convenient. Therefore, I needed some kind of script
to turn my Markdown blog posts into HTML content. I investigated some
options for this and found <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.
Pandoc is a universal document converter for converting markup formats.
It provides a library and a CLI for converting documents from Markdown
to HTML (along with many other formats).</p>
<p>To write the script, I wanted something as lightweight as possible
but easier to use than a Bash script. This led me to Python and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a>. I’ve found that uv basically
abstracts away the Python environment in a way that’s really convenient
for a tiny project like this. Using Python also gave me a free way to
serve my website using the <code>http.server</code> module. Finally, I
wrote a tiny Makefile so I wouldn’t have to remember the serve
command.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/arnath/vijayp.dev">outcome</a> was
not the <em>most</em> revolutionary because my website was really simple
in the first place. But the size of my “compiled” website asset went
from ~356kb to ~88kb. My project tree got a lot simpler and the only
Javascript on the site now is to highlight code. I’m also just happier
about the state of things. I feel like I understand how and why my site
works (where before I understood parts but not the whole mystery).</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>There are two downsides that I’ve found so far. I’d like to
investigate ways to fix or improve these.</p>
<ul>
<li>More code duplication. SvelteKit has a component system so I could
make my navigation bar as a component and reuse it. When I removed it, I
had to duplicate that code in a few places. Luckily the cost was pretty
minor because I only really have four HTML pages. I’m aware that there’s
some way to do this using web components. It’s something I intend to
look into as one of my next side projects.</li>
<li>No live reloading. I have to kill the website to rebuild it now. I’m
sure there’s a tool I can find to fix this, or maybe just use something
like FastAPI that has automatic reload. But until I do something about
it, there’s a minor added cost every time I make a change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I think this repository is now a reasonably good template for
someone who wants to make a simple website with some Markdown blog posts
without using a generator. I was surprised when I started this project
how difficult it was to find a guide about how to write your site
without a framework. Hopefully this can help some other people.</p>
