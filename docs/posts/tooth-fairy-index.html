	<p>Over time, the Tooth Fairy Index<sup>TM</sup> (TFI) shows that the value of a lost tooth is closely related to the U.S. economy. Much like Punxsutawney Phil’s Groundhog Day weather prognostication, the Original Tooth Fairy Poll has generally been a good barometer of the overall direction of the economy. In fact, for 17 of the past 20 years, the trend in average giving has tracked with the movement of the S&amp;P 500.</p>

	<p>Since 1998, Delta Dental has annually conducted the Original Tooth Fairy Poll® as a fun way to gauge how generous the tiny fairy had been in the previous year. The poll collects Tooth Fairy average giving and compares it to stock market activity to show how the value of a lost tooth relates to the U.S. economy (Tooth Fairy Index<sup>TM</sup>)</p>
<p>Poll answers provide Delta Dental with valuable data that we in turn give to parents so they can discuss and promote good oral health care with their children. Talking about the Tooth Fairy’s giving habits makes for a fun and wonderful opportunity to help kids develop positive dental habits at an early age.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 parents of children ages 6-12 were surveyed using an email invitation and an online survey. The sample was designed to capture a broad spectrum of the U.S. population, not just those with dental insurance.</p>
