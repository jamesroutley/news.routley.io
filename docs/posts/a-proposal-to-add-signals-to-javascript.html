<p>While looking for custom fonts for this website, I came across <a href="https://github.com/joelesko/minlo-font/tree/main">Minlo</a>, a minified version of the Apple system font Menlo.</p>
<p>I first thought it was made smaller by some cool compression technique. While that is true (converting to WOFF2 leads to smaller file sizes), I found that it even contains lesser characters (glyphs) than in a regular font file.</p>
<p>As I&#39;d been considering using custom fonts in my website, I wanted to make something like Minlo, but for other fonts.</p>
<h2 id="manual-approach">Manual approach <a href="#manual-approach">#</a></h2>
<p>The first idea I had was to manually remove glyphs I don&#39;t need using <a href="https://fontforge.org/en-US/">Font Forge</a>, a font editor.</p>
<p>I found a post that describes the exact same steps I tried - <a href="https://barrd.dev/article/create-a-custom-font-with-only-the-glyphs-you-need/">Create a custom font with only the glyphs you need</a>. To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a font file in FontForge</li>
<li>Select glyphs you wish to remove and delete them</li>
<li>Regenerate the font file</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is straight-forward but time-consuming. Font files can have lots of glyphs, specifically any combination of characters from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters">List of unicode characters</a>. There are also separate files for different weights, so the process became repetitive really quickly.</p>
<p>There had to be a way to do this programmatically, right?</p>
<h2 id="meet-pyftsubset">Meet <code>pyftsubset</code> <a href="#meet-pyftsubset">#</a></h2>
<p>I found an answer to this in the most unexpected of places - the <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#faq-subset">FAQ section of Inter</a>, a sans-serif font family.</p>
<p>The tool is called <code>pyftsubset</code>, and since I&#39;m looking for to create a file that contains a subset of the original set of glyphs, this sounds like the right one to go with!</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subset/">documentation</a>, the tool is part of the <code>fonttools</code> Python package, which I installed using <code>pip</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 -m pip install fonttools
$ pyftsubset -h
usage: pyftsubset font-file [glyph...] [--option=value]...
Try pyftsubset --help for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>Looking back at the docs, there are a couple of ways to provide which glyphs I want to keep. The easiest option seems to be using <code>--unicodes</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, that takes a list of the Unicode code points (<code>U+</code> followed by hexadecimal digits) representing each character.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re familiar with ASCII, Unicode (more specifically UTF-8) is another encoding standard that contains more characters than ASCII, like symbols and characters from other languages.</p>
<h3 id="demo-time">Demo time! <a href="#demo-time">#</a></h3>
<p>I created a subset file of the font Inter Regular, containing only uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and punctuation.</p>
<pre><code>$ pyftsubset Inter-Regular.otf --unicodes=U+0020-007E \ 
  --layout-features=&#39;&#39; \ 
  --passthrough-tables
</code></pre>
<p>The unicode range is from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block)">Basic Latin unicode block</a>, the <code>--layout-features</code> flag is set to an empty string to remove all glyphs associated with <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#features">OpenType features</a>, while <code>--passthrough-tables</code> skips over any sections of the file that the tool doesn&#39;t know what to do with.</p>
<p>With this, the file size has reduced from 591KB to 12KB, a 97% decrease!</p>
<pre><code>$ du -Ahs Inter-Regular.otf Inter-Regular.subset.otf
591K    Inter-Regular.otf
 12K    Inter-Regular.subset.otf
</code></pre>
<p>Converting the file to the WOFF2 format reduces the size further to 7.5KB!</p>
<pre><code>$ pyftsubset Inter-Regular.otf --unicodes=U+0020-007E \ 
  --layout-features=&#39;&#39; \ 
  --passthrough-tables \ 
  --flavor=woff2

$ du -Ahs Inter-Regular.otf Inter-Regular.subset.woff2
591K    Inter-Regular.otf
7.5K    Inter-Regular.subset.woff2
</code></pre>
<p>This was pretty fun to experiment with, and after quite a lot of trial and error, I settled on a combination of Verdana for the text (same as before) and a custom subset of Menlo for code blocks.</p>
<h2 id="font-trivia">Font trivia <a href="#font-trivia">#</a></h2>
<p>While re-designing my blog, I found out more about the origins of Verdana and Menlo, and apparently they share common links to other fonts!</p>
<p>Verdana was the basis for the design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera">Bitstream Vera Sans</a>. Bitstream Vera also has a monospaced font, which is what Menlo is based on.</p>
<p>Another common link is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu_fonts">DejaVu font family</a>, an extension to the Bitstream Vera font family that adds support for more glyphs, which Menlo includes.</p>
<p>This explains why the two work well together!</p>

<p>I got confused for a bit on why the <code>unicodes</code> flag was displayed with one dash instead of two. This a bug in the docs, which has been discussed in <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/2900">fonttools#2900</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
