    <h1>Where do journals go to die?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3581889322101148563" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In 2011 I had a post, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/11/are-these-journals-real_16.html">here</a>, about a real journal called <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/ok3/prof/journal.html">The Antarctica Journal of Mathematics</a>. Note that I put in the link in the last sentence; however, if you go there you will get to a page that IS labelled with the name of that journal, but all of the links on it are either broken or go to a place to sell domain names. I assume the journal is dead, but I can&#39;t find any evidence that it was ever alive. When I googled it I got the link above for the first hit and my 2011 blog post for the fourth hit. <br/></p><p>On Wikipedia I found a debate about deleting the Wikipedia webpage for it, which I assume won since there is no webpage for it.  Here is that webpage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Antarctica_Journal_of_Mathematics">here</a>.  That page also debates whether the journal was a joke, though they conclude that it was not a joke. <br/></p><p>If you try to go to <a href="https://novapublishers.com/shop/journal-of-combinatorics-and-number-theory/">The Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory</a> using that link you will find</p><p>a) There is a page, but it says that the  journal is discontinued.</p><p>b)  You can click to see the table of contents from Vol 11, No 1 to Vol 12 No. 3.</p><p>c)  There is a mechanism to click on stuff and BUY articles from those issues but I do not know if it works, and I am not going to find out. <br/></p><p>d) For issues before Vol 11, there is a place to click for <i>prior issues</i>. When you click on it you get to the NOVA publishers webpage but no indication of where to go for prior issues of this particular journal.<br/></p><p>e) There is no Wikipedia site for the journal. That might not mean much, there is no Wikipedia site for  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6862942/">Raegan Revord</a> either, and she deserves one (I linked to her IMDB page).</p><p>f) Why do I care? Actually, I don&#39;t care much. However, I DO have an article in that journal, co-authored with Larry Washington and Sam Zbarsky. It was refereed seriously and we were never asked for money, so (1) its probably not a scam, and (2)  there was some quality control  (or the referee didn&#39;t get the memo). It was in Volume 10, No. 1. There is  no way for me to verify that it was ever published. Fortunately I will never have to. Also, the paper does not need to be published to be known since (1) I blogged about it  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/07/i-would-call-these-galois-games-but-i.html">here</a> and (2)  its on arxiv&#39;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04793">here</a>. Someone read it (probably on arxiv) and wrote a followup paper, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00213">here</a>.<br/></p><p>QUESTIONS</p><p>1) Why did The Antarctica Journal of Mathematics die?</p><p>2) Why did the Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory die?</p><p>If an author publishes in a journal that dies, and the journal does not maintain a good website, how can the author prove that he published there, if they need to? For a paper journal they may have a paper version of the journal, but for an e-journal they may be <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/S.O.L.">SOL</a>.<br/></p><p>If the paper is not on arxiv (or a similar site) it may be lost forever. Note that even if you wanted to pay for an article in either of those journals, it might be impossible. </p><p>3) I wonder- are journals losing money since people are using arxiv and hence not buying the journals?</p><p>I only use journals to get credit from my school for publishing, and to get a good proofread from the referee. NOT to get an article out there. Thats what arxiv is for! Also, in my case I can email my article to the few people who care. And I can blog about it. </p>
