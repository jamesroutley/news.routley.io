<p>This is a big one for us: Chime 2.0 is now <a href="https://www.chimehq.com/download">available</a>! It includes an <strong>extension system</strong> and support for <strong>23 new languages</strong>. On top of that, we snuck in a command-line tool and quick open with fuzzy matching. In so many ways, it feels like an entirely new app.</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>By far, the thing we’re most exited about is <a href="https://www.chimehq.com/extensions">extensions</a>. We’re using <a href="https://www.chimehq.com/blog/extensionkit-intro">ExtensionKit</a>, which is new to macOS Ventura. Extensions are built with our <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/ChimeKit">Swift SDK</a>, which even supports views using SwiftUI! Yes, this is an <strong>entirely native</strong> system. The <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/ChimeKit">SDK</a>, as well as our extensions for <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/chime-swift">Swift</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/chime-rust">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/chime-ruby">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/chime-go">Go</a> are all open source.</p>

<p>We’re also interested in expanding the system. Please <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ/ChimeKit">open an issue</a> if you’d like to see some new APIs!</p>

<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>

<p>Chime 2.0 includes support for 23 <strong>new</strong> languages and formats. Here’s the list:</p>

<p>Bash, C, C++, C#, CSS, Elixir, Elm, Go workspaces, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Julia, Lua, Markdown, Perl, PHP, Python, Rust, SQL, YAML, Zig.</p>

<p>Not all languages support all of Chime’s syntactic features today, but that’s coming. And, <a href="https://www.chimehq.com/contact">let us know</a> if there’s one missing you’d like.</p>

<h2 id="more-open-source">More Open Source</h2>

<p>Large portions of Chime were already open source, but this release definitely resulted in the most open source work we’ve ever done. Over the course of building 2.0, we created <strong>five</strong> new projects, and made significant updates to <strong>nine</strong> others. Open source has become a huge part of what we do, and we really enjoy it.</p>

<p>If you want to see what we’ve been up to, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/ChimeHQ">GitHub profile</a>.</p>

<h2 id="check-it-out">Check it Out</h2>

<p>So, yes. This is a very significant update. It can do so much more, and we’re pumped. Chime 2.0 is available for <a href="https://www.chimehq.com/download">download</a> now.</p>
