<p>We are proud to present the first 3 working applications developed with <em>Castle Game Engine</em> for the <a href="https://castle-engine.io/web">web</a>! Check them out ‚Äî just open the links below, in any web browser (Firefox, Chrome‚Ä¶), on desktop or mobile!</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://castle-engine.io/web-demos/simplest_viewport">3D viewport, with random cones, animated spot light, dropping boxes with physics, Examine camera navigation</a>.
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://castle-engine.io/web-demos/simplest_invaders">2D ‚ÄúInvaders‚Äù game ‚Äì simple game, using keys, multiple views, 2 difficulty modes</a>. Note: This example is not really useful on mobile, just because it relies on the keyboard input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://castle-engine.io/web-demos/simplest">The first, simplest example that we got running on the web!</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: These are <em>early demos</em>, don‚Äôt judge the quality yet ‚Äî we have some known TODOs (fuzzy text; and the demos will look more impressive once we will have <a href="https://castle-engine.io/data">data</a> loading, for now everything you see was set up by code). Stay tuned for more üôÇ</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the WebAssembly target available in <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">FPC</a> and we have a ‚Äúglue‚Äù code generated using <a href="https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/">Pas2js</a>. We render using WebGL (1.0, with 2.0 features useful but optional), using the <a href="https://castle-engine.io/">Castle Game Engine</a> code. The game code is cross-platform (the 3 examples above can be recompiled to desktop, mobile, console without any change). The <code><a href="https://castle-engine.io/apidoc/html/CastleWindow.TCastleWindow.html">TCastleWindow</a></code> abstracts all platform differences providing rendering and handling input (key, mouse, touch).
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not yet available in the CGE <code>master</code> branch, not yet available in the downloads! The development is on a branch <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test">webassm_platformer_test</a>. It should be merged to <code>master</code> soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a ton of documentation what works already, how it works, how to test it, what is missing, and what do we plan on the <a href="https://castle-engine.io/web">web platform page</a>. This page was quite intensively updated in the last 2 weeks, so check it out!</p>
