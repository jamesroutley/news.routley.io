The findings are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00793-y" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature Aging</i>.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    <p>Previous clinical trial research has shown that restricting <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caloric+intake/" rel="tag">caloric intake</a> may slow aging in humans. Other research conducted in animal studies or small pilot trials on slowing biological aging, such as by consuming vitamin D or omega-3, has also shown promising effects. However, whether these interventions work in humans remains unclear.</p>

<p>Researchers Heike Bischoff-Ferrari, Steve Horvath and colleagues used molecular biology tools known as epigenetic clocks to calculate how rates of aging were affected during a clinical trial involving 777 participants aged 70 and older from Switzerland.</p>
<p>During the clinical trial, testing eight different groups or treatments, participants consumed 2,000 International units (IU) of vitamin D per day, and/or took 1 gram of omega-3 per day and/or participated in a 30-minute home exercise program 3 times a week across a 3-year span.</p>
<p>In an analysis of blood samples, Bischoff-Ferrari and colleagues found that omega-3 consumption moderately slowed biological aging across several of the epigenetic clocks by up to 4 months. This finding was not dependent on the sex, age or body mass index of the participant. Combining omega-3, vitamin D, and exercise was found to work even better, as shown by one of the tests.</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors also found that these three interventions together had the biggest impact on lowering <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+risk/" rel="tag">cancer risk</a> and preventing frailty over three years. Each intervention works through different but related mechanisms, and when combined, they reinforce each other, creating a stronger overall effect, the authors suggest.</p>
<p>The authors note that a key limitation of this work is that there is not a standardized measure of biological aging, and that they opted for the most-validated tests available. Likewise, they acknowledge that their sample of Swiss participants does not represent the average global population of adults aged 70 years and older.</p>
