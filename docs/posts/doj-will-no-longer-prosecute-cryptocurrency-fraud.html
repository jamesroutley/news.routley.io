He<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211345/bitcoin-conference-2024-nashville-trump-maga-crypto"> headlined the 2024 Bitcoin Conference</a> in Nashville, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258815/world-liberty-financial-accredited-investors-know-your-customer-trump">launched his own “crypto platform”</a> ahead of the presidential election. As president, he has<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622538/trump"> helped enrich</a> the crypto interests that helped him get elected — and now he’s effectively promising to deregulate the industry altogether.</p></div><p>Per Blanche’s memo, which was circulated on Monday, the Justice Department is dropping litigation and enforcement actions “while President Trump’s actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework.” </p><p>But Trump is scaling back regulations outside of litigation, too. Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped several investigations of and lawsuits against companies that allegedly violated securities violations, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/cryptocurrency/618286/robinhood-announces-the-sec-has-ended-its-investigation-into-robinhood-crypto">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617221/coinbase-sec-lawsuit-ending-agree-in-principle">Coinbase</a>. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmomZFeBysQ&amp;ab_channel=FoxBusiness">donated $2 million to Trump’s inauguration</a>, and Robinhood lists Trump’s meme coin on its exchange. </p><p>Instead of policing crypto platforms and exchanges, Trump’s DOJ will “focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel financing.”</p></div></div></div>
