<p>The Go 1.18 release adds support for generics.
Generics are the biggest change we’ve made to Go since the first open
source release.
In this article we’ll introduce the new language features.
We won’t try to cover all the details, but we will hit all the
important points.
For a more detailed and much longer description, including many
examples, see the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/HEAD/design/43651-type-parameters.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal
document</a>.
For a more precise description of the language changes, see the
<a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec">updated language spec</a>.
(Note that the actual 1.18 implementation imposes some restrictions on
what the proposal document permits; the spec should be accurate.
Future releases may lift some of the restrictions.)</p>
<p>Generics are a way of writing code that is independent of the specific
types being used.
Functions and types may now be written to use any of a set of types.</p>
<p>Generics adds three new big things to the language:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type parameters for function and types.</li>
<li>Defining interface types as sets of types, including types that
don’t have methods.</li>
<li>Type inference, which permits omitting type arguments in many
cases when calling a function.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="type-parameters">Type Parameters</h2>
<p>Functions and types are now permitted to have type parameters.
A type parameter list looks like an ordinary parameter list, except
that it uses square brackets instead of parentheses.</p>
<p>To show how this works, let’s start with the basic non-generic <code>Min</code>
function for floating point values:</p>
<pre><code>func Min(x, y float64) float64 {
    if x &lt; y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can make this function generic–make it work for different
types–by adding a type parameter list.
In this example we add a type parameter list with a single type
parameter <code>T</code>, and replace the uses of <code>float64</code> with <code>T</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import &#34;golang.org/x/exp/constraints&#34;

func GMin[T constraints.Ordered](x, y T) T {
    if x &lt; y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is now possible to call this function with a type argument by
writing a call like</p>
<pre><code>x := GMin[int](2, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>Providing the type argument to <code>GMin</code>, in this case <code>int</code>, is called
<em>instantiation</em>.
Instantiation happens in two steps.
First, the compiler substitutes all type arguments for their
respective type parameters throughout the generic function or type.
Second, the compiler verifies that each type argument satisfies the
respective constraint.
We’ll get to what that means shortly, but if that second step fails,
instantiation fails and the program is invalid.</p>
<p>After successful instantiation we have a non-generic function that can
be called just like any other function.
For example, in code like</p>
<pre><code>fmin := GMin[float64]
m := fmin(2.71, 3.14)
</code></pre>
<p>the instantiation <code>GMin[float64]</code> produces what is effectively our
original floating-point <code>Min</code> function, and we can use that in a
function call.</p>
<p>Type parameters can be used with types also.</p>
<pre><code>type Tree[T interface{}] struct {
    left, right *Tree[T]
    value       T
}

func (t *Tree[T]) Lookup(x T) *Tree[T] { ... }

var stringTree Tree[string]
</code></pre>
<p>Here the generic type <code>Tree</code> stores values of the type parameter <code>T</code>.
Generic types can have methods, like <code>Lookup</code> in this example.
In order to use a generic type, it must be instantiated;
<code>Tree[string]</code> is an example of instantiating <code>Tree</code> with the type
argument <code>string</code>.</p>
<h2 id="type-sets">Type sets</h2>
<p>Let’s look a bit deeper at the type arguments that can be used to
instantiate a type parameter.</p>
<p>An ordinary function has a type for each value parameter; that type
defines a set of values.
For instance, if we have a <code>float64</code> type as in the non-generic
function <code>Min</code> above, the permissible set of argument values is the
set of floating-point values that can be represented by the <code>float64</code>
type.</p>
<p>Similarly, type parameter lists have a type for each type parameter.
Because a type parameter is itself a type, the types of type
parameters define sets of types.
This meta-type is called a <em>type constraint</em>.</p>
<p>In the generic <code>GMin</code>, the type constraint is imported from the
<a href="https://golang.org/x/exp/constraints" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">constraints package</a>.
The <code>Ordered</code> constraint describes the set of all types with values
that can be ordered, or, in other words, compared with the  &lt;
operator (or  &lt;= ,  &gt; , etc.).
The constraint ensures that only types with orderable values can be
passed to <code>GMin</code>.
It also means that in the <code>GMin</code> function body values of that type
parameter can be used in a comparison with the  &lt;  operator.</p>
<p>In Go, type constraints must be interfaces.
That is, an interface type can be used as a value type, and it can
also be used as a meta-type.
Interfaces define methods, so obviously we can express type
constraints that require certain methods to be present.
But <code>constraints.Ordered</code> is an interface type too, and the  &lt;
operator is not a method.</p>
<p>To make this work, we look at interfaces in a new way.</p>
<p>Until recently, the Go spec said that an interface defines a method
set, which is roughly the set of methods enumerated in the interface.
Any type that implements all those methods implements that interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics/method-sets.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>But another way of looking at this is to say that the interface
defines a set of types, namely the types that implement those methods.
From this perspective, any type that is an element of the interface’s
type set implements the interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics/type-sets.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>The two views lead to the same outcome: For each set of methods we can
imagine the corresponding set of types that implement those methods,
and that is the set of types defined by the interface.</p>
<p>For our purposes, though, the type set view has an advantage over the
method set view: we can explicitly add types to the set, and thus
control the type set in new ways.</p>
<p>We have extended the syntax for interface types to make this work.
For instance, <code>interface{ int|string|bool }</code> defines the type set
containing the types <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, and <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics/type-sets-2.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that this interface is satisfied by
only <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, or <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the actual definition of <code>contraints.Ordered</code>:</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    Integer|Float|~string
}
</code></pre>
<p>This declaration says that the <code>Ordered</code> interface is the set of all
integer, floating-point, and string types.
The vertical bar expresses a union of types (or sets of types in this
case).
<code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> are interface types that are similarly defined
in the <code>constraints</code> package.
Note that there are no methods defined by the <code>Ordered</code> interface.</p>
<p>For type constraints we usually don’t care about a specific type, such
as <code>string</code>; we are interested in all string types.
That is what the <code>~</code> token is for.
The expression <code>~string</code> means the set of all types whose underlying
type is <code>string</code>.
This includes the type <code>string</code> itself as well as all types declared
with definitions such as <code>type MyString string</code>.</p>
<p>Of course we still want to specify methods in interfaces, and we want
to be backward compatible.
In Go 1.18 an interface may contain methods and embedded interfaces
just as before, but it may also embed non-interface types, unions, and
sets of underlying types.</p>
<p>When used as a type constraint, the type set defined by an interface
specifies exactly the types that are permitted as type arguments for
the respective type parameter.
Within a generic function body, if the type of a operand is a type
parameter <code>P</code> with constraint <code>C</code>, operations are permitted if they
are permitted by all types in the type set of <code>C</code> (there are currently
some implementation restrictions here, but ordinary code is unlikely
to encounter them).</p>
<p>Interfaces used as constraints may be given names (such as <code>Ordered</code>),
or they may be literal interfaces inlined in a type parameter list.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>[S interface{~[]E}, E interface{}]
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>S</code> must be a slice type whose element type can be any type.</p>
<p>Because this is a common case, the enclosing <code>interface{}</code> may be
omitted for interfaces in constraint position, and we can simply
write:</p>
<pre><code>[S ~[]E, E interface{}]
</code></pre>
<p>Because the empty interface is common in type parameter lists, and in
ordinary Go code for that matter, Go 1.18 introduces a new predeclared
identifier <code>any</code> as an alias for the empty interface type.
With that, we arrive at this idiomatic code:</p>
<pre><code>[S ~[]E, E any]
</code></pre>
<p>Interfaces as type sets is a powerful new mechanism and is key to
making type constraints work in Go.
For now, interfaces that use the new syntactic forms may only be used
as constraints.
But it’s not hard to imagine how explicitly type-constrained
interfaces might be useful in general.</p>
<h2 id="type-inference">Type inference</h2>
<p>The last new major language feature is type inference.
In some ways this is the most complicated change to the language, but
it is important because it lets people use a natural style when
writing code that calls generic functions.</p>
<h3 id="function-argument-type-inference">Function argument type inference</h3>
<p>With type parameters comes the need to pass type arguments, which can
make for verbose code.
Going back to our generic <code>GMin</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>func GMin[T constraints.Ordered](x, y T) T { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>the type parameter <code>T</code> is used to specify the types of the ordinary
non-type arguments <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>.
As we saw earlier, this can be called with an explicit type argument</p>
<pre><code>var a, b, m float64

m = GMin[float64](a, b) // explicit type argument
</code></pre>
<p>In many cases the compiler can infer the type argument for <code>T</code> from
the ordinary arguments.
This makes the code shorter while remaining clear.</p>
<pre><code>var a, b, m float64

m = GMin(a, b) // no type argument
</code></pre>
<p>This works by matching the types of the arguments <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> with the
types of the parameters <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>This kind of inference, which infers the type arguments from the types
of the arguments to the function, is called <em>function argument type
inference</em>.</p>
<p>Function argument type inference only works for type parameters that
are used in the function parameters, not for type parameters used only
in function results or only in the function body.
For example, it does not apply to functions like <code>MakeT[T any]() T</code>,
that only uses <code>T</code> for a result.</p>
<h3 id="constraint-type-inference">Constraint type inference</h3>
<p>The language supports another kind of type inference, <em>constraint type
inference</em>.
To describe this, let’s start with this example of scaling a slice of
integers:</p>
<pre><code>// Scale returns a copy of s with each element multiplied by c.
// This implementation has a problem, as we will see.
func Scale[E constraints.Integer](s []E, c E) []E {
    r := make([]E, len(s))
    for i, v := range s {
        r[i] = v * c
    }
    return r
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a generic function that works for a slice of any integer
type.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we have a multi-dimensional <code>Point</code> type, where each
<code>Point</code> is simply a list of integers giving the coordinates of the
point.
Naturally this type will have some methods.</p>
<pre><code>type Point []int32

func (p Point) String() string {
    // Details not important.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes we want to scale a <code>Point</code>.
Since a <code>Point</code> is just a slice of integers, we can use the <code>Scale</code>
function we wrote earlier:</p>
<pre><code>// ScaleAndPrint doubles a Point and prints it.
func ScaleAndPrint(p Point) {
    r := Scale(p, 2)
    fmt.Println(r.String()) // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this does not compile, failing with an error like
<code>r.String undefined (type []int32 has no field or method String)</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that the <code>Scale</code> function returns a value of type <code>[]E</code>
where <code>E</code> is the element type of the argument slice.
When we call <code>Scale</code> with a value of type <code>Point</code>, whose underlying
type is <code>[]int32</code>, we get back a value of type <code>[]int32</code>, not type
<code>Point</code>.
This follows from the way that the generic code is written, but it’s
not what we want.</p>
<p>In order to fix this, we have to change the <code>Scale</code> function to use a
type parameter for the slice type.</p>
<pre><code>// Scale returns a copy of s with each element multiplied by c.
func Scale[S ~[]E, E constraints.Integer](s S, c E) S {
    r := make(S, len(s))
    for i, v := range s {
        r[i] = v * c
    }
    return r
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve introduced a new type parameter <code>S</code> that is the type of the
slice argument.
We’ve constrained it such that the underlying type is <code>S</code> rather than
<code>[]E</code>, and the result type is now <code>S</code>.
Since <code>E</code> is constrained to be an integer, the effect is the same as
before: the first argument has to be a slice of some integer type.
The only change to the body of the function is that now we pass <code>S</code>,
rather than <code>[]E</code>, when we call <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>The new function acts the same as before if we call it with a plain
slice, but if we call it with the type <code>Point</code> we now get back a value
of type <code>Point</code>.
That is what we want.
With this version of <code>Scale</code> the earlier <code>ScaleAndPrint</code> function will
compile and run as we expect.</p>
<p>But it’s fair to ask: why is it OK to write the call to <code>Scale</code>
without passing explicit type arguments?
That is, why can we write <code>Scale(p, 2)</code>, with no type arguments,
rather than having to write <code>Scale[Point, int32](p, 2)</code>?
Our new <code>Scale</code> function has two type parameters, <code>S</code> and <code>E</code>.
In a call to <code>Scale</code> not passing any type arguments, function argument
type inference, described above, lets the compiler infer that the type
argument for <code>S</code> is <code>Point</code>.
But the function also has a type parameter <code>E</code> which is the type of the
multiplication factor <code>c</code>.
The corresponding function argument is <code>2</code>, and because <code>2</code> is an <em>untyped</em>
constant, function argument type inference cannot infer the correct type for
<code>E</code> (at best it might infer the default type for <code>2</code> which is <code>int</code> and which
would be incorrect).
Instead, the process by which the compiler infers that the type argument
for <code>E</code> is the element type of the slice is called <em>constraint type
inference</em>.</p>
<p>Constraint type inference deduces type arguments from type parameter
constraints.
It is used when one type parameter has a constraint defined in terms
of another type parameter.
When the type argument of one of those type parameters is known,
the constraint is used to infer the type argument of the other.</p>
<p>The usual case where this applies is when one constraint uses the form
<code>~</code><em><code>type</code></em> for some type, where that type is written using other type
parameters.
We see this in the <code>Scale</code> example.
<code>S</code> is <code>~[]E</code>, which is <code>~</code> followed by a type <code>[]E</code> written in terms
of another type parameter.
If we know the type argument for <code>S</code> we can infer the type argument
for <code>E</code>.
<code>S</code> is a slice type, and <code>E</code> is the element type of that slice.</p>
<p>This was just an introduction to constraint type inference.

document</a>
document or the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec">language spec</a>.</p>
<h3 id="type-inference-in-practice">Type inference in practice</h3>
<p>The exact details of how type inference works are complicated, but
using it is not: type inference either succeeds or fails.
If it succeeds, type arguments can be omitted, and calling generic
functions looks no different than calling ordinary functions.
If type inference fails, the compiler will give an error message, and
in those cases we can just provide the necessary type arguments.</p>
<p>In adding type inference to the language we’ve tried to strike a
balance between inference power and complexity.
We want to ensure that when the compiler infers types, those types are
never surprising.
We’ve tried to be careful to err on the side of failing to infer a
type rather than on the side of inferring the wrong type.
We probably have not gotten it entirely right, and we may continue to
refine it in future releases.
The effect will be that more programs can be written without explicit
type arguments.
Programs that don’t need type arguments today won’t need them tomorrow
either.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Generics are a big new language feature in 1.18.
These new language changes required a large amount of new
code that has not had significant testing in production settings.
That will only happen as more people write and use generic code.
We believe that this feature is well implemented and high quality.
However, unlike most aspects of Go, we can’t back up that belief with
real world experience.
Therefore, while we encourage the use of generics where it makes
sense, please use appropriate caution when deploying generic code in
production.</p>
<p>That caution aside, we’re excited to have generics available, and we
hope that they will make Go programmers more productive.</p>
