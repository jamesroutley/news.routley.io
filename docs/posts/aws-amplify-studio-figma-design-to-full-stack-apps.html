        <p>AWS Amplify announces AWS Amplify Studio, a visual development environment that offers frontend developers new features (public preview) to accelerate UI development with minimal coding, while integrating Amplify’s powerful backend configuration and management capabilities. Amplify Studio automatically translates designs made in Figma to human-readable React UI component code. Within Amplify Studio, developers can visually connect the UI components to app backend data. For configuring and managing backends, Amplify Admin UI’s existing capabilities will be part of Amplify Studio going forward, providing a unified interface to enable developers to build full-stack apps faster. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>.<br/> </p>

        <p>Developers can now use Amplify Studio to set up a backend, create UI components, and connect the two together, all within Amplify Studio. Amplify Studio contains all of Admin UI’s existing backend creation and management capabilities, simplifying set up and management of app backend infrastructure such as database tables, user authentication, and file storage, without requiring cloud expertise. To accelerate UI development, Amplify Studio offers developers a React UI library with dozens of components such as newsfeeds, contact forms, and e-commerce cards. All UI components are fully customizable within Figma, giving designers complete control over the visual styling of components within tooling they are familiar with. Developers can import component customizations from Figma into Amplify Studio, and use the component editor to visually connect the UI components to data from the app backend. Amplify Studio exports all frontend and backend artifacts (UI components, backend infrastructure) to credible code, empowering developers to fully customize the application design and behavior using familiar programming concepts — JavaScript for application code, Amplify CLI , and AWS CDK for extending backend infrastructure.</p>

        <p>AWS Amplify Studio’s UI development capabilities are currently in public preview. All backend configuration and management capabilities are generally available in 17 AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), South America (São Paulo), and Middle East (Bahrain).</p>
