    <h1>Greenland Ditches Starlink for French Satellite Service</h1>

			<p>Greenland Strengthens Internet Links Without U.S. Help</p>

				

<p>In today’s world, internet access is essential for education, health, and safety. </p>



<p>Yet, many people in East and North Greenland still struggle with slow or unreliable connections. That is about to change.</p>



<h2>Faster and More Stable</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&#34;imageId&#34;:&#34;68f873b7acfab&#34;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/shutterstock_2570841733_31n5Asv-1024x683.jpg" alt="Greenland"/><figcaption>Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Greenland’s national telecom company, Tusass, has signed a new agreement with the French company Eutelsat<strong> </strong>to provide satellite internet through OneWeb, reports Danish News Media <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/groenland/groenland-satser-paa-fransk-selskab-frem-elon-musk-s-satellitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DR</a>.</p>



<p>These satellites will bring faster and more stable coverage to towns and settlements that do not have underwater cables or radio links.</p>



<h2>Closing the Gap</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&#34;imageId&#34;:&#34;68f873b7ad5f7&#34;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Shutterstock_733835062-1024x532.jpg" alt="Grönland, Greenland"/><figcaption>Vadim_N / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tusass director Toke Binzer said the new service will improve life in remote areas such as Tasiilaq, Ittoqqortoormiit, and Qaanaaq. </p>



	
<p>He explained that customers in these regions have waited too long for reliable service. The goal is to close that gap and bring them online at a much higher standard.</p>



<h2>An Improvement</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&#34;imageId&#34;:&#34;68f873b7ada92&#34;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Shutterstock_2434412393-1024x512.png" alt="Satellite, space, orbit, tech, global"/><figcaption>Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eutelsat is a major player in global satellite communications. Its OneWeb satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional ones, which allows for faster and more reliable signals. </p>



<p>The company says the partnership will help connect isolated communities, support critical infrastructure, and improve maritime safety and rescue operations.</p>



<p>The first area to benefit will be Tasiilaq, which is expected to gain access before the end of the year. Other communities will follow as Tusass expands the network.</p>



<h2>Starlink Was Considered</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&#34;imageId&#34;:&#34;68f873b7aded0&#34;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Elon-Musk-Grok-1024x532.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tusass had also been in talks with Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, but chose to continue working with Eutelsat. </p>



	
<p>Binzer said it was not about which company was better, but about trust and long-term cooperation. Tusass already works with Eutelsat and knows their systems well.</p>



<h2>Maintaining Greenlandic Control</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&#34;imageId&#34;:&#34;68f873b7ae2be&#34;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Shutterstock_2538006591-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Grønland, greenland, flag"/><figcaption>ACERS_FOTO/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some Greenlandic politicians have warned that the country must keep control of its telecom infrastructure. </p>



<p>They fear that opening the market to foreign providers could threaten national security. For now, Tusass remains the sole provider of telecommunications in Greenland.</p>



<p>Binzer said the company will keep an open mind for future partnerships, but the priority remains clear. Greenland’s communication systems must stay under Greenlandic control.</p>
