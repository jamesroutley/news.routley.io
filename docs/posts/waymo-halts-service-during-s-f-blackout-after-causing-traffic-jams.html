<p><em>Update: On Sunday afternoon, Waymo said its fleet was <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/12/sf-waymo-pge-blackout-resume-service/">back on the roads.</a></em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Waymo said Saturday that it was stopping service across San Francisco after numerous online videos showed its autonomous vehicles snarling traffic during the <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/12/sf-power-outage-pge-electricity/">citywide blackout</a>.</p>


<p>“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco,” wrote Suzanne Philion, a company spokesperson, a little after 7 p.m. “We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work.”</p>

<p>About a <a href="https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/outage-tools/outage-map/">third of San Francisco</a> lost electricity throughout the day Saturday after rolling Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. blackouts hit some 125,000 homes and businesses. PG&amp;E <a href="https://x.com/PGE4Me/status/2002597756448198853">said</a> at 8:30 p.m. that power should start to be restored “later this evening.”</p>

<p>Traffic lights across the city were down, seemingly confusing the driverless cars — and halting them in their tracks. Riders and pedestrians posted videos of Waymos stuck at intersections, long lines of drivers behind them.</p>

<p>Many of the videos and images showed Waymos lined up one behind the other, with human drivers passing them by.</p>

<p>Groups of two, three, as many as five Waymos were stalled at different corners across the city, blinking red lights in the rain.</p>
