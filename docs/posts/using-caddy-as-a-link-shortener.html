<p>A few days ago, I was chatting to <a rel="noopener external" target="_blank" href="https://cassidoo.co/">Cassidy</a> after finding out she plays go, and she casually dropped a link to her profile at <a rel="noopener external" target="_blank" href="https://cass.run/ogs">cass.run/ogs</a>. I link people to my own OGS account from time to time, but that link looks like <code>online-go.com/user/view/1687228</code>, which is a little tough to remember. Usually I just tell people my username and let them look it up, but that’s a bit more hassle for them.</p>

<p>Well I guess I could remember my account number, but I use it infrequently enough that it’s easy to forget in between the times that I need it. And besides, I have plenty more URLs that would be useful to have on hand, but that are pretty tough to remember. All this is to say, I really like Cassidy’s idea of a personal URL shortener.</p>
<p>Hers lives, aptly, at <a rel="noopener external" target="_blank" href="https://cass.run/shortener">cass.run/shortener</a>, but it’s deployed as a Netlify application. I already have all of my domains pointing to my reverse proxy, Caddy, so I’d rather just use that if I can. Turns out it’s actually pretty easy! Just add this to your Caddyfile:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>rosy.systems {</span></span>
<span><span>    map {path} {redirect-uri} {</span></span>
<span><span>        /ogs    https://online-go.com/user/view/1687228</span></span>
<span><span>        /path   https://whatever.other.url.you.like</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>        default https://lucymcphail.com</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    redir {redirect-uri}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Replace the domain at the top with your own, and make sure to leave in the <code>default</code> mapping if you want it to gracefully handle paths that you haven’t added a redirect for. It works fine if you don’t, but you’ll get an ugly default error page if you try and hit <code>/wibble</code> or something else you haven’t defined. From there, just add any extra shortened URLs you’d like! Happy shortening :)</p>
