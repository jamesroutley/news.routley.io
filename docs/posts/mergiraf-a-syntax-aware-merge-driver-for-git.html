    <h1>Mergiraf: a syntax-aware merge driver for Git</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
                    <main>
                        <p><em>Are you held back by conflicts? Then meet</em></p>

<p>Mergiraf can solve <a href="https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html">a wide range of Git merge conflicts</a>. That&#39;s because it&#39;s aware of the trees in your files!
Thanks to <a href="https://mergiraf.org/languages.html">its understanding of your language</a>, it can often reconcile the needs of both sides.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://mergiraf.org/adding-a-language.html">teach Mergiraf a new language</a> in a completely declarative way. It&#39;s a nonviolent animal, so it prefers that over imperatives.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>Configure Git to use Mergiraf instead of its default merge heuristics. This will enhance <code>git merge</code>, <code>revert</code>, <code>rebase</code>, <code>cherry-pick</code> and more.</p>


<p>You can also keep Git&#39;s original behaviour and manually invoke Mergiraf after encountering conflicts.</p>

<p>Mergiraf is designed with your needs in mind. Its goals are:</p>
<h3 id="dont-sweep-conflicts-under-the-rug"><a href="#dont-sweep-conflicts-under-the-rug">Don&#39;t sweep conflicts under the rug</a></h3>
<p>Syntax-aware merging heuristics can sometimes be a bit too optimistic in considering a conflict resolved. Mergiraf does its best to err on the side of caution and retain conflict markers in the file when encountering suspicious cases.</p>
<p>If it manages to resolve all conflicts on its own, it encourages you to review its mediation work via the <code>mergiraf review</code> command.
If a merge looks faulty, <a href="https://mergiraf.org/usage.html#reporting-a-bad-merge">you can report it easily</a>.</p>

<p>Did you know that giraffes can run as fast as 60 kilometers per hour? Anyways. The operation of merging diverging versions of files happens routinely when working on a code base, often without you noticing as long as there aren&#39;t any conflicts. So Mergiraf tries to be quick so as not to interrupt you in your tasks.</p>
<h3 id="be-open-to-other-methods"><a href="#be-open-to-other-methods">Be open to other methods</a></h3>
<p>In many cases, line-based merging works just great and there is no need for tree-munging business. If a line-based merge is conflict-free, then Mergiraf just returns that merge (which is very quick).
One exception to this rule is <a href="https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html#line-based-merges">when line-based merging creates duplicate keys</a>. In such a case, Mergiraf does a bit more work to resolve the issue or highlight it to you with conflict markers.</p>
