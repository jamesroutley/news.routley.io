    <h1>Isle au Haut</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quartz-body"><div><article><p>So planning this kayaking trip with my friends, and I guess it’s sort of symbolized all the hopes of summer, and what is summer if not the hopes for the year? I went Kayaking Maine once many years ago as a camp counselor in Maine, and have wanted to do it again every since, but was having trouble finding someone who could help us locally with the gear and local knowledge of Maine’s channels and bays.</p>
<p>So I was in such a good mood after talking with Michael of Stonington Kayak Outfitters in Maine that this tune just immediately popped into my head and I wrote it down, because something had become possible that hadn’t before, and I was excited.</p>

<p>And on piano it sort of starts on this A-C#-E chord</p>

<p>tryin some words

<p>It is a one star in the sky before
all them in the sky git time
it’s the one shore big and wide
it’s the one shore coming near</p>
<p>and tide crash going hit
the tide pulls you in
the tide crash pushin you
riptide
hit your head</p>
<p>drift down to the sandy
shore underneath
it’s another kind of shore
another kind of shore</p>
<p>when did you you lose your home
did you find a way to replace
do you remember names
I only brought colors</p>
<hr/>
<p>another idea</p>
<p>hey big feelin
where’d you go</p>
<p>hey big feelin
been feelin low</p>
<p>you musta gone
on the road again</p>
<p>I know you get so
restless</p>
<p>I moved to new york
sold my car</p>
<p>starting to think i’ll always
have this guitar but I</p>
<p>gave the rest up
tryna find you</p>
<p>opened every door
like you told me to</p>
<p>hey big feeling
drop a pin</p>
<p>can’t recognize you
all the people that you’ve been</p>
<p>maybe one day I’ll
know your name</p>
<p>but hey big feeling
never the same</p>
<p>will I find you
in august isle au hat</p>
<p>the dancing of the water
of the waves down below</p>
<p>I know I will
don’t stand still</p>
<p>hey big feeling
that’s the source of the thrill</p>
<p>and I am proud of myself
for holdin on when it got hard</p>
<p>I guess so but I dunno why
how many choices did I even make</p>
<p>hey big feelin you got me
along for the ride</p>
<p>hey big feeling
always one step behind</p></article><hr/></div></div></div>
