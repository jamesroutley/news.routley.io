    <h1>Ask HN: Why hasnâ€™t AMD made a viable CUDA alternative?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I appreciate developing ROCm into something competitive with CUDA would require a lot of work, both internally within AMD and with external contributions to the relevant open source libraries.</p><p>However the amount of resources at stake is incredible. The delta between NVIDIA&#39;s value and AMD&#39;s is bigger than the annual GDP of Spain. Even if they needed to hire a few thousand engineers at a few million in comp each, it&#39;d still be a good investment.</p></div></div></div>
