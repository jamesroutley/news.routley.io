In a world of plastic consumer goods, avoiding the material entirely requires the fervor of a religious conversion. But getting rid of black plastic kitchen utensils is a low-stakes move, and worth it. Cooking with any plastic is a dubious enterprise, because heat <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-plastic-a-threat-to-your-health">encourages</a> potentially harmful plastic compounds to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214289422001089">migrate</a> out of the polymers and potentially into the food. But, as Andrew Turner, a biochemist at the University of Plymouth recently told me, black plastic is particularly crucial to avoid.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In 2018, Turner <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160412018302125?via%3Dihub">published one of the earliest papers</a> positing that black plastic products were likely regularly being made from recycled electronic waste. The clue was the plastic’s concerning levels of flame retardants. In some cases, the mix of chemicals matched the profile of those commonly found in computer and television housing, many of which are treated with flame retardants to prevent them from catching fire.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Because optical sensors in recycling facilities <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/black-plastic-recycling-supermarkets-waste/">can’t detect</a> them, black-colored plastics are largely rejected from domestic-waste streams, resulting in a shortage of black base material for recycled plastic. So the demand for black plastic appears to be met “in no insignificant part” via recycled e-waste, according to Turner’s research. TV and computer casings, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.undp.org/blog/unsung-heroes-four-things-policymakers-can-do-empower-informal-waste-workers">like the majority of the world’s plastic waste</a>, tend to be recycled in informal waste economies with few regulations and end up remolded into consumer products, including ones, such as spatulas and slotted spoons, that come into contact with food.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">You simply do not want flame retardants anywhere near your stir-fry. Flame retardants are typically not bound to the polymers to which they are added, making them a particular flight risk: They dislodge easily and make their way into the surrounding environment. And, indeed, another paper from 2018 found that flame retardants in black kitchen utensils readily <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969717321708">migrate into hot cooking oil</a>. The health concerns associated with those chemicals are well established: Some flame retardants are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10486428/">endocrine disruptors</a>, which can interfere with the body’s hormonal system, and scientific literature suggests that they may be associated with a range of ailments, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/exposure-to-common-flame-retardant-chemicals-may-increase-thyroid-problems-in-women/">thyroid disease</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deohs.washington.edu/hsm-blog/flame-retardants-and-diabetes">diabetes</a>, and cancer. People with the highest blood levels of PBDEs, a class of flame retardants found in black plastic, had about a 300 percent increase in their risk of dying from cancer compared with people who had the lowest levels, according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816783">study released this year</a>. In a separate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524022173?via%3Dihub">study</a>, published in a peer-reviewed journal this month, researchers from the advocacy group Toxic-Free Future and from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam found that, out of all of the consumer products they tested, kitchen utensils had some of the highest levels of flame retardants.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Many of the flame-retardant compounds that showed up in the tests that Liu and her co-authors conducted should no longer be in the product stream. Brominated flame retardants have mostly been phased out of products in the U.S. and Europe, including from many electronics. In the U.S. and elsewhere, some of the most harmful flame-retardant compounds are now illegal for use in most consumer goods. Massachusetts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wamc.org/new-england-news/2021-02-03/new-massachusetts-law-bans-certain-chemical-flame-retardants">banned</a> a list of 11 flame retardants in 2021. Starting this year, a New York <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A5418">bill</a> restricts the use of organohalogen flame retardants—one large class of the compounds—in electronic casings, and a similar Washington State ban will go into effect in 2025.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But these compounds keep coming back. The sushi tray tested in Liu’s study contained 11,900 parts per million of decaBDE, also called BDE-209, which she described as a “really alarming” level of a chemical that was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/24/2023-25714/decabromodiphenyl-ether-and-phenol-isopropylated-phosphate-31-revision-to-the-regulation-of#:~:text=The%202021%20decaBDE%20final%20rule,as%20of%20January%206%2C%202022.">banned</a> from most U.S. commerce in 2022 and largely phased out of production long before that. Because plastic recycling is a global economy with scant oversight, patchwork legislation may do little to keep these compounds out of the supply chain. “You send your electronic waste abroad, and you just haven’t got a clue what happens to it,” Turner told me. “I think the assumption is that it gets handled safely and it’s disposed of properly. But, you know, it comes back in the form of things that we don’t want.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For a consumer, this problem would be simpler to handle if it was clear that only certain black plastic products posed a risk, or that all of them did. But Turner found that products were contaminated with flame retardants at random. Not all of the black plastic he tested in his 2018 study contained the compounds, and in those that did, “the amount of chemicals in the black plastic varied hugely,” he said. Some items would have the same chemical profile of what you’d expect from, say, the flame-retardant plastic housing of a television or a cellphone. Other objects would have just a trace of flame retardant, or none at all. Of the more than 200 black plastic products Liu bought at retail stores for her study, hardly any were labeled as being made from recycled materials, she said. Consumers have no way to tell which black plastics might be recycled e-waste and which aren’t. “It’s just a minefield, really,” Turner said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Putting your black plastic in the recycling bin might seem like the right thing to do, but recycling isn’t a solution to the most noxious qualities of plastics. “I personally have been throwing out my black plastic takeout containers,” Liu told me, because if they are contaminated, “it’s scary to think that those might be reentering other products with the same flame retardants.” Until flame retardants and any dubious compounds that arise to replace banned ones are eliminated from the supply chain, reusing black plastic will perpetuate a potential health hazard. In her view, “the onus shouldn’t fall on consumers to have to make these daily changes in their lives.” Ultimately, federal bans or more ubiquitous state laws that go beyond single-compound phaseouts are the only way to keep flame retardants out of takeout containers and other black plastic intended for use in things such as foodware and toys. Until manufacturers use safer flame-retardant compounds and laws effectively prohibit recycled electronics material from entering consumer products, these chemicals will continue circulating through our kitchens, arising and re-arising like toxic zombies.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But that doesn’t mean we need to consume them by way of our kitchen utensils. Replacing a black plastic spatula with a steel or silicone option is an easy way to cut down on at least part of one’s daily dose of hormone disruptors. I’ve also taken this news as a reason to coax myself into carrying a reusable coffee mug more often, if only to avoid the black plastic lids on disposable cups—heat plus plastic equals chemical migration, after all. It’s a minefield of random hazards out there, as Turner said. Most of the time we’re trying to navigate without a map. But in at least some areas, we can trace a safer path for ourselves.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>
