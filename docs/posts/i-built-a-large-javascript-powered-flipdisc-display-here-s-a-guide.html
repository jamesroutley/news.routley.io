    <h1>Show HN: I built a large JavaScript powered flipdisc display. Here&#39;s a guide</h1>

<p><strong>Flipdiscs</strong> (or <em>flip dots</em>) are a display type that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to flip a small disc between two colors. Despite being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-disc_display#History">invented over 80 years ago</a>, the underlying technology is mostly the same today. I chose them because I wanted to design a large interactive wall art for my office, and didn’t like the LED glow of traditional screens. Flip displays are an interesting alternative. They have no moving parts, near limitless lifespan, high readability, and achieves anywhere between 25-60fps. Also, as a pleasant bonus, they emit a sound like rain hitting a window each time one of the disc flips - I find it very soothing. I’ve always wanted unique ways to visualize code, like this <a href="https://github.com/kelly/electroknit-app">pixel knitting app</a> we designed for <a href="https://beckystern.com/2010/11/02/hacking-the-brother-kh-930e-knitting-machine/">electroknit knitting machines</a> or this <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/atom-crafts">crafting tool</a> for Atom Editor (RIP). Flipdots seemed like a similar fun challenge. I paired with my <a href="https://github.com/kelly">partner</a> to help code and design the board. Who doesn’t love quality hacking time with their partner?! I’m not sure how many people will find this useful since flipdisc displays are sort of an obscure technology, but here we go!</p>
