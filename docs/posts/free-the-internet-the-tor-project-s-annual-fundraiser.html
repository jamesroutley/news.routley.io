    <h1>Free the Internet: The Tor Project&#39;s annual fundraiser</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Is the internet today the internet you want for future generations? What if instead of for-profit greed, rampant <a href="https://www.404media.co/airlines-sell-5-billion-plane-ticket-records-to-the-government-for-warrantless-searching/">privacy violations</a>, and pervasive <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/geedge-networks-mass-censorship-leak/">government spying</a>, we could have a different relationship with the internet?</p>
<p>What if we could FREE THE INTERNET from the chains of surveillance and censorship?</p>
<p>At the Tor Project, along with our incredible community of supporters, we&#39;re not just imagining a free internet â€” <strong>we&#39;re building it</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In countries like Turkmenistan where access to information is tightly controlled, <a href="https://turkmen.news/">Turkmen.news</a> trusts Tor to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/Corruption-Control-Turkmenistan-internet-censorship-business/">provide safe access to the free internet</a> where it once did not exist.</li>
<li><a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> uses Tor as the backbone of <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/five-things-to-know-about-securedrop/">SecureDrop</a>, a tool that allows journalists and sources to communicate freely without fear of retaliation or exposure. </li>
<li>In Russia and Egypt, where authorities often block encrypted tools to control communications, individuals use Tor Browser to access encrypted email services like <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/tutanota-blocked-russia">Tuta Mail</a> to freely communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tor is a building block for a free internet, and it takes our collective efforts to improve and amplify it. Thatâ€™s why during the next three months, the Tor Project will be holding a fundraising campaign during which we ask for your support to advance digital freedom.</p>
<p>As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, the Tor Project relies on donations to power its tools â€“ the Tor network, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>, <a href="https://tails.net/install/index.en.html">Tails OS</a>, and the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/strength-numbers-entire-ecosystem-relies-tor/">Tor ecosystem</a>. These <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship">tools are trusted by millions</a> and always <strong>free</strong> to use, without collecting, selling, trading, or renting any of your data for profit.</p>
<p>This year we are calling to <strong>FREE THE INTERNET</strong> by supporting Tor. If you give now during the campaign, <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2025">your donation will be matched</a> by our supporters at <a href="https://powerupprivacy.com/">Power Up Privacy</a>. This means a $25 donation will have a $50 impact â€“ and all donations over $25 will qualify you for fun <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2025">Tor merchandise</a>. ðŸ‘€</p>

<p>In the 2023-2024 fiscal year, 84% of our expenses were associated with program services. That means that a very significant portion of our budget goes directly into building Tor and making it better. Those program services include building Tor <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-refresh-to-help-more-people-get-online/">technology</a>, conducting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbyqc4Jdm3o">outreach</a>, and keeping Tor tools up-to-date and secure. We are proud to have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/208096820">Four-Star Charity</a> rating from Charity Navigator, and have been awarded <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/shared/7d68a7b7-2a9f-4613-a985-1638da87abdf">Candidâ€™s Platinum Seal of Transparency</a>. This demonstrates the Tor Projectâ€™s commitment to openness and honesty in how the organization manages its finances and uses your investment for a greater impact.</p>
<p>Join us in being defiant against profit-driven tech tools and keeping Tor tools FREE, private, and accessible. Your support today helps build a better internet for tomorrow.</p>
