                <p>Recently since the AI wave started to hit, I&#39;ve probably gotten back on a decent addiction level of checking HackerNews (HN).  There have been some pretty cool things to come out of just watching what people post.</p><p>But occasionally, I am dumbfounded by what happens.  It happened to be a Saturday morning, and as I awoke from my slumber I did what any addict would do.  I got my dose.  Then I saw this</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/ee7d5bc7-766d-41dd-8af2-cb74d28bd2c5.png"/>Someone had posted an open source project I had finally made version 0.2 of.  And it went to #3.</p><p>Honestly, before I even got to the end of the title I thought &#34;Damn, nice, some one else open sourced a AI video remover too&#34;.  Then of course surprised when it was my own project.  So I loaded HN again and took a screen shot.</p><p>There is already a blog post on that project and its creation, so I am not going to digress into that.  Instead I am going to dig a bit into the HN effect the day after.</p><p>Here are the Github stats on traffic, mind you the flat line you see before is about 300 views a day, so the project had already been out for a couple years;</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/169379cd-2abb-4890-bab7-efca44dd864d.png"/></p><p>Then a further breakdown of where they came from and where they went;</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/eab0356d-82eb-41df-a732-b5c162c012b2.png"/></p><p>Of course, I was blown away all day and let the community know, and per usual HN, it started with topics I had no idea about, on my own project.</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/70ec339a-ac9d-42e6-8968-9f365bb31836.png"/></p><p>And</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/e14b3cc2-0c6f-4ed5-8e4f-004a25acfce6.png"/></p><p>And of course me not even knowing what they mean by binary,</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/6928ae73-9d6e-4bb8-96a0-be3ebefdf884.png"/></p><p>And getting educated in the comments</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/685af168-0e41-4a52-9dea-099857719ef7.png"/><br/></p><p>In the end, amazing.  Almost as amazing as the poster who sent me higher than I had ever felt over a project I had ever been</p><p><img src="https://johnathannader.com/media/django-summernote/2023-05-07/05ec6950-21fa-46e0-950e-8ffd6df1d288.png"/></p><p>So thank you HN and thunderbong; I hope open source keeps on opensourcing.<br/></p>
