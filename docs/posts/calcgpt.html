CalcGPT, conceived by an incisive and quirky artist-engineer Calvin Liang,
      serves as the praxis of satire in a hyper-advanced AI-dominated era.
      Imbued with an ingenious blend of technology and dry humor, the creation
      shrewdly prods at the modern world&#39;s pervasive and at times, excessive
      leaning towards AI solutions - even when not necessarily needed.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-tisrfsvx="">
More than merely functional, this artwork manifests in the rather
      unassuming form of a calculator, powered by the sophisticated GPT language
      model. But this isn&#39;t your standard piece of tech; instead, it is a clever
      parody, an emblem of resistance to the unrelenting AI craze.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-tisrfsvx="">
CalcGPT embodies the timeless adage - &#39;Old is Gold&#39; - reminding us that
      itâ€™s often rewarding to resort to established, traditional methods rather
      than chasing buzzword-infused cutting-edge tech. Serving not just as a
      computational tool, but as a poignant social commentary, this creation
      employs the grandeur of technology to a funny yet thought-provoking end.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-tisrfsvx="">
The piece invites us to reflect on the necessity and relevance of AI in
      every aspect of our lives as opposed to its prevailing use as a mere
      marketing gimmick. With its delightful slowness and propensity for
      computational errors, CalcGPT elicits mirth while urging us to question
      our zealous indulgence in all things AI.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-tisrfsvx="">
Liang&#39;s creation is laced with understated humor, driving home a
      lighthearted critique on our unchecked fascination with AI. CalcGPT urges
      us to weigh the equilibrium between preserving tradition and embracing
      innovation and reflects on the possibility of our headlong pursuit of
      fashionable tech buzzwords misguiding us.
