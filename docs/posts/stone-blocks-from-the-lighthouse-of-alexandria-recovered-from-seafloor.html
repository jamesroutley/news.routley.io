Supported by the Fondation Dassault Systèmes, the project aims to virtually reassemble the structure using advanced technology.</p><p>Among the recently excavated finds are the massive lintels and uprights of the monumental entrance to the lighthouse, its threshold stones, foundation paving slabs, and fragmentary remains of a previously unrecorded pylon. The doorway of the pylon intriguingly blends Egyptian stylistic elements with Greek construction techniques, evidencing the multicultural diversity of Hellenistic Alexandria.</p><figure id="attachment_51074" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51074"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijk2MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgOTYwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2.jpg" alt="Lighthouse of Alexandria rises again as 22 massive blocks resurface from the seafloor after 2,000 years" width="1280" height="960" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51074">One of the monumental doorway blocks of the Lighthouse of Alexandria being raised from the seabed.

It was constructed by Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus and stood more than 100 meters tall above the island of Pharos, guiding ships safely through Alexandria’s treacherous coastal waters. It held the title of the world’s tallest human-made structure for more than 1,600 years, until an earthquake in 1303 rendered it inoperable. Its remaining stones were recycled by Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa’it Bay to build a fortress in the same place in 1477.</p><p>While the sunken ruins had been visible as early as 1968, systematic archaeological work began in 1994 when French archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur led a full-scale exploration. His team documented over 3,300 objects including sphinxes, obelisks, columns, and granite blocks. More than 100 of these architectural fragments have been digitally scanned on the seabed over the last decade.</p><figure id="attachment_51076" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51076"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijk2MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgOTYwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4.jpg" alt="Lighthouse of Alexandria rises again as 22 massive blocks resurface from the seafloor after 2,000 years" width="1280" height="960" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/lighthouse-of-alexandria-4-1140x855.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51076">Digital reconstruction of the Lighthouse of Alexandria based on a 2013 survey.
