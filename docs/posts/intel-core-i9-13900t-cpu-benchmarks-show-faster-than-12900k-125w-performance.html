			<p>Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-expands-13th-gen-desktop-cpu-family-with-65w-35w-skus-starting-at-109-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently introduced</a> brand new 13th Gen T-series chips which feature the Core i9-13900T that operates at a 35W TDP. The new chip has been benchmarked within Geekbench 5 and showcases impressive performance given its limited power budget.</p>
<h2>Intel&#39;s 13th Gen Core i9-13900T 35W CPU Beats The 125W Core i9-12900K In Geekbench 5 Benchmark</h2>
<p>Starting with the specifications, the Intel Core i9-13900T is a variation of the Core i9-13900 series that comes with a limited TDP design. While the standard chips boast 125W TDP in the unlocked and 65W TDP on the Non-K SKUs, the T-series chip is limited to a 35W TDP.Â  The Unlocked CPU is rated at up to 253W, the Non-K is rated at up to 219W while the T-series chip is rated at up to 106 Watts which is less than half the power budget of its higher-end siblings.</p>
<p>The Intel Core i9-13900T retains the same core configuration with 24 cores that are made up of 8 P-Cores and 16 E-Cores with 32 threads, a base clock of 1.10 GHz, a boost of up to 5.30 GHz &amp; 68 MB of cache (L2+L3). The CPU also comes at a slightly lower price point of $549.00 US. Now the CPU is tested within the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/19876072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geekbench 5 benchmark</a> using an ASUS TUF Gaming B660M-PLUS WIFI board and coupled with 64 GB of DDR5 memory.</p>

<p>The CPU scored 2178 points in the single-core and 17339 points in the multi-core tests. We used the Intel Core i9-12900K for comparison which scores 1901 points in single-core and 17272 points in multi-core tests. This puts the Intel Core i9-13900T up to 15% faster in single-core and slightly faster in multi-threaded tests which is very impressive considering the Core i9-12900K also has a higher 125W base TDP (3.58x higher) and a peak TDP rating of 241W (2.27x higher).</p>

<p>This goes off to show the immense efficiency that Intel&#39;s 10nm ESF process node and the new hybrid architecture packs and we will also get to see some similar results with the mobility lineup, especially the <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-13th-gen-mobility-family-roars-hx-h-p-u-cpus-raptor-lake-core-i9-13980hx-first-24-core-laptop-chip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13th Gen HX parts</a> which are going to ship in enthusiast-grade gaming laptops in the coming months. AMD also introduced its brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7000-non-x-desktop-cpus-already-available-for-sale-at-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new 65W Ryzen 7000 Non-X CPUs</a> which have been showcasing some impressive efficiency feats on their own with the Zen 4 core architecture.</p>
