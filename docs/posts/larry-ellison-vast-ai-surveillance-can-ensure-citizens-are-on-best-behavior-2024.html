He said AI will usher in a new era of surveillance that he gleefully said will ensure &#34;citizens will be on their best behavior.&#34;</p><p>Ellison made the comments as he spoke to investors earlier this week during an Oracle financial analysts meeting, where he shared his thoughts on the future of AI-powered surveillance tools.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Ellison said AI would be used in the future to constantly watch and analyze vast surveillance systems, like security cameras, police body cameras, doorbell cameras, and vehicle dashboard cameras.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re going to have supervision,&#34; Ellison said. &#34;Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there&#39;s a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that&#39;s going on.&#34;</p><p>Ellison also expects AI drones to replace police cars in high-speed chases. &#34;You just have a drone follow the car,&#34; Ellison said. &#34;It&#39;s very simple in the age of autonomous drones.&#34; He did not say if those drones would broadcast the chases on network news.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Ellison&#39;s company, Oracle, like almost every company these days, is aggressively pursuing opportunities in the AI industry. It already has several projects in the works, including one in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-larry-ellison-team-up-ai-farming-tool-starlink-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">partnership with Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX</a>.</p><p>Ellison is the world&#39;s sixth-richest man with a net worth of $157 billion, according to Bloomberg. </p><p>Ellison&#39;s children have made names for themselves in the film industry.
