  <p>Since I haven&#39;t published anything in almost two months, let me jot down one thought that has come to mind frequently over the past few months.</p>
<h2>If you use LaTeX …</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, are you sure you <em>have to</em> use LaTeX? By which I mean, are you sure you can&#39;t use Markdown+MathJax or textile+MathJax or restructuredText+MathJax? Especially if you&#39;re teaching your students, are you absolutely sure you are completely and utterly unable to use something simpler? Something that is more modern than learning a hundred bits of print typesetting that your student will never, ever need? Ok, just checking. So…</p>
<h2>If you (have to) use LaTeX, then make HTML your primary output.</h2>
<p>By which I mean: don&#39;t just produce PDFs that nobody can read on small screens, PDFs that nobody can read accessibly, PDFs that nobody will want to read in 5 years.</p>
<p>Make HTML your first output. It&#39;s important. HTML is the future engine for mathematical and scientific content. If you can&#39;t produce HTML, then ur doin it rong. If you don&#39;t produce HTML, you won&#39;t ever help all the people working on pushing math on the web forward.</p>
<p>It won&#39;t be trivial but easier than you think. Install <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/a">LaTeXML</a> and learn how to use it. (Alternatively you probably have a copy of tex4ht installed with your TeX.) How hard is it? This hard:</p>
<pre><code>  latexml --dest=mydoc.xml mydoc.tex
  latexmlpost --dest=mydoc.html --format=html5 mydoc.xml
</code></pre>
<p>And when you run into LaTeXML limitations, then get over it, <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/contact.html">report them back</a>, help make it better. If you run into problems with MathJax, <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax/issues">report them</a>, help make it better. You need graphics? Check out <a href="https://github.com/sonoisa/XyJax">xyjax</a>. You need pstricks? Check out <a href="http://mathapedia.com">mathapedia</a>. You need computations? Check out <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/eval.html">Sage cell server</a>. It&#39;s all there, but you have to get started. To it today.</p>
<p>But if you&#39;ve ever wanted math to be native on the web, then you have to realize that it <strong>won&#39;t happen without your help</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re too lazy for converting (e.g., when you&#39;re teaching), then use something that compiles to both TeX and HTML (like markdown+MathJax etc). Pick a decent tool for it, like <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute">Qute</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a>, write on the web with <a href="http://fiduswriter.com/">FidusWriter</a> or <a href="http://authorea.com">Authorea.com</a>, write in your favorite Mac-editor with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">extend sublimetext</a>, on an iPad app use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994">Writing Kit</a> -- and that&#39;s just off the top of my head; there are many more editing environments that offer good syntax and MathJax integration. Many can save to TeX documents, anything can be converted via <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. It&#39;s not perfect yet but it won&#39;t get better unless you give everybody some feedback.</p>
<p>So, if you can, don&#39;t author LaTeX, author <em>into</em> LaTeX. And whatever you do, compile it to HTML. It&#39;s important.</p>
