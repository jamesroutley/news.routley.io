    <p>Donations are a key part of what keeps F-Droid independent and reliable and
our latest hardware update is a direct result of your support. Thanks to
donations from our incredible community, F-Droid has replaced one of its
most critical pieces of infrastructure, our core server hardware. It was
overdue for a refresh, and now we are happy to give you an update on the new
server and how it impacts the project.</p>

<p>This upgrade touches a core part of the infrastructure that builds and
publishes apps for the main F-Droid repository. If the server is slow,
everything downstream gets slower too. If it is healthy, the entire
ecosystem benefits.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-wait">Why did we wait?</h2>

<p>This server replacement took a bit longer than we would have liked. The
biggest reason is that sourcing reliable parts right now is genuinely
hard. Ongoing global trade tensions have made supply chains unpredictable,
and that hit the specific components we needed. We had to wait for quotes,
review, replan, and wait again when quotes turned out to have unexpected
long waits, before we finally managed to receive hardware that met our
requirements.</p>

<p>Even with the delays, the priority never changed. We were looking for the
right server set up for F-Droid, built to last for the long haul.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-about-the-host">A note about the host</h2>

<p>Another important part of this story is where the server lives and how it is
managed. F-Droid is not hosted in just any data center where commodity
hardware is managed by some unknown staff. We worked out a special
arrangement so that this server is physically held by a long time
contributor with a proven track record of securely hosting services. We can
control it remotely, we know exactly where it is, and we know who has
access. That level of transparency and trust is not common in
infrastructure, but it is central to how we think about resilience and
stewardship.</p>

<p>This was not the easiest path, and it required careful coordination and
negotiation. But we are glad we did it this way. It fits our values and our
threat model, and it keeps the project grounded in real people rather than
anonymous systems.</p>

<h2 id="old-hardware-new-momentum">Old hardware, new momentum</h2>

<p>The previous server was 12 year old hardware and had been running for about
five years. In infrastructure terms, that is a lifetime. It served F-Droid
well, but it was reaching the point where speed and maintenance overhead
were becoming a daily burden.</p>

<p>The new system is already showing a huge improvement. Stats of the running
cycles from the last two months suggest it can handle the full build and
publish actions much faster than before. E.g. this year, between January and
September, we published updates once every 3 or 4 days, that got down to
once every 2 days in October, to every day in November and it’s reaching
twice a day in December. <em>(You can see this in the frequency of index
publishing after October 18, 2025 in our <a href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/f-droid.org-transparency-log/-/commits/master">f-droid.org transparency
log</a>)</em>.
That extra capacity gives us more breathing room and helps shorten the gap
between when apps are updated and when those updates reach users. We can now
build all the <a href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/FAQ#finding-updates">auto-updated
apps</a> in the
<em>(UTC)</em> morning in one cycle, and all the newly included apps, fixed apps
and manually updated apps, through the day, in the evening cycle.</p>

<p>We are being careful here, because real world infrastructure always comes
with surprises. But the performance gains are real, and they are exciting.</p>

<h2 id="what-donations-make-possible">What donations make possible</h2>

<p>This upgrade exists because of community support, pooled over time, turned
into real infrastructure, benefiting everyone who relies on F-Droid.</p>

<p>A faster server does not just make our lives easier. It helps developers get
timely builds. It reduces maintenance risk. It strengthens the health of the
entire repository.</p>

<p>So thank you. Every <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/donate/">donation</a>, whether large
or small, is part of how this project stays reliable, independent, and
aligned with free software values.</p>
