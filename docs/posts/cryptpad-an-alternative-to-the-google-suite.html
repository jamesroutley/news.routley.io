    <p>What I most love in cryptpad it&#39;s about privacy policies and cryptography. Have a service of this category for free, it&#39;s just amazing. The teams and real time working kicks out any disappointing if compare the product with Google Docs. I really would trust CryptPad for any service or doc that you must do online and would not worry at all with information leaks.</p>

    <p>First of all, I love the lightweight interface design of CryptPad. It makes it very easy, especially for less digital people, to start using the online collaboration tools. Another thing I love is that we can work with a high level of privacy here. That&#39;s hugely important in tool selection in associations I work with.
For collaborative writing CryptPad is my tool of choice, for the overview to small projects I immediately start a Kanban board. CryptDrive is super as we can store all files here.</p>

    <p>That it is a good, easy-to-use, open source and free alternative to other online office suites and storage, which, unlike the similar suites and storage, does not spy on you or profit from your data as it cannot due to the way it works. I also love that it keeps adding new tools in order to be able to do more than possibly even the other similar online software does.</p>

    <p>God, what don&#39;t I? I love the feel of the UI, the robustness of the text. The privacy is great, and why I got into it in the first place. Takes alot off my mind. Decryption&#39;s nice and quick, too, so it&#39;s not a slog. Overall, the workspace feels really nice, and almost like an online home. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for an alternative to larger online word-processors like Google Docs.</p>

    <p>Given the abusive commercial data mining activities of other cloud based productivity tool providers, the suite of tools offered by CryptPad and their dedication to data privacy and implementation of data encryption is both laudable and the future.

They actually respond to issues promptly. The free tier is generous and allows shoe-string independent developers like myself to get my fledgling business started. I will have no hesitation in switching to a paid tier when cashflow permits.</p>

    <p>Digitalcourage, the NGO I am volunteering for, had used Etherpad for many years to write texts collaboratively. When I set up a CryptPad server, everyone switched to it within a few weeks. As a pro-privacy organization, using a zero-knowledge service is a no-brainer. As an IT admin, I am glad that I cannot read the documents stored on my CryptPad server. As a user, it feels good that I can control who gets to read my documents. There is no reason to use Google Docs or Microsoft 365 any more!</p>

    <p>&#39;What do I love about Cryptpad?&#39; Utter simplicity of the interface - big, bold and tells you what&#39;s going on. Very reassuring for new users who get confused/intimidated by techy UIs with dozens of buttons. Will definitely upgrade when independent journalism funding improves. For now, tho, this pad is a great way for new teams to safely connect e.g. as here in the vast Pacific, across many timezones. </p>

    <p>Found CryptPad to be very easy and quite straightforward to use. Very similar to the Microsoft Office &amp; LibreOffice software suites and would definitely say it&#39;s a smooth transition from those offerings to the CryptPad software suite. Have greatly enjoyed - and have utilised quite often - the collaboration features of CryptPad; exceedingly helpful when working with others on a file (or multiple files). In conclusion, very pleased with CryptPad and would highly recommend it!</p>

    <p>I love CrpytPad because it&#39;s similar to Google Drive (and will become more so when the development team finally launches native CryptPad Docs, Sheets, and Slides) with the important difference that with CryptPad I know that my private documents are actually private. Not even the CryptPad team can see the contents of my Drive. Can&#39;t say the same for Google Drive.</p>

    <p>Easy collaboration, security and privacy. Obviously those are very important to us.  We are an action group targeting the climate crisis. We plan non-violent but disruptive actions that meet resistance from police, financial institutions and government. Most of us have never been in an action group before. Although consequences are scary, we feel that we must do what we can, in the little time that is left. Our tools must be reliable and usable for non-professionals.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s great to have a secure and private platform to organise and collaborate with others. Best of all: it&#39;s entirely open source using a free licence. Setting up and maintaining a CryptPad is rather simple, so you can run your own server in no time if the fully encrypted nature of all user data is not enough for you to put trust into third party servers.</p>

    <p>As a FOSS advocate, i thought there will be no alternative to Google Docs, so i was struggling to manage my documents. Until i discovered &#34;CryptPad&#34; the best collaboration tool I&#39;ve ever seen. With Cryptpad, I am sure that all my documents are safe and encrypted, the service is so reliable and perfectly suits my needs.</p>

    <p>Easy to use, data protection on high level and open for persons without Cryptpad account.
I use it for:
- collaborative work on a topic, application (instead of google.docs)...
- platform to save datas for other persons (instead of wetransfer)
- platform to save reports of meetings with persons of many organisations
- the pad can be actualised without saving again the document</p>

    <p>I love that with CryptPad there is finally a privacy-friendly and open-source, still fully-featured alternative to well-known Google services. I love the ease of use and the simple yet genius security concept behind sharing document links which ensure that only end-users can read the content. And I love the spirit behind the product and their creators. It&#39;s really great to see that there are companies like XWiki SAS that believe both in privacy and free and open-source software products.</p>

    <p>CryptPad has great sharing options, and includes online concurrent editing. That makes it my default suggestion anytime someone wants to share documents: it satisfies the shared editing like in Google Docs, it includes spreadsheets, and it has folders that I can share with a group. I now have a single online service for collaboration... and I know I can export my own data any time if my projects grow in size (for me to host and directly manage, eg. P2P).</p>

    <p>There are so many great things about CryptPad, but the top three are: 1.) It is very secure and can be used directly in your browser! 2.) It&#39;s free for personal use! I use it for all kinds of things and haven&#39;t looked back. 3.) It&#39;s as simple as using Google Docs/Sheets and Word/Excel. I highly recommend it anyone that is concerned about their privacy. </p>

    <p>The Cryptpad family of web applications is built on the principles that I would use to build software for my friends, family and myself:
- Data security by end-to-end-encryption
- Control over one&#39;s own data
- Enable uncomplicated collaboration</p>

    <p>Besides encryption, I appreciate excellent user interface - intuitive, responsive, customizable. Folders tree in the left pane. Rich text editor (really rich and classic). My personal favorite: automatic outline, forming clickable table of contents in the left pane, which can be shown/hidden by a &#34;hamburger&#34; button, perfect for mobile. I also like the simple calendar, colorful tags, monday-starting weeks, monthly view. Other types of files look even more interesting. Haven&#39;t tried yet, but: wow!</p>

    <p>I like CryptPad, in my opinion it is the best OSS decentralized privacy-focused alternative to commercial collaborative office suites like Google Drive. I also like that CryptDrive could be used as a secure cloud for my personal files. I am grateful to the developers and those who maintain public CryptPad instances. </p>

    <p>The sandboxing layer of encryption is fantastic and the free account without restriction of features is a brilliant way to not turn people off. I recommend it&#39;s usage to anyone looking for something in this field. We are now running out of space and as a somewhat techy person I am self-hosting Cryptpad on our group&#39;s server, but there are a lot of people I&#39;m sure who can&#39;t do that and I hope you are receiving some subscription finances from those that can afford it.</p>

    <p> CryptPad is a great example of FLOSS. It combines and enhances many other FLOSS tools. CryptPad has an active community and is well interacting with project members. It is simple by default, while providing basic/advanced productivity tool. Recently, it is becoming more powerful (&#34;simple&#34; pad -&gt; encrypted OnlyOffice). And it is GDPR compliant.

    <p> My data hosted in EU. Crypted data. Share data securely with others. Good replacement of Google Agenda. Good online OnlyOffice editors. Wish: Android app for Agenda. A desktop drive would be cool too. I think with those two features I would easily go for a paid plan because we should promote all kinds of EU services vs. US and China ones.</p>

It is great that you do not register via google, Facebook or another Data collecting company. It gives the feeling of a secure, data minimised work platform. </p>

    <p>I like that it can be used without having to provide extra information when using a free account.  And even with the premium account, it requires just an email (which is still more privacy focused than Google).  It is about doing what you need to do without mining more data, or trying to dig deeper to lock you into one ecosystem.  Also the loading screen gives a fun kind of &#34;hacker person&#34; vibe while also giving an idea what it is doing.</p>

    <p>Cryptpad makes it easy for me to take my documents on-the-go, without trading my privacy for convinience. I see merit in the project and had been a paid member to support the team and have my team to work on various documents simultaneously, and it had been best investment. It is truly a magnificient alternative to the proprietary solutions and does exactly what it claims to do.</p>

    <p>CryptPad is super accessible, while having a lot of useful features. I like that anyone can use it, no account needed. I used it with homeschoolers I&#39;ve tutored, to distribute and collaborate on a text file of productive things to do during COVID. </p>

    <p>Although the free version limits you, it gives you so much more to work with and with ensured privacy. I was astounded by what was capable in the free version, compared to the rest of the competition. CryptPad surely knows what it&#39;s doing.</p>

    <p>Open source is a huge amount of the appeal.  On top of being pretty much the only online collaborative document editor I can trust, the fact that anybody can deploy it and audit it and increases that trust.  Allowing free use while also providing extra support via subscription also seems like a good model for longevity of the project.  I really hope to see it continue to flourish, and perhaps become a subscriber myself soon!</p>

    <p>I like CryptPad, because it is open source and creates to empower societal actors in a sustainable way, so that the value goes back to the society and not to a handful of shareholders. Also this creates a way for lots of people to learn coding. Another positive effect for us is that people get control over their data.</p>

    <p>1. The software is open source and provides actually an alternative that can combat Microsoft Online and Google Drive/Documents. An &#34;online LibreOffice&#34;
2. The CryptPad official instance collects minimal data; only that which is required to operate the service which prevents them from being able to leak data to intelligence agencies as they do not possess any.
3. It has a free option and a paid with extra features so a sustainable model.
4. ToS and Privacy Policy are summarized and clear.</p>
