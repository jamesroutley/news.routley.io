    <h1>PlanetScale increases plans to include billions of reads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Since the beginning of PlanetScale, our team has worked to provide our users with an incredibly powerful and fast serverless database at a reasonable price. In the past year, we’ve introduced our database branching feature, deploy requests, and better query statistics. We are just getting started and have some more game-changing features coming your way in March.</p><p>We’ve also heard your feedback about how our pricing is difficult to understand and hard for you to predict. Today we’re announcing a few changes that we think will make your life a lot easier. Starting March 1st we’ll be offering our customers up to 200x more reads across all pricing plans. Notably the Scaler plan now comes with <strong>100 billion</strong> reads included for $29/month.</p><p>This will enable you to use our product without worrying whether you’re going to see a giant bill at the end of the month. See our <a href="https://planetscale.com/pricing">pricing page</a> for more details.</p><p>We’re excited to have you on board as we continue to build the best database on the planet.</p></div></div></div></div>
