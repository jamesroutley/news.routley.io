    <h1>Has the CIA Done More Harm Than Good?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Donovan was an adept publicist, but what mattered most, in the end, was that he was good, or lucky, when it came to hiring people. Despite the “pale, male, and Yale” stereotype, the O.S.S. was somewhat more diverse than other units, and certainly more eclectic. Among its ranks were Ralph Bunche, Herbert Marcuse, and Julia Child. Many of its officers moved straight to the new C.I.A. Most consequentially, perhaps, four future directors of the C.I.A. were O.S.S. veterans: Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, William Colby, and William Casey. Each seems to have had glory-day memories of the O.S.S., which is to say that each, in various ways, was afflicted with what a general in Army intelligence called “the screwball Donovan effect.” Casey, who put a picture of Donovan on his wall, said of his old boss, “We all glowed in his presence.” Wild Bill lost the bureaucratic fight but won the personnel and mythology wars.</p><p>And, of course, the agency found customers and collaborators in the White House. There was no mention of covert action in the law that chartered the C.I.A., but Presidents—starting with Truman—began using it that way. One of the agency’s first operations involved meddling in the 1948 Italian election, to insure the victory of the Christian Democrats. The subsidies and outright bribery of Italian politicians, some of them on the far, far right, continued into the nineteen-seventies.</p><p>Almost from its creation, though, there was a sense that something about the C.I.A. was off. The split between covert action and intelligence gathering and analysis was part of it. The director of the agency was also supposed to be the leader of U.S. intelligence as a whole, but, invariably, the person in the job seemed more invested in preëminence than in coördination. That setup remained in place until the establishment of the O.D.N.I., in 2004, a move that thus far has mostly continued a tradition of trying to deal with the C.I.A.’s dysfunction by setting up ever more agencies, offices, and centers. (The N.S.A. was established, in 1952, in response to a series of cryptography-related failures.) “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Ashes-History-Tim-Weiner/dp/0307389006/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1BU2JN2INNNA3&amp;keywords=Legacy+of+Ashes&amp;qid=1666282782&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjM0IiwicXNhIjoiMi4wMiIsInFzcCI6IjIuMTYifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=legacy+of+ashes%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Ashes-History-Tim-Weiner/dp/0307389006/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1BU2JN2INNNA3&amp;keywords=Legacy+of+Ashes&amp;qid=1666282782&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjM0IiwicXNhIjoiMi4wMiIsInFzcCI6IjIuMTYifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=legacy+of+ashes%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Ashes-History-Tim-Weiner/dp/0307389006/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1BU2JN2INNNA3&amp;keywords=Legacy+of+Ashes&amp;qid=1666282782&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjM0IiwicXNhIjoiMi4wMiIsInFzcCI6IjIuMTYifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=legacy+of+ashes%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Legacy of Ashes</a>,” Tim Weiner’s 2008 history of the C.I.A.—and still an invaluable overview—takes its title from a lament by Eisenhower about what he’d be leaving his successors if the “faulty” structure of American intelligence wasn’t changed. Since Weiner’s book was published, the ashes, and the agencies, have only been piling up.</p><p>Zegart’s “Spies, Lies, and Algorithms” aims to bring that history to the present. Zegart has served as an adviser to intelligence agencies, and she provides a decent guide to our current bureaucracy. Throughout, her book is clear and well organized—maybe a little too well organized, one feels, after taking in the “Seven Deadly Biases” of intelligence analysis, the “Four Main Adversaries” and the “Five Types of Attack” in the crypto area, and the “Three Words, Four Types” that define covert action. (The covert-action words, incidentally, are “influence,” “acknowledged,” and “abroad.”) Not a few paragraphs read like PowerPoint charts; contradictions are displayed without really being reckoned with. She observes that the balance between “hunting” and “gathering” seems off, but, in her telling, the fact that Presidents of both parties regularly turn to the C.I.A. for paramilitary and other covert tasks constitutes proof that doing so is part of the order of things. The impression she leaves is that if it all goes wrong, it’s because some checklist has been missed. One of the top priorities of U.S. intelligence today, she thinks, should be persuading tech companies to get with the program and help out. She moots the creation of yet another agency, to deal with <em>OSINT</em>—open-source intelligence.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><div data-testid="responsive-cartoon"><a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26979&#34;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26979" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Do you know how fast you’re going?

She depicts the Senate’s 2014 Torture Report, which detailed profound abuses in the C.I.A.’s so-called black sites, as a they-said, the-agency-said, who-knows case. She turns it into a parable about the problems with Congress—suggesting that, although the committee structure may have needed rejiggering, the moral compass of those involved in the program of torture was just fine.</p><p>Another new volume, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Question-Standing-History-CIA/dp/0192847961/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I46R4F7JUG08&amp;keywords=A+Question+of+Standing%3A+A+History+of+the+CIA&amp;qid=1666282808&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjAyIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=a+question+of+standing+a+history+of+the+cia%2Caps%2C74&amp;sr=8-1" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Question-Standing-History-CIA/dp/0192847961/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I46R4F7JUG08&amp;keywords=A+Question+of+Standing%3A+A+History+of+the+CIA&amp;qid=1666282808&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjAyIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=a+question+of+standing+a+history+of+the+cia%2Caps%2C74&amp;sr=8-1&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Question-Standing-History-CIA/dp/0192847961/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I46R4F7JUG08&amp;keywords=A+Question+of+Standing%3A+A+History+of+the+CIA&amp;qid=1666282808&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjAyIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=a+question+of+standing+a+history+of+the+cia%2Caps%2C74&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Question of Standing: A History of the CIA</a>” (Oxford), by Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Edinburgh, offers the insights of a more distant observer. He can be astute about how “false memories” of the O.S.S.’s accomplishments have led the C.I.A. astray. Part of his argument is that the agency has acted as if its influence depended on its standing with whoever is in the White House, thus motivating it to offer Presidents quick fixes that fix nothing. The net effect is to reduce its standing, and that of the U.S., with the public at home and abroad. But Jeffreys-Jones is prone to rash generalizations and pronouncements. He theorizes that, in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, George W. Bush’s national-security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, may have been susceptible to “war mongering” due to her status as “a descendant of slaves,” and that the working-class background of the C.I.A.’s director, George Tenet, made him more likely to vouch for the faulty intelligence on weapons of mass destruction used to justify the war. “Social mobility so often leads to conformity,” warns Jeffreys-Jones, himself the son of an academic historian.</p><p>During the Vietnam War, the C.I.A. had discouraging intelligence to offer, and, when successive Administrations didn’t want to hear it, focussed on being helpful by providing those supposedly quick fixes. That meant abetting a coup in 1963, spying on antiwar protesters, and launching the Phoenix Program, an anti-Vietcong campaign marked by torture and by arbitrary executions; in total, more than twenty thousand people were killed under Phoenix’s auspices.</p><p>Phoenix was run by William Colby, the O.S.S. alum, who was soon promoted to C.I.A. director. At lower levels, discontent about Vietnam fuelled leaks. In December, 1974, the journalist Seymour Hersh told the agency that he was about to publish a story in the <em>Times</em> exposing its domestic spying. Whether in a miscalculation or (as Jeffreys-Jones somewhat breathlessly speculates) as an act of personal expiation, Colby gave Hersh partial confirmation. Amid the scandals and the Congressional hearings that followed, Colby angered some of his colleagues, and Henry Kissinger, by laying bare even more. It emerged that, in 1973, Colby’s predecessor had asked senior agency officials to produce a list of things the C.I.A. had done that might have been unlawful. The resulting document, covering just the prior fifteen years, was known in-house as “The Family Jewels,” and was almost seven hundred pages long.</p><p>The question of how much it matters who works at the C.I.A. is a perennial one. The influence of Donovan’s acolytes shows that decisions about whom you recruit can, in a formative period or at a critical juncture, make a big difference. But, once an institutional culture has become entrenched, it can be easier to see how the institution shapes the people within it than vice versa.</p><p>“<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Wise-Gals-Changed-Future-Espionage/dp/0593328485/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TQQR83Y88JTW&amp;keywords=Wise+Gals%3A+The+Spies+Who+Built+the+CIA+and+Changed+the+Future+of+Espionage&amp;qid=1666282828&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjM5IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zOCIsInFzcCI6IjEuNTIifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=wise+gals+the+spies+who+built+the+cia+and+changed+the+future+of+espionage%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-1" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Wise-Gals-Changed-Future-Espionage/dp/0593328485/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TQQR83Y88JTW&amp;keywords=Wise+Gals%3A+The+Spies+Who+Built+the+CIA+and+Changed+the+Future+of+Espionage&amp;qid=1666282828&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjM5IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zOCIsInFzcCI6IjEuNTIifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=wise+gals+the+spies+who+built+the+cia+and+changed+the+future+of+espionage%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-1&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wise-Gals-Changed-Future-Espionage/dp/0593328485/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TQQR83Y88JTW&amp;keywords=Wise+Gals%3A+The+Spies+Who+Built+the+CIA+and+Changed+the+Future+of+Espionage&amp;qid=1666282828&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjM5IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zOCIsInFzcCI6IjEuNTIifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=wise+gals+the+spies+who+built+the+cia+and+changed+the+future+of+espionage%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wise Gals: The Spies Who Built the CIA and Changed the Future of Espionage</a>” (Putnam), by Nathalia Holt, comes at the question from a different angle. It’s about five women who worked for the early C.I.A.; three also worked at the O.S.S., and one, Eloise Page, began her career as Bill Donovan’s secretary. Holt is also the author of “Rise of the Rocket Girls,” about women in the early years of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and “The Queens of Animation,” about women at the Walt Disney Company. Her book contains fine material for a beautifully art-directed streaming series, with set pieces in postwar Paris, nineteen-fifties Baghdad, and nineteen-seventies Greece, where Page was the C.I.A.’s first woman station chief. It even has a framing device in the form of the “Petticoat Panel,” a working group of C.I.A. women that convened in 1953 to document their unequal pay and treatment. Holt quotes the transcript of the meeting at which the leadership of the agency summarily rejected their findings. Helms, the future director, says, “It is just nonsense for these gals to come on here and think that the government is going to fall apart because their brains aren’t going to be used to the maximum.” (In 1977, Helms was convicted of lying to Congress about the C.I.A.’s machinations in Chile.) What the book is not, unfortunately, is a coherent history of the C.I.A., of the era it depicts, or even of these women’s work.</p><p>Holt’s research does turn up evidence that Jane Burrell, one of her subjects, was the first C.I.A. officer to die in the line of duty, in a plane crash in France, in 1948, a fact that the agency itself apparently missed. Holt ends her book with a call for a star honoring Burrell to be added to the C.I.A.’s memorial wall. Of the hundred and thirty-seven officers represented there, she writes, forty-five died accidentally, the majority in plane crashes, meaning that Burrell’s case would be fairly typical. Burrell was on the return leg of a trip to Brussels, where she’d been sent to talk to war-crimes investigators about a mess the C.I.A. had created by relying on an agent who turned out to have worked with the S.S. and was now in custody. In that respect, too, Burrell, who had personally handled the agent, was typical of the C.I.A. (After Burrell vouched for him, the man was released.) The subject of the C.I.A.’s postwar relations with former Nazis—some of whom, like Reinhard Gehlen, it helped to install in West Germany’s new intelligence service—and with collaborationist émigré groups is, no doubt, a morass. Holt, alas, manages to make the story even more garbled than it has to be. In the end, she basically treats the whole sordid episode as a learning experience for the Gals.</p></div></div></div></div>
