<p>Before we close the year, we wanted to take a moment to reflect and look back on what we accomplished in 2022. This year continued to be a roller coaster ride of ups and downs, and we know how important it is to have something in life you can rely on. So, here at Firefox, we continued to focus on the features that mattered the most and meet you where you are at. If there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that Firefox will always deliver the best web experience wherever you are. </p>

<h2>Firefox 2022’s top features working for you</h2>



<p>Here’s a look at the features that helped you the most from the privacy features to the small but mighty features that help get you what you need. </p>



<h2>Delivering privacy features for you </h2>



<p>We know that what you do online is your business. So, we rolled out privacy features to make sure it stays that way.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Total Cookie Protection on default:</em></strong> In June, we rolled out Total Cookie Protection by default to all Firefox desktop users worldwide. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-tips/internet-safety-for-families-total-cookie-protection/">Total Cookie Protection</a> is Firefox’s one of strongest privacy protection to date, confining cookies to the site where they were created, thus preventing tracking companies from using these cookies to track your browsing from site to site. We end 2022 with Firefox the most private and secure major browser available across Windows, Mac and Linux.</li>



<li><strong><em>Making Private Browsing even easier:</em></strong> We added a new shortcut button where you can pin Private Browsing to your Windows desktop and quickly go to Private Browsing mode whenever you want. We also added a modern look and feel with a new logo and updated it so Private Browsing mode now defaults to dark theme, making it easier to know when you are in Private Browsing mode.</li>



<li><strong><em>HTTPS-only mode on Firefox Android and Firefox Focus: </em></strong>Insecure connections are not only a risk to your online security, they also reveal the full content of the websites you are browsing to anyone who can monitor your internet traffic, including your ISP. When HTTPS-Only Mode is enabled, Firefox will favor secure connections to the web by default for every website you visit. You can read more about HTTPS <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/privacy-security/https-protect/">here</a>. </li>
</ul>



<h2>Features that surprise and delight </h2>



<p>We had our share of surprises this year and in our quest to deliver the best online experience wherever you are, we released features that delighted us in how much of an impact it made in your life.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Filling out PDF forms just couldn’t get any easier:</em></strong> You know those PDF forms you receive either from your doctor or other service provider that you have to print out and send back to them? Now, you can write directly within those forms in the PDF editor. </li>



<li><strong><em>To be continued…where you last left off: </em></strong>Whether you’re browsing at your desk or your phone, you can easily pick up your last open tab between your devices with a Firefox Account. <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/signin">Sign up for a free Firefox Account</a> and access your saved passwords and tabs across devices. </li>



<li><strong><em>Picture-in-picture gets an upgrade:</em></strong> In 2019 we released<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/news-from-firefox-on-mobile-private-network-and-desktop/"> Picture-in-Picture</a> and it quickly became a favorite among users. Since its release we continued to improve it, first, by making it available across Windows, Mac and Linux, then making multiple Picture-in-Pictures (which coincidentally was a plus for<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/how-to-watch-winter-games-multiple-videos-firefox/"> sports enthusiasts</a> and multi-tasking parents), and this year with subtitles and captions. Whether you’re hard-of-hearing, a multi-tasker or a multilingual user, we have you covered with Picture-in-Picture subtitles. To learn more visit <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-picture-in-picture-rolls-out-subtitles/">here</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Removing the clutter from your history and tabs on Firefox Android and iOS: </strong>For clutter-free history, we’ve organized it for you in an intuitive way. One of the ways we’ve done this is grouping by the original item, for example if you’re looking for shoes and you’ve looked at several models, you can find them grouped in one folder under your search term. We’ve also reduced the visual clutter in your history by removing duplicate sites.</li>
</ul>
