    <h1>A proto-pizza emerges from a fresco on a Pompeii wall</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whilst it looks like a pizza, this image from a Pompeian painting from 2000 years ago obviously can&#39;t be, since some of the most characteristic ingredients are missing, namely tomatoes and mozzarella. However, as shown by a first iconographic analysis of a still life fresco, which emerged recently as part of the new excavations in the inula 10 of the Regio IX in Pompeii, what was represented on the wall of an ancient Pompeian house could be a distant ancestor of the modern dish, elevated to the status of a World Heritage element in 2017 as the “traditional art of the Neapolitan pizza chef”. </p></div></div>
