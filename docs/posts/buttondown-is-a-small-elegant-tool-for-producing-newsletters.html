    <h2>The easiest way to <span><span id="verb">run</span></span> your newsletter.</h2>
    <p>Buttondown is a small, elegant tool for producing newsletters.</p>
    <p>The minimalist interface makes it easy for you to write great emails; the automation acts like the editorial
        assistant you wish you had, by checking for typos, broken links, or malformed images; the portable subscription
        widget makes it really easy to grow your audience from wherever you host your site.</p>
    <p>And then Buttondown gets out of your way! Buttondown&#39;s focus is on <em>pragmatism</em> over richness; it&#39;s not the most powerful application you&#39;ve ever used, but it may be the most delightful.</p>

    <div>
        
            <p><strong>Migrating your existing newsletter is free and easy!</strong></p></div>

    <h2>Built for people like you.</h2>
    <p>I had been writing my own <a target="_blank" href="https://arcana.computer" title="null">personal
        newsletter</a> for years but struggled with how
        other tools worked. Simple tasks like cleaning up Markdown, checking links, resizing images, and making sure the
        email looked right was a <em>huge hassle</em>. It took me away from doing the fun part: <strong>writing a great
            newsletter</strong>.</p>
    <p>I needed a simple, pleasant tool that took the annoying stuff off of my plate. I also wanted something that was
        for people like me: not a tool that was really built for big commercial sites or complex editorial teams, but
        for
        a small user who wanted to spend more time writing than dealing with an interface.</p>
    <h2>Just enough features.</h2>

            <h3>Run by a human</h3>
            <p>Buttondown isn&#39;t a team or a startup or a movement or whatever: it&#39;s just me. I respond to every email
                personally and deeply care about the problems I&#39;m trying to solve.</p>

            <h3>Privacy-first</h3>
            <p>Buttondown is GDPR-compliant — and then some. I don&#39;t collect any data about you (or your subscribers),
                and Buttondown is the only newsletter provider that starts with analytics turned off by default. (If you want lightweight open
                or link tracking, it&#39;s a single click away.)</p>

    <h2 id="your-newsletter-not-your-data">Your newsletter, your data.</h2>
    <p>Most email and newsletter tools operate under one of two business models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are venture-backed, forcing them to achieve scale and profitability at the expense of usability or
            privacy.
        </li>
        <li>They are designed for large corporations, who spend tens of thousands of dollars a month to create complex
            automation workflows based on subscriber actions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Buttondown is different. I&#39;ve built it specifically for folks who want a tool, rather than an ecosystem: I <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.buttondown.email/behind-the-scenes/running-costs" title="null">keep
        track of how I spend money</a> and offer customizable analytics options so you can be comfortable
        with the data you collect.</p>
