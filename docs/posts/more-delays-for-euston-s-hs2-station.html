    <h1>More delays for Euston&#39;s HS2 station</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>It may be several years before we know what the plans for Euson’s HS2 station will be, a report by the National Audit Office has warned.</p>

<p>In its periodic review of HS2’s progress, the National Audit Office (NAO) has examined the current state of the railway and the previous government’s sudden cancellation of the railway north of Birmingham.</p>
<p>In London, the main focus is on the impact of the decision to delay work on <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/tag/euston-station/">Euston station</a> and seek a private company to build it while leaving a largely empty building site in the middle of London.</p>
<p>One of the oddities is that the station is now expected to be smaller, but the oversite development has been made larger, which raised the cost of building the station as it needed far larger foundation supports for the commercial development.</p>
<p>The NAO report says that the Department for Trade (<a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/tag/dft/">DfT</a>) has progressed with developing minimum requirements for the station and options for a new delivery model ahead of ministerial approval. However, it is at an earlier stage in considering how cost and risk will be transferred and what the long-term governance arrangements at Euston will be. The NAO says that DfT expects it may be several years before it can put all these arrangements in place.</p>

<p>One of the arguments is about accounting — where do the costs and profits go in the government spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Currently, all the costs fall on <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/tag/hs2/">HS2</a>, whereas the profits from the oversite development go to the Treasury. So although both are effectively arms of the government, the Treausry’s desire for a larger oversite development piled costs onto HS2 that it is not able to offset from the extra property sales. In fact, in a previous <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/high-speed-two-euston.pdf">report</a>, HS2 estimated that the extra structural costs imposed on it to support the over-site development exceeded their budget for the station.</p>
<p>That put HS2 in a situation where its costs rose, but its income didn’t—and made Euston station, while more expensive than planned, also look worse than it really was. That’s the sort of issue that’s fixed by letting HS2 keep the income it creates with the commercial development. It’s an issue of financial bookkeeping, not construction.</p>
<p>Although Euston station is currently designated a private development, the report notes that public funding may be needed to complete some early works to avoid later delays and higher costs.</p>
<p>Of particular note was the <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/government-set-to-approve-1-billion-tunnels-for-hs2-euston-link-72203/">recent suggestion</a> that it would make sense to start tunnelling from Old Oak Common to Euston as soon as possible and get that part of the work out of the way. That may also open the potential to use the tunnel for delivery logistics during the station construction, reducing the disturbance for Camden residents.</p>
<p>There’s no date in the report for when Euston will open.</p>

<p>Outside London, the report mainly focuses on the impact of the cancellation of Phase 2 of the railway.</p>
<p>The report notes that the previous government’s decision was taken without discussing the issue with either HS2 or other rail organisations, leaving them scrambling to work out what had just happened. HS2 now estimates that closing down the cancelled phase 2 of the railway will take three years to complete at a cost of up to £100 million, as HS2 has an obligation to return land it had started preparation works on to its original state.</p>
<p>The report also warns that the cutback railway will not be able to address capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line north of Birmingham, and even current plans to upgrade the railway without HS2 mean it’s likely to be at full capacity by the middle of the 2030s.</p>
<p>In that situation, the NAO report notes that the railways will need to start “managing demand” for the services — which is code for higher prices.</p>

<p>In effect, the cancellation of HS2’s Phase 2 north of Birmingham will result in people paying higher fares for an inferior service, while passengers travelling south will find themselves arriving at Old Oak Common instead of the centre of London until a decision is taken to build Euston station.</p>
