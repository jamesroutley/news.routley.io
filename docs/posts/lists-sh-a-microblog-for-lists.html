        <h2>Publish your posts with one command</h2>
        <p>
            When your post is ready to be published, copy the file to our server with a familiar
            command:
        </p>
        <pre>scp ~/blog/*.txt lists.sh:/</pre>
        <p>note: if using openssh v9+, also supply the `-O` flag.</p>
        <p>We&#39;ll either create or update the lists for you.</p>

        <h2>Terminal workflow without installation</h2>
        <p>
            Since we are leveraging tools you already have on your computer
            (<code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>), there is nothing to install.
        </p>
        <p>
            This provides the convenience of a web app, but from inside your terminal!

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I love writing lists.  I think restricting writing to a set of lists can really
            help improve clarity in thought.  The goal of this blogging platform is to make it
            simple to use the tools you love to write and publish lists.  There is no installation,
            signup is as easy as SSH&#39;ing into our CMS, and publishing content is as easy as
            copying files to our server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another goal of this microblog platform is to satisfy my own needs.  I like to
            write and share lists with people because I find it&#39;s one of the best way to disseminate
            knowledge.  Whether it&#39;s a list of links or a list of paragraphs, writing in lists is
            very satisfying and I welcome you to explore it on this site!
        </p>
        <p>
            Other blogging platforms support writing lists, but they don&#39;t
            <span>emphasize</span> them.  Writing lists is pretty popular
            on Twitter, but discoverability is terrible.  Other blogging platforms focus on prose,
            but there really is nothing out there catered specifically for lists ... until now.
