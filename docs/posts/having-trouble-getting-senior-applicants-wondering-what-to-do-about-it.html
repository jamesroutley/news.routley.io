    <h1>Ask HN: Having trouble getting senior applicants, wondering what to do about it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>We&#39;re a fairly typical run-of-the-mill mid-size enterprise software vendor trying to hire for fully-remote SWEs in the &#34;DevOps&#34; software space (Linux, containers, k8s, yadda yadda). We post in the usual places including Who&#39;s Hiring but we haven&#39;t even managed to backfill a retirement from six months ago, and we&#39;re junior-heavy already. Benefits and salary are good (though salary isn&#39;t posted in the ad), and the people are great, though the work requires a reasonably deep understanding of the underlying platforms which a lot of people seem to dislike.<p>I&#39;m wondering if the work being a higher percentage non-code is what&#39;s causing us trouble, if we&#39;re just rubbish at hiring in general, or if it&#39;s something else.</p><p>What&#39;s everyone else&#39;s experience attracting applications from senior talent in this market, and what is everyone doing to increase their attractiveness?</p><p>Current hiring process:</p><pre><code>  - Resume screened by in-house recruiter
  - 30m call with them
  - Resume passed up to engineering
  - Hour-long call with hiring manager (typically the engineering manager of the team the candidate would join)
  - Take-home technical assignment (~4h) or similar at candidate&#39;s choosing
  - Presentation of technical assignment to the team
  - Offer</code></pre></td></div></div>
