You won&#39;t get useless listicles because we&#39;ll never crawl them. Relevant urls are harvested from HN, StackOverflow, programmer Reddit, and a few others. Page content comes mostly from the Common Crawl project.</p><p>The limited, but awesome, features in this first release are:</p><p>- Expressions! Experience the power of Elasticsearchâ€™s Simple Query Strings.</p><p>- REST API. Just change &#39;text/plain&#39; to `application/json` in the above alias.</p><p>- CLI. Just use curl in the terminal. Simple as.</p><p>HackerNews, StackOverflow, Arxiv abstracts, 2M Github repos, and programmer Reddit (up to 2020) are being indexed right now. There&#39;s much more to come in the next few months.</p><p>I&#39;d love to hear your questions, comments and suggestions in the comments below.</p></td></div></div>
