<h3 id="wolfram-demonstrations-project">Wolfram Demonstrations Project</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Demonstrations Project</a> offers more than 12 thousand interactive Wolfram Language Demonstrations in varying fields, including over two hundred <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/topic.html?topic=Astronomy&amp;limit=20">astronomy Demonstrations</a>. Manipulate and learn from unique Demonstrations like the following.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ViewOfOurSolarSystem/">View of Our Solar System</a></b><b><br/></b>By: Becky Johnsen</p>
<p>Johnsen’s Demonstration explores the relative distances between the Sun, planets and the dwarf planet Pluto. All bodies are shown larger than scale size but in correct relative proportion except for the Sun and Pluto (for aesthetic reasons).</p>

<p><b><a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PhasesOfPlanets/">Phases of Planets</a></b><b><br/></b>By: Jeff Bryant</p>
<p>Like the Moon, planets can also have phases. Bryant’s Demonstration offers a view of Mercury, Venus and Earth when viewed from any of these three planets. Planets in inferior orbits undergo complete phase changes like the Moon when viewed from a planet with a superior orbit. Planets in superior orbits only go though minor changes in phase when viewed from a planet with an inferior orbit.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SolarAndLunarEclipses/">Solar and Lunar Eclipses</a></b><b><br/></b>By: Jeff Bryant</p>
<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon’s shadow moves across the face of the Earth. Similarly, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow moves over the Moon. Bryant’s Demonstration allows you to see a model of solar and lunar eclipses by adjusting the position and distance of the Moon.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/LifeCycleOfAStar/">Life Cycle of a Star</a></b><b><br/></b>By: Allison Jung</p>
<p>Stars evolve from birth to death much as animals or plants do. New stars form in stellar nebulae, made of clouds of plasma, hydrogen and helium. The lifetime of a star varies according to its mass; more massive stars have shorter lifespans than average-sized stars. The dividing line between the two types is around eight times the mass of the Sun. Jung’s Demonstration shows the life cycles of stars by adjusting an average and massive star’s evolutions.</p>

In his book <em>Predicting the Eclipse: A Multimillennium Tale of Computation</em>, Stephen Wolfram discusses the history of studying eclipses, using the April 8 North American eclipse as a case study, and the impact of this work on the development of science and technology, from witnessing the stars to soaring among them.</p>
