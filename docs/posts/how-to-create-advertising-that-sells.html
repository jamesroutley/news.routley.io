<h2>An Advertisement by Ogilvy &amp; Mather</h2>

<p>I thought this advertisement, written by David Ogilvy many years ago as a promotional advertisement for Ogilvy &amp; Mather was a 
brilliant
case of &#34;tell more sell more.&#34; Very believable. Very credible.</p>

<p>I have ignored some of the original format (it was originally 4 columns wide). If you&#39;d like to see the 
original format, just <a href="http://lannigan.org/images_archive/Ogilvy_and_Mather_Advertisement.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>


<h2>How to Create Advertising that <span>Sells</span></h2>

<address>by David Ogilvy</address>

<p><b>Ogilvy &amp; Mather has created over $1,480,000,000 worth of advertising, and spent $4,900,000 tracking the results.</b></p>
<p><b>Here, with all the dogmatism of brevity, are 38 of the things we have learned.</b></p>





<p><b>1. The most important decision.</b> We have learned that the effect of your advertising on your sales depends more on this decision than 
on any other: <span>How should you position your product?</span></p>
<p>Should you position SCHWEPPES as a soft drink듪r as a mixer?</p>
<p>Should you position DOVE as a product for dry skin or as a product which gets hands really clean?</p>
<p>The results of your campaign depend less on how we write your advertising than on how your product is positioned. It follows that 
positioning should be decided before the advertising is created.</p>
<p>Research can help. Look before you leap.</p>

<p><b>2. Large promise.</b> The second most important decision is this: what should you promise the customer? A promise is not a claim, 
or a theme, or a slogan. It is a <span>benefit for the consumer.</span></p>
<p>It pays to promise a benefit which is unique and competitive. And the product must deliver the benefit you promise.</p>
<p>Most advertising promises <span>nothing</span>. It is doomed to fail in the marketplace.</p>
<p>&#34;Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement&#34;듭aid Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p><b>3. Brand image.</b> Every advertisement should contribute to the complex symbol which is the brand image. Ninety-five percent 
of all advertising is created <span>ad hoc</span>. Most products lack any consistent image from one year to another.</p>
<p>The manufacturer who dedicates his advertising to building the most sharply defined personality for his brand gets the 
largest share of the market.</p>

<p><b>4. Big ideas.</b> Unless your advertising is built on a BIG IDEA it will pass like a ship in the night.</p>
<p>It takes a BIG IDEA to jolt the consumer out of his indifference듮o make him <span>notice</span> your advertising, 
<span>remember</span> it and <span>take action</span>.</p>
<p>Big ideas are usually simple ideas. Said Charles Kettering, the great General Motors inventor: &#34;This problem, when solved, will be simple.&#34;</p>
<p>BIG SIMPLE IDEAS are not easy to come by. They require genius드nd midnight 
oil. A truly big one can be continued for 
twenty years듧ike our Eye patch for Hathaway shirts.</p>

<p><b>5. A first-class ticket.</b> It pays to give most products an image of quality드 first-class ticket.</p>
<p>Ogilvy &amp; Mather has been conspicuously successful in doing this듡or Pepperidge, Hathaway, Mercedes-Benz, 
Schweppes, Dove and others.</p>
<p>If your advertising looks ugly, consumers will conclude that your product is shoddy, and they will be less likely to buy it.</p>


<p><b>6. Don&#39;t be a bore.</b> Nobody was ever <span>bored</span> into buying a product. Yet most advertising is impersonal, detached, 
cold드nd dull.</p>
<p>It pays to <span>involve</span> the customer. </p>
<p>Talk to her like a human being. Charm her. Make her hungry. Get her to participate.</p>
<p><b>7. Innovate.</b> Start trends들nstead of following them. Advertising which follows a fashionable fad, or is 
imitative, is seldom successful</p>
<p>It pays to <span>innovate</span>, to blaze new trails. But innovation is risky unless you 
pre-test your innovation with 
consumers. Look before you leap.</p>
<p><b>8.  Be suspicious of awards.</b> The pursuit of creative awards seduces creative people from the pursuit of sales.</p>
<p>We have been unable to establish <span>any</span> correlation whatever between awards and sales.</p>
<p>At Ogilvy &amp; Mather we now give an annual award for the campaign which contributes the most to <span>sales</span>.</p>
<p>Successful advertising sells the product without drawing attention to itself. It rivets the consumer&#39;s attention on the 
<span>product</span></p>
<p>Make the product the hero of your advertising.</p>

<p><b>9. Psychological segmentation.</b> Any good agency knows how to position products for <span>demographic</span> segments of the 
market듡or men, for young children, for farmers in the South, etc.</p>
<p>But Ogilvy &amp; Mather has learned that it often pays to position products for <span>psychological</span> segments of the market.</p>
<p>Our Mercedes-Benz advertising is positioned to fit nonconformists who scoff at &#34;status symbols&#34; and reject flimflam 
appeals to snobbery.</p>

<p><b>10. Don&#39;t bury news.</b> It is easier to interest the consumer in a product when it is <span>new</span> than at any other point in its 
life. Many copywriters have a fatal instinct for burying news. This is why most advertising for new products fails to exploit the 
opportunity that genuine news provides.</p>
<p>It pays to launch your new product with a loud BOOM-BOOM.</p>

<p><b>11. Go the whole hog.</b> Most advertising campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of marketing objectives. They 
embrace the divergent views of too many executives. By attempting too many things, they achieve nothing.</p>
<p>It pays to boil down your strategy to one simple promise드nd go the whole hog in delivering that promise.</p>

<h3>What works best in television</h3>

<p><b>12.Testimonials:</b> Avoid irrelevant celebrities. Testimonial commercials arc almost always successful들f you make them credible.</p>
<p>Either celebrities or real people can be effective. But avoid <span>irrelevant</span> celebrities whose fame has no natural connection 
with your product or your customers. Irrelevant celebrities steal attention from your product.</p>

<p><b>13.Problem-solution (don&#39;t cheat!)</b> You set up a problem that the consumer recognizes.</p>
<p>Then you show how your product can solve that problem.</p>
<p>And you prove the solution.</p>
<p>This technique has always been above average in sales results, and it still is. But don&#39;t use it unless you can do so 
<span>without cheating</span>; the consumer isn&#39;t a moron, she is your wife.</p>

<p><b>14. Visual demonstrations.</b> If they are honest, visual demonstrations are generally effective in the marketplace.</p>
<p>It pays to <span>visualize your promise</span>. It saves time. It drives the promise home. It is memorable.</p>

<p><b>15. Slice of life.</b> These playlets are corny, and most copywriters detest them. But they have sold a lot of merchandise, 
and are still selling.</p>

<p><b>16.  Avoid logorrhea.</b> Make your <span>pictures</span> tell the story. What you show is more important than what you say.</p>
<p>Many commercials drown the viewer in a torrent of words. We call that logorrhea (rhymes with 
diarrhoea).</p>
<p>We have created some great commercials <span>without</span> words.</p>

<p><b>17. On-camera voice.</b> Commercials using on-camera voice do significantly better than commercials using voice-over.</p>

<p><b>18. Musical backgrounds.</b> Most commercials use musical backgrounds. However, on the average, musical backgrounds reduce 
recall of your commercial. Very few creative people accept this.</p>
<p>But we never heard of an agency using musical background under a new business presentation.</p>

<p><b>19. Stand-ups.</b> The stand-up pitch can be effective, if it is delivered with straightforward honesty.</p>

<p><b>20. Burr of singularity.</b> The average consumer now sees 20,000 commercials a year; poor dear.</p>
<p>Most of them slide off her memory like water off a duck&#39;s back.</p>
<p>Give your commercials a flourish of singularity, a burr that will stick in the consumer&#39;s mind. One such burr is the 
MNEMONIC DEVICE, or relevant symbol듧ike the crowns in our commercials for Imperial Margarine.</p>

<p><b>21. Animation &amp; cartoons.</b> Less than five percent of television commercials use cartoons or animation. They are less 
persuasive than live commercials.</p>
<p>The consumer cannot identify herself with the character in the cartoon. And cartoons do not invite belief.</p>
<p><span>However, Carson/Roberts, our partners in Los Angeles, tell us that animation can be helpful when you are talking to children.</span></p>
<p><span>They should know듮hey have addressed more than six hundred commercials to children.</span></p>

<p><b>22. Salvage commercials.</b> Many commercials which test poorly can be salvaged.</p>
<p>The faults revealed by the test can be corrected. We have doubled the effectiveness of a commercial simply by re-editing it</p>

<p><b>23.  Factual vs. emotional.</b> Factual commercials tend to be more effective than emotional commercials.</p>
<p>However, Ogilvy &amp; Mather has made some emotional commercials which have been successful in the marketplace. Among these 
are our campaigns for Maxwell House Coffee and Hershey&#39;s Milk Chocolate.</p>

<p><b>24. Grabbers.</b> We have found that commercials with an exciting opening hold their audience at a higher level than 
commercials which begin quietly.</p>

<h3>What works best in print</h3>

<p><b>25. Headlines.</b> On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body</p>
<p>It follows that, if you don&#39;t sell the product in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your money. That is 
why most Ogilvy &amp; Mather headlines include the brand name and the promise.</p>

<p><b>26. Benefit in headlines.</b> Headlines that promise a benefit sell more than those that don&#39;t.</p>

<p><b>27. News in headlines.</b> Time after time, we have found that it pays to inject genuine <span>news</span> into headlines.</p>
<p>The consumer is always on the lookout for new products, or new improvements in an old product, or new ways to use an old product.</p>
<p>Economists든ven Russian economists드pprove of this. They call it &#34;informative&#34; advertising. So do consumers.</p>

<p><b>28. Simple headlines.</b> Your headline should <span>telegraph</span> what you want to say들n simple language. Readers do not stop to 
decipher the meaning of obscure headlines.</p>

<p><b>29. How many words in a headline?</b> In headline tests conducted with the cooperation of a big department store, it was 
found that headlines of ten words or longer sold more goods than short headlines.</p>
<p>In terms of <span>recall</span> headlines between eight and ten words are most effective.</p>
<p>In <span>mail-order</span> advertising, headlines between six and twelve words get the most coupon returns.</p>
<p>On the average, long headlines sell more merchandise than short ones듣eadlines like our</p>
<p>&#34;At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.&#34;</p>

<p><b>30. Localize headlines.</b> In Local advertising it pays to include the name of the city in your headline.</p>

<p><b>31. Select your prospects.</b> When you advertise a product which is consumed only by a special group, it pays to &#34;flag&#34; 
that group in your headline -MOTHERS, BED-WETTERS, GOING TO EUROPE?</p>

<p><b>32. Yes, people read long copy.</b> Readership falls off rapidly up to fifty words, but drops very little between fifty and 
five hundred words. (This page contains 1909 words, and you are reading it.)</p>

<p>Ogilvy &amp; Mather has used long copy등ith notable success듡or Mercedes-Benz, Cessna Citation, Merrill Lynch and Shell 
gasoline.</p>
<p>&#34;The more you tell, the more you sell.&#34;</p>

<p><b>33. Story appeal in picture.</b> Ogilvy &amp; Mather has gotten notable results with photographs which suggest a story. The reader 
glances at the photograph and asks himself, &#34;What goes on here?&#34; Then he reads the copy to find out.</p>
<p>Harold Rudolph called this magic element &#34;story appeal.&#34; The more of it you inject into your photograph, the more people 
look at your advertisement.</p>
<p>It is easier said than done.</p>

<p><b>34. Before &amp; after.</b> Before and After advertisements are somewhat above average in attention value.</p>
<p>Any form of &#34;visualized contrast&#34; seems to work well.</p>

<p><b>35. Photographs vs. artwork.</b> Ogilvy &amp; Mather has found that photographs work belter than drawings드lmost 
invariably.</p>
<p>They attract more readers, generate more appetite appeal, are more believable, are better remembered, pull more 
coupons, and sell more merchandise.</p>

<p><b>36. Use captions to sell.</b> On the average, twice as many people read the captions under photographs as read the body copy.</p>
<p>It follows that you should never use a photograph without 
putting a caption under it; and each caption should be a 
miniature advertisement for the product듞omplete with brand name and promise.</p>

<p><b>37.  Editorial layouts.</b> Ogilvy &amp; Mather has had more success with editorial layouts than with. &#34;addy&#34; layouts.</p>
<p>Editorial layouts get higher readership than conventional advertisements.</p>

<p><b>38. Repeat your winners.</b> Scores of great advertisements have been discarded before they have begun to pay off.</p>
<p>Readership can actually increase with repetition듯p to five repetitions.</p>

<p>Is this all we know?</p>
<p>These findings apply to most categories of products. But not to all.</p>
<p>Ogilvy &amp; Mather has developed a separate and specialized body of knowledge on what makes for success in advertising 
<span>food products, tourist destinations, proprietary medicines, children&#39;s products and other classifications</span>.</p>
<p>But this special information is revealed only to the clients of Ogilvy &amp; Mather.</p>
