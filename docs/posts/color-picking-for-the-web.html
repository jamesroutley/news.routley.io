<p><span>05 Jul 2023</span></p><p>Recently, I was in the market for <a href="https://archivesoftomorrow.com/">a new color scheme</a>, which means I had to think about things like branding, how colors work together, and, most importantly, how the colors work well together <em>on the web, on a website</em>.</p>

<p>I’m starting to think I’m not very good with colors. I feel like I understand the theory, and maybe I understand colors in the context of, say, painting, or a specific mark (see: the handful of logos I’ve designed). But picking out a color scheme that works well as part of a website isn’t the same as picking colors the vibe well together, there’s so many other factors to consider!</p>

<p>Anyway, this isn’t a philosophical blog post, this is mostly a list of links. Here are some things I’ve used.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolers</a>: I think this site is so good for picking a range of colors that work well together. I like how you can go up or down a shade in a given range, too, when trying to select the right amount of contrast between colors. I’ve found this useful for when I need a full-ish rainbow (like 5 different colors) and I want them all to place nice with each other.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.happyhues.co/">Happy Hues</a>: This is my newest discovery, really aligned with the problem I expressed above. It’s a couple dozen really nice palettes that you can toggle through and see how they work on a real website, not just in theory.</li>
  <li><a href="https://randoma11y.com/">Random a11y</a>: I love some of these color combos and how you can keep generating them, and that they’re guaranteed to be accessibility-compliant. This is such a good way to get a duo-tone set together. I like lighter backgrounds though, so I wish there were some more pastel or nuanced-pale-color tones to work with.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mycolor.space/">mycolor.space</a>: I like that this works with a predetermined color (if you choose) and gives you a big range of ways to work with that color and its complementing colors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://paletton.com/">paletton</a>: I used to use this one a lot to pull together complementary colors in a duo or triad or tetrad combination, it’s like a super-sized colorpicker.</li>
  <li><a href="https://encycolorpedia.com/">encycolorpedia</a>: This is one I used to use religiously, or it’s close enough to the same concept. I like using this to analyze one color in particular, basically to check if the vibes are right for its intended purpose. There are a few similar sites like this, e.g. <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/">color-hex.com</a> and <a href="https://hexcolorpedia.com/">hexcolorpedia</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and one more bonus! For my last few projects, I’ve worked with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> and they have a nice, flexible <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors">palette</a> with ranges to choose from, so that makes things easy.</p>
