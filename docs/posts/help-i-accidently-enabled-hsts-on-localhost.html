Help! I accidently enabled HSTS–on localhost

<p>I ran into an issue after accidently enabling HSTS for a website on localhost. This was not an issue for the original website that was running in IIS and had a certificate configured. But when I tried to run an Angular app a little bit later on <code>http://localhost:4200</code> the browser redirected me immediately to <code>https://localhost</code>.</p>  <p>Whoops! That was not what I wanted in this case. </p>  <p>To fix it, you need to go the network settings of your browser, there are available at:</p>  <ul>   <li>chrome://net-internals/#hsts </li>    <li>edge://net-internals/#hsts </li>    <li>brave://net-internals/#hsts</li> </ul>  <p>Enter ‘localhost’ in the domain textbox under the <strong>Delete domain security policies</strong> section and hit <strong>Delete</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-QwQj2HOqm_w1HeOU0c1_4HoEmcGGGp1fCXX2RfA8Q7QHZpgZgIkzaXJgsrLwPC3Y0sRcTU1VNF3b8G5E-k_FjYMHgBcJt8p6MkMI_Y577G9uhvfTmegm8013QjSGm7hWfq0Uf0Pc6rfTi-fewkKlOf9QThgdQDDFe3nTCSXl6ZSosUidvmG3DQAAoULz/s2632/HSTS.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="869" data-original-width="2632" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-QwQj2HOqm_w1HeOU0c1_4HoEmcGGGp1fCXX2RfA8Q7QHZpgZgIkzaXJgsrLwPC3Y0sRcTU1VNF3b8G5E-k_FjYMHgBcJt8p6MkMI_Y577G9uhvfTmegm8013QjSGm7hWfq0Uf0Pc6rfTi-fewkKlOf9QThgdQDDFe3nTCSXl6ZSosUidvmG3DQAAoULz/s16000/HSTS.PNG"/></a></p></div>

A colleague asked me to take a look at the following code inside a test project:    My first guess would be that this code checks that the specified condition(the contains) is true for every element in the list.    This turns out not to be the case. The Assert.Collection expects a list of element inspectors, one for every item in the list. The first inspector is used to check the first item, the second inspector the second item and so on. The number of inspectors should match the number of elements in the list.   An example:     The behavior I expected could be achieved using the Assert.All method:

In the world of software engineering, the Lehman&#39;s Laws of Software Evolution are widely recognized as a fundamental framework for understanding how software systems evolve over time. These laws were introduced by British computer scientist, Meir Lehman, in the 1980s(!) in his paper “Programs, Life Cycles, and Laws of Software Evolution”, and they remain relevant to this day.   Lehman&#39;s Laws describe how software systems evolve and how they can be managed over their lifespan. In this blog post, we will explore these laws in detail and their significance in software development.   From the paper :     The first law of software evolution states that  software systems must evolve or they will become progressively less useful . This law recognizes that software is not static and unchanging, but instead must adapt and grow to meet changing user needs and technological advancements. Failure to evolve software systems can result in decreased usefulness or even obsolescence. This means
