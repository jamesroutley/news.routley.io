    <h1>Uber and Lyftâ€™s new road: Fewer drivers, thrifty riders and jittery investors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p data-type="paragraph">Uber<!-- --> Technologies Inc. and <!-- -->Lyft<!-- --> are recalibrating to a new reality: Investors are increasing the pressure to rein in hefty losses, riders are taking fewer trips as fares rise and drivers are still in short supply. </p><p data-type="paragraph">The average Uber and Lyft fare hit a record high in the U.S. last month, according to market-research firm YipitData, driven by the labor shortage and high gas prices. The companies collectively drew at least 20% fewer riders and posted 35% fewer trips in the first quarter than three years earlier, according to YipitData.</p></section></div></article></div>
