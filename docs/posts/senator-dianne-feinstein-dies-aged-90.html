She took on lighter duties upon her return and moved around the US Capitol using a wheelchair. She sometimes seemed confused during interviews, and in committee hearings or floor votes. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The BBC has reached out to Ms Feinstein&#39;s office for comment on her death. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Feinstein was well known as a vocal advocate for gun control measures, and an ardent supporter of the assault weapons ban signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier in life, she became San Francisco&#39;s mayor after her predecessor, George Mascone, and city councilman Harvey Milk were shot dead. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She later recounted rushing to Mayor Mascone&#39;s office and finding a bullet wound as she searched for his pulse - an experience she said left an indelible impression on her. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As a senator, Ms Feinstein was the first woman to chair the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, where she led a years-long review of the CIA&#39;s controversial interrogation programme of foreign terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The CIA&#39;s actions are a stain on our values and our history,&#34; she said at the time, adding that &#34;history will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and a willingness to face an ugly truth and say &#39;never again&#39;&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The review ultimately led to legislation barring the use of &#34;enhanced interrogation techniques&#34; such as waterboarding on terrorism suspects. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Feinstein was also the first woman to sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and first female chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a 2017 interview with CNN, she said that &#34;being a woman in our society even today is difficult&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I know it in the political arena,&#34; she said. &#34;We went from two women senators when I ran for office in 1992 to 24 today - and I know that number will keep climbing.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On Capitol Hill, she was known as a centrist willing to work with her Republican opponents - sometimes leading to criticism from the more left-leaning members of her own party. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>News of her death quickly reverberated around the halls of power in Washington DC, with tributes pouring in from colleagues on both sides of the US political spectrum. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Dianne Feinstein was an incredible public servant and an inspiration to many,&#34; said New Jersey Democrat Bonnie Watson Coleman.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In recent years, worries over her declining health and cognitive abilities led some to call for her retirement and starkly highlighted concerns over America&#39;s aging politicians. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In one widely circulated video, people around her could be heard imploring her to &#34;just say aye&#34; during a committee vote. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She is survived by a daughter, Katherine, who reportedly has held power of attorney over her mother&#39;s legal affairs amid mounting family tensions. Her husband, investment banker Richard Blum, died last year. </p></div></article></div></div>
