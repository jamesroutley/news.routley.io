<p><strong><em>Will Kyiv fall to Russian forces by April 2022?</em></strong></p>
<p>This question will resolve positively if it is publicly reported by at least three reputable media sources or from direct statements from at least four Permanent UNSC members that the majority of Kyiv&#39;s raions are under Russian military control by April 1, 2022.</p>

      <h3>Metaculus help: Predicting</h3>
      <p>Predictions are the heart of Metaculus. Predicting is how you contribute to the wisdom of the crowd, and how you earn points and build up your personal Metaculus track record.</p>
      <p>The basics of predicting are very simple: move the slider to best match the likelihood of the outcome, and click predict. You can predict as often as you want, and you&#39;re encouraged to change your mind when new information becomes available.</p>
      <p>The displayed score is split into <em>current points</em> and <em>total points</em>. Current points show how much your prediction is worth <em>now</em>, whereas total points show the combined worth of all of your predictions over the lifetime of the question. The scoring details are <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#howscore">available on the FAQ</a>.</p>
