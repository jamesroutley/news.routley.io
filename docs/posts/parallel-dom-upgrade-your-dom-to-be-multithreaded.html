                        What are you talking about ? iFrames suck!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        iFrames were once insecure and often used for nefarious purposes. Browser makers have introduced many new security requirements as either defaults or even removed the older insecure ways entirely. The technology has advanced significantly. Some of the security features PDom uses to secure the iframes:

                    <div><p>
                    
                    In browser script injection:</p></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Why not use Web Workers (or friends) instead of Iframes ? 
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Web workers do not have access to DOM. They are great for CPU intensive tasks, but not for DOM manipulation. PDom uses a dedicated CPU process for javascript and DOM manipulation.

                        What browsers are currently supported ?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Since we depend on the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header being honored by the browser, we are currently limited to <b>Chrome</b> and <b>Edge</b>.
                        </p></div>

                        This is great! But, I don&#39;t trust a third party domain (Think polyfill.io ...). Can I host this myself ?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Absolutely! The whole thing is open source, and we have included <a href="#self-hosted">documentation</a> on how to host this yourself. We have also built a Vercel template for you to quickly deploy the service if you use Vercel.
