    <h1>UHaul Data Breach</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I just received this email a few days ago:<p>We are writing to inform you of an incident that involved some of your information. We are providing this notice to explain the incident and measures we have taken, and also to provide some steps you can take in response.</p><p>What Happened?
We detected a compromise of two unique passwords that were used to access a customer contract search tool that allows access to rental contracts for U-Haul customers. The search tool cannot access payment card information; no credit card information was accessed or acquired. Upon identifying the compromised passwords, we promptly changed the passwords to prevent any further unauthorized access to the search tool and started an investigation. Cybersecurity experts were engaged to identify the contracts and data that were involved. The investigation determined an unauthorized person accessed the customer contract search tool and some customer contracts. None of our financial, payment processing or U-Haul email systems were involved; the access was limited to the customer contract search tool.</p><p>What Information Was Involved?
On August 1, 2022, our investigation determined some rental contracts were accessed between November 5, 2021, and April 5, 2022. After an in-depth analysis, our investigation determined on September 7, 2022, the accessed information includes your name and driver&#39;s license or state identification number</p><p>Well its a nice email to wake up to.
The first time I ever rent a uHaul and my DL is leaked.</p></div></div>
