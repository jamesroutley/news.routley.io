    <h1>The Effect of Noise on Sleep</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> <p> <time datetime="2025-06-26T00:00:00.000Z"> Jun 26, 2025 </time> </p> <h2>The effect of noise on sleep</h2>  <hr/> </div>  <p>How detrimental is noise for your sleep? Andrej Karpathy raised this exact question in a <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1931426322536132767">tweet</a>. The answer to Karpathy’s question is, well, <em>empirical</em>, with a rough experiment suggested by <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1932020390013862038">Paul Graham</a>:</p>

<p>Consumer devices like Apple Watch measure many sleep metrics, including <a href="https://www.empirical.health/metrics/deep-sleep-percent">sleep stages</a>,
<a href="https://www.empirical.health/metrics/hrv">heart rate variability</a>, and <a href="https://www.empirical.health/metrics/heart-rate">heart rate</a>.
The Apple Watch’s microphone also measures noise in fine-grained frequency, which can be filtered down to times when you’re asleep.
Given that we’re a medical practice that makes extensive use of wearable data to improve patient care, and advance the science
of <a href="https://www.empirical.health/blog/dont-die-of-a-heart-attack/">heart health</a> (where sleep and sleep apnea are major inputs), so we were curious to quantify the actual effect of noise on sleep.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: across every metric we examined, bedroom noise shows a consistent, dose-dependent impact on sleep quality.</strong></p>

<h2 id="noise-vs-rem--deep-sleep"><a href="#noise-vs-rem--deep-sleep">Noise vs REM &amp; deep sleep</a></h2>
<p>Our panel shows a steady, almost linear erosion of REM minutes from the low-40 dB range through the mid-50s. Once noise climbs past roughly 58–60 dB (about the loudness of normal conversation), the line kinks sharply downward—REM time falls by an additional ~15 minutes in that single step. Deep-sleep minutes follow a similar pattern, holding fairly steady below 50 dB, slipping modestly through the low-50s, then dropping 6–7 minutes once the room crosses that same upper-50s threshold. Taken together, the curves suggest a threshold effect near 60 dB where restorative stages start to collapse rather than decline gradually.</p>
<h2 id="sleep-duration"><a href="#sleep-duration">Sleep Duration</a></h2>
<p>Total sleep duration mirrors the stage-specific trends: nights under 55 dB hover around 6¼–6½ hours, but once noise breaches the upper-50s the average night shortens by nearly an hour—nearly all of it coming from REM and deep stages rather than lighter sleep.</p>
<h2 id="heart-rate--hrv-during-sleep"><a href="#heart-rate--hrv-during-sleep">Heart rate &amp; HRV during sleep</a></h2>
<p>Physiology responds in the opposite direction. Sleeping heart rate remains flat in the quietest bins, rises a beat or two in the low-50s, then jumps 4–5 bpm in the high-50s/low-60s. Sleeping HRV shows the mirror image: minor dips below 50 dB, followed by a pronounced 15–20 % drop once noise crosses that same ~60 dB mark. These shifts imply the body’s overnight stress load spikes at the same acoustic threshold that disrupts sleep architecture.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-health-sleep-score"><a href="#empirical-health-sleep-score">Empirical Health sleep score</a></h2>
<p>Last, our own composite score—a weighted mix of duration, stages, and physiology—tracks the individual metrics closely. Scores stay in the high-70s below 55 dB but slide into the mid-60s once noise exceeds ~60 dB, confirming that the upper-50s/low-60s zone is the pivotal point where overall sleep quality degrades quickly.</p>

<p>The red dashed lines mark the single largest step-down for each series, and most of them cluster in a narrow band around 55–60 dB. Below that range, incremental quieting still buys modest gains, but above it the penalties accelerate: REM and deep minutes shrink by roughly a quarter, total sleep contract by about an hour, HR climbs by several beats per minute, and HRV flattens out.</p>
<p>Practically, that suggests a <strong>threshold effect</strong>: keeping bedroom sound levels beneath the <strong>low-60s dB</strong> (roughly the volume of normal conversation) is a pivotal target for preserving restorative sleep stages and the physiologic calm that goes with them.</p>  </div></div>
