<p>As a child I felt really alone and misunderstood. As I grew up I gravitated to those things that let me work alone. I never understood the managers or leaders or coaches. I considered these people totally useless, and perhaps even worse – like parasites. </p>



<p>All these people did was get in my way.  They did not DO anything.  I never wanted to be a leader or a manager or a coach, just leave me alone to do my thing. I was actually able to do things. </p>



<p>This shifted for me in my last job in consulting. I worked at a really fantastic although completely homogenous consulting company – I was one of two or three women out of 150 consultants – not to mention  race, gender and sexual orientation diversity.  However, most of the people there were incredibly intelligent and accomplished. They like me, after a career of running things, they just wanted to just be left alone to do their thing. </p>



<p>I had a midlife crisis (I may still be having one).  I did not want to run anything – I just wanted to be alone and do my technical thing. In the software world -we call this an individual contributor/IC. So I did that – at this wonderful consulting company. </p>



<p>What I found was that I could sit there and do my technical thing BUT SADLY the overall project would be a dumpster fire. This was bad for me in two respects: </p>



<ol><li>if my projects kept failing then no one would hire the company and I would be out of a job </li><li>it was unpleasant for me personally to work on projects that were failing </li></ol>



<p>Why were there dumpster fires? I noticed that the technical directors I worked with were: </p>



<ol><li>unable to pick the correct items to work on</li><li>stay focused and make progress on those items</li><li>have their team contributing meaningfully to forward progress</li><li>communicate that progress to the client</li></ol>



<p>I did not want to work on any more dumpster fire projects – so I decided to go back into management. I am really good at this.I think my secret skill is that I know what is important to work on. </p>



<p>How do you develop this skill? I think it is a type of wisdom. Through practice and intention. Your intention has to be – I want to build something that people happily use. Believe it or not this is often not the intention when working on technical projects (even for myself). </p>



<p>When I was technical directing projects – it felt really good. It felt good to see this progress, to see that clients understood this progress. </p>



<p>What is management vs leadership? I read an HBR article that said management is the ability to manage complexity and leadership is the ability to manage change. I was engaged in a management role – I was managing complexity. </p>



<p>I moved into a new position at a different company about 6 months ago.  I offered my skills at managing complexity and optimizing systems but people did not care really about this. I wondered what was I going to do?  Change… organizations these days are constantly changing. I think this is what it means to be post modern. You can never be the same as you were yesterday, your organization cannot be the same as it was yesterday. </p>



<p>How do you manage this change? You lead. </p>



<p>What does it mean to lead? You collect yourself in integrity and start steering the ship. It can be a small dingy of one or a massive ocean liner. But the leader is just looking into the wind not back at the passengers.</p>
