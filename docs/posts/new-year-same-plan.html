    <h1>new year, same plan</h1>

<p>Some months ago, the bill from GCE for hosting this blog jumped from nearly nothing to far too much for what it is, so I moved provider and needed to write a blog post to test it all.</p>

<p>I could have figured out why my current provider hiked the price. Presumably I was Holding It Wrong and with just a few grip adjustments I could get the price dropped. But if someone mysteriously starts charging you more money, and there are other people who offer the same service, why would you stay?</p>

<p>This has not been a particularly easy year, for a variety of reasons. But here I am at the end of it, and beyond a few painful mistakes that in retrospect I did not have enough information to get right, I made mostly the same decisions I would again. There were a handful of truly wonderful moments.</p>

<p>So the plan for 2023 is the same: keep the kids intact, and make programming more fun.</p>

<p>There is also the question of Twitter. It took me a few years to develop the skin to handle the generally unpleasant environment. (I can certainly see why almost no old Twitter employees used their product.) The experience recently has degraded, there are still plenty of funny tweets, but far less moments of interesting content. Here is a recent exception, but it is notable because it&#39;s the first time in weeks I learned anything from twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/lrocket/status/1608883621980704768">https://twitter.com/lrocket/status/1608883621980704768</a>. I now find more new ideas hiding in HN comments than on Twitter.</p>

<p>Many people I know have sort-of moved to Mastodon, but it has a pretty horrible UX that is just enough work that I, on the whole, don&#39;t enjoy it much. And the fascinating insights don&#39;t seem to be there yet, but I&#39;m still reading and waiting. On the writing side, it might be a good idea to lower the standards (and length) of my blog posts to replace writing tweets. But maybe there isn&#39;t much value in me writing short notes anyway, are my contributions as fascinating as the ones I used to sift through Twitter to read? Not really.</p>

<p>So maybe the answer is to give up the format entirely. That might be something new for 2023.</p>

<p>Here is something to think about for the new year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DAVID BRANCACCIO: There&#39;s a little sweet moment, I&#39;ve got to say, in a very intense book– your latest– in which you&#39;re heading out the door and your wife says what are you doing? I think you say– I&#39;m getting– I&#39;m going to buy an envelope.</p>

<p>KURT VONNEGUT: Yeah.</p>

<p>DAVID BRANCACCIO: What happens then?</p>

<p>KURT VONNEGUT: Oh, she says well, you&#39;re not a poor man. You know, why don&#39;t you go online and buy a hundred envelopes and put them in the closet? And so I pretend not to hear her. And go out to get an envelope because I&#39;m going to have a hell of a good time in the process of buying one envelope.
I meet a lot of people. And, see some great looking babes. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And, and ask a woman what kind of dog that is. And, and I don&#39;t know. The moral of the story is, is we&#39;re here on Earth to fart around.
And, of course, the computers will do us out of that. And, what the computer people don&#39;t realize, or they don&#39;t care, is we&#39;re dancing animals. You know, we love to move around. And, we&#39;re not supposed to dance at all anymore.</p>
