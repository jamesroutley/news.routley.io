    <h1>XMPP: The Gem of Instant Messaging</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Instant messaging is dominated by mainstream apps today, each with their own ecosystems, closed protocols, and business models based on data collection and user engagement. In this landscape, XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) might seem like a relic, yet it offers a powerful, open, and privacy-respecting alternative that deserves more recognition. Despite its versatility and potential, XMPP has struggled to gain the popularity it deserves. Here, we&#39;ll explore why XMPP hasn&#39;t reached widespread adoption, why it remains relevant, and how it might be the best option for those seeking a flexible, secure, and open-source messaging tool.</p>
<h3>What makes XMPP unique?</h3>
<p>XMPP isn&#39;t just a messaging protocol; it&#39;s a foundational technology that provides decentralized, extensible communication. Built on XML, it supports a variety of messaging types (text, voice, video, and even file transfer) without being locked to a single platform or app. Since it&#39;s an open protocol, anyone can run their own XMPP server, maintain complete control of their data, and use any compatible client.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">the wide array of XMPP clients</a> available across all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, KaiOS), users have a choice to pick the interface and features that suit them best. XMPP has a rich ecosystem of clients that cater to different preferences, from simple, lightweight clients to those packed with advanced features. And with <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">a plethora of servers</a> that can be self-hosted, including open-source options like <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> and <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a>, setting up a personal or community server is accessible, even for those with modest technical skills.</p>
<h3>Security and privacy with XMPP</h3>
<p>One of XMPP&#39;s major strengths is its potential for secure communication. Out of the box, XMPP can already secure messages with TLS encryption. However, it becomes much more versatile when you activate specific XEPs (XMPP Extension Protocols). Here are some that make XMPP even more robust and useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OMEMO (XEP-0384)</strong>: provides end-to-end encryption that ensures messages can&#39;t be read by anyone except the intended recipient(s), offering privacy similar to Signal&#39;s protocol.</li>
<li><strong>MAM (Message Archive Management, XEP-0313)</strong>: allows message synchronization across devices by enabling server-side message archiving, making it possible to retain and access message history across different clients without sacrificing privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Message Carbons (XEP-0280)</strong>: enables message synchronization across multiple devices by copying outgoing and incoming messages, ensuring conversations are consistent across all connected clients.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP File Upload (XEP-0363)</strong>: enables file sharing over XMPP by allowing users to upload files to a server via HTTP, making them accessible through secure links. This XEP facilitates sharing images, documents, and other files easily and securely within chats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these XEPs provide a way to make XMPP a secure, synchronized, and feature-rich messaging system across devices, rivaling what proprietary apps offer without requiring you to give up control or trust a third-party service.</p>
<h3>Why doesn&#39;t XMPP have more success?</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Lack of awareness</strong></h4>
<p>XMPP doesn&#39;t have the marketing muscle that proprietary platforms enjoy. As a protocol, it doesn&#39;t have a single corporation pushing it forward. Instead, it relies on a community of developers and volunteers. This means the average person has likely never heard of XMPP, let alone considered using it.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Fragmentation and inconsistency</strong></h4>
<p>With XMPP, the decentralized nature can be both a strength and a weakness. Unlike a centralized service, XMPP&#39;s decentralized model means that different clients and servers can have varying levels of compatibility depending on which XEPs are supported. For users, this can create friction and a sense of inconsistency, particularly when switching between clients or servers that may not fully implement the same extensions. However, <a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_24">XMPP Summits</a> help developers to improve compatibility between software.</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Complexity and user experience</strong></h4>
<p>While setting up and running an XMPP server can be straightforward for someone with technical skills, it&#39;s not as effortless as signing up for a mainstream app. For the non-tech-savvy user, terms like &#34;XEP&#34;, &#34;OMEMO&#34;, and even &#34;server&#34; may feel overwhelming. XMPP&#39;s vast configurability is appealing to those who enjoy flexibility, but it can be daunting for users accustomed to more user-friendly apps. If you don&#39;t want to install an XMPP server, <a href="https://providers.xmpp.net/">just join an existing one</a>!</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Network effect</strong></h4>
<p>Mainstream messaging apps benefit from the network effect: the more people who use them, the more useful they become. XMPP has struggled to build this critical mass. When users open an XMPP client and see an empty contact list, they&#39;re likely to revert to apps where their friends, family, and colleagues are already present. If you have an XMPP address, share it with your contacts (as you do with your email address).</p>
<h3>Why XMPP is still the right tool for many</h3>
<p>For privacy advocates, technologists, and those who value control over their data, XMPP remains a compelling choice. Its decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure and <strong>mitigates risks of censorship or data exploitation</strong>. The fact that it&#39;s open-source means that the community can continually audit, improve, and adapt XMPP to new security standards without relying on a corporation&#39;s goodwill.</p>
<p>Even more, XMPP has a place in niches where decentralized control and configurability are essential. Many organizations, communities, and even countries with stringent data privacy laws are looking to open protocols like XMPP for their communication needs. Developers working on SmolWeb, IndieWeb, and LowTech projects may find that XMPP aligns with their principles far better than any centralized, corporate-owned platform.</p>
<h3>The future of XMPP</h3>
<p>For XMPP to gain traction, it needs a stronger ecosystem of clients with user-friendly interfaces and seamless integration of essential XEPs like OMEMO and MAM. Additionally, a larger user base could help dispel the perception that XMPP is only for &#34;techies&#34;. Projects and communities like <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> (on Android), <a href="https://dino.im/">Dino</a>, <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> or <a href="https://www.kaidan.im/">Kaidan</a> (for desktop), <a href="https://siskin.im/">Siskin</a> or <a href="https://monal-im.org/">Monal</a> (for iOS) and <a href="https://git.disroot.org/badrihippo/convo">Convo</a> (for KaiOS) are working to close the user experience gap, making it easier for people to join and use XMPP networks without a technical background.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as concerns about data privacy and digital sovereignty grow, XMPP&#39;s appeal could increase among users and developers looking for alternatives to surveillance-heavy platforms. If more users discover the freedom and flexibility of XMPP, we might see a resurgence in interest, with new communities forming around this open standard.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whether you&#39;re looking to host your own server, control your data, or explore an alternative to centralized platforms, XMPP is worth a look. If you are aware of the benefits of federated networks such as Fediverse or Email, XMPP should become your instant messaging tool!</p>
