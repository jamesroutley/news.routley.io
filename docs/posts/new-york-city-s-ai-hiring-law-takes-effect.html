That’s evaluated with an “impact ratio,”  which measures the technology’s effect on hiring across legally protected groups defined by race, ethnicity, and gender—although, notably, not people with disabilities or older workers. Violations by employers will result in a fine.</p><h2 id="h25086"><a id=""></a><strong>But what are critics saying about the AI hiring law?</strong> </h2><p>But advocates for ethical uses of AI critique the law and its standards of measurement, saying it doesn’t go far enough to meaningfully protect job candidates. Unless the law is airtight, they charge, developers can find loopholes to pass—or bypass—audits.<br/></p><p>“There’s a real concern that good governance tools, like audits and impact assessments regarding artificial intelligence programs, become this administrative wand-waving in front of your face,” Winters said. </p><p>He cited an example involving video interview platform HireVue.

But when you access the audit, Winters said, it doesn’t state that the tool is unbiased—just that the auditors didn’t have didn’t have enough information to decide.</p><p>“I don’t hold out any hope that [the law]<strong> </strong>will give us any information,” he added, “or really allow people to increase the equity around their experience with hiring.”</p><p>New York City’s law is no stranger to critique.

Meanwhile, states including California, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, along with the District of Columbia, are at work on laws regulating the use of AI in hiring.</p><p>And lawmakers in Europe <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/eu-parliament-approves-ai-act/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/eu-parliament-approves-ai-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have approved</a></span> the EU AI Act, a sweeping set of rules that will classify algorithmic technologies into categories of risk, allowing the European Union to limit high-risk technology—and outright ban software they rank “unacceptable.”</p><h2 id="h25088"><a id=""></a><strong>So how can candidates trust the AI being used in their job interviews?</strong></h2><p>Other advocates for ethics in AI are optimistic that despite their shortcomings, laws tackling hiring algorithms force some meaningful transparency for job candidates. “All of [the laws] are flawed,” Mona Sloane, a senior research scientist at NYU’s Center for Responsible AI, told Quartz this spring. But they also make AI regulation more concrete—and reign in an algorithmic Wild West. If regulators really want to the laws to work, Sloane and others point to one way to close loopholes: resources.</p><p>“There is no funding available to think concretely about innovation and compliance,” Sloane said. To change that, she argued, regulators—not just companies contracting audits—must give auditors the access and resources they need to carry out their work. Only then can candidates trust that a company’s hiring process uses truly independent tools, techniques, and protocols. Otherwise, job seekers and regulators will have to take AI tools—and the companies that use them—at their word.</p></div></div></div>
