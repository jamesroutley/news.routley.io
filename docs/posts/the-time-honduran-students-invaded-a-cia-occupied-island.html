<p>I’m currently reading Daniel Immerwahr’s excellent <em>How To Hide An Empire</em>, a book telling the history of the United States from the perspective of its colonies and territories. The whole book is packed with gems of history you’d never get from high school, but there was one story in particular that was odd and hilarious enough to merit sharing. A moment in history where a group of Honduran students attempted to reclaim the American-occupied Swan Islands on behalf of their country. Armed with rifles, a Honduran flag, and a mission to liberate land from (what they believed to be) corporate America, they set out for Swan Island in July of 1960.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the students, the primary American presence on this island wasn’t just corporate America, but the CIA. The Swan Islands were being used to harbor a large radio tower broadcasting anti-Castro propaganda towards the Cuban public and, allegedly, coded phrases to anti-government groups within the country.</p>

<p>When the CIA caught wind of a planned “invasion,” they knew something must be done to ensure they didn’t find the station’s location nor disrupt its operation. As such, they directed their operatives on the island to “give them plenty of beer and protect the family jewels” (referring to the radio station).</p>

<p>When the Honduran students arrived for their invasion, the following messages were sent back to headquarters during the encounter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Swan to HQ:</strong> honduran ship on horizon. beer on ice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, unlike many encounters with arms of American foreign policy, the end-result was peaceful. Also unbeknownst to those students were a group of Marines stationed on the island, prepared to escalate the situation into violence.</p>

<p>Gary Oswald from Sea Lion Press published <a href="https://www.sealionpress.co.uk/post/caribbean-cold-war-drinking-beer-with-the-cia">an article</a> with more detail into the encounter and how, had the butterfly of history flapped its wings differently, the ripple effects could have easily spread into the Bay of Pigs Invasion and, subsequently, the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>

<p>It’s absolutely absurd, fascinating, and slightly terrifying moment of history. It appears to be a relatively obscure one as well, as I wasn’t able to find too many accounts of the incident aside from <em>How To Hide An Empire</em> and the article from Sea Lion Press.</p>
