    <h1>AI tooling must be disclosed for contributions</h1>

      <p dir="auto">I think, at this stage of AI, it is a common courtesy to disclose this.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality work than any human. That isn&#39;t the world we live in today, and in many cases it&#39;s generating slop. I say this despite being a fan of and using them successfully myself (with heavy supervision)! I think the major issue is <strong>inexperienced human drivers of AI</strong> that aren&#39;t able to <strong>adequately review their generated code.</strong> As a result, they&#39;re pull requesting code that I&#39;m sure they would be ashamed of if they knew how bad it was.</p>
<p dir="auto">The disclosure is to help maintainers assess how much attention to give a PR. While we aren&#39;t obligated to in any way, I try to assist inexperienced contributors and coach them to the finish line, because getting a PR accepted is an achievement to be proud of. But if it&#39;s just an AI on the other side, I don&#39;t need to put in this effort, and it&#39;s rude to trick me into doing so.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>I&#39;m a fan of AI assistance and use AI tooling myself.</strong> But, we need to be responsible about what we&#39;re using it for and respectful to the humans on the other side that may have to review or maintain this code.</p>
<p dir="auto">(In the spirit of this PR... none of this PR was AI generated. lol.)</p>
