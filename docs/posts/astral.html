          <div><p><strong>Mandarin</strong> - given they are resident nearby and the Wetlands seems to have the right habitat - should be far commoner than they are. But if past years are any guide, the smart drake found by P &amp; TR on No 1 in rain on the 28th may be the only record in 2023. Late March does, however, seem to be the best time to look as last year&#39;s sole appearance was just a day later. It also very much lived up to tradition by disappearing as quickly and mysteriously as it arrived. A few <strong>shoveler </strong>and <strong>teal </strong>remained throughout the month as did the long-staying drake <strong>scaup </strong>which moved home from No 4 to East Warwick where it showed ridiculously well.   </p></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><p>It was a very good month for large raptors with the definite highlight the first <strong>osprey </strong>since the autumn of 2020. LB, scanning from his loft window overlooking Lockwood on the 29th, was alerted to it by the alarm call of worried gulls. He managed to snatch a couple of photographs as it continued west despite having to run downstairs to grab his camera. March also saw a <strong>marsh harrier</strong>, seen separately by RW and DCo, fly north over the Wetlands on the 3rd, It is another species which was not recorded at all last year. Single <strong>red kites</strong> were seen on the 5th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 27th with <strong>buzzards </strong>on the 2nd and 26th with at least three on the 27th. </p></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><p>But for the wader-fest in December when up to four were seen daily, the <strong>jack snipe</strong> found on the 2nd would have caused far more excitement. It stayed faithful, when water levels weren&#39;t too high, to the channel in the No 1 reed-bed until the 7th although it could be a devil to pick out even when you knew were it was. Presumably the same bird was seen to fly in to the reed-bed on the 12th. <strong>Common snipe</strong> was seen on the 1st, 3rd and 11th while the only record of <strong>green sandpiper</strong> was on the 8th. This was a better showing than <strong>common sandpiper,</strong> a regular winterer, which has yet to be seen at all this year while this was the first March since 2019 without an Avocet being recorded.     </p></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><div><p><strong>Alpine swift </strong>was high on the list of rarities expected to make an appearance at the Wetlands and, with an unprecedented influx from mid-month seeing birds recorded as close as Fisher&#39;s Green, plenty of time was spent gazing at the sky in vain. The wait was ended when JR, the Wetlands manager, found a swift feeding over the Coppermill Tower when she opened up the reserve on the 26th. Although without her binoculars, she managed to  capture a video with her phone which, when shared, saw a stampede of regulars heading from all points to the Wetlands. LB arrived first and was able to confirm the Wetlands&#39; second ever Alpine Swift and the first since June 1980. </p>
<p>It was also the rarest bird to turn up at the Wetlands since 2018 and, having kindly arrived on a Sunday, attracted birders from far afield as it fed high over the south end of the complex. It was still around next morning but, after going even higher than usual around 1330,  disappeared north east and was not seen again.   </p>
<p>The southerly airflow also sped up migration of its more common cousins. The first <strong>swallow </strong>was seen on the 20th - nine days earlier than last year - with singles on four other days. A <strong>sand martin</strong> arrived on the 11th - two days earlier than last year - with 20 feeding over the reservoirs in heavy rain by the 17th. And an early <strong>house martin </strong>joined the <strong>sand martin</strong> flock over West Warwick on the 31st with the first not seen last year until April 8th.</p>
<p>More expected were the first <strong>skylarks </strong>of the year on the 13th, 20th and 22nd. <strong>Chiffchaff</strong> and <strong>blackcap </strong>numbers built up with singing birds from mid-month. They included a <strong>Siberian chiffchaff </strong>in full song found by CF on the 27th. <strong>Willow warblers</strong> were also ahead of schedule with the first on the 28th and four on the 30th while none were seen last March.  </p>

      </div><div>
          <div><p><strong>Rock Pipit</strong> is a regular Autumn visitor to the Wetlands but only occasional in Spring. This month, however, saw an unusually strong  passage. After the first on the 6th on the No4/5 causeway, birds were seen daily until the 14th. Two were seen together on both the 12th and 14th but photographs show that at least four individuals birds passed through. <strong>Brambling</strong> is also a scarce but regular visitor in Spring with CF finding a male at the south end of No 3 on the 28th. At least one <strong>siskin</strong>, another species which should appear more often, was seen feeding in alders on West Warwick and the Coppermill on the 30th.  </p></div>
