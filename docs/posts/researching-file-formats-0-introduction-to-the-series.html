<p><span>04 Aug 2023</span></p><p>In June, I started working on a project that will run for the next year – it’s helping the Library of Congress update their <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/">Sustainability of Digital Formats</a> page with around 40 new file formats! You can see the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_workplan.shtml">list of 2023-2024 formats here</a> – those are the formats I’ll be researching.</p>

<p>There’s an announcement in this <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2023/06/filling-in-the-file-format-gaps/">general updates post</a> from the Library of Congress and <a href="https://myriadconsultants.org/blog/enhancing-file-format-documentation-myriads-commitment-to-collaboration-transparency-and-efficiency">another announcement blog</a> from Myriad.</p>

<p>Doing this research is a huge thrill for me!! Most of my time is going straight into the formats research, with a little time spent answering clarifying questions from my teammates and also doing the XML conversion required for the project. Since I’m spending a lot of time with each format, I thought it’d be nice to document some of the things I’m learning along the way that are … well, things that just don’t fit into a standard open government document, like my opinions and weird discoveries. So I’m going to do that here on my blog!</p>

<p><strong>This blog series represents my views and my views only, and they do not reflect the views of any of my colleagues, and definitely not the views of any companies/organizations, because they don’t have feelings anyway.</strong></p>

<p>(I started drafting the first several posts and some of them have at least started off a little fiery so it seems appropriate to say that in advance.)</p>

<p>I realize there’s a chance you’re coming across this Sustainability of Digital Formats page for the first time via this blog post. Well, it’s a great and continually updated resource – don’t let the vintage web design fool you! I like to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/browse_list.shtml">review the entire list</a>. I like this resource not just as a way to understand the assessed state of preservation risks for individual formats, but just in general to learn about the way a format works and the format history. There’s also relationships with other formats, which is essential for anyone just learning that a “format” like a video file can actually be at least three formats rolled up into one (the container, the audio codec, the video codec).</p>

<p>This blog post will (eventually) serve as a canonical list of all of the entries in order (and you can always visit the <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/tags/">tags section of my blog</a>).</p>

<p>We are not working in set order, so the posts won’t correspond to the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_workplan.shtml">published list</a>. This projects is running from June 2023 until May 2024. I am aiming to post roughly once a week.</p>

<p>Here’s a tip for following along: Click the little satellite on this blog’s sidebar if you would like <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/feed.xml">an RSS feed</a>(or click that link right there) and want to stay up to date that way! Otherwise, I will be posting weekly notifications <a href="https://digipres.club/@ashley">on Mastodon</a>.</p>
