    <h1>Reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main><article><p>I had owned a copy of <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">SICP</a>) for a couple of years, but never made it past the first few pages.</p>
<p>Last year in February, <a href="https://softwareunderthehood.com/">my friend Maud</a> offered me a physical copy. Now I had two. It was time.</p>
<p>With about a decade of experience in web development, I wanted to challenge my thinking and build stronger foundations.</p>
<p>So I joined the Recurse Center SICP reading group and got started. It took me about a year to finish.</p>

<p>SICP starts with the fundamentals of programming - procedures, recursion - then explores lazy evaluation, concurrency, and different programming paradigms.
By the end, it develops a Scheme interpreter (written in Scheme<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-metacircular" id="user-content-fnref-metacircular" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>) and a register-based virtual machine with a compiler.</p>
<p>I found the exercises very well-designed. I would recommend doing as many as possible.</p>
<p>SICP feels like a reflection on how to design programs. The authors walk you through ideas and invite you to compare them.
They give precise names to patterns you probably have seen before<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-names" id="user-content-fnref-names" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Naming is powerful! It helps reason about the ideas and apply them <em>intentionally</em>.</p>
<p>I also thought the programs presented throughout the book (like the digital circuit simulator) were remarkably elegant. The implementation is so simple!
I have written similar programs in the past and I know how easy it is to end up with a confusing pile of code. SICP shows how it&#39;s done.</p>

              </svg></span></a>Should you read it?</h2>
<p>I would not recommend SICP to everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re just getting started and looking for a job, skip this. Come back later :)!</li>
<li>If you want practical tips to ship software faster, there are better books.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you want to reflect on programming and build stronger foundations, SICP might be worth the effort. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/">Peter Norvig&#39;s review</a> puts it better than me.</p>
<p>One caveat: The book assumes MIT undergraduate knowledge of math. If you are not math-inclined, some of the examples and exercises might be difficult. You can just skip some of them but it will make the overall experience a bit harder<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-also" id="user-content-fnref-also" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If I had not committed to reading the whole book, I would probably have signed up for <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/sicp.html">David Beazley&#39;s course based on SICP</a>.
I have taken a few of his other courses and can really recommend them.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A minimal setup is fine. I used MIT/GNU Scheme 12.1, <code>rlwrap scheme</code>, and a shortcut to run <code>scheme &lt; [current_file]</code> from my editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning to use the Scheme debugger early on saved me a lot of time. I&#39;d say if you&#39;re in chapter 2 and intend to read the whole book, it makes sense to invest the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes you need to read ahead to be able to test your code. Don&#39;t be afraid to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build tools when needed. I added the ability to load files (like a file import) inside the custom interpreters of chapter 4 and it made testing much smoother.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to these people who discussed their solutions online. The ones I referred to the most:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mk12.github.io/sicp/exercise/index.html">https://mk12.github.io/sicp/exercise/index.html</a>, until half-way through chapter 4.</li>
<li><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">https://eli.thegreenplace.net/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.inchmeal.io/sicp/review.html">https://www.inchmeal.io/sicp/review.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In case all three of the websites above go down, my solutions are <a href="https://github.com/ldirer/sicp">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a big thank you to the Recurse Center SICP Wizard group ðŸ§™! Meeting weekly for many months helped me find motivation to finish the book.
Thanks in particular to fellow wizards Banna, Charlie, Jeff, and Maud.</p>
<p>SICP did not change the way I write code overnight. But I made some progress, and picked up a few tools for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>Happy wizarding ðŸ§™ âœ¨</p>
