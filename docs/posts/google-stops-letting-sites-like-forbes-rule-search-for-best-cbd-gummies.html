    <h1>Google stops letting sites like Forbes rule search for &#34;Best CBD Gummies&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Under the strength of Forbes&#39; long-existing and well-linked site, Forbes Marketplace/Advisor has dominated the search term &#34;best cbd gummies&#34; for &#34;an eternity,&#34; <a href="https://x.com/lilyraynyc/status/1859262396130336911">according to SEO analyst Lily Ray</a>. Forbes has similarly dominated &#34;best pet insurance,&#34; and long came up as the second result for &#34;how to get rid of roaches,&#34; as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/">detailed in a blog post by Lars Lofgren</a>. If people click on this high-ranking result, and then click on a link to buy a product or request a roach removal consultation, Forbes typically gets a cut.</p>
<p>Forbes Marketplace had seemingly also provided SEO-minded review services to CNN and USA Today, as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/cnn-usa-today-forbes-marketplace/">detailed by Lofgren</a>. Lofgren&#39;s term for this business, &#34;Parasite SEO,&#34; took hold in corners critical of the trend. Ars has contacted Forbes for comment and will update this post with response.</p>
<h2>“The unfair, exploitative nature” of “parasite SEO”</h2>
<p>Google writes that it had reviewed &#34;situations where there might be varying degrees of first-party involvement&#34; (most publishers&#39; review sites indicate some kind of oversight or editorial standards linked to the primary site). But however arranged, &#34;no amount of first-party involvement alters the fundamental third-party nature of the content or the unfair, exploitative nature of attempting to take advantage of the host sites&#39; ranking signals.&#34;</p>
<p>As such, using third-party content in such a way as to take advantage of a high search quality ranking, outside the site&#39;s primary focus, is considered spam. That delivers a major hit to a site&#39;s Google ranking, and the impact is already being felt.</p>
<p>The SEO reordering does not affect more established kinds of third-party content, like wire service reports, syndication, or well-marked sponsored content, as detailed in Google&#39;s spam policy <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation">section about site reputation abuse</a>. As seen on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO">SEO subreddit</a>, and on social media, Google has given sites running afoul of its updated policy a &#34;<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175?hl=en-NA">Manual Action</a>&#34; rather than relying only on its algorithm to catch the often opaque arrangements.</p>
