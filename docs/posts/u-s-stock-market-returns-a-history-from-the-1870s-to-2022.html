	<p><i>Note: This post was last updated on January 5th, 2023 to include refreshed U.S. stock market returns up until the end of 2022. The U.S. stock market declined by 23.3% in 2022 üìâ</i></p>
<p>From Canada to Chile, Barcelona to Bali ‚Äî investors around the globe pay close attention to the U.S. stock market. With the U.S. generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">~25% of global GDP</a>,¬† and U.S. companies weighing in at <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/a71b65b5-d0ea-4b5c-a709-24b1213bc3c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">~60% of global stock markets</a>, the long-term performance of all of our investments is heavily influenced by the performance of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>This post will cover a few facts and figures on the history of U.S. stock market returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the average return of the stock market?</li>
<li>How often does the stock market go down?</li>
<li>Gauging the impact of short / long time horizons and the likelihood of losing money in the market</li>
<li>The best months and worst months in stock market history</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding historical stock market returns can help to inform your financial plans, from <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/retirement-date-forecasting-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning for retirement</a>, or figuring out whether it makes more sense to <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/rent-versus-buy-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rent or buy your home</a>. Plus, it‚Äôs plenty of fun for data geeks üßê</p>
<p>Throughout this post we‚Äôll be relying on a <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fantastic data set</a> released and maintained by Professor Robert Shiller, giving us data on U.S. stock market returns all the way back to the 1870s ‚Äî a data set covering more than 150 years.</p>
<p>Onto the good stuff!</p>

<h2>U.S. Stock Market Returns by Year</h2>
<p>What is the average annual return of the U.S. stock market?</p>
<ul>
<li>The average return of the U.S. stock market has been 8.4% per year over the past 151 years (1871 to 2022); note that this is the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù average across all years (also known as the ‚Äúarithmetic‚Äù average)</li>
<li>The annualized return (also known as the ‚Äúgeometric‚Äù average) of the U.S. stock market from start to finish has been 6.9% per year. This represents the compounded annual return that you would have earned if you‚Äôd be invested over this whole period</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Annual Returns of S&amp;P 500 Index" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Annual-Returns.png"/></p>
<p>This showcases why many financial planners tend to assume returns of 5% to 8% per year in the stock market.</p>
<p>Note: these figures are ‚Äúreal total returns‚Äù, meaning that they‚Äôve been adjusted to include the re-investment of dividends, and have also been adjusted for inflation.</p>

<h2>Distribution of Annual Returns</h2>
<p>How often does the stock market go down?</p>
<ul>
<li>While the U.S. stock market has trended upwards over time, the market has declined in 31% of all years on record (47 years out of 151 years in total)</li>
<li><strong>U.S. stock market returns in any single year can be extremely volatile</strong>. There have been 5 cases where the market declined by 30 to 40% in a single year (1917, 1931, 1937, 1974, and 2008)</li>
<li>You don‚Äôt need to go back too far for evidence of losses in the stock market losses ‚Äî in 2022, the U.S. stock market dropped by 23.3% (real total return of the S&amp;P 500 index)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Distribution of 1 Year Returns" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Distribution-of-1-year-returns.png"/></p>
<h2>Buy, Hold‚Ä¶ Profit?</h2>
<p>The wild swings of the market are reduced if we start to look at time horizons that are longer than a single year.</p>
<p>In the animation below, you can see how U.S. stock market returns have fared when we look at 1 / 5 / 10 / 20 year rolling periods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/US-stock-market-return-animation-3.gif"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking a 1-year view, we see lots of red ‚Äî there were plenty of years in which the market was down, and sometimes down significantly.</li>
<li>As we consider longer and longer time periods (stretching our view out to 5 years, then 10 years, and finally 20 years), the range of possibilities narrows, and the chance of losing money diminishes.</li>
<li>Once we zoom it out to look at 20-year periods, you won‚Äôt see any more flashes of red. In other words, <strong>The U.S. stock market has never declined over any 20-year period</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And down below you‚Äôll find the same chart, but this time shown as a static picture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rolling-Returns-1074.png"/></p>
<p>To summarize: while the range of returns across 1-year periods has varied significantly (from negative 37.0% to +53.2%), the annualized returns across 20-year periods have a much tighter range (from +0.5% to +13.2%).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Range of Total Returns" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Range-of-Total-Real-Returns.png"/></p>
<p>In the long run, U.S. stocks have delivered strong returns. However, if your investment horizon is short (0-5 years), your savings are likely better suited towards less volatile assets such as bonds, GICs, or high interest savings accounts.</p>

<h2>U.S. Stock Market Returns by Decade</h2>
<p>Across the entire period spanning 1871 until 2022, U.S. stocks have increased at +4.6% per year <em>excluding</em> dividends, +9.1% per year <em>including</em> dividends, and +6.8% per year <em>including dividends and also adjusting for inflation</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Returns by Decade" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Returns-by-decade-1.png"/></p>

<h2>The Best and Worst Months in Stock Market History</h2>
<p>The table below lists the 20 months on record with the highest returns, and the 20 months with the lowest returns (without adjusting for dividends or inflation).</p>
<p>A familiar story: in the short-term, the stock market is far from predictable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Best and Worst 20 Months" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Best-Months.png"/></p>
<p>The best month in stock market history was August 1932, when the market gained 50.3% in a single month!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Best and Worst 20 Months" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Worst-Months.png"/></p>
<p>On the other hand, the worst month in stock market history was November 1929, with a decline of 26.5%. The worst month in recent memory was October 2008 (during the depths of the Great Recession), when the stock market dropped by 16.9%.</p>

<h2>$1,000 ‚Äî Then and Now</h2>
<p>If you had invested $1,000 in the U.S. stock market on Dec. 31st, 1969 and held the investment until Dec. 31, 2022 (without buying or selling during that 53-year period), your investment would have grown to ~$182k before inflation, or ~$23k after inflation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Growth of a $1,000 Investment" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Growth-of-1000-1.png"/></p>
<p>Historically, buying and holding (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/forgetful-investors-performed-best-2014-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and potentially forgeting about the investment entirely</a>) has been a simple and straightforward way to build wealth.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking to make a quick buck by jumping in and out of the market, quite often you‚Äôll find yourself on the losing end of things. Over short time periods, there‚Äôs no telling if the market will go up, down, or sideways.</p>
<p>However, if you have the patience and fortitude to hold onto your investments for 10 or 20+ years, your prospects become much brighter. You‚Äôll ride out the short-term noise and benefit from the long-term upwards trend üöÄ.</p>
<p>As always, Warren Buffet put it best: <strong>‚Äúthe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient‚Äù</strong>.</p>
