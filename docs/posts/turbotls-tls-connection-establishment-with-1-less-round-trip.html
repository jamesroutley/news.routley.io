      <span>Abstract:</span>  We show how to establish TLS connections using one less round trip. In our
approach, which we call TurboTLS, the initial client-to-server and
server-to-client flows of the TLS handshake are sent over UDP rather than TCP.
At the same time, in the same flights, the three-way TCP handshake is carried
out. Once the TCP connection is established, the client and server can complete
the final flight of the TLS handshake over the TCP connection and continue
using it for application data. No changes are made to the contents of the TLS
handshake protocol, only its delivery mechanism. We avoid problems with UDP
fragmentation by using request-based fragmentation, in which the client sends
in advance enough UDP requests to provide sufficient room for the server to fit
its response with one response packet per request packet. Clients can detect
which servers support this without an additional round trip, if the server
advertises its support in a DNS HTTPS resource record. Experiments using our
software implementation show substantial latency improvements. On reliable
connections, we effectively eliminate a round trip without any noticeable cost.
To ensure adequate performance on unreliable connections, we use lightweight
packet ordering and buffering; we can have a client wait a very small time to
receive a potentially lost packet (e.g., a fraction of the RTT observed for the
first fragment) before falling back to TCP without any further delay, since the
TCP connection was already in the process of being established. This approach
offers substantial performance improvements with low complexity, even in
heterogeneous network environments with poorly configured middleboxes.
