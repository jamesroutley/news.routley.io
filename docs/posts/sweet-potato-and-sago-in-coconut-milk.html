<p><span id="more-17130"></span>It is the First of April and I joke not: the weather is really cold here in London and we are not exactly impressed. Two weeks ago we had a flourishing show of cherry blossoms in <a href="https://www.kew.org/">Kew Gardens</a> and I am concerned these will be gone by the time I head there again this weekend.</p>
<p>I found a sweet potato in the fridge, left by one of the children, and appropriated it to make something warm and comforting. Strangely enough, this sweet potato dish is what I often ate in Malaysia where the weather is a lovely 30 C all year round. People often wonder why the British went off colonising other countries. I think it really was because of the miserable weather back home.</p>
<p>The choice of starchy root here can be sweet potato or yam, and I have even made this with dense Japanese squashes like Kuri Squash. In Malaysia we call it <em>bubur cha-cha</em> which has a whiff of scandal but really, I think the cha-cha alludes to the mixed colours of both the white yam and orange or yellow sweet potato. <em>Bubur</em> means porridge.</p>
<p>After I made this I told Mr Gochugaru that it is wonderful to live in a tropical climate where the native plants throw up such lovely things that you can put together in a pot to make such a dessert. He did not say anything but headed back to his desk for his afternoon meetings. But now I know what he must be thinking: <em>we also have such desserts in cold countries and we call them steamed pudding and custard</em>.</p>
<p>As this dish is made with native (to me) ingredients I have given substitutes at the end of the post. As an aside, here is a helpful article on the <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/sago-vs-tapioca-pearl-3030148">difference between sago and tapioca pearls</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Bubur Cha-Cha:</p>
<p>300 g sweet potato</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>150 g yam and 150 g sweet potato</p>
<p>500 g water</p>
<p>A few strips of fresh or frozen pandan leaf, knotted</p>
<p>30 g palm sugar / gula Melaka</p>
<p>2 tablespoons sago pearls</p>
<p>200 g tinned coconut milk (I always use Aroy brand if possible)</p>
<p>pinch of salt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Peel the sweet potato and/ or yam and cut into even-sized pieces, either cubes or more random shapes.</p>
<p>Heat the water in a pot to simmering point and add in the knotted pandan leaves and sago.</p>
<p>If you are using yam, add this first to the water. Cook for a few minutes before adding the sweet potato, as yam has a denser texture and takes longer to cook. When you have checked that the yam is half cooked, add the sweet potato.</p>
<p>If you are using just sweet potato or Japanese squash, place this in the pot with the knotted pandan leaves and sago.</p>
<p>Simmer for around 15 minutes, pot uncovered,  then check to see if the potatoes have softened. It takes around 15  &#8211; 25 minutes to cook, depending on the size of the potatoes.</p>
<p>Add the palm sugar, coconut milk and salt towards the end of the cooking time.</p>
<p>Serve the <em>bubur cha-cha</em> hot or cold. I would eat it hot, and no doubt the British in Malaya would have eaten it cold.</p>
