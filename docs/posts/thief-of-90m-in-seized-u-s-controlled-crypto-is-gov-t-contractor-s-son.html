    <h1>Thief of $90M in seized U.S.-controlled crypto is gov&#39;t contractor&#39;s son</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>Two crypto thieves decided to settle an argument over who was wealthier by screensharing as they transferred crypto between wallets to prove ownership. In doing so, one of them — known online as &#34;Lick&#34; — revealed a wallet address that crypto sleuth zachxbt quickly tied to the theft of around $90 million from US government wallets containing seized crypto assets, including a <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=possible-us-government-theft" target="_blank">$20 million theft zachxbt reported in October 2024</a>.<p>zachxbt has alleged that &#34;Lick&#34; is a man named John Daghita. After reporting Daghita&#39;s identity, &#34;Lick&#34; appeared to try to scrub his Telegram account, then <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#dusting" target="_blank">dusted</a> zachxbt&#39;s public crypto wallet from one of the theft addresses.</p><p>Daghitia is reportedly the son of Dean Daghita, the owner of Command Services &amp; Support (CMDSS). In October 2024, CMDSS landed a contract with the US Marshals to manage seized crypto assets, which is still active. After zachxbt linked the younger Daghita to his father and CMDSS, CMDSS also scrubbed its online presence. Around that time, Lick began trolling zachxbt again, and later sent 0.6767 ETH (~$1,900) of the stolen funds to zachxbt.</p><p>CMDSS&#39; website boasts that they are &#34;a proven provider of mission-critical services to the Department of Defense and Department of Justice&#34;.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2014685263327351116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet thread by zachxbt</span></a><span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2026-01-23-0/0">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2015430549846777964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet thread by zachxbt</span></a><span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2026-01-23-0/1">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/81fc28c4-3f1c-a300-4e38-8616bb76adff-P/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Command Services &amp; Support, Inc.</span></a><span>, USASpending.gov</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260127023607/https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/81fc28c4-3f1c-a300-4e38-8616bb76adff-P/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div>
