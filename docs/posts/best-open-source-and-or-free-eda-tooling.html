    <h1>Ask HN: Best open source and/or free EDA tooling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I last needed EDA type tools in 2012. Since then, wherever I was employed, I only wrote software and the actual PCB production was handled by a different team.</p><p>I&#39;m getting back into doing it all myself, and the tools I used to use (gEDA) are no longer in the repositories of my distros (debian-based).</p><p>What is being used these days to do circuit diagrams, PCB layout, etc? First prize would be something already in many repositories (I see a `lepton` tool which I will try out), but I will accept a second prize of FLOSS or consolation prizes of `free to download, but closed-source`).</p><p>TIA, I will read and consider all replies seriously.</p></div></div></div>
