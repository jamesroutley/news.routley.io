<p>Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) announced on the 29th that it will assist India&#39;s Tata Electronics to build India&#39;s first 12-inch wafer fab in Dholera, Gujarat. The fab construction will begin this year. The new semiconductor company in India is expected to create more than 20,000 local job opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Tata Electronics is a wholly-owned subsidiary of India&#39;s largest enterprise Tata Sons Group. With the assistance of PSMC, Tata Electronics plans to produce power management IC, display driver IC as well as microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, in order to enter the automotive, computing and data storage, wireless communications, artificial intelligence and other application end markets.</p>
<p>N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons Group, said that the group has played a pioneering role in many industrial fields in India. As the first company enters into semiconductor fabrication in India, Tata will once again demonstrate its tradition of breaking new ground. Through the policy support of the Indian central and Gujarat state governments, Tata Sons Group will not only build an international semiconductor industry cluster in India, but also provide high-tech job opportunities for India&#39;s young generation.</p>
<p>Frank Huang, Chairman of PSMC, pointed out that Tata Sons Group is India&#39;s largest and internationally-renowned company. India not only has the world&#39;s largest population, it also has a huge domestic market. At this critical moment of the global restructuring of high-tech supply chain, the cooperation between PSMC and Tata Sons Group is indeed timely.</p>
<p>Regarding the planning of the new factory in Dholera, Tata Electronics CEO Randhir Thakur said that through the cooperation with PSMC, Tata Electronics will be able to expand its technological reach and establish synergies among its manufacturing companies. On top of that, Tata electronics will also achieve the goal of Made in India in order to meet the needs of its international customers as well as the need of Indiaâ€™s rapidly growing domestic market and to enhance the resilience of global supply chain.</p>
