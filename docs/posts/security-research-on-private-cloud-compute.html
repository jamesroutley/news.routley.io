<p>Private Cloud Compute (PCC) fulfills computationally intensive requests for Apple Intelligence while providing groundbreaking privacy and security protections — by bringing our industry-leading device security model into the cloud. In our previous post <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">introducing Private Cloud Compute</a>, we explained that to build public trust in the system, we would take the extraordinary step of allowing security and privacy researchers to inspect and verify the end-to-end security and privacy promises of PCC. In the weeks after we announced Apple Intelligence and PCC, we provided third-party auditors and select security researchers early access to the resources we created to enable this inspection, including the PCC Virtual Research Environment (VRE).</p>
<p>Today we’re making these resources publicly available to invite all security and privacy researchers — or anyone with interest and a technical curiosity — to learn more about PCC and perform their own independent verification of our claims. And we’re excited to announce that we’re expanding Apple Security Bounty to include PCC, with significant rewards for reports of issues with our security or privacy claims.</p>
<h3>Security guide</h3>
<p><span><figure><img alt="Security Guide Icon" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_security-guide.png" srcset="/assets/image/generated/xlarge_security-guide.png 2500w, /assets/image/generated/large_security-guide.png 1650w, /assets/image/generated/medium_security-guide.png 1300w, /assets/image/generated/small_security-guide.png 840w, /assets/image/generated/xsmall_security-guide.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/></figure></span></p><p>To help you understand how we designed PCC’s architecture to accomplish each of our core requirements, we’ve published the <a href="https://security.apple.com/documentation/private-cloud-compute">Private Cloud Compute Security Guide</a>. The guide includes comprehensive technical details about the components of PCC and how they work together to deliver a groundbreaking level of privacy for AI processing in the cloud. The guide covers topics such as: how PCC attestations build on an immutable foundation of features implemented in hardware; how PCC requests are authenticated and routed to provide non-targetability; how we technically ensure that you can inspect the software running in Apple’s data centers; and how PCC’s privacy and security properties hold up in various attack scenarios.</p>
<h3>Virtual Research Environment</h3>
<p><span><figure><img alt="Virtual Research Environment Icon" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_vre.png" srcset="/assets/image/generated/xlarge_vre.png 2500w, /assets/image/generated/large_vre.png 1650w, /assets/image/generated/medium_vre.png 1300w, /assets/image/generated/small_vre.png 840w, /assets/image/generated/xsmall_vre.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/></figure></span></p><p>For the first time ever, we’ve created a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) for an Apple platform. The VRE is a set of tools that enables you to perform your own security analysis of Private Cloud Compute right from your Mac. This environment enables you to go well beyond simply understanding the security features of the platform. You can confirm that Private Cloud Compute indeed maintains user privacy in the ways we describe.</p>
<p>The VRE runs the PCC node software in a virtual machine with only minor modifications. Userspace software runs identically to the PCC node, with the boot process and kernel adapted for virtualization. The VRE includes a virtual Secure Enclave Processor (SEP), enabling security research in this component for the first time — and also uses the built-in macOS support for paravirtualized graphics to enable inference.</p>
<p>You can use the VRE tools to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List and inspect PCC software releases</li>
<li>Verify the consistency of the transparency log</li>
<li>Download the binaries corresponding to each release</li>
<li>Boot a release in a virtualized environment</li>
<li>Perform inference against demonstration models</li>
<li>Modify and debug the PCC software to enable deeper investigation</li>
</ul>
<div><figure><img alt="The Virtual Research Environment for Private Cloud Compute" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_PCC_VRE.png" srcset="/assets/image/generated/xlarge_PCC_VRE.png 2500w, /assets/image/generated/large_PCC_VRE.png 1650w, /assets/image/generated/medium_PCC_VRE.png 1300w, /assets/image/generated/small_PCC_VRE.png 840w, /assets/image/generated/xsmall_PCC_VRE.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/></figure></div>
<p>The VRE is available in the latest macOS Sequoia 15.1 Developer Preview and requires a Mac with Apple silicon and 16GB or more unified memory.

<h3>Private Cloud Compute source code</h3>
<p><span><figure><img alt="Source Code Icon" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_source-code.png" srcset="/assets/image/generated/xlarge_source-code.png 2500w, /assets/image/generated/large_source-code.png 1650w, /assets/image/generated/medium_source-code.png 1300w, /assets/image/generated/small_source-code.png 840w, /assets/image/generated/xsmall_source-code.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/></figure></span></p><p>We’re also making available the source code for certain key components of PCC that help to implement its security and privacy requirements. We provide this source under a limited-use license agreement to allow you to perform deeper analysis of PCC.</p>
<p>The projects for which we’re releasing source code cover a range of PCC areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc/tree/main/CloudAttestation/CloudAttestation">CloudAttestation</a> project, which is responsible for constructing and validating the PCC node’s attestations.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc/tree/main/Thimble">Thimble</a> project, which includes the privatecloudcomputed daemon that runs on a user’s device and uses CloudAttestation to enforce verifiable transparency.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc/tree/main/darwinOSBits/splunkloggingd">splunkloggingd</a> daemon, which filters the logs that can be emitted from a PCC node to protect against accidental data disclosure.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc/tree/main/srd_tools">srd_tools</a> project, which contains the VRE tooling and which you can use to understand how the VRE enables running the PCC code.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the available PCC source code in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc">apple/security-pcc</a> project on GitHub.</p>
<h3>Apple Security Bounty for Private Cloud Compute</h3>
<p><span><figure><img alt="Bug Bounty Icon" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_bug-bounty.png" srcset="/assets/image/generated/xlarge_bug-bounty.png 2500w, /assets/image/generated/large_bug-bounty.png 1650w, /assets/image/generated/medium_bug-bounty.png 1300w, /assets/image/generated/small_bug-bounty.png 840w, /assets/image/generated/xsmall_bug-bounty.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/></figure></span></p><p>To further encourage your research in Private Cloud Compute, we’re expanding Apple Security Bounty to include rewards for vulnerabilities that demonstrate a compromise of the fundamental security and privacy guarantees of PCC.</p>
<p>Our new PCC bounty categories are aligned with the <a href="https://security.apple.com/documentation/private-cloud-compute/attacks">most critical threats</a> we describe in the Security Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accidental data disclosure</strong>: vulnerabilities leading to unintended data exposure due to configuration flaws or system design issues.</li>
<li><strong>External compromise from user requests</strong>: vulnerabilities enabling external actors to exploit user requests to gain unauthorized access to PCC.</li>
<li><strong>Physical or internal access</strong>: vulnerabilities where access to internal interfaces enables a compromise of the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because PCC extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud, the rewards we offer are comparable to those for iOS. We award maximum amounts for vulnerabilities that compromise user data and inference request data outside the PCC trust boundary.</p>
