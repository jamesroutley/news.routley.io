    <h1>Microbially produced protein that is much sweeter than sugar</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <div><p>A biotech answer to the world’s epic sugar consumption could be in the works — if Amai Proteins gets its way. The synthetic biology company is gearing up to commercialize a microbially produced protein that on average is 3,000 times sweeter than sugar and, if widely adopted, could put a dent in the global metabolic disease and obesity epidemic. Amai is aiming for this protein to replace up to 70% of the added sugar without the health hazards and off-flavors of other synthetic and natural <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline">sweeteners</a>.</p><div data-test="illustration" id="i1"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw703/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-023-01865-x/MediaObjects/41587_2023_1865_Figa_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img alt="" aria-describedby="i1-desc" width="703" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw703/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-023-01865-x/MediaObjects/41587_2023_1865_Figa_HTML.png"/></picture></div><p><span data-test="illustration-credit">

Although it is a protein, monellin also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13239">docks to</a> the same sweet receptors as sugar, so has the same mouthfeel and taste profile. But there is a glitch. “This is a hyper-sweet protein, but it denatures at 45 degrees; just like boiling an egg, it loses functionality,” says Ilan Samish, Amai’s Founder and CEO.</p><p>Samish modified this plant protein with a method called agile integrative computational protein design (AI-CPD), a technique with which Samish worked and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6637-0">published</a> as an academic researcher. Taking inspiration from extremophiles — organisms that withstand harsh pH, salt and temperature conditions — Samish applied AI-CPD to tweak monellin’s protein <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/328739a0">structure</a> and improve its characteristics — mainly stability, a critical feature for mass produced food products. “A protein is a sequence of pearls [amino acids]; we can change the sequence to build a new protein inspired by life in extreme conditions.” The result is a designer protein that is stable even at high temperatures and optimized for use as a food additive.</p><p>Next, the scientists at the Rehovot-based company biomanufacture the designer protein in yeast. “For us, fermentation is just like a brewery,” says Samish. Once the output is harvested, the yield is a pure protein, a white powder they call sweelin.</p><p>The company has tested sweelin in a range of foods, achieving a 70% reduction in the sugar content of ketchup and a 50% reduction in that of chocolate, for example, without changing palatability. “Supertasters can’t tell the difference,” says Samish. A huge advantage is that, unlike other sweeteners, sweelin is unlikely to interact with the gut microbiome. And because these sweet molecules are proteins, they are digested into amino acids without activating the insulin response.</p><p>Amai has so far raised $30 million and expects to close a series A investment soon. The company has ongoing collaborations with food manufacturers. The goal is to launch commercially in 2023 once they receive Generally Recognized as Safe status, first in the form of a self-affirmation and then from the US Food and Drug Administration. Beyond producing sweet food additives, the company anticipates optimizing other proteins for different uses. “Old-school agriculture cannot be sustained; we need to produce new tasty, healthy, cost-efficient and sustainable designer proteins for the mass food market. This is what we can do with synthetic biology.”</p>
