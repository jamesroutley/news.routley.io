<b>Abstract: </b>This  paper  initiates  research  on  zero-knowledge  middleboxes (ZKMBs).  A  ZKMB  is  a  network  middlebox  that  enforces  network  usage  policies  on  encrypted  traffic.  Clients  send  the  middlebox  zero-knowledge  proofs  that  their  traffic  is  policy-compliant;  these  proofs  reveal  nothing  about  the  client’s  communication  except  that  it  complies  with  the  policy.  We  show  how  to  make  ZKMBs  work  with  unmodified  encrypted-communication  protocols (specifically  TLS 1.3),  making  ZKMBs  invisible  to  servers.  As  a  contribution  of  independent  interest,  we  design  optimized  zero-knowledge  proofs  for  TLS 1.3  session  keys.
We  apply  the  ZKMB  paradigm  to  several  case  studies.  Experimental  results  suggest  that  in  certain  settings,  performance  is  in  striking  distance  of  practicality;  an  example  is  a  middlebox  that  filters  domain  queries (each  query  requiring  a  separate  proof)  when  the  client  has  a  long-lived  TLS  connection  with  a  DNS  resolver.  In  such  configurations,  the  middlebox’s  overhead  is 2–5  ms  of  running  time  per  proof,   and  client  latency  to  create  a  proof  is  several  seconds.  On  the  other  hand,  clients  may  have  to  store  hundreds  of  MBs  depending  on  the  underlying  zero-knowledge  proof  machinery,   and  for  some  applications,  latency  is  tens  of  seconds.
