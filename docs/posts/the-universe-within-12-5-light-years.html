<h3>About the Map</h3><p>
This map shows all the star systems that lie within 12.5
light years of our Sun.  Most of the stars are red dwarfs - stars with a tenth of
the Sun&#39;s mass and less than one hundredth the luminosity.  Roughly eighty percent
of all the stars in the universe are red dwarfs, and the nearest star - Proxima - is
a typical example.
