<p><b>Introduction:</b></p><p><b>Choose a theory:</b></p><p><b>Theories page 2:</b></p><p><b><u><a name="theory0">Theory 0: The basic golden rule of mapping.</a></u></b>

</p><p>The other theories are guidelines, suggestions, advice, possibilities...this one is not.
This is a rule - a rule that applies to getting reviews on this site, but also a rule that
should be (but isn&#39;t) obeyed by any mapper anywhere. It&#39;s this simple:

</p><p>Â  Â  <b>If you publicly release a map, that map must be good quality and worth playing.</b>

</p><p>A very simple rule that shouldn&#39;t even be necessary to state - really this should be taken
for granted. But it isn&#39;t, it needs to be stated clearly, and there are some related details/questions
that are worth considering.

</p><p><b>»</b> How can map makers know what good quality is???</p><p><b>»</b> What about first time mappers learning to map???</p><p>This rule may seem a very stern and judgemental one, but it is working towards a positive
goal: people enjoy good maps, the better the map, the more they&#39;ll enjoy it. People don&#39;t
enjoy bad maps - at the best it will bring them no enjoyment, and worst they&#39;ll be offended
by the mediocrity and low quality. So any mapper should strive to release the best maps they
can, for their own satisfaction, and for other peoples&#39; enjoyment - strive for quality!!!


</p><p><b><u><a name="theory1">Theory 1: What makes a proper Q1 SP level:</a></u></b>

</p><p>And for my next trick, I shall &lt;drum roll&gt; attempt to... &lt;/dr&gt; ...define the 
undefinable!!! Now I just need a volunteer from the audience... Okay, so trying to define 
what makes a proper Quake1 single player level seems a pretty fruitless task, but I have had
someone ask me what he would need to make for it to be considered a &#34;proper&#34; SP level. So 
I&#39;ve thought of some guidelines, that may even help people who are wondering if they are 
capable of making a Q1 SP level. Of course, these guidelines aren&#39;t actual *rules*, and some
proper (and even very good) levels do fail to meet one or two of these, but I think they are pretty good 
&#34;basics&#34;.</p><p><b>1. The level, in it&#39;s single player version, should be specifically designed for 
single player:</b></p><p><b>2. The level should contain an entrance and an exit:</b></p><p><b>3. The level should attain a degree of complexity, and require progression through
it:</b></p><p><b>4. The level should contain a &#34;reasonable&#34; number of monsters:</b></p><p><b>5. The level should be completable without cheating or altering console variables:</b>
</p><p><b>6. The level should be completable without &#34;trick&#34; moves or gameplay:</b></p><p><b>7. The level should be free of serious technical problems that make it unfeasible to
play:</b></p><p><b>8. The level should be completely, well, completed:</b></p><p><b>9. The level should be adequately designed and themed:</b></p><p><b>10. The level should not contain and major sections copied from other maps:</b></p><p><b><u><a name="theory2">Theory 2: Common flaws to be avoided in Q1 SP levels:</a></u></b>

</p><p>Just a few things that are common flaws in single player levels, and
should be avoided, roughly in the order of importance. Obviously this is just bad stuff to
avoid, and doesn&#39;t cover good stuff that will really enhance the map, and further, it is a limited selection of the most common and off putting flaws - map makers should strive for quality in 
all areas of their maps.

</p><p><b>1. Level is has no/poor theme:</b></p><p><b>2. Level is too hard to start and too easy to finish:</b></p><p><b>3. Poor and ugly architecture/texturing:</b></p><p><b>4. Low quality and inappropriate modifications/extras:</b></p><p><b>5. Lack of skill settings:</b></p><p><b>6. Gameplay situations that are hard/impossible to survive first attempt:</b></p><p><b>7. Instant death traps:</b></p><p><b>8. Obscure progression or trick gameplay:</b></p><p><b>9. Monsters not used well:</b></p><p><b>10. Secrets either not present or used not used well:</b></p><p><b>11. Levels being just too hard in general:</b></p><p>Of course all of this theory only focuses on negative aspects to be avoided in levels, and packing levels with positive aspects is far more important - so the next theories will cover that
in depth...

</p><p><b><u><a name="theory3">Theory 3: What makes a map look good???</a></u></b>

</p><p>A simple question I was asked the other day - with a complex answer. The answer is: a LOT
of different aspects of the level&#39;s overall architecture, all working in unison. In this 
theory, I&#39;ll present all the aspects *I* think make a map look good - but all of these have 
been confirmed by several players and map makers. However, I don&#39;t make maps, so this is 
purely from a player&#39;s point of view, though I have gone into a fair bit of depth (but obviously not as far as stating my personal architectural preferences!). I&#39;ve divided the 
aspects up into various sections, but these aren&#39;t all distinct sections, and there is some 
crossover.

</p><p><b>1. Theme:</b></p><p><b>2. Designs:</b></p><p><b>3. Details:</b></p><p><b>4. Texturing:</b></p><p><b>5. Lighting:</b></p><p><b>6. Other aspects:</b></p><p><b>Continue to <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive//teamshambler.planetquake.gamespy.com/theories2.html">Theories 2</a> page.</b>
