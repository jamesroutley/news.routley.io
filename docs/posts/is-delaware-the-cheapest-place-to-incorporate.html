    <h1>Is Delaware the cheapest place to incorporate?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am living in Taiwan and want to create a startup. The business will be mostly open source and likely to have low to no revenue.</p><p>I see that US states like Colorado have no franchise tax. But I also saw posts here that Delaware is usually ultimately cheaper.</p><p>What is the recommendation for a company to manage an open source project? Sure it might be worth money, but likely not, so I would like to keep money tight.</p><p>thanks!</p></div></div></div>
