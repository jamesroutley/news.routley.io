    <h1>I&#39;m spoiled by Apple Silicon but still love Framework</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I mainly use my <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacBook M1 Pro</a> with Apple Silicon for work. Recently I’ve had a few weeks off. It’s been sitting in my laptop bag waiting for me to return to work.</p>
<p>Since I’m back to work tomorrow I got it out to see if it was charged enough for the train journey in the morning. 90% remaining. After 3 weeks. It wasn’t turned off, just closed.</p>
<p>In contrast, my <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://frame.work/au/en/laptop13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework 13</a> with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS is almost always dead when I go to use it. It’s very frustrating. I’m not using it every day so it often goes 2-3 days without being opened. I haven’t measured it but I read that I should expect it to lose <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/18c8yk7/high_battery_drain_when_sleeping_amd_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-4% in suspend every hour</a>. Is that a joke?</p>
<p>I was running Fedora Workstation on the 13 for a long while until I had a short stint with Arch Linux. <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Framework_Laptop_13#Troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It wasn’t stable enough</a> so now I’m on Fedora Silverblue which has been delightful.</p>
<p>However, the Framework’s battery life continues to be an issue.</p>
<p>I’m a true believer of Framework’s mission. The technology is awesome. But why is the battery life of modern laptops (other than Apple Silicon) so bad? I don’t think it’s unique to Framework, but it affects my love for this groundbreaking device.</p>
<p>Apple Silicon is built upon ARM64 which is apparently <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/22/apple-silicon-macbook-pro-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core to such great battery life</a>. Do I need to get an ARM mainboard as soon as Framework offers it as an upgrade? I’m not sure. It appears to be <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40418192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way more complicated</a> than just switching to ARM64.</p>
<p>I still love my Framework, despite its flaws. I will just keep it plugged in so that it’s ready to go when I want to use it.</p> </div></div>
