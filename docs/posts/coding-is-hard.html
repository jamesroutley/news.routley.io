It&#39;s 2 am here right now. I wrote this post very quickly in about 30 mins on the recommendation of a friend to just take my mind off things before going to sleep. I was not expecting it to get any real attention, and so did not attempt to provide much context in the post.
</p><p>Genuinely appreciate your comments, especially those with encouraging, emphatic words and guidance. Also great to read your own personal journeys as well.</p>
<p>Although I started learning to code 10 years ago, I have not actually been actively coding for all these years. I have worked as a full time dev professionally for maybe just 3 months, and quickly moved into management roles from there.</p>
<p>My primary expertise today is more towards product management, sales, marketing, etc than coding. I currently work in a Enterprise Sales role, and my goal is still being an entrepreneur and building companies.</p>
<p>Zooming out and looking at my entire history, I have spent very little actual time coding. This is the primary reason behind the struggle I express in this post. I feel frustrated with how much little time I have put into it over the years, and how little progress I have made.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps important to note, I have diagnosed ADHD, chronic anxiety disorder and some level of bipolar as well. I don&#39;t like to attach these as part of my personality, but it explains a lot of my impulsivity, grandiose thinking and mood swings, which contribute to my frustration significantly as well. Also the reason why I could never learn well in classroom or with tutors. Self-learning has always worked better for me.</p>
<p>The post is intentionally very generic and vague, and doesn&#39;t give any specific examples of what I was struggling with and why, simply because it was more of an emotional post to express my frustration from the past week. I also have not written anything in a long time, so this was a good excuse for me to quickly write and publish something.</p>
<p>I recently started working on a new side project, and I have a team of people working with me, but we have been falling short of hands, and so I decided to get more involved in the development, and things were going great until last week when I started trying to refactor our codebase. I hit many walls with things I did not fully deeply understand, and struggling to keep track of a lot of different changes as I was making them - thus ending up breaking things and compounding my frustration even more.</p>
<p>I am currently strongly motivated to get better at coding. That is what prompted me to talk to my friend, who is the best engineer I know, and who encouraged me to write down my thoughts and publish them.</p>
<p>I am certain that with persistence and consistency, I would get through and not struggle as much as I have in the past week.</p>

<p>I was 15 years old, inspired by Zuckerberg and Jobs, brimming with ideas for companies I wanted to build when I grew older. My strategy was simple, find great engineers and work with them to build great companies. I was supposed to be Steve Jobs, just waiting to meet his Steve Wozniak.</p>
<p>I was the &#34;ideas guy&#34;, unironically, but one day, when sharing this <em>brilliant</em> strategy of mine casually with a friend, he asked me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friend : &#34;why not do it yourself?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me - &#34;what do you mean?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Friend : &#34;why not write the code and build the ideas yourself?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t have any good reason why, and it made me suddenly feel very embarrassed and dumb. It made me pause and rethink about my life -</p>
<p>&#34;why not build it myself? Why not learn to code? Why can I not learn this thing that so many other people have learnt? I am smart enough, right? I should be able to teach myself how to code. All the information is already available online, for free. I can do it. This would be easy for me!&#34;</p>
<p>And so my journey began to learn to code, all by myself, through the internet.</p>
<p>At first, I started with a few simple resources like W3Schools, learing the basics of HTML. I built basic websites and blogs on Google Sites, Weebly, WordPress, Blogger etc. But that was not sufficient.</p>
<p>At 17, after finishing highschool, I took a gap year and started with Codecademy. I went through all the tracks, from basic HTML (again) to JavaScript and even Ruby amd Python. And I was super proud of myself for doing just that. I then started this 2-day python crash course published by a Google Engineer, then stumbled through many more resources, blogs, just watching their courses and learning within their sandbox environments without actually building anything on my system. I then discovered freeCodeCamp by Quincy Larson, and jumped right into it. I also started CS50 at the same time and had challenged myself to finish the 12 week course within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn everything. I wanted to master everything. I wanted to prove to myself that I was smart, that all the adults in my life who told me I was &#34;dumb and stupid&#34; because I couldn&#39;t excell at school were wrong. I was <strong>not dumb</strong>, I was <strong>not an idiot</strong>, I could do it.</p>
<p>And that was when reality slapped me really hard for the first time on my face.</p>
<p>I was done with all the hand-holding exercises, I was done with all the reading material, docs, course videos. I understood a lot, I felt like I was a master already, and then I had to actually sit down and write code, on my system. I had to open the blank editor and write stuff in it and make it run and work. I had to actually solve the weekly pset challenges from CS50, and I just couldn&#39;t. Forget about finishing the entire course in 4 weeks, I was stuck on just one single problem for more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t do it. My mind was blank, I had no idea where to begin, what to write, how to actually code. I felt <strong>dumb</strong>. I felt <strong>stupid</strong>. I wanted to give up. I felt that I couldn&#39;t do this, that I was a fraud, I couldn&#39;t actually learn this stuff. I was fooling myself into thinking I was capable of going through this and making it to the other side. I expected everything to be easy for me, I expected my mind to sail smoothly across, but it did not. It crashed, it hit walls and it broke down.</p>
<p>I decided to take some time for myself, reflected, questioned if I really want to continue doing this. I was ashamed. Embarrassed. I couldn&#39;t accept it, I had to get through somehow. I couldn&#39;t just give up. How can this be the end of my journey?</p>
<p>And so, I persisted, and persisted, and kept fighting through what seemed like an endless barrage of walls and problems that I kept hitting against, getting stuck, feeling lost, feeling stupid, feeling like I could never figure this shit out. And somehow I made it through to the other side, I finished my first ever website, my first project, I finished the pset, I made it through.</p>
<p>That&#39;s when I decided that I didn&#39;t need to go to college. I could just teach myself, for free, through all these online resources.</p>
<p>But it never stopped being difficult. I would keep progressing, I would keep learning and growing, but this entire experience of hitting walls and feeling lost, feeling dumb and stupid, feeling like it&#39;s too hard for me to even grasp and figure out, just kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>Even after going through that experience multiple times, I still continue to live inside this bubble - I expect it to be easy for me, I expect it to be smooth sailing, just rapidly coding and building things without hitting walls, and every single time, I hit those walls, and fall back down to feeling like shit.</p>
<p>Personally for me, over time, this has psychologically made me want to avoid coding as much as possible. I don&#39;t like feeling dumb. It really triggers the insecurities inside me, it makes me think all those adults from my childhood were right about me - that I am stupid. It makes me feel like an imposter, a fraud who pretends to be smart but is actually very dumb. And people are gonna see it, they will catch me, and this whole charade will collapse.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been 10 years since I first started learning how to code. And I still struggle with it, a lot. I am not consistent. Honestly, it makes me feel very anxious to even think about coding, just from the anticipation of &#34;what if I can&#39;t figure it out? What if I can&#39;t make it work? What if everyone around me thinks that I am dumb and stupid?&#34;</p>
<p>I am writing this blog post today because I have been struggling for the past week. I have been working on something, and I was expecting it to be very easy, smooth sailing for me. On the high level, it&#39;s all very simple stuff. It&#39;s just refactoring the codebase a bit, reorganizing it, making it cleaner and more structured, and it&#39;s supposed to be easy.</p>
<p>And yet, every single day, I have felt frustrated, annoyed with myself and the problem I am trying to solve, mentally exhausted, stupid, dumb, feeling as if my brain is just incapable of grasping these simple concepts, keeping these simple details in mind.</p>
<p>I forget how something was setup in some section of some file, and write code in another file and it just breaks the entire logic. I feel frustrated that I cannot upload and maintain the entire logical map of even this very small and simple codebase in my mind.</p>
<p>I think of a solution to a problem, go into it with the assumption that I know everything already on how to do it, and suddenly realize that I <strong>do not, in fact, know anything about it</strong>.</p>
<p>I go back to the basics, again and again and again.</p>
<p>I relearn simple concepts, again and again and again.</p>
<p>I feel dumb and stupid. I feel like giving up.</p>
<p>I make very little progress, make something work, but then discover another thing is not working anymore properly. I have broken what was already working. I feel annoyed and frustrated, and just leave the code as it is, and not even touch it for the entire day.</p>
<p>I come back to it the next day, and suddenly I see things a bit more clearly. I keep working, keep hacking at it, keep chipping away at the problems, the bugs, and I find myself again breaking things, the code not working, simple things that were functional breaking apart, and I get angry and frustrated at myself and give up again for the day.</p>
<p>Going though this every day, makes me wonder - am I really meant for this? Is my brain actually capable for this type of thing? should I just find other people to work on it, people who are much more smarter and patient and disciplined than me? should I give up?</p>
<p>I really want to give up. But then, I ask myself, is this it? Is this really the end of my journey? How can I leave something in the middle of working on it? How can I stop at things not working? I need to finish this, no matter how hard it appears.</p>
<p>And I keep chipping away, keep fighting against this endless barrage of walls and problems, with the childlike hope that I will somehow make it to the other side.</p>
<p>Maybe some day it will get easier, or maybe this is what it&#39;s always going to be like.</p>
<p>The only question I ask myself is, what is the alternative? If not this, then what? And honestly, I have no good answers. As frustrating as coding can be, I am still in love with it. I love to see my code work, I love it when people can use it, play with it. I love building things, solving problems. I love making progress through difficult challenges.</p>
<p>Coding is actually hard, but you can make it through. Just keep chipping away at the problem, one bug at a time.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
