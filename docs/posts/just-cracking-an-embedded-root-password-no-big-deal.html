    <h1>Just cracking an embedded root password, no big deal</h1>
    
    
<p>
Yeah, I&#39;m still here.  I&#39;m still processing things from last month.  
Obviously.

I just spent a few CPU hours on cracking something stupid and figured 
I&#39;d share the results so nobody else goes through the same thing.  Save 
some time and power, you know the thinking.

... and if this means anything to you, then you&#39;ll also be glad to know 
that the default value for &#34;PermitRootLogin&#34; of &#34;prohibit-password&#34; 
should be in place so nobody can get into your device that way.  Test it 
yourself to be sure if you&#39;re worried.  I sure did.
