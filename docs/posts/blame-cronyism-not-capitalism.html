Cronyism.</p><p>“These critiques often confuse capitalism with cronyism, a system of government favoritism toward particular firms,” authors <a href="https://business.baylor.edu/directory/?id=Peter_Klein" target="_blank">Peter G. Klein</a> of Baylor University, <a href="https://business.fsu.edu/person/michael-holmes" target="_blank">R. Michael Holmes Jr.</a> of Florida State University, <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-strategy-and-innovation/staff/njfsi" target="_blank">Nicolai Foss</a> of Copenhagen Business School, <a href="https://business.fau.edu/faculty-research/faculty-profiles/profile/sterjesen.php" target="_blank">Siri Terjesen</a> of Florida Atlantic University, and <a href="https://business.fsu.edu/person/justin-pepe" target="_blank">Justin Pepe</a> of Florida State University wrote in “<a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">Capitalism, Cronyism, and Management Scholarship: A Call for Clarity</a>.”</p><p>Cronyism can plague any economic system, Klein explained, across the spectrum of free-market economies to governmentally controlled environments. “The essential distinction is not so much which of those systems you’re in, but whether firms primarily get capital and become profitable by beating the competition in the marketplace, or having some kind of privilege they get from knowing someone in power.”</p><p>“Critics would say, ‘capitalism increases inequality, it favors the wealthy at the expense of the poor.’ And maybe in places like India or China, and other parts of the developing world, they would say, ‘capitalist industries are causing environmental harm and inadequate healthcare,’” Klein said. He added that post-Soviet economies in Eastern Europe experienced “devastating environmental degradation and pollution under communist regimes.” Russian oligarchs, whose wealth and power arise from government favoritism, represent one example of cronyism.</p><p>Criticisms of capitalism, “both from the progressive left and the populist right,” are not new, the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors wrote</a>, noting that the theme of the 2013 <a href="https://aom.org/events/annual-meeting/past-annual-meetings" target="_blank">Annual Meeting</a> of the <a href="https://aom.org/" target="_blank">Academy of Management</a> was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeDAKMxsU2c" target="_blank">Capitalism in Question</a>.”</p><figure id="mid1"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/cms/10.5465/amp.2019.0198.summary/asset/images/medium/amp.2019.0198-chart1.png" data-src="/cms/10.5465/amp.2019.0198.summary/asset/images/medium/amp.2019.0198-chart1.png" title="" alt="" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>“Our core argument is that such cronyism is distinct from capitalism, that some government interventions to address the apparent shortcomings of capitalism invite cronyism, and that conflating cronyism and capitalism has negative consequences,” <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">they wrote</a>.</p><p>“Say you’ve got a teenager at home. You go away for the weekend and leave a fully stocked liquor cabinet unlocked. Is something bad going to happen? Not necessarily. But you’ve opened the door for something bad to happen,” Klein said. “We’re saying that to the extent that the state has influence over directing resources in the economy, you’re providing an incentive for potential beneficiaries to try to get that system to work in their favor. How do you control that? You clamp down on cronyism, you pass anti-crony laws. That’s like laying down the rules for your teenager, setting up security cameras, and coming home early to check on things. Another alternative is not to have a fully stocked liquor cabinet. As long as we have systems in which the state has an influence on picking winners and losers, that creates an incentive for organizations to do whatever it takes to be the winners.”</p><h2 id="_i3">Legal and illegal activities</h2><p>Cronyism—which the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors defined</a> as a “system in which firms receive advantages over rivals from their influence with government officials, rather than a superior ability to create value for consumers”—can include both illegal and legal activities.</p><figure id="mid2"><img src="https://blog.jonnew.com/cms/10.5465/amp.2019.0198.summary/asset/images/medium/amp.2019.0198-chart2.png" data-src="/cms/10.5465/amp.2019.0198.summary/asset/images/medium/amp.2019.0198-chart2.png" title="" alt="" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>Illegal activities can include:</p><ul><li><p>Bribes</p></li><li><p>Kickbacks</p></li><li><p>Nepotism</p></li></ul><p>Legal activities, or corporate political activity (CPA), can include:</p><ul><li><p>Lobbying</p></li><li><p>Campaign contributions</p></li><li><p>Lawsuits and patent disputes</p></li><li><p>Advertising and marketing that creates favorable impressions among regulators</p></li><li><p>Having former government officials as board members</p></li></ul><p>“If you’re Boeing, Raytheon, or Lockheed Martin, of course you want retired generals on the board of directors because they know how the military works, they give you legitimacy, they can really help your company run better. But I think many of us believe that the real reason companies put those people on their boards is because they feel like they’ll get an edge when it comes to getting government contracts. Is it illegal? Definitely not. Is it unethical? Maybe it’s a gray area. But what we’re arguing is that by setting up a system in which retired politicians can serve on boards, you’re opening the door to potential abuse,” Klein said.</p><p>“There are lots of ways that companies might try to influence decision-makers; bureaucrats, agency personnel, elected representatives, and so forth. Not all of them are illegal,” he said. “We want to suggest that an analysis of the implications of those activities shows that it doesn’t really matter whether it’s legal or illegal.”</p><p>“Although the legality and (sometimes) transparency of CPA blurs the line between cronyism and capitalism in the eyes of many critics, we think CPA is neither essential to capitalism nor inevitable in free-market economies,” the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors wrote</a>.</p><p>Governments often create cronyism by interfering with free-market forces, even when it comes to areas of deep public interest, such as health, education, or the environment, the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors argued</a>.</p><p>“The more interventions government supports to overcome presumed shortcomings in the market, the more opportunities there are for abuse. And the more difficult it is for outsiders to distinguish between a legitimate intervention to correct a market-related problem and cronyism,” Klein said.</p><h2 id="_i5">Big push policies</h2><p>Even well-intentioned government intervention can go awry, Klein noted, as in the case of Solyndra executives misleading the Obama White House and other federal officials to obtain $535 million in government-backed loans as part of a clean energy program. The company went bankrupt after being unable to compete with other solar panel manufacturers.</p><p>“Many countries have adopted ‘big push’ industrial policies that rely on government intervention to foster industrialization. For example, Japanese and Korean governments selected strategically important industrial sectors believed to be critical to economic development (electronics, communications, heavy manufacturing, infrastructure, and transportation) and directed government resources and policies to facilitate those sectors’ development in the aftermath of World War II and the Korean War, respectively. These governments funneled financial resources to select firms through tax policies, government subsidies, and low- or zero-interest loans, and enacted protectionist policies such as import quotas and special access to business licenses to protect the focal firms from foreign and domestic competition,” the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors wrote</a>. “The resulting ‘big push,’ in turn, was followed by industrialization and economic growth in both countries. Similar approaches to economic development have been tried in Argentina, Israel, Russia, and several other East Asian countries.”</p><p>“Such policies can produce long-term harm,” <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">they wrote</a>. “For example, while politically favored firms in emerging markets can thrive and grow, other firms are likely to stagnate and fail. Similarly, many large and politically connected firms oppose the emergence of innovative startups that represent new sources of competition. As a result, the ‘big push’ policies ultimately hindered the long-term development of innovative startups in Japan and Korea. Moreover, close ties between government and business likely contributed to the [1997] Asian financial crisis by stifling or delaying needed regulatory reforms, enabling poor corporate governance, and allocating capital inefficiently (on the basis of political ties). Both Japan and Korea also experienced major bribery scandals and criminal indictments of executives and government officials, the failure of firms that were supported by government, and setbacks in the development of entire industries (Japanese casinos). In turn, ‘big push’ policies created short-term benefits and economic development, but helped foster long-run slowdowns in both countries (especially Japan). Similar long-term problems have been observed elsewhere, notably in many African, Latin American, and other East Asian countries.”</p><h2 id="_i6">Social welfare consequences</h2><p>The <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0198" target="_blank">authors’ analysis</a> of scholarly management and economics articles identified “at least six ways that cronyism reduces social welfare:” </p><ol><li><p>“The direct costs of cronyism divert capital from more productive uses. In 2018, for example, candidates for each seat in the U.S. Congress spent an average of $12.2 million per election, and that average has increased by 175% since 2010 (Center for Responsive Politics, 2019). During that period, the two U.S. presidential elections cost an average of $2.5 billion. Most costs are funded by campaign contributions from individuals and organizations, including private businesses and unions. … Moreover, the World Bank estimates that over $1 trillion is spent annually on <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/annals.2018.0156.summary" target="_blank">bribes</a>, which is nearly 2% of global GDP.”</p></li><li><p>“Institutions established to prevent, monitor, or prosecute cronyism create substantial indirect costs. … Countries establish campaign finance rules and anti-corruption statutes which must then be monitored by their governments and by international bodies, such as the U.N. Convention against Corruption and E.U. Anti-Corruption Convention. Taxpayers tend to bear much of the costs of creating and maintaining such institutions.”</p></li><li><p>“Cronyism undermines the impartiality of economic and legal institutions. Politically connected firms can enjoy judicial and regulatory exemptions and treatment, as well as superior access to government contracts, grants, loans, and other financial resources.”</p></li><li><p>“Cronyism reduces the overall effectiveness of institutions. Cronyism incentivizes government officials to enact more regulations, which increases their opportunity to solicit financial contributions (legal or otherwise) in exchange for regulatory favors.”</p></li><li><p>“Cronyism … can create vicious cycles that stunt economic development. The unpredictability, favoritism, poor property rights, and lack of transparency hinder entrepreneurship, access to external capital, domestic startup activity, and foreign firms’ entry.”</p></li><li><p>“Cronyism is associated with a variety of social problems,” including inadequate access to safe water, malnutrition, poor medical care, and lax environmental protections.</p></li></ol><p>Klein offered these recommendations:</p><ul><li><p>For <b>policy makers</b>: “As you think about ways that you might want to intervene in the market, be aware of the opportunities for cronyism that you might be creating.”</p></li><li><p>For <b>managers</b>: “As you are encouraged by your stakeholders and public opinion to be more politically aware and active, and to think about the social impact of what you do, be on guard for things that you might do or people might want you to do, that really are taking the form of getting special benefits for your firm, from politicians with whom you have relationships. Be aware that as you move into the political sphere, there will be temptations for you to engage in unethical crony activity.”</p></li><li><p>For <b>consultants</b> and <b>educators</b>: “If you research, teach, or consult about social responsibility and political activism, be mindful of inadvertently encouraging cronyism by bringing business and politics closer together.”</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://mises.org/library/peter-klein-cronyism-capitalism-and-entrepreneurial-pathway" target="_blank"><b>Peter Klein discusses cronyism, capitalism, and entrepreneurship in this podcast.</b></a></p></div></div>
