    <p>We recently published a <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">blog
post</a>
with our reaction to the new Google Developer Program and how it impacts
your freedom to use the devices that you own in the ways that you want. The
post garnered quite a lot of feedback and interest from the community and
press, as well as various civil society groups and regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>In this post, I hope to clarify and expand on some of the points and rebut
some of the counter-messaging that we have witnessed.</p>

<h3 id="googles-message-that-sideloading-is-not-going-away-is-clear-concise-and-false">Google’s message that “Sideloading is Not Going Away” is clear, concise, and false</h3>

<p>Shortly after our post was published, Google aired an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7DEhW-mjdc&amp;t=613s">episode</a> of their
Android Developers Roundtable series, where they state unequivocally that
“sideloading isn’t going anywhere”. They follow-up with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html">blog
post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Does this mean sideloading is going away on Android?</strong> Absolutely not. Sideloading is fundamental to Android and it is not going away.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is untrue. The developer verification decree effectively ends
the ability for individuals to choose what software they run on the devices
they own.</p>

<p>It bears reminding that “sideload” is a made-up term. Putting software on
your computer is simply called “installing”, regardless of whether that
computer is in your pocket or on your desk. This could perhaps be further
precised as “<em>direct</em> installing”, in case you need to make a distinction
between obtaining software the old-fashioned way versus going through a
rent-seeking intermediary marketplace like the Google Play Store or the
Apple App Store.</p>

<p>Regardless, the term “sideload” was coined to insinuate that there is
something dark and sinister about the process, as if the user were making an
end-run around safeguards that are designed to keep you protected and
secure. But if we reluctantly accept that “sideloading” is a term that has
wriggled its way into common parlance, then we should at least use a
consistent definition for it. Wikipedia’s summary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">definition</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>the transfer of apps from web sources that are not vendor-approved</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this definition, Google’s statement that “sideloading is not going away”
is simply <em>false</em>. The vendor — Google, in the case of Android certified
devices — will, in point of fact, be approving the source. The supplicant
app developer must register with Google, pay a fee, provide government
identification, agree to non-negotiable (and ever-changing) terms and
conditions, enumerate all their current and future application identifiers,
upload evidence of their private signing key, and then hope and wait for
Google’s approval.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-means-for-your-rights">What this means for your rights</h3>

<p>You, the consumer, purchased your Android device believing in Google’s
promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run
whatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will
be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that
irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement
over what software you are permitted to trust.</p>

<p>You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with
your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google’s
approval. The promise of Android — and a marketing advantage it has used to
distinguish itself against the iPhone — has always been that it is
“open”. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the
Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can
now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.</p>

<p>You, the state, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital
sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the
extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal
apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the
running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the
opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation. Monocultures are
perilous not just in agriculture, but in software distribution as well.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this applies not just to devices that exclusively use the
Google Play Store: this is for <em>every</em> Android Certified device <em>everywhere</em>
in the world, which encompasses over 95% of all Android devices outside of
China. Regardless of whether the device owner prefers to use a competing app
store like the Samsung Galaxy Store or the Epic Games Store, or a free and
open-source app repository like F-Droid, they will be captive to the
overarching policies unilaterally dictated by a competing corporate entity.</p>

<h3 id="the-place-of-greater-safety">The place of greater safety</h3>

<p>In promoting their developer registration program, Google
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">purports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our recent analysis found over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We haven’t seen this recent analysis — or any other supporting evidence —
but the “50 times” multiple does certainly sound like great cause for
distress (even if it is a surprisingly round number). But given the recent
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/224-malicious-apps-removed-from-the-google-play-store-after-ad-fraud-campaign-discovered">news</a>
of “224 malicious apps removed from the Google Play Store after ad fraud
campaign discovered”, we are left to wonder whether their energies might
better be spent assessing and improving their own safeguards rather than
casting vague disparagements against the software development communities
that thrive outside their walled garden.</p>

<p>In addition, other recent
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/apps_android_malware/">news</a> of over
19 million downloads of malware from the Play Store leads us to question
whether the sole judgement of a single corporate entity can be trusted to
identify and assess malware, especially when that judgement is clouded by
commercial incentives that may not align with the well-being of their users.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h3>

<p>Google has been facing public outcry against their heavy-handed policies for
a long time, but this trend has accelerated recently. Last year they
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/">crippled
ad-blockers</a>
in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers by forcing through their unpopular
“manifest v3” requirement for plugins, and earlier this year they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">closed
off</a>
the development of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is how they
were able to clandestinely implement the verification infrastructure that
enforces their developer registration decree.</p>

<p>Developer verification is an existential threat to free software
distribution platforms like F-Droid as well as emergent commercial
competitors to the Play Store. We are witnessing a groundswell of opposition
to this attempt from both our user and developer communities, as well as the
tech press and civil society groups, but public policymakers still need to
be educated about the threat.</p>

<a href="https://keepandroidopen.org">keepandroidopen.org</a> for information on how to
contact your representative agencies and advocate for keeping the Android
ecosystem open for consumers and competition.</p>

<p>If you are an app developer, we recommend against signing yourself up for
Google’s developer registration program at this time. We unequivocally
reject their attempt to force this program upon the world.</p>

<p>Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone. Google does not own
your phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust,
and where you can get your software from.</p>
