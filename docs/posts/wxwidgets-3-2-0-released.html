            <p>After almost 9 years since the beginning of the last wxWidgets stable release
series, the first release in the new stable 3.2 series is finally <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.2.0">available
on GitHub</a>. You will find there archives with the library sources and
documentation as well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as
<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Visual C++</a>,
<a href="https://mingw-w64.org/">MinGW-w64</a> and
<a href="https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/">TDM-GCC</a>. You can also read the
<a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.0/">updated documentation</a> for this version and, in particular, if you’re
new to wxWidgets, you may find the <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.0/overview_install.html">installation guide</a> a good starting
point.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-this-release">Changes in this release</h3>

<p>This release is a culmination of many years of development since the
last stable 3.0 release. It contains more than 15,000 commits from more
than 400 unique contributors (including more than 200 with multiple
contributions) and has too many improvements to list them all here, but
here is a maximally condensed summary of the most important ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build system improvements: support for new compilers (up to MSVS 2022,
g++ 12, clang 14) with an even simpler way of using wxWidgets from
MSVS, with <code>wxwidgets.props</code> file, as well as an entirely new CMake build
system.</li>
  <li>Support for native dark mode under macOS 10.14 and later, support for
ARM hardware and macOS versions up to 13.</li>
  <li>High DPI support with the new, but almost perfectly backwards-
compatible, API based on <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.0/classwx_bitmap_bundle.html">wxBitmapBundle</a>, including per-monitor DPI and
dynamic DPI changes.</li>
  <li>New features: HTTPS and HTTP/2 support with <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.0/classwx_web_request.html">wxWebRequest</a> and friends;
support for freezing rows/columns in wxGrid; mouse gesture events
(GSoC 2017 project); non-integer font sizes and arbitrary font weights
in wxFont; fractional pen widths in wxGraphicsContext; arbitrary label
windows in wxStaticBox; markup in wxDataViewCtrl items text; support
for ZIP 64 files; LZMA compression; much improved accessibility
support under MSW; new Edge-based wxWebView implementation; support for
using native spell-checking in wxTextCtrl; new PCRE-based wxRegEx.</li>
  <li>New classes: wxActivityIndicator, wxAddRemoveCtrl, wxAppProgressIndicator,
wxBitmapBundle, wxNativeWindow, wxPersistentComboBox,
wxPowerResourceBlocker, wxSecretStore, wxTempFFile, wxUILocale and many new
features in the existing classes.</li>
  <li>New XRC handlers for all the new and some of the existing classes.</li>
  <li>Significant improvements to: wxBusyInfo, wxDataViewCtrl, wxDirDialog, wxGrid,
wxNotificationMessage, wxSpinCtrl, wxStaticBox, wxStyledTextCtrl,
wxUIActionSimulator.</li>
  <li>Improvements to compile-time safety with the possibility to disable dangerous
implicit conversions between wxString and <code>char*</code> strings.</li>
  <li>Latest versions of all bundled 3rd party libraries, including all the
security fixes and support for WebKit 2 and GStreamer 1.7 under Unix.</li>
  <li>Better, even if still perfectible, Wayland support in wxGTK.</li>
  <li>Revamped OpenGL support better suited to modern OpenGL (3.2+).</li>
  <li>Further C++11 and later support improvements, wxWidgets can be built using
C++20 compilers.</li>
  <li>New experimental wxQt port.</li>
  <li>Many, many bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in spite of all these changes, wxWidgets 3.2.0 is almost fully
compatible with wxWidgets 3.0 and updating the existing applications to
use it shouldn’t require much effort. But please do read the (relatively
short) section listing the incompatible changes in the beginning of the
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.0/docs/changes.txt">change log file</a> if you’re upgrading from a previous wxWidgets version.</p>
