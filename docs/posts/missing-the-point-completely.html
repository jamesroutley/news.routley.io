Today, I'll share a story about someone from marketing who was trying to 
make things happen and really stepped in it.  It goes like this: a bunch 
of us engineer types are invited to a meeting with someone from 
marketing.  We don't know the first thing about marketing in general, or 
even the particulars of it at this company.  But they want to chat and 
hey, it's an excuse to not "work", so why not go see what they want?
</p><p>
We'll call this person A.  A gets up there and it's pretty clear they're 
the sort of loose, goofy and hopefully funny... almost hippie type... 
you've heard about.  It makes sense.  You need to be creative for that 
job, and they're the creative type.  So far, so good.
</p><p>
A proceeds to tell a story about this big "tent-pole" movie that was 
coming out.  All of the nerds were going to want to see this latest 
movie in a series that went back a couple of decades.  Plus, it'd 
successfully slopped over into non-nerd life, such that a bunch of 
regular people would also be excited about it coming out.
</p><p>
Marketing saw this coming and proceeded to reach out to the company that 
worked on the movies.  They wanted to do a partnership where the 
company's product would change for the weekend of the movie's 
opening.  Instead of having the usual little icons for whatever it is 
they did (dog walking, pizza delivery, you know the type of company), 
there'd be icons of characters and certain well-known and well-loved 
vehicles from the franchise zipping around.
</p><p>
All they had to was get it written and out the door in advance of the 
movie.  The marketing folks sat down with the engineering peeps and laid 
it out.  They were told right then and there "no can do".  Even though 
they had all kinds of time in which to do this kind of "theming" of the 
app, they knew they couldn't do it.  That's how bad it was at this 
company.
</p><p>
Anyway, A told us this story, and used it as a basis for asking if 
anyone could help solve the fundamental disconnect that kept the company 
from doing cool things.  It was basically a "this is why we can't have 
nice things" story, but at the same time it was a cry for help.  Since 
they were at the mercy of the software people who had to add the actual 
icons and toggles and features into the app (and backend stuff), they 
were stuck.
</p><p>
Towards the end, A told the audience a story about what happens if you 
have a product that might be good in theory but has terrible marketing.  
As part of this part of the talk, they put up a slide.  You might've 
been wondering what the hell was with the image I put at the top of this 
post.  Well, that's what was on the slide.
</p><p>
For people who are using text to speech or otherwise can't see the 
image, I'll describe it here: it's a bog-standard conference room with a 
projector screen, and the only thing on the screen is "clownpenis.fart" 
- like a URL, only not.  There are also some white blocks where I cut 
out a few people who would otherwise be identifiable (including the 
speaker).
</p><p>
When I saw this, I didn't get it.  My own reaction was along the lines 
of "heh" from my inner 12 year old and also "what?" and "I guess I'm 
missing the reference".  Someone quickly informed me that it was a 
callback to a Saturday Night Live skit that aired around 2000.  I had 
stopped watching SNL by then, and so that's why it was off my radar.  
Easy enough.
</p><p>
I had to go back and watch it - you can still find it online if you're 
interested.  It's about an investment firm that is solid and has been 
around forever, but is only now (2000, remember) "getting online" - 
establishing a "web presence", if you will.  They waited too long and 
so got the "last domain name available" - the aforementioned 
<em>clownpenis.fart</em>.  This ran on national TV, albeit late on a 
Saturday night some 22 years ago.  (And yes, that's the voice of Jerry 
from Rick and Morty.)
</p><p>
Basically, the presenter was trying to get people to connect the dots by 
using something funny that they had seen in the past.  It didn't work.  
Oh, did it ever not work.
</p><p>
For the next month, all you could hear about in the company was that A 
did the wrong thing, and shouldn't have said that, and they should 
apologize, and what are we going to do about this sort of 
communications issue, and so on.
</p><p>
Personally, I filed it under "stupid", not "hostile", but that was me at 
that point in time.  I had plenty of "buffer space" in my life.
</p><p>
What's kind of amazing is that nobody ever mentioned the "we can't have 
nice things because eng is fundamentally unable to do the simplest, 
stupidest adjustments to our 'chrome' which would surprise and delight 
our customers".  That went COMPLETELY unnoticed and was largely 
forgotten.
</p><p>
The company continued to be unable to have nice things.
