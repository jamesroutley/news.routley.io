Just look at the huge variety of translations of the first line of </span><em>The Odyssey</em><span>! There are over 70… and man oh man do they change the tone of the epic, to say the least. </span></p><p><span>Indeed, it can be difficult to decide which version of the word the author intended because we just don’t think </span><em>exactly</em><span> like ancient Greeks. The huge differences in time and culture can make it tricky to figure out what they really meant.</span></p><p>So while actually dedicating years to learning this beautiful and complicated ancient language might not be the most practical use of your time, I do think you should at least learn a few of the most important concepts.</p><p>In fact, I reckon these 12 terms should definitely make a comeback in our current society… and that we might be a lot better for it… check them out below and let me know if you agree. </p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><span>All the best,</span></p><p>Founder and Director</p><p>Classical Wisdom and Classical Wisdom Kids</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/12-ancient-greek-terms-that-should?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/12-ancient-greek-terms-that-should?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><strong>1.

The person of Arete is of the highest effectiveness; they use all their faculties—strength, bravery, and wit—to achieve real results.

Kleos (Greek: </strong><em><strong>κλέος</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p>Kleos is invariably transferred from father to son; the son is responsible for carrying on and building upon the “glory” of the father. This is a reason for Penelope putting off her suitors for so long, and one justification for Medea’s murder of her own children was to cut short Jason’s kleos. Kleos is sometimes related to aidos — the sense of shame.</p><p><strong>5. Xenia (Greek: </strong><em><strong>ξενία</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>6.

It uses the word νόστος along with another Greek root, άλγος or algos, meaning pain, to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past.</p><p><strong>8. Oikos (Greek: </strong><em><strong>οἶκος</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p>The oikos was the basic unit of society in most Greek city-states. In normal Attic usage the oikos, in the context of families, referred to a line of descent from father to son from generation to generation. Alternatively, as Aristotle used it in his Politics, the term was sometimes used to refer to everybody living in a given house. Thus, the head of the oikos, along with his immediate family and his slaves, would all be encompassed. Large oikoi also had farms that were usually tended by the slaves, which were also the basic agricultural unit of the ancient economy.</p><p><strong>9. Apatheia (Greek: </strong><em><strong>ἀπάθεια</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>10. Ataraxia (Greek: </strong><em><strong>ἀταραξία</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p><span>Achieving ataraxia is a common goal for Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and </span><a href="https://classicalwisdom.com/philosophy/stoicism/" rel="">Stoicism</a><span>, but the role and value of ataraxia within each philosophy varies depending their philosophical theories. The mental disturbances that prevent one from achieving ataraxia vary among the philosophies, and each philosophy has a different understanding as to how to achieve ataraxia.</span></p><p><strong>11. Doxa (Greek: </strong><em><strong>δόξα</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>12. Episteme (Greek: </strong><em><strong>ἐπιστήμη</strong></em><strong>) and Techne (Greek: </strong><em><strong>τέχνη</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p><p>Meanwhile Techne is often translated as “craftsmanship”, “craft”, or “art”. While it resembles epistēmē in the implication of knowledge of principles, techne differs in that its intent is making or doing as opposed to disinterested understanding. However, Plato regularly used the two terms interchangeably, and to the ancients, techne and episteme simply mean knowing and “both words are names for knowledge in the widest sense.”</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
