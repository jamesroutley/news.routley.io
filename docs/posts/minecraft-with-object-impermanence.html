							<p>I generally am uninterested in generative AI that&#39;s too close to the real thing. But every once in a while there&#39;s a modern AI thing that&#39;s so glitchy and broken that it&#39;s strangely compelling.

Look at a mountain, look away, and look back at it, and the mountain&#39;s completely gone. </p><p>I found myself in this wooden cavern (which I did not build; I just came across it like a natural formation):</p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image.png" alt="AI-generated minecraft screenshot of a cavern made entirely of wooden boards, stretching up more than a story and out away into the shadows.

There&#39;s no underlying physics engine, no library of standard block or creature types and their properties, which means that things like half blocks and quarter blocks can exist. You can dig a hole exactly wide enough for yourself and then fail to fall into it, no matter how much you jump up and down over the opening. The blocks in the landscape are only approximations, and if you approach them they seem to shift and morph, attempting to look casual. I walked toward the torchlit area in the screenshot above, and there was a point at which the torchlit &#34;stone&#34; got too bright and texture-y, so it morphed into birch tree bark. </p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-2.png" alt="Closeup of a cavern interior with one wall made of smooth stone (with a torch mounted on it) and the other wall made of a jumble of wooden boards and white-speckled black material.

Noise in a generative algorithm usually comes in the form of strong striped patterns, so by continually staring in the same direction you force the &#34;Minecraft&#34; algorithm to keep generating new frames based on accumulating noise. A somewhat ordinary stone cliff face gradually loses what definition it has, becoming blocky and flat as it seems to panic.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-11.png" width="1692" height="1584" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-11.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/image-11.png 1000w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/11/image-11.png 1600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-11.png 1692w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-12.png" width="1690" height="1590" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-12.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/11/image-12.png 1600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-12.png 1690w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-13.png" width="1690" height="1578" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-13.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/image-13.png 1000w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/11/image-13.png 1600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-13.png 1690w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>A natural cave turns in three frames from a sort of plausible looking feature in the side of a mountainside, to a weirdly smooth shadow on an ill-defined crease in the landscape.

Also my hunger bar is rapidly decreasing for some reason, and my health is going down. The next several frames were extremely hard-to-interpret blocky chaos, but eventually I popped out into an ordinary desert.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>At another point, I jumped into this ordinary bush, which became a deep, dark forest.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-27.png" width="837" height="785" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-27.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-27.png 837w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-28.png" width="828" height="779" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-28.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-28.png 828w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-29.png" width="832" height="783" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image-29.png 600w, https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-29.png 832w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>Note that the tiny bush on the left is about two blocks wide, then becomes a clump of about 20 bush-blocks as I get closer, then morphs into a lush forest with deep green leaves and thick trunks.

I don&#39;t think anything I do has any effect on my actual health - I think the AI just generally predicts that health sometimes goes up or down a little between gameplay frames, and that it goes down faster when you&#39;re in the presence of things that are generally flame-colored. Occasionally an apple or a carrot would appear in my inventory, but attempting to eat them didn&#39;t affect my health levels.</p><p>I did have an inventory the entire time, although I cropped it out in the above screenshots because they were masked by the controls every time I paused playback. The inventory never made sense. It was mostly empty, except for when the occasional pickaxe or chunk of dirt appeared there for a while. If I tried to use a pickaxe, it might appear in my hand for a few strokes and then apparently wander off again. Less identifiable stuff would appear in my inventory too, which never seemed to do anything when I tried to use it.</p><p>I tried to place a crafting table, but only got half-readable text saying &#34;crafting table&#34;. The regular Minecraft game uses a message like this to announce your success at making a crafting table the first time you manage it - this usually happens early enough in the Minecraft game that it probably came up a lot in training. Occasionally AI Minecraft will give me other messages in the same white text, but they&#39;re even harder to interpret.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-23.png" alt="A tranquil-looking area of faintly green grass and a couple of red flowers on a gentle slope farther out.

Most of the inventory is unidentifiable and ununsable, so I couldn&#39;t get anything I did on this screen to have an effect on the items I had access to when playing in the map. By the time I gave up checking my inventory, I ended up with less in my ready inventory than when I had started.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-26.png" alt="This screen looks a lot like the inventory screen, except the player has mostly dirt blocks (realistic for minecraft actually) and a few sticks.

If I want to build a structure I&#39;m better off staring at a mountain until the stones resolve into a wooden wall. If I manage to build or accomplish anything at all, I can&#39;t take my eyes off it or it will immediately disappear. This makes it pretty much impossible to make any progress in the game. The game loads with a list of &#34;goals&#34; beside the gameplay window, but as far as I can tell, there&#39;s no way to make these happen on purpose, nor does the game itself know when you&#39;ve achieved them.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2024/11/image-30.png" alt="The (human-written) game screen lists four goals: 1. Kill a zombie and have rotten meat drop. 2. Explode a creeper. 3. Get shot by a skeleton. 4. Punch the ender dragon.

The original Minecraft is already infinitely playable, thanks to the way it randomly generates a 7x-larger-than-planet-Earth landscape with each new game. You can&#39;t use generative AI like this to get a new kind of game, only a better simulation of the game you trained it on.</p><p>I wonder if this glitchy, dreamlike landscape is already as good as it gets. It reminds me of my first time playing an early <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/dungeon-crawling-or-lucid-dreaming-19-09-11/" rel="noreferrer">AI-generated imitation of a text-based dungeon crawling game</a>, where lack of memory and comprehension caused the game to constantly shift in entertaining ways.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aiweirdness.com/content/images/2025/01/image.png" alt="Block text reads &#34;You are standing on the main road.

Counterfeit games where the first several seconds of gameplay appear to be a new game, but then it messily devolves into minecraft?
