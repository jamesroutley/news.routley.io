    <h1>Make your health insurance company cry: One woman&#39;s fight to turn the tables</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For San Francisco tech worker Holden Karau, paperwork had become a hobby. </p><p>Specifically, the forms and letters required to fight back when her health insurance provider denied a claim for a covered service, surgery, or pharmaceutical. </p><p>As a trans woman who loves motorcycles, she has required gender-affirming care and treatments for an accident in recent years, and received a spate of insurance denials along the way. </p><p>Instead of passively accepting the providers’ decisions, she’d spend hours writing letters and filling out forms to appeal. It usually worked: Out of roughly 40 denials, she won more than 90% of her appeals, she estimates. (She also successfully fought an insurance denial for her dog, Professor Timbit.) </p><p>“Part of that is an unreasonable willingness to take things too far,” Karau said. “There’s an enjoyment in getting a counterparty to follow the rules that they don’t seem to want to have to follow.”</p></div><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person wearing a pink shirt and a smartwatch is working on a laptop.

It’s free for users, though she might eventually charge for added services like faxing appeals.</p><p>At this point, she’s not planning on leaving her tech job to work on the platform full time (she has held gigs at IBM, Apple, Google, and Netflix, where she currently works) but hopes it can become a self-sustaining business, in addition to a cause about which she’s wildly passionate. </p><p>“The best-case scenario — which is, admittedly, incredibly unlikely — is that this increases the accessibility of appeals to the point that insurance companies stop denying so much tiny bullshit,” she said. “I suspect that they would still try to be dicks about big things, but hopefully we can get them to stop being dicks about small things.”</p></div></div></div>
