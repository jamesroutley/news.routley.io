          <div><p>October now seems the best bet to catch up with scarcer gulls at the Wetlands. Photographs suggest there may have been three <strong>caspian gulls</strong> seen this month (and perhaps four over the Autumn) with 1Ws seen on the 19th, 21st, 22nd, 25th and 28th. The month also seems the best time to catch up with <strong>yellow-legged gulls </strong>at the reservoirs<strong>. </strong> The first was an adult found on the 11th by CF remarkably on the same day and the same railings on High Maynard as last year. This was followed by a run of young birds with DC finding a 1W on the 14th, three on 21st - six days later than three were seen last year - with one remaining on the 24th.</p></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><div><p>October is also a good month for <strong>jackdaw</strong> passage and although numbers did not run into the hundreds as they did in 2019, 54 were seen on the 16th and 42 on 9th with smaller numbers both over and on the reservoirs on other days. <strong>Skylark</strong> movement was also stronger than last year when only five were seen all month. Birds were recorded on at least six days with three on both the 8th &amp; 24th.                         </p>
<p>Single <strong>swallows, </strong> which were not seen in October last year, were recorded on the 3rd, 9th and 20th with a late <strong>reed warbler</strong> as well on the 2nd. <strong> Blackcaps</strong> are not regular winterers at the reservoirs so the male seen on the 31st may again be a late migrant. The first<strong> irecrest</strong> of the year was heard at the north end of Lockwood on the 22nd by DC and was still there, and still hidden, next day. </p>
<p><strong>Fieldfare</strong> passage, just like last year, was light with just the odd bird over or on the reservoirs until a flock of 50 on the 24th. This was not the case with <strong>redwing </strong>although movement was crammed into two days. Over 60 were seen on the 8th before an estimated 1000-plus flew over next day - twice the highest daily count last year. </p>
