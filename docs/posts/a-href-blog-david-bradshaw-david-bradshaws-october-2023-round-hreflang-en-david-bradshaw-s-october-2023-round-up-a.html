  <div>
    <div><p>October saw five species added to the Wetland&#39;s year list with three smart drake common scoter and a pintail - both the first for two years - as well as a grey plover the highlights. Lesser redpoll and a heard-only firecrest were the other additions in a month which also saw a run of scarcer gulls, a late arctic tern, short-eared owl and a day count of 1000 migrating redwing. </p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The five additions take the year list at the reservoirs to 143 - eight ahead of last year and just one behind&#39;s 2020&#39;s record high. Red-crested Pochard, which gave the Wetlands a miss last year as well, and Brent Goose are the only obvious gaps so adding new species is going to be hard.</p>
<p>Three <strong>shelduck</strong> made an unseasonal visit on the 18th and a <strong>garganey</strong> was found on East Warwick on the 3rd. After being very scarce so far this year, <strong>wigeon</strong> returned to form with records on at least seven days with five on the 24th and seven on the 18th. The first <strong>pintail</strong> for two years was a female-type found by RE hiding among the <strong>shoveler</strong> on No 5 on the 9th.    </p>
<p><strong>Common scoter</strong>, like <strong>pintail</strong>,<strong> </strong>are nearly annual visitors to the Wetlands but again none were seen in 2022. This year looked likely to be blank as well until CF found three drakes on Lockwood on the 12th. They were flighty at first but settled down on East Warwick for the day. CF also found three<strong> ringed teal</strong> on No 5 on the 27th but, while very attractive ducks, they seem much more likely to have escaped from a wildfowl collection than flown from their natural home in South America. Unusually, neither the first <strong>goldeneye</strong> or <strong>goosander</strong> of the winter had arrived by the month&#39;s end.  </p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>After the departure of the wintering <strong>great egret</strong>, the species has been scarce with DC&#39;s fly-over on the 14th only the fourth of the year. The only record of <strong>red kite</strong> was on the 3rd but <strong>buzzards</strong> were seen on at least four days including a year-high count of six in the air together on the 9th - one of several good days this month for migrants. </p>
<p>October is usually light on waders but this year bucked the trend with no less than nine species compared to just four in 2022. Single <strong>lapwing</strong> was seen on the 18th and 27th with two on both the 17th  &amp; 24th. <strong>Grey plover</strong> is a very scarce visitor with no records since 2018 before the big freeze last December saw one on Lockwood so DC&#39;s record of one flying north over Lockwood on the 2nd was the wader highlight of the month. <strong>Black-tailed odwits </strong>are usually much more regular but the four going south on the 12th were surprisingly only the second record of the year. The same date saw a <strong>dunlin </strong>on Lockwood.  </p>
<p>Migrant <strong>snipe</strong> were resting on the reservoir banks on several days with two on the 9th but the <strong>jack snipe</strong> that dropped onto the shoreline of East Warwick on the 28th was only the second of the year. The autumn&#39;s strong <strong>common sandpiper</strong> passage continued with birds throughout the month, Four were still present on the 24th - a fortnight later than the last bird last October - with two staying to the end of the month to suggest the Wetlands may have wintering birds again. In contrast, the only<strong> green</strong> <strong>sandpiper</strong> was on the 23rd and <strong>redshank</strong> on Lockwood on the 26th. </p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>October now seems the best bet to catch up with scarcer gulls at the Wetlands. Photographs suggest there may have been three <strong>caspian gulls</strong> seen this month (and perhaps four over the Autumn) with 1Ws seen on the 19th, 21st, 22nd, 25th and 28th. The month also seems the best time to catch up with <strong>yellow-legged gulls </strong>at the reservoirs<strong>. </strong> The first was an adult found on the 11th by CF remarkably on the same day and the same railings on High Maynard as last year. This was followed by a run of young birds with DC finding a 1W on the 14th, three on 21st - six days later than three were seen last year - with one remaining on the 24th.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Late terns have always got a good chance of being <strong>arctic terns</strong> and that seems to be case of the bird photographed by MLP on the 20th. After a two-month stay in which it hardly ever showed, the <strong>little owl</strong> was last heard on the 2nd. The third <strong>short-eared owl</strong> was on the 22nd over Lockwood - again on exactly the same date as last year. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>October is also a good month for <strong>jackdaw</strong> passage and although numbers did not run into the hundreds as they did in 2019, 54 were seen on the 16th and 42 on 9th with smaller numbers both over and on the reservoirs on other days. <strong>Skylark</strong> movement was also stronger than last year when only five were seen all month. Birds were recorded on at least six days with three on both the 8th &amp; 24th.                         </p>
<p>Single <strong>swallows, </strong> which were not seen in October last year, were recorded on the 3rd, 9th and 20th with a late <strong>reed warbler</strong> as well on the 2nd. <strong> Blackcaps</strong> are not regular winterers at the reservoirs so the male seen on the 31st may again be a late migrant. The first<strong> irecrest</strong> of the year was heard at the north end of Lockwood on the 22nd by DC and was still there, and still hidden, next day. </p>
<p><strong>Fieldfare</strong> passage, just like last year, was light with just the odd bird over or on the reservoirs until a flock of 50 on the 24th. This was not the case with <strong>redwing </strong>although movement was crammed into two days. Over 60 were seen on the 8th before an estimated 1000-plus flew over next day - twice the highest daily count last year. </p>
