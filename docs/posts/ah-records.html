      <p>One of the last projects I was working on before leaving for the US was <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/hi">hi</a>, a minimal, performant chat system. I&#39;ll talk about this in a later post, but right now I want to focus on a bug that really took me by surprise. It has nothing to do with software development and everything with operations.</p>

<p>While I was on vacation my hosting provider <a href="http://webfaction.com/">Webfaction</a> informed me that they would need to perform a VM migration, which meant my sites would be unavailable for the duration of the maintenance and the IP address would change. Fair enough, I thought. The migration came and went, and I checked whether everything was still in working order. It did, so I went back to visiting distilleries and overeating. This is where you should start to get suspicious. There was an IP change, and everything just worked? Weren&#39;t the A records wrong now? And of course you got it exactly right, for my DNS records are managed by another provider. But my vacation brain wasn&#39;t prepared to think about any of that and the sites <em>seemed</em> to be chugging quite merrily along. So the problem was deferred until it bubbled up a week after I had returned from the US.</p>
<p>The chat service uses WebSockets to distribute messages between clients in real time. WebSockets use regular TCP connections, and its initial handshake uses HTTP. It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>An initial HTTP request is sent. The most important headers to look out for are the <code>Connection</code> header, the value of which should be <code>Upgrade</code>, and the <code>Upgrade</code> header, the value of which should be <code>websocket</code>. There is also a random key being transmitted and some metainformation, but for the sake of this post, we will omit that.</li>
<li>The server responds with the HTTP status code 101 (<code>Switching Protocols</code>). The <code>Upgrade</code> and <code>Connection</code> headers stay the same, the key will be sent back hashed, to identify the connection—not for security reasons.</li>
<li>The connection is now a duplex connection and messages will be sent back and forth using the WebSocket protocol. Yay!</li>
</ol>
<p>This, in connection with the IP change, came back to bite me when I continued to work on the chat application. I realized that the websocket handshake between my browser and the server failed, and thus I couldn&#39;t connect to the chat. Weird. The logs told me that my server found some of the headers needed for a successful handshake were missing—<code>websocket: not a websocket handshake: &#39;websocket&#39; token not found in &#39;Upgrade&#39; header</code>. A quick look into the developer console confirmed that my browser did send that header.</p>
<p>This meant that the header was somehow lost in transmission, and my first guess was that the <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> configuration was somehow mangling the headers. Ironically, at this point I remembered that the migration had happened, but instead of thinking about DNS, I guessed that the NGINX configuration had somehow not been migrated correctly. I wrote a minimal client and server to test my assumptions and started tweaking the controls, to no avail. It soon became obvious that NGINX was actually fine.</p>
<p>At this point I was stumped and had to ask Webfaction for help. They are generally very helpful and great, and when submitting a ticket I never feel as dumb as I probably should. They&#39;re really patient with me, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this hosting provider to anyone who asks.</p>
<h2 id="burned-http-bridges">Burned HTTP Bridges</h2>
<p>It didn&#39;t take long for Webfaction to find the bug—which was surprising, since I opened the ticket on a Saturday, expecting it to be first touched on Monday. Instead, I was able to solve it on the same day.</p>
<p>It turns out that Webfaction had helpfully added a reverse proxy for HTTP to point to the old IP address, which caused most of my services to work still. The NGINX configuration <em>on that machine</em> however was not setup for Websocket traffic or headers and so it threw the headers away before relaying the requests. Sneaky. So, the error was in fact configuration-related, but the configuration of another machine. I updated the A records and the bug went away, causing me to feel stupid.</p>
<h2 id="write-a-list">Write a List</h2>
<p>One immediate takeaway from this bug is that I behave very differently in professional and personal life. When at work, I always check what needs to be done upfront. When on vacation, I obviously throw that right out of the window. That&#39;s unfortunate, but leads to fun learning experiences. So, in the end, I&#39;m somewhat glad I ran into this bug. Next time, I will have a list of things that need to be done before, during, and after the maintenance at hand.</p>
<p>I also want to give Webfaction another big shout-out: I couldn&#39;t be happier with my experience with them, both in everyday business and in the kinds of scenarios where I shoot myself in the foot and need a medic as quickly as possible. I host a ton of different tools and services there and all of them were a breeze to set up, no matter whether I&#39;m using Python, Go, Node.js, or any other technology.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you don&#39;t think less of me for running into such a mundane bug and that you&#39;ll stay tuned for an upcoming post on hi, the chat service.</p>
