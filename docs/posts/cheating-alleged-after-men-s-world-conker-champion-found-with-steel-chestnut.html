    <h1>Cheating alleged after men&#39;s world conker champion found with steel chestnut</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>The World Conker Championships is investigating cheating allegations after the men’s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket.</p><p>David Jakins won the annual title in Southwick, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/northamptonshire" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Northamptonshire</a>, on Sunday for the first time after competing since 1977.</p><p>But the 82-year-old was found to have a metal replica in his pocket when he was searched by organisers after his victory.</p><p>The retired engineer has denied using the metal variety in the tournament.</p><p>Jakins was responsible for drilling and inserting strings into other competitors’ chestnuts as the competition’s top judge, known as the “King Conker”.</p><p>Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, who lost in the men’s final against Jakins, said he suspected “foul play”, the Telegraph reported.</p><p>The 23-year-old said: “My conker disintegrated in one hit, and that just doesn’t happen … I’m suspicious of foul play and have expressed my surprise to organisers.”</p><p>Kelci Banschbach, 34, from Indianapolis, defeated the men’s champion in the grand final to become the first American to win the competition. More than 200 people took part.</p><p>Jakins said: “I was found with the steel conker in my pocket, but I only carry [it] around with me for humour value and I did not use it during the event.</p><p>“Yes, I did help prepare the conkers before the tournament. But this isn’t cheating or a fix, and I didn’t mark the strings.”</p><p>St John Burkett, a spokesperson for the World Conker Championships, said the cheating claims were being investigated.</p><p>“Allegations of foul play have been received that somehow King Conker swapped his real conker for the metal one later found in his pocket.</p><p>“Players select conkers from a sack before each round.</p><p>“There are also suggestions that King Conker had marked the strings of harder nuts. We can confirm he was involved in drilling and lacing the nuts before the event.</p><p>“We are investigating.”</p><p>More than 2,000 conkers had been prepared prior to the event.</p></div></div></div>
