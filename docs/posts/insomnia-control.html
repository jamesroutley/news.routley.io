    <h1>Insomnia, Control</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I&#39;m trying to get back into a <a href="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/share-your-unfinished-scrappy-work/">regular posting schedule</a>, so I hope you won&#39;t mind keeping things a bit less techy for a minute (or sixty). I&#39;ll do my best to follow the rules of this site: <a href="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/be-kind-be-curious/">spark your curiosity</a>, entertain you or, at the very least, inspire you (because you&#39;ll realise you can do it even better!).</p>
<p>Now, enough with the <a href="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/disclaimer/">disclaimers</a>, it&#39;s Moonworm timeâ„¢:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/insomnia-control/O-k0K8Ptvf-1400.webp" alt="" width="1400" height="1050"/></p>
<p>I used to be an insomniac, the 2-3 hours of sleep per night variety. This has improved gradually over 20-ish years. But, not unlike other people with permanent matches installed under their eyelids, I developed a somewhat paranoid, controlling relationship with my sleep.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/insomnia-control/p6f6ZvPQWU-2048.webp" alt="" width="2048" height="2048"/></p>
<p>For instance, I had a set of rules meant to guarantee uninterrupted sleep. These ranged from the sensible:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>take a hot shower before bed</em></li>
<li><em>go to bed before xx:xx</em></li>
</ul>
<p>to the less orthodox ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>under any circumstances, do <strong>not</strong> think about the <a href="https://wunderbaum.com/wb/home-wb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wunderbaum</a> car scent during the day, because you if you do, <strong>you will wake up</strong>. You&#39;re not thinking about it? Good. I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re not thinking about Wunderbaum.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, I was aware of how irrational that sounds, but the muscle memory, the reflex, stayed. Most people with herpetophobia know that snakes are not <em>just waiting out there to get them</em>. And they&#39;re <em>mostly</em> right.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all to say I was a little bit of a control freak when it came to sleep. And not in the rational <em>let&#39;s-maintain-good-sleep-hygiene</em> kind of way. That made some things scarier that they should have been. If to adult-me, the prospect of skipping a night is a nuisance, to teenage-me it felt like punishment, and when I was a young adult â€“ it was confusing torture, one I couldn&#39;t think my way out of.</p>
<p>Luckily, despite and because of this (mildly paranoid) context, I came up with another rule, one that would override all of the above: <em><strong>if it was late, but I felt inspired, I didn&#39;t give a shit about sleep</strong></em>. I&#39;d just skip the night and take my sweet time to: write, draw, practice calligraphy, code a little toy, make a little sculpture from a scrap of wood. I&#39;d never rush, and never judge myself in that state, just do the thing. I wouldn&#39;t feel scared of the dark or worry about being late to work.</p>
<p>And, what still amazes me is that it all came with such ease! The usual anxiety that accompanies insomnia was mostly absent (just the like the refreshing, resinous and, dare I say, slightly soapy aroma we all <a href="https://wunderbaum.com/wb/home-wb?referral=PLEASE_SPONSOR_ME_WUNDERBAUM_YOU_OWE_IT_TO_ME_ALL_THE_MIDNIGHT_DREARY_CAN_I_PLURALISE_THAT_WORK_EVEN_WAIT_I_FORGOT_TO_INTRODUCE_MYSELF_ITS_ME_RAFAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">love and enjoyâ„¢ ðŸŒ²</a>).</p>
<hr/>
<p>Any creative pursuit can feel both exhilarating (flow, <a href="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/dog-mode/">Dog mode</a>) and dreadful, anxiety-inducing (staring at a blank piece of paper, ruminating). A big part of the latter is that when we see the blank piece of paper, we protest against it. We try to brute-force it out of existence, then deus-ex-machina something else in its place (that <em>something else</em> perhaps being a sense of safety).</p>
<p>Of course we all know that&#39;s not how it works. You came with a donkey preinstalled in your head. The harder you pull it in one direction, the stronger it resists. Also, every time it brays it sounds more like <em>fuck-you</em> than <em>hee-haw</em>. Mine&#39;s called Adalbert by the way.</p>
<p><em>(No, I did not write myself into a corner, <a href="https://youtu.be/jK60Jpe0ito?t=42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you did</a>!)</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/insomnia-control/GicFjKHyI2-1200.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630"/></p>
<p>What I&#39;m trying to say here (poorly): what worked for me then, and what seems to work now is to <em>give myself permission to give up control</em>. Give up control over something I couldn&#39;t control in the first place. <a href="https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/acceptance-is-defiance/">Acceptance is Defiance</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re in any way an over-thinker like me: give yourself permission to do art (uppercase, lowercase). It also does not matter whether you&#39;re good at it.</p>
<p>Correction: it helps if you&#39;re somewhat terrible at it. Lower that bar until you can&#39;t even trip on it. And if you do, <a href="https://sonnet.io/posts/hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tell me about it</a>!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
