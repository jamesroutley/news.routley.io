<p>I just heard a <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/450/so-crazy-it-just-might-work" rel="noreferrer">This American Life episode</a> which recounted the famous anecdote about Frank Nelson Cole factoring <span>$N:=2^{67}-1$</span> as <span>$193{,}707{,}721\times 761{,}838{,}257{,}287$</span>. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a historical record of how Cole achieved this; all we have I could find his statement that it took &#34;three years of Sundays&#34;. Ira Glass&#39;s guest, Paul Hoffman, suggests that this was done by trial division.</p>

<p>But this is nuts, unless I am missing something. Three years of Sundays is <span>$156$</span> days. If he works <span>$10$</span> hours a day, that&#39;s <span>$93{,}600$</span> minutes. There are <span>$10{,}749{,}692$</span>  primes up to 
<span>$193{,}707{,}721$</span>. So that is more than <span>$100$</span> trial divisions a minute. Worse than that, existing prime tables didn&#39;t go high enough: According to Chapter XIII of Dickson&#39;s <a href="https://archive.org/details/historyoftheoryo01dick" rel="noreferrer">History of the Theory of Numbers</a>, existing tables of primes only ran to something like <span>$10{,}000{,}000$</span> (<span>$664{,}579$</span> primes), so for the vast majority of the trial divisions, he&#39;d have to find the primes first. (Lehmer, in 1914, went up to <span>$10{,}006{,}721$</span>.)</p>

<p>But I&#39;m puzzled thinking what else Cole could have done. I skimmed Chapter XIV in Dickson. The methods which seem to have existed at the time are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Various ways to speed up trial division for the first <span>$1000$</span>&#39;s of prime numbers. That only helps at the start.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing <span>$N$</span> as <span>$x^2-y^2$</span>. But <span>$y$</span> would be <span>$380{,}822{,}274{,}783$</span>, which is an even larger search.</p></li>
<li><p>Since <span>$2$</span> is a square modulo <span>$N$</span> (namely, <span>$(2^{34})^2 \equiv 2 \mod N$</span>), we know that all prime factors must be <span>$\pm 1 \bmod 8$</span>, which cuts the time in half. But that&#39;s only a factor of <span>$2$</span>. </p></li>
<li><p>Since <span>$N \equiv 3 \mod 4$</span>, there must be a prime factor which is <span>$3 \bmod 4$</span>, so we could try only checking those primes. But this turns out to make things worse, since the SMALL factor is the one which is <span>$1 \bmod 4$</span>. </p></li>
<li><p>If we could write <span>$N$</span> as a sum of squares in two ways, we&#39;d be done. But <span>$N$</span> isn&#39;t a sum of squares, since it is <span>$3 \bmod 4$</span>. Generalizations to other positive definite quadratic forms were known at the time, but how would Cole know which quadratic form to try?</p></li>
<li><p>A variant of the above would be to use the quadratic form <span>$2x^2-y^2$</span>, since we already have one solution. Dickson doesn&#39;t mention any work using mixed signature forms, but it would work. And since <span>$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$</span> is a PID, there must be a second way to write <span>$N$</span> as <span>$2x^2-y^2$</span>, not related to the previous by units of <span>$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$</span>. I&#39;m not sure how large this second solution is.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How could someone find the prime factors of <span>$N$</span> in <span>$100{,}000$</span> minutes of hand computation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarizing what Cole says for my own understanding: By methods which he doesn&#39;t make clear to me, Cole found solutions to $x^2 \equiv a \bmod N$ for many small values of $a$ and convinced himself (but not rigorously) that many other $a$ were not achievable. This gave many congruence conditions on possible divisors of $N$. In this manner, he was rapidly able to filter the integers up to $16$ million down to just a few trial divisors, none of which worked. (Note that it is okay if he winds up trying some non-prime divisors in the process.)</p>

<p>At this point, he used his data in a different way. Suppose that $N=pq$ and look at one of his small values of $a$, for example $a=-7$. Since he knew $-7$ was square modulo $N$, we deduce that $p$ and $q$ are each $ 1$ , $2$ or $4 \bmod 7$ and, since $2^{67}-1 \equiv 1 \bmod 7$, we get that $(p,q)$ is $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$ or $(4,2) \bmod 7$. This means that $(p+q)/2 \equiv 1$ or $3 \bmod 7$. In this way, he obtained many modular conditions on $(p+q)/2$, giving a few possibilities. For each possibility $x$, he checked whether $x^2-N$ was square. When he tried the right option, he had $x^2-N = ((p+q)/2)^2 - N = ((p-q)/2)^2$ and won.</p>

<p>You assume that he did his computations by hand, but that&#39;s not a necessity. At the time, mechanical calculators (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer" rel="noreferrer">arithmometers</a>) were widely available. It&#39;s not at all unusual that the kind of person who devotes Sundays to factoring would own one.</p>

<p>These machines are orders of magnitude faster and more precise than doing computations by hand. This model from 1875 could handle 20-digit numbers, for instance. (<span>$2^{67}$</span> has 21 digits.)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7rHdf.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7rHdf.png" alt="enter image description here"/></a></p>

<p>Multiplying two numbers on one of them takes a few seconds. To multiply 761838257287 by 193707721, for instance (assuming they fit on the machine, which isn&#39;t the case for the machine in the picture --- it can multiply two ten-digit numbers at most, natively), you&#39;d have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>reset the machine by turning a certain small reset crank or switch.</li>
<li>slide up and down the 10 linear switches in the lower-right part, one by one, to the positions corresponding to the digits of 761838257287.</li>
<li>turn the crank one time, then slide the upper slab to the right by one notch, then turn the crank again 2 times, then move the slab, then turn it 7 times, and so on for each digit of the second number, for a total of 1+9+3+7+0+7+7+2+1 = 37 turns. The number of turns made in each position is displayed on an indicator, to reduce mistakes. (those ten tiny circular holes on top of the linear switches, I think).</li>
<li>then you can read off the digits of the result in the upper row of 20 rotating indicators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to divide (with remainder) a certain number <span>$A&lt;10^{20}$</span> by a <span>$B&lt;10^{10}$</span>, you can do the following, which directly mimics grade school division:</p>

<ul>
<li>set up the machine so that the top moving row shows the number <span>$A$</span></li>
<li>slide the upper slab to the right a certain number <span>$k$</span> of tims, so that the most significant digit of <span>$A$</span> is aligned with the most significant digit of <span>$B$</span>.</li>
<li>turn the crank in the reverse direction between 0 and 10 times; each turn subtracts <span>$10^k B$</span> from <span>$A$</span>. Stop when you&#39;d reach below zero. In practice, these machines work modulo <span>$10^{20}$</span>, and many models make a bell sound when you move below zero; so in practice you&#39;d turn the crank until you hear the bell, then make one turn back.</li>
<li>slide the upper slab one notch to the left, and continue by subtracting multiples of <span>$10^{k-1}B$</span> from the number in the top row. Continue until the upper slab is back to the original position (which means you&#39;re subtracting multiples of <span>$10^{0}B$</span> and can&#39;t slide it left anymore. Then you can read the remainder on the top row, and the quotient on a tiny (barely visible here) row of numbers below it, which kept track of how many turns were made in each position.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t have much manual skill with these machines, but it looks like the method could be performed in a completely mindless way --- turn the crank until you hear the bell, turn it back one turn, slide left, repeat.</p>

<p>While the question how Cole factored $N := 2^{67}âˆ’1$ has already been answered by quid,
David Speyer&#39;s more general question is how someone could find the factors of that
number in $100000$ minutes of hand computation.</p>

<p>Assuming one would try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm" rel="noreferrer">Pollard&#39;s rho algorithm</a> and compute the sequence
$x_1 := 1$, $x_{k+1} := (x_k^2+1) \!\! \mod n$, then one would find that
$\gcd(x_{8064} - x_{2536},n) = 193707721$. This requires $2 \cdot 8063 = 16126$
multiplications mod $n$ (in practice a bit more, since one doesn&#39;t take Gcd&#39;s
after every step), and taking a couple of Gcd&#39;s with $n$.
Now, doing a multiplication modulo a $21$-digit number in $6$ minutes by hand
is maybe tough, but plausibly possible.</p>

<p>Another option would be to try the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve" rel="noreferrer">quadratic sieve</a>.
In this case, we try to see whether what <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/factint.html" rel="noreferrer">FactInt</a>&#39;s MPQS routine does
could be done by hand as well. --</p>

<p>FactInt chooses a factor base of size $92$, and takes $4096$ as length of the sieving
interval. With this, it takes $8$ polynomials until it finds enough
factorizations over the factor base (including relations with a large factor)
to obtain a factorization of $N$. Doing the sieving by hand on standard
A4 $5$mm-squared paper by marking squares would require $2$ sheets of paper
for each sieving interval of $4096$ numbers, as there are $41 \cdot 58 = 2378$
squares on each sheet, hence the sieving would take in total $8 \cdot 2 = 16$
sheets of paper.</p>

<p>Finally one would need to find the nullspace of a sparse $\mathbb{F}_2$ matrix
with $114$ columns and a few more rows, which one could write down on
$6$ of the said sheets of squared paper glued together if one uses one square
for each entry. Doing Gaussian elimination would now probably be a little
tedious by hand and would likely take up the rest of the writing pad,
but it would certainly not be infeasible with a supply of time as generous
as the assumed $100000$ minutes.</p>

<p>I imagine it took Cole longer than he said.  If I were to undertake the project, here is how I would proceed:</p>

<p>I would start sifting the set of numbers {134k + 1} for primes.  One can modify the Sieve of Eratosthenes to produce quite a few of the primes quickly, and then just do certain members of the arithmetic progression whether they are prime or not (say those coprime to 2310).</p>

<p>I might do trial division, but for the larger numbers, modular exponentiation/ multiplication is the way to go.  I make a table up to 2^33 of powers of two.  Given p, I multiply by the largest power of 2 less than p to get a product less than p and then double that carefully and subtract p, and then repeat until I get to 2^67 mod p.  The nice thing about this is that I can leverage earlier work: If I have 2^s = p + K for some small K, the next prime q = p +r will have 2^s = p + (K-r) + r, and so some work can be saved on some iterations.  I can see processing two or three primes in parallel this way by hand.</p>
