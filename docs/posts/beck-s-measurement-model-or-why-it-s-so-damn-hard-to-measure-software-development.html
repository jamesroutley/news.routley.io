    <h1>Beck’s Measurement Model, or Why It’s So Damn Hard to Measure Software Development</h1>

You may want to read the prior parts before reading this essay.</em></p><p>On August 17, 2023, McKinsey published a report titled <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity">Yes, You Can Measure Software Developer Productivity</a>, written for large company executives, proposing a set of four new metrics that McKinsey claimed had been tested in 20 companies. These metrics were:</p><ul><li>Inner/Outer Loop Time Spent &#x2014; the time a programmer spent building actual software (the inner loop) vs the time spent deploying, integrating, and aligning with security and other organisational objectives (the outer loop).</li><li>Developer Velocity Index Benchmark &#x2014; a proprietary (to McKinsey!) survey that measures &#x2018;an enterprise&#x2019;s technology, working practices, and organizational enablement and benchmarks them against peers.&#x2019;</li><li>Contribution Analysis &#x2014; a measure of &#x2018;contributions by individuals to a team&#x2019;s backlog (starting with data from backlog management tools such as Jira, and normalizing data using a proprietary algorithm to account for nuances)&#x2019;, designed to &#x2018;surface trends that inhibit the optimisation of that team&#x2019;s capacity.&#x2019;</li><li>Talent Capability Score &#x2014; a score that reflects &#x2018;individual knowledge, skills, and abilities of a specific organisation&#x2019; that is based on &#x2018;industry standard capability maps&#x2019;.</li></ul><p>All of these metrics were presented with a beautiful sheen of legitimacy, in the way that management consulting output so often is.</p><h2 id="the-kent-beck-measurement-model">The Kent Beck Measurement Model</h2><p>The report lit a fire in the dev communities I&#x2019;m plugged into: just about every credible software leader I respected had bad things to say about it. Two weeks later, Kent Beck and Gergely Orosz published a two-part response (links <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity">one</a>, <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-440">two</a>), and introduced something I&#x2019;m going to call Beck&#x2019;s Measurement Model:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>How does software engineering create value? Take the typical example of building a feature, then launching it to customers, and iterating on it. What does this cycle look like? Say we&#x2019;re talking about a pretty autonomous and empowered software engineering team working at a startup, who are in tune with customers:</p>

<p>We start by deciding what to do next, and then we do it. This is the <strong>effort</strong> like planning, coding and so on. Through this effort, we produce tangible things like the feature itself, the code, design documents, etc. These are the <strong>output</strong>. Customers will behave differently as a result of this output, which is our <strong>outcome</strong>. For example, thanks to the feature they might get stuck less during the onboarding flow. As a result of this behavior change, we will see value flowing back to us like feedback, revenue, referrals. This is the <strong>impact</strong>.</p>
<p>So let&#x2019;s update our mental model with these terms:</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Beck&#x2019;s Measurement Model is the concept that I want to highlight here. It is illuminating, and wonderful. In <a href="https://forum.commoncog.com/t/q-a-on-the-weekly-business-review/1341?u=cedric">member discussions</a> of the <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">Becoming Data Driven in Business Series</a> I have wondered &#x2014; like many &#x2014; about the difficulty of measuring software development compared to sales, recruiting, and customer support. I&#x2019;ve also puzzled over the applicability of the process control approach to software development.</p>
