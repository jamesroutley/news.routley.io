<p>Rescribe Ltd offers custom-tailored Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Services for historical texts.</p>

<p>Our OCR training packages are designed for the Tesseract and OCRopus engines and can be downloaded and used for free from <a href="https://latinocr.org">latinocr.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rescribe">github.com</a>. The <a href="#tools">software and tools</a> we create are all released as free and open source software.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://blog.rescribe.xyz">a blog</a> which contains various guides and articles, written to be useful for humanists, librarians and technologists.</p>

<p>For more information on our commercial service, read on or contact <a href="mailto:info@rescribe.xyz">info@rescribe.xyz</a>.</p>



<h2>Service</h2>

<p>Our service is comprised of three steps: Preprocessing and OCR of images or PDFs and postprocessing the resulting output. Upon request, the output can be proofread for maximum accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Preprocessing</b> the scans or image files serves to deskew pages, reduce noise in the scans and convert the result into a binarized image which can be processed by Tesseract, our OCR engine.</p>

<p>In the second step we run the <b>OCR</b> on the preprocessed files, using our specifically trained packages and adapting language and character settings to the document at hand.</p>

<p>The resulting output is further refined in an automated <b>postprocessing</b> step: special characters and ligatures are optionally expanded and adapted to modern typography standards (e.g. æ to ae). These settings can be adjusted to the customer’s preferences. The final output can be delivered as raw text files, searchable PDFs or hOCR format.</p>

<p>We naturally aim to deliver an output of optimum accuracy; however, the quality can depend on a number of factors beyond our control (such as quality of page and scan, fonts and outerwordly characters). A set of analytical tools allows us to quickly assess the relative quality of the output and devote more attention to problem areas. Where a higher accuracy is required, the output can be optionally proofread to ensure that requirements are met.</p>

<td>Recently we have been putting some effort into improving the PDF output from our tools, which have all made it into the latest release of rescribe (v0.5.1). While they may seem simple, PDFs are a surprisingly complex, sometimes tricky file format to produce correctly, so here we’ll run through some of the ways we get really good PDFs out of our pipeline, and exactly what “good” means in this context. <a href="https://blog.rescribe.xyz/posts/pdfs/">Read more…</a></td>
<td>We’ve just released a major new version of our desktop OCR tool called Rescribe, which we first described here on the blog last year. The new version is much easier to use, as it includes the OCR engine software and our latest and greatest OCR models, so you can just download it and start using it without the need to install Tesseract and OCR models separately. <a href="https://blog.rescribe.xyz/posts/desktop-tool-0.4.0/">Read more…</a></td>

<p>We release all of the tools we create as free software under the GPLv3 license. Our recent tools have mostly been written in our favourite language, Go. While our workflow primarily uses a distributed system with virtual servers, all useful functionality, including image preprocessing, postprocessing analysis, and final PDF generation tools are also made available as separate self-contained commands within the packages.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://blog.rescribe.xyz/posts/tool-overview/">tour of our tools</a> on our blog that describes what they all do, how they fit together, and which tools and libraries are likely to be particularly useful for others.</p>
