    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>How it works</h2><p>ToS;DR aims to provide easy-to-understand summaries of Privacy Policies and Terms of Service through a transparent and peer-reviewed process.</p><p>Terms of service are reviewed by volunteer contributors, who highlight small points that we can discuss, compare and ultimately assign a score: &#34;good&#34;, &#34;neutral&#34;, &#34;bad&#34;, and scariest of all, &#34;blocker&#34;.</p><p>Once a service has enough points to assess the fairness of their terms, we use a formula to provide ratings from Grade A to Grade E:</p><ul><li><span>Grade A</span> — The terms of service treat you fairly, respect your rights, and will not abuse your data.</li><li><span>Grade B</span> — The terms of service are fair towards the user but they could be improved.</li><li><span>Grade C</span> — The terms of service are okay but some issues need your consideration.</li><li><span>Grade D</span> — The terms of service are very uneven, or there are some important issues that need your attention.</li><li><span>Grade E</span> — The terms of service raise very serious concerns.</li><li><span>No Grade Yet</span> — Not enough information exists to accurately grade this service yet.</li></ul><p>Right now you will notice that many services do not yet have a grade assigned. This is where you come in! Help us <a href="https://edit.tosdr.org/">analyse more documents</a> so that we may increase our coverage.</p></div></div>
