    <ul>
<li>Deep diving (lol) on undersea cables, partly for a video essay I&#39;m making, partly because I&#39;m fascinated. Low key want to become a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships">subsea cable repair person</a> but also it sounds difficult and I am very soft and not good with my hands. Maybe somewhere in the multiverse I&#39;m doing that and not falling overboard...</li>
<li>Enjoying research and trying out different methods and methodologies for keeping my ducks in a row. I want to like Zettelkasten but atomic notes annoy me and I like to write in the same place I keep my notes which is controversial for some reason.</li>
<li>Loving <a href="https://capacities.io">Capacities</a>! Time based and object based notes for the win.</li>
<li>Seeing <a href="https://www.personalcanon.com/p/research-as-leisure-activity?utm_source=www.pkmbeth.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=saying-goodbye-to-pkm-beth">research as a leisure activity</a> and planning/reviewing my life as a hobby has changed my world, it all feels so much lighter and I worry less about wasting time optimising systems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_Roses">We can&#39;t all supply bread, some of us are really about the roses</a>.</li>
<li>Really want to get back into learning about algorithms/computer science, and with textbooks maths is a blocker, with <a href="https://csprimer.com">the course</a> I mentioned before cost is a blocker, and I&#39;m at a loss for other ways to learn what I want in a practical way. Suggestions super welcome.</li>
<li>I really miss Twitter as it was. I know now so many people were on it despite not enjoying it which is wild to me, but I met a lot of cool people.</li>
<li>Wondering how much critical mass you need to make a discord that doesn&#39;t immediately die, I think if people want to chat about tech ethics-y, how tech affects life stuff all together I&#39;d be really into it. I want more online community but I know joining a slow space never really bodes well, so will bide my time.</li>
<li>Took a chess holiday last week, hopefully this week I will get back on the horse/knight!</li>
