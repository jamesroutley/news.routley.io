    <h1>Microjs: Fantastic Micro-Frameworks and Micro-Libraries for Fun and Profit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong><span>Fantastic</span><span> Micro</span><span>-</span><span>Frameworks</span><span> and</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p>How much library code do you really need — 50K? 100K? 150K? More? How
    much of that do you really use?</p>

    <p>Sure, we all love our favorite monolithic frameworks, and sometimes we
    even use them fully. But how often do we reach for the ride-on John
    Deere tractor with air conditioning and six-speaker sound system, when
    a judiciously applied pocketknife would do the trick better, faster,
    slicker?</p>

    <p>Micro-frameworks are definitely the pocketknives of the JavaScript
    library world: short, sweet, to the point. And at 5k and under,
    micro-frameworks are very very portable. A micro-framework does one
    thing and one thing only — and does it well. No cruft, no featuritis,
    no feature creep, no excess anywhere.</p>

    <p>Microjs.com helps you discover the most compact-but-powerful
    microframeworks, and makes it easy for you to pick one that’ll work
    for you.</p>
