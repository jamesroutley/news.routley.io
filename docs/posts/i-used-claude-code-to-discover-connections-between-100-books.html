<p>Reflecting on this past year, I feel grateful and lucky for
everything that’s happened to me, both personally and
professionally.</p>
<p>I’m writing this from a remote town in Switzerland, where I
train-hopped my way from Rome over the course of 3 days. My return
journey is being pushed indeterminately due to cascading flight
cancellations from Amsterdam winter storms. I have no hotel/travel
sketched out past tomorrow. Each new day brings new experiences, new
scenery, new weather, new cuisines, new cultures, and the discomfort of
adjusting to yet another bed. I’m enjoying my travel, but I’m also
looking forward to coming back home, whenever that ends up being.</p>
<p>My Eurotrip, intended to be a breather before my new job, has
unintentionally become a metaphor for my professional life over the last
3 years.</p>
<h2 id="corporate-ronin">Corporate ronin</h2>
<p>My situation at Google became unstable when Osmo spun out from Google
in June 2022. Instead of simply joining an existing team, I’d been
trying to pitch a new project in Climate+ML, ableit unsuccessfully:
“your project is credible at 10 megatons of <span>\(\ce{CO2}\)</span> offset ($100M equivalent), but
that still isn’t big enough. 100 megatons or bust”, they told me.
Defeated, I spent my paternity leave thinking deeply about the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/why_brain/">incentive structures driving Google
Research</a>.</p>
<p>A week before I was scheduled to return from leave, I was laid off. I
bounced in between ideas and opportunities, trying to decide what <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/new_mountains/">new mountain</a> I wanted to climb. I
ruled out drug discovery + ML. I tried getting into management
consulting but nobody was hiring. I tried a self-driving car startup but
found the startup incurably dysfunctional (they had 30% layoff a few
months after I left). Finally, I thought I’d found a home with Lilac, a
LLM data tooling startup run by two former coworkers from Google
Research. Alas, it was not to be.</p>
<p>Six months after I’d joined Lilac, we got acquired by Databricks,
which seemed like a logical home for the team at the time. I thought
that Databricks might become my new long-term home, but 9 months in, the
verdict was in: I wasn’t fitting into Databricks culture. I found myself
checking the calendar, thinking, “just a few more months till my vesting
cliff”, and started seeing myself in this <a href="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/ideal-candidate/">short
story</a>. The vesting cliff passed and I left for greener pastures.
Databricks and the Lilac founders treated me super respectfully through
the whole process, so there’s no ill will on my end. I was unlucky,
Databricks was unlucky, and we all parted ways agreeably. The 6 months
at Lilac were engrossing and I’m super grateful to the founders for
letting me join their adventure.</p>
<p>My solo startup, Cartesian Tutor, was the next six months of my life,
and it’s the most fun I’ve had since I last took a sabbatical to teach
myself ML in 2016. In retrospect, I wasn’t being entirely honest with
myself about why I was doing it - I had vague hopes about making some
money, but ultimately I wanted to learn about LLMs, and just not have a
boss for a while. That, I accomplished in spades – what I learned in six
months would probably have taken me or anyone else two years to learn in
the context of a normal job. My recent <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/2025_job_search/">job search</a> would not have been
anywhere as successful if I’d jumped right into it after Databricks.</p>
<h2 id="finding-employer-employee-fit">Finding employer-employee
fit</h2>
<p>Empirically, employer-employee fit (let’s call this EEF) has been
tough to find. Over the past 3 years, only Lilac has been an EEF.</p>
<p>I wondered at times if it was a “me” problem. Many people seemed
capable of doing what needed to be done in a corporate setting; why
couldn’t I do the same? If we’re being honest, it’s because I’m too
opinionated and confident in my own skills and judgment to take marching
orders from someone whose skills and judgment I don’t respect. Perhaps
I’m overconfident, but I don’t think it’s a problem - most people are
systematically underconfident and that tends to stop them from taking
action. So then, the alternate solution is to find a job where I have
the agency to find and solve the problems I think are important, at a
company whose management I respect.</p>
<p>EEF, for me, is finding a company that 1. needs cutting-edge research
2. believes they need cutting edge research 3. has a culture of enabling
researchers to solve problems.</p>
<p>Many companies that believe they need cutting edge research don’t
actually need cutting edge research, and when reality comes knocking,
they fold their research bets, reorging their researchers into the
corporate machine. A few need cutting edge research but are structurally
incapable of believing it due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">innovator’s
dilemna</a>. And some that need it and know they need it, can’t help but
stick their fingers into the cake while it’s being made, leading to
mutual dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Jane Street needs agents, believe they need agents, and have a
culture that has been lovingly described as an anarchist commune. I did
a lot more due diligence on culture fit this time around, compared to
the very short time I had to think through the Databricks-Lilac
acquisition, so I’m optimistic and hopeful that this will be a good
EEF.</p>
<h2 id="feeling-lucky">Feeling lucky</h2>
<p>Throughout my journey, I’ve been humbled and honored by my friends,
classmates, and colleagues who have helped me in my search. I also feel
lucky that every time I’ve been thrown into uncertainty, I’ve emerged
stronger. I’ve lived long enough now to witness several of my
classmates’ lives and careers derailed by a variety of issues
self-inflicted (pessimism), unlucky (long COVID), and horrifying
(murdered someone). There is a strong survivor bias to the success
stories you read online, and I’m grateful that I am one of those
stories.</p>
<h2 id="obligatory-ai-section">Obligatory AI section</h2>
<p>2025 was the year coding agents got good enough for just about
<em>everyone</em> to boost their productivity by roughly 2x, whereas in
previous years they were not at that breakeven point yet. I personally
estimate my productivity boost at 2-4x, depending on the project. I am
grateful that my departure from Databricks was fortuitously timed with
the release of Sonnet 3.5.</p>
<p>I am in agreement with Andrej that it is <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521">possible to get
to 10x</a> with just the models we have today, if we just
refactor/refine our workflows and interactions with the agents.</p>
<p>If you still haven’t at least tried coding agents, you are either
living under a rock or suffering from some sort of cognitive
dissonance.</p>
<p>That being said, claims of coding agent progress are confounded by
multiple factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People who do insufficient verification of Claude’s output and are
impressed that it is 90% correct. (The last 10% takes exactly as long as
it did, pre-coding agents, because it is no longer a coding problem, it
is a task specification problem.)</li>
<li>People are trying coding agents for the first time, and they ascribe
their “wow” moment to specific incremental improvements in Opus 4.5,
rather than to the cumulative progress made over the past few years,
leading to perpetual headlines of “$LATEST_MODEL represents another
phase change in coding”.</li>
<li>The most impressive demonstrations come from incredibly experienced
engineers, the kind who could probably implement the whole thing from
scratch in a week if you cleared their calendars. Their demos tend to be
in areas they are deeply familiar with, if not an outright copy of
something they’ve built before (and can anticipate all the
pitfalls).</li>
<li>Some of the strongest proponents of coding agents are clearly in
some sort of LLM psychosis. (looking at you, <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04">Steve
Yegge</a>) And yet, I can’t stop reading their ravings, for they are an
endless pool of fresh ideas that I can mix into my entropy stream.</li>
<li>Almost all of these demos are <em>solo</em> projects. In team
settings, the main bottleneck is actually ensuring that the team has a
shared, accurate mental model of the problem domain and the
solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inverting each of these points, we arrive at a roadmap for getting to
10x productivity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If task specification is the bottleneck, then the fundamental
iteration loop to be optimized is allowing the user to interact with the
generated artifact and decide which parts of it they want to change. The
coding agent should be able to interact with the generated artifact in
the same way to verify correctness.</li>
<li>There is currently no substitute for hands-on experience in
understanding what these agents are capable of and what they tend to be
good or bad at.</li>
<li>If you want to maximally harness the power of coding agents, you
will need to at least learn the basics of your application domain, to
the point where you can speak the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/llm_shibboleths/">shibboleths</a>. I myself did not reach
full productivity on Cartesian Tutor’s web app until I had spent a
~month learning web fundamentals.</li>
<li>Stay skeptical of Steves. But definitely read his blog and try his
slop for flavor. I absolutely agree with his push towards reinventing
workflow technologies, like issue trackers, in text-based,
agent-friendly forms.</li>
<li>Not sure, but one starting point is to have regular team meetings
where the latest updates to the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/ai_codebase/#information-architecture-should-be-handwritten">information
architecture</a> are reviewed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Progress in building software is no longer about writing code. It is
about reaching a full understanding of the problem, along with a full
specification for a solution. For the vast majority of software
products, iteration on a working product is the fastest way to discover
unknown unknowns and resolve ambiguities. Once a fully specified
solution (including information architecture) is available, then coding
agents can build your codebase from scratch, without the messy iteration
history that tends to muck up codebases with tech debt.</p>
