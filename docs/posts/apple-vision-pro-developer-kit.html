						<h3>How it works</h3>
						<p>We’ll loan you a Vision Pro developer kit to prepare your app for the launch of the new App Store on Vision Pro.</p>
						<p>You’ll also receive:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Help setting up the device and onboarding.</li>
							<li>Check-ins with Apple experts for UI design and development guidance, and help refining your app.</li>
							<li>Two additional code-level support requests, so you can troubleshoot any issues with your code.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This Apple-owned development device needs to be returned upon request.</p>

						<h3>How to apply</h3>
						<p>Submit a brief application for a Vision Pro developer kit. You’ll need to be an Account Holder in the Apple Developer Program, provide details about your team’s development skills and existing apps, and agree to the terms and conditions. Applications will be reviewed and priority will be given to applicants creating an app that takes advantage of visionOS features and capabilities.</p>
