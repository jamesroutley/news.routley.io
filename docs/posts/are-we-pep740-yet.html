                <h2 id="what-pep740">What is PEP 740?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a> is a Python standard
                    for defining cryptographically verifiable attestations hosted by indices like
                    PyPI.
                </p>
                <h2 id="what">What are attestations?</h2>
                <p>
                    Attestations are digitally signed, publicly verifiable statements about Python
                    packages, including their <em>provenance</em> (e.g., the exact source repository
                    that produced them).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attestations are built on top of <a href="https://sigstore.dev">Sigstore</a>
                    and use short-lived signing keys bound to trusted identities
                    (like <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/">Trusted Publishers</a>),
                    making them misuse-resistant and less susceptible to key loss and theft.
                </p>
                <h2 id="about-list">What is this list?</h2>
                <p>This site shows the top 360 most-downloaded packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> showing which have been uploaded with attestations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Green</span> packages <span id="success-percent"></span> with a üîè offer attestations for verification</li>
                    <li><span>Uncolored</span> packages <span id="default-percent"></span> with a ‚è∞ were last uploaded before attestations were available</li>
                    <li><span>Yellow</span> packages <span id="todo-percent"></span> have no attestations uploaded (yet!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Packages that are known to be deprecated are not included (for example, distribute). If your package is incorrectly listed, please <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/issues/">create a ticket</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="creating-wheels">My package is uncolored. What can I do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Trusted Publisher is the easiest way to enable attestations, since they come baked in!
                    See <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/">the PyPI user docs</a>
                    and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">official PyPA publishing action</a>
                    to get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For projects already using the official PyPA publishing action, you can upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/releases/tag/v1.11.0">v1.11.0</a> or later
                    to automatically enable attestations for the next release of the project. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of the action to receive any bug fixes.
                </p>
                <h2 id="bugs">Something&#39;s wrong with this page!</h2>
                <p>Fantastic, a problem found is a problem fixed. Please <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/issues/">create a ticket</a>!</p>
                <p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/pulls/">submit a pull-request</a>.</p>
