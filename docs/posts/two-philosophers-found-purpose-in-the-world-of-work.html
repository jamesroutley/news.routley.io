    <h1>Two philosophers found purpose in the world of work</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p data-type="paragraph">In 1943, two of the century’s most original thinkers—<!-- -->Ludwig Wittgenstein<!-- --> and <!-- -->Simone Weil<!-- -->—found themselves in bomb-battered London, looking for medical work to help the war effort. Though they never met, they were remarkably similar. Both were foreigners by birth, and both struck others as foreigners by their behavior.</p><p data-type="paragraph">Crucially, both were also foreigners to the traditional way of doing philosophy, their profession of choice. The Austrian-born Wittgenstein and French-born Weil insisted that philosophy must be lived—or, as academics have it, “embodied”—and they shunned the academy to live and work in the real world. While many of us take a break from work on Labor Day, we might spare a moment to consider these abstract thinkers who gave nearly as much of themselves to labor as to contemplation.</p></section></div></article></div>
