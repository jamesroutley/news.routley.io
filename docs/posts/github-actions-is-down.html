        <p>I am not sure if it’s related, but we’re getting intermittent <code>getCacheEntry failed: Cache service responded with 503</code> errors when running setup-* with a <code>cache</code> parameter. And it seems that <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install/issues/80" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">we’re not the only ones</a>. GitHub Status is all green, though.</p>

        <p>yes I think it is related because I am getting the error during the cache steps too</p>

        <p>Also facing these issues and have been since this morning. Workflows have worked once or twice since this morning (~7AM BST). Does appear to be related to the cache.</p>

          <p>Hi <a href="https://github.community/u/akash1134">@Akash1134</a> ,</p>
<p>This minor interruption as you call it may prevent people from deploying docker images to production. So this should be dealt with all seriousness because for us developers it is a major and not minor interruption.</p>
<p>Besides this the fact that it took you 4 hours to identify that there is an issue is also not a merit and this should be fixed from your side.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
