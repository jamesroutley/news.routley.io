    <h1>StarDict sends X11 clipboard to remote servers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<a href="https://stardict-4.sourceforge.net/index_en.php">StarDict</a> is a
GPLv3-licensed cross-platform dictionary application. It includes dictionaries
for a number of languages, and has a rich plugin ecosystem. It also has a
glaring security problem: while running on X11, using Debian&#39;s default configuration,
it will send a user&#39;s text selections over unencrypted HTTP to two remote servers.
</p>

<p>
On August 4, Vincent Lefevre
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250804092217.GA962280@qaa.vinc17.org/">
reported</a> the problem to the oss-security mailing list and to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370">
Debian&#39;s bug tracker</a>.
He identified it while testing his setup before the
upcoming Debian 13 (&#34;trixie&#34;) release.
Installing StarDict will also
install the <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> package by default, because the former
recommends the latter. The plugins package contains a set of commonly used
StarDict plugins, including a plugin for
<a href="https://www.youdao.com/">
YouDao</a>, a Chinese search engine that supplies Chinese-to-English
translations. The plugin also contacts a second online Chinese dictionary,
<a href="https://dict.cn">
dict.cn</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would normally not be much cause for concern; of course a dictionary
program will include code to talk to dictionary-providing web sites. But one of
StarDict&#39;s features, which is also enabled by default, is its &#34;scan&#34;
functionality: it will watch the user&#39;s text selections (i.e. text highlighted
with the mouse), and automatically
provide translations as a pop-up. Taken together, the two features result in any
selected text being sent to both servers. This only occurs while StarDict is
open, but the application is designed to be left open in the background in case
the user needs a quick reference while reading.

StarDict on Wayland doesn&#39;t have this problem, because Wayland
prevents applications from being
able to capture text from other applications by default. That does mean that it
breaks StarDict&#39;s scan feature, though.
</p>

<p>
Xiao Sheng Wen, the Debian package maintainer for StarDict,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#10">
didn&#39;t see a problem</a> with the behavior, noting that if a user doesn&#39;t want
to use the scan functionality or the YouDao plugin, both can be disabled.
Lefevre
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#29">
wasn&#39;t satisfied</a> with that, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
But this is not the whole point. Features with privacy concerns
should never be enabled by default (unless the feature is the
only purpose of the package, and such a package would never be
installed automatically — and even in such a case, there should
be a big warning first).
</blockquote>

<p>
In response, Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#34">
pointed out</a> that
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-gtk">
the package description</a> can be read by any
user who chooses to install the software, and it does mention the scan feature.
That said, I noted during my investigation that the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-plugin">
description</a> of <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> did
not mention that the YouDao plugin uses an online service instead of an offline
dictionary. Xiao suggested splitting the networked dictionary plugins into a
separate package, but was &#34;<q>not sure whether it&#39;s very necessary to do so</q>&#34;.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the scan feature, while obviously a problem in this
context, is one of the reasons that a user might choose to use StarDict over an
alternative. Reading foreign-language media is often easier when words can be
sought in a dictionary with as little fuss as possible. From that perspective,
it makes sense that Xiao might not view the feature as problematic.
</p>

<p>
Any user who did read the description of the package, and who knew what the
YouDao plugin would do, might nevertheless expect the resulting communication to
at least be encrypted. But the plugin actually reaches out to its backend
servers — dict.youdao.com and dict.cn — over unsecured HTTP. So, not only are
these servers sent any text the user selects, but anyone who can view traffic
anywhere along its path can see the same thing.
</p>

<p>
This is not even the first time that StarDict has sent user selections to the
internet; the
same kind of problem
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534731">was
reported</a> by Pavel Machek in 2009 and
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#5">again</a>
by &#34;niekt0&#34; in 2015. The 2009 bug was solved by patching
the application&#39;s default configuration to disable networked dictionaries. That
appears to have worked for a time, but the YouDao plugin, which was added in
2016, does not respect the
configuration option. The 2015 problem was not fixed
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#57">until
August 6 of this year</a> (although the package was removed from Debian for
unrelated reasons for a few months from 2020 to 2021). That fix just removed the
<tt>stardict_dictdotcn.so</tt> plugin, which also sent translation requests to
dict.cn and was later subsumed by the YouDao plugin,
from the package. In fairness to Xiao, he
was not the
StarDict maintainer in 2015 —
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912065912/https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/stardict">
that was</a> Andrew Lee — but Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#28">knew</a>
about the 2015 bug since at least 2021, even if he didn&#39;t consider it a priority.
</p>

<p>
According to Debian&#39;s
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=stardict">package popularity
contest statistics</a>,
only 178 people have
StarDict installed, down from around a thousand between 2009 and 2015.
That obviously doesn&#39;t capture people who have configured
their Debian system not to participate in the statistics collection, but it does
suggest there were a number of people who might have been broadcasting their text
selections to the internet for several years. Given that people copy and
paste passwords from their password managers, or select the text of sensitive
emails and documents during the course of editing, that should be a significant cause
for concern.
</p>

<p>
Debian is a large distribution, containing tens of thousands of packages.
Moreover, because of its commitment to stability, a decent fraction of these
are older software with delayed or sporadic updates. The reality is that Linus&#39;s
law (&#34;<q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</q>&#34;) only holds up if
people are looking — and if, once they have looked, and have reported things,
the people who have taken up maintenance of the software actually agree that
there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
Part of the justification for moving to Wayland over X11 is to make security
vulnerabilities relating to one application spying on another more difficult to
introduce. That obviously has to be balanced against the
cost of adapting to a new way of doing things, but it&#39;s not hard to see why so
many people are eager to make Wayland work. Maybe, in the future, StarDict&#39;s
default behavior would
have had little to no impact. Or maybe StarDict would have started asking for
special permissions to let it work on Wayland, and users would have accepted
those defaults the same way they currently do.
</p>

<p>
Either way, the existence of serious security problems that can be
found, diagnosed, reported, and still remain unfixed is cause for concern. Linux
has long enjoyed a reputation for security; maintaining that reputation depends
on the developers, maintainers, and users of open-source software caring enough
to fix security problems when they arise.
