    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Curious to know if anyone has written programs for their own, regular, &amp; personal use. And if so what they are? E.g. A colleague of mine tracks all of his homes energy use through a custom program which disaggregates the energy consumption per device and outputs a report to a tablet.</td></div></div>
