                            <p>Update: As some have pointed out: the restores can be rollbacks from the server issues or post haven&#39;t been properly deleted due to subs being private during blackouts. Many have experienced the same issue, I can&#39;t explain how this happens. I&#39;ll just run the script again, try the GDPR request and delete my account.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: according to the ToS Reddit can actually do whatever they want with existing content, apparently we agreed to this when signing up.</p>
<p>Attached: 2 images ðŸ‘¿ PSA: <a href="https://kbin.social/tag/Reddit" rel="tag">#Reddit</a> is restoring deleted and overwritten posts to save what they consider &#34;their data&#34;. This is a new low and probably illegal at least in Europe. You can send a GDPR or CPRA request here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request</a> These are screenshots of my profile on June 14th before and after overwriting and then deleting all my posts with Powerdelete. Today, June 16th all my posts have been restored by Reddit without my knowledge or consent. <a href="https://kbin.social/tag/redditblackout" rel="tag">#redditblackout</a> <a href="https://kbin.social/tag/redditmigration" rel="tag">#redditmigration</a> <a href="https://kbin.social/tag/kbin" rel="tag">#kbin</a> <a href="https://kbin.social/tag/lemmy" rel="tag">#lemmy</a></p>
