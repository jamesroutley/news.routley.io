    <h1>Ask HN: How to transcribe 1000s of handwritten notes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have 10 yearsâ€™ worth of journals.</p><p>My handwriting is not great!</p><p>None of the off the shelf solutions come even close to recognizing my handwriting.</p><p>Can you think of anything better than just opening every single file and manually transcribing it?</p><p>I have been thinking about training a model to first divide the images into lines of text. Then, it will be easier to transcribe, and automatically those transcriptions will be associated with areas of the image, in case I figure out a good handwriting model.</p></div></div></div>
