<p>We are striking to protest Etsy’s treatment of sellers.  We will put our shops on vacation mode April 11-18.  Those of us who can will strike for the whole week, and some of us are striking only for April 11.</p>



<p>Buyers can support the strike too, by boycotting Etsy from April 11-18, and looking for ways outside of Etsy to support sellers.</p>



<h2>These are our demands:</h2>



<ol><li>Cancel the fee increase.</li><li>Crack down on resellers with a comprehensive plan that is transparent, so sellers can hold Etsy accountable.</li><li>Give ‘Golden’ support tickets to sellers affected by extreme AI actions (account termination, 45/90 day holds, etc.)</li><li>End the Star Seller Program.</li><li>Give all sellers the ability to opt out of off site ads.</li></ol>



<p>For more information on each of these topics and how they impact each of us as sellers, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/cancel-the-fee-increase-work-with-sellers-not-against-us">see our petition.</a></p>
