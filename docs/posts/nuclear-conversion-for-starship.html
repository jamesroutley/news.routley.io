Their specific impulse is up to three times greater than chemical rockets, they produce comparable amounts of thrust and they could be designed to accept a variety of propellants, from CO2 to ammonia. They can reduce travel times in space, push around much larger payloads and get refuelled with whatever fluid is available at their destination. </span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-js2qJDqdtPY/YWhHrfG705I/AAAAAAAAFyk/MbpfnV8CXTw5xue4DprVzfAmZJLMFj8GACNcBGAsYHQ/s980/NERVAenginemockup.jpg"><span><img data-original-height="980" data-original-width="666" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-js2qJDqdtPY/YWhHrfG705I/AAAAAAAAFyk/MbpfnV8CXTw5xue4DprVzfAmZJLMFj8GACNcBGAsYHQ/w434-h640/NERVAenginemockup.jpg" width="434"/></span></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Full scale <a href="https://media.wired.com/photos/5932a576f682204f73697225/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/NERVAenginemockup.jpg">mockup</a> of the NERVA engine.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span><span>For these reasons, they are lauded as the best way to accelerate human exploration and expansion into space. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>They are not a new technology either. The idea to use nuclear energy to propel spacecraft dates back to 1944. Serious testing has been done on nuclear rockets, with ground tests in 1955 and functional gigawatt-scale rockets firing for several minutes by the 1970s. The Strategic Defense Initiative rekindled studies into nuclear propulsion with Project Timberwind, a program that ran until 1991 and resulted in modern designs that were even more capable. </span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg"><img data-original-height="622" data-original-width="1600" height="248" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h248/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We are now in the midst of another revival of this technology.

Then, we would acquire the ability to send even heavier payloads to orbit and beyond.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The modern nuclear rocket</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The design and performance targets for nuclear propulsion has shifted considerably over the last few decades. The initial efforts in the 1970s were straightforward in the desire for maximum power and thrust. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://fas.org/nuke/space/la-10062.pdf"><span>Project Rover</span></a><span>, for example, resulted in the Phoebus-2A reactor that managed an output of 4000 MW for 12 minutes during a test run. As a fully developed engine, it would have managed 5000 MW and 825s of specific impulse. It would have held 300 kg of enriched uranium and had a relatively cool core temperature of 2300 K (although the goal was 2500 K). Total mass was 9300 kg, meaning it had an impressive power density of 537 kW/kg.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The ultimate version of this sort of maximum power engine would be the Pebble Bed reactors from the 1980s Strategic Defence Initiative era </span><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA305996.pdf"><span>Project Timberwind</span></a><span>. The largest version aimed to operate at 3000K to achieve a specific impulse of 1000s). 12,000 MW of power served to produce 2451 kN of thrust. Power density was a whopping 1450 kW/kg. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>More recent nuclear thermal rockets have taken a different direction. Each rocket is smaller, aiming for a thrust level of around 100 kN. Multiples are used to ensure reliability during operation. Core temperatures are reduced to prolong engine life. With no hope of being used within an atmosphere, they are vacuum-only designs with a reduced focus on power density. Instead, additional capabilities such as the ability to produce electricity continuously are featured. </span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/s1326/16-Figure14-1.png"><img data-original-height="776" data-original-width="1326" height="374" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h374/16-Figure14-1.png" width="640"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>A <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nuclear-Thermal-Propulsion-(NTP)%3A-A-proven-growth-Borowski-McCurdy/772072e3043c7e6ee50f8e420f4f3145e4c6d5e1">Copernicus</a> Mars vehicle equipped with three SNREs.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span><span>An example of this would be the</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120012928/downloads/20120012928.pdf"><span> ‘Borowski SNRE’</span></a><span> NERVA-derived design that produces 111 kN of thrust. When operated at 2800K, it achieves a specific impulse of 925s. Power density is about 152 kW/kg (504 MW for 3300 kg).</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>An even further diminished version of the SNRE is to be expected in the near future. Highly enriched uranium (enrichment level 93%) will be replaced by </span><a href="https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/GA-delivers-HALEU-fuelled-reactor-concept-for-Mars"><span>HALEU fuel</span></a><span>, which has an enrichment level of 20% at most. Five times more fuel in total would be needed to complete the same missions as with highly enriched uranium fuel, or a greatly increased amount of neutron reflector is necessary to surround the reactor core to achieve the same power output. Either way, the power density will suffer. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>An additional aspect of nuclear thermal rocket development needs to be addressed: the choice of propellant. Nearly all tests and designs focus on the use of liquid hydrogen as it has the potential to deliver the highest specific impulse. However, other propellants </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19910012833/downloads/19910012833.pdf"><span>have been considered</span></a><span>, especially in the context of ISRU where spacecraft are refueled with whatever is available at their destination.

It is six times denser than liquid hydrogen, can be stored at 100K, which is compatible with liquid oxygen, and it can be produced using water and carbon dioxide. At high temperatures, it breaks down into hydrogen and carbon, turning it from a 16 g/mol molecule into a 3.25 g/mol plasma. That is how it achieves a specific impulse only mildly lower than what is achievable using liquid hydrogen. Zubrin lists its specific impulse as 606s when heated to 2800K, or 625s at 3000K.  </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Nuclear Starship</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>A nuclear-powered Starship would not be a complete overhaul of the design.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>It will still be a 50m tall steel tube that launches atop the SuperHeavy booster, using vacuum-optimized engines fed by large propellant tanks, and a set of smaller gimballed engines optimized for landing, with flaps to handle reentry. Dry mass in the final version will be 120 tons and about 30 tons of propellant is reserved for landing. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It might be unsurprising to you that we cannot simply bolt on nuclear rockets to the Starship and expect everything to work. Special modifications have to be made to accommodate the new propulsion system, ranging from new attachment points to control software, but we will focus on the most impactful one: radiation shielding.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The shape of the Starship is not well adapted to handling the radiation from a nuclear rocket. There are large flaps extending to the sides that could scatter radiation back into the crew compartment at the top. Retracting them when the nuclear rockets are in use would be a good idea. Designs which were meant to be nuclear from the start also usually place their reactor or nuclear rocket far from the main body of the spaceship, on the end of a long boom or tapered propellant tanks. Radiation released from a fission reaction spreads as a sphere in all directions - if it is placed further away, the main body of the spaceship intercepts a smaller fraction of it. </span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/s907/rns_rear.PNG"><img data-original-height="698" data-original-width="907" height="492" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h492/rns_rear.PNG" width="640"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>The ideal rear end of a nuclear-propelled spacecraft, based on the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720009983/downloads/19720009983.pdf">RNS</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span>The fraction of radiation that cannot be avoided is handled using radiation shielding, with different layers meant to absorb different types of radiation. It is placed as close as possible to the reactors or engines to create the widest shadow of protection, which is why they are also called shadow shields.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>A fission reaction mainly produces fission fragments, gamma rays and neutrons. Fission fragments are heavy ions that do not travel very far. Gamma rays are penetrating photons that are best absorbed by a dense material. Neutrons are high velocity subatomic particles with no charge; they are best dealt with using a material that contains as much hydrogen as possible, like water. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We want to use as little </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150006884/downloads/20150006884.pdf"><span>shielding mass</span></a><span> as possible. </span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/s987/risk1.PNG"><img data-original-height="987" data-original-width="716" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/w464-h640/risk1.PNG" width="464"/></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The densest elements are the best protection against gamma rays, with tungsten (W) being an ideal choice (lead would melt too easily and depleted uranium is not practical). </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Lithium Hydride (LiH) is the most mass-efficient protection against neutrons. Boron Carbide (B4C) is 20% heavier than LiH for the same protection, but it melts at 3036K is a very strong ceramic, which is ideal for surfaces exposed to reentry heating. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It must be noted that some radiation protection is already built-in. The beryllium or graphite reflector within the nuclear reactor prevents some radiation from leaving. The 30 tons or more of landing propellant, especially methane, is effective at absorbing neutrons too and will always be present while in space. A much larger load of propellant will be drained as the nuclear propulsion is used, representing several meters of shielding. Furthermore, there will be a 25 meter separation between the engines and the crew compartment, so only 1/625 of the radiation is actually intercepted. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/AIAA-2004-3863_TRITON.pdf"><span>Different</span></a><span> </span><a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/radiation.php#id--Radiation_Shielding--Shielding--Shadow_Shield"><span>estimates</span></a><span> for the shielding required place the total at about 440 kg/m^2, which corresponds to 2 cm tungsten plus 2 cm of Boron Carbide. The engines themselves are about 1 meter wide, whether they produce 500 MW or 5000 MW of power, so the shielding to be added to each engine is about 345 kg. Perhaps this estimate is optimistic, but we can rely on all the previously mentioned protections to make up for any deficiency. Consider also that the effectiveness of radiation shielding is not linear but improves exponentially with its thickness - it is easy to adjust protection levels. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Finally, there would be significant changes to be made to supply propellant to nuclear rocket engines. We would extend them to take up the volume currently occupied by liquid oxygen. We won’t be changing the total volume of propellant tanks available to us, for a fair comparison with other versions of the Starship. If we selected liquid hydrogen, we would need specially designed tanks with insulation and active cooling. If we feed the nuclear rockets with liquid methane, we can use the same type of propellant tanks as exists today. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The propellant tanks dedicated to landing would also have to be changed. A nuclear Starship is expected to have a heavier dry mass, so more propellant is needed to land it, which means larger tanks. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>With all these modifications in mind, let’s dive into the numbers.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Performance analysis</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We will calculate the performance of a SpaceX starship equipped with nuclear propulsion.</span></span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1554/starship1.PNG"><img data-original-height="734" data-original-width="1554" height="302" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h302/starship1.PNG" width="640"/></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Two nuclear rockets are considered: a 150 kW/kg near-term design operating at 2800K, and a 1000 kW/kg far-term design operating at 3000K.

We will consider the use of traditional hydrogen propellant as well as the methane alternative, and either try to match the accelerations possible with chemical rockets or aim for a lower performance. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>To begin, let’s begin by breaking down the existing Starship design. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It has three vacuum Raptors massing 1.87 tons each, three sea-level Raptors massing 1.11 tons each.

The fuel becomes intensely radioactive. After shutdown, up to 1% of the maximum power output keeps getting released. That’s several megawatts in this case. It falls off rapidly, but radiation levels near the engine would remain lethal for days and harmful for weeks. Remember, it is unshielded around the sides and rear, so there is no protection for someone coming from those angles. NASA estimates that a nuclear rocket engine returns to its ‘safe’ state after a month. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Rapid reuse becomes complicated. Discharging the payload to orbit and then reentering means the nuclear engines are still ‘hot’ after landing. Even if the landing itself is performed with chemical Raptor engines rather than with active nuclear engines, the residual radioactivity means that any ground crew would need to be fully protected, the refueling facilities will all have to be shielded and adding a new payload then stacking it back on top of a Superheavy Booster without contaminating them become very difficult tasks. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Even in space, where we don’t mind irradiating the empty environment, there are issues. Approaching the International Space Station becomes impossible unless the Starship ‘cools down’ for a month in orbit. Docking maneuvers between a Starship and the craft meant to refuel it have to be done along a narrow corridor between each ship’s radiation shadows. Moon landings take place about 3 days after departure from orbit and the use of the main engines. Nuclear rockets would still be ‘hot’ by then and dangerous to any astronaut approaching from the surface. They would have to land far away from any lunar bases, and rely on shielded rovers to transfer payload across the Moon’s surface across a safe distance. The lack of any air to grant free radiation shielding means this safe distance will be very large.</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/s2549/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg"><img data-original-height="1175" data-original-width="2549" height="296" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h296/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is less of an issue for Mars missions.

But this is necessarily a smaller number of missions compared to the Earth-Earth or Earth-Moon missions. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>And finally, there’s the ISRU.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Martian Starships return to Earth after being refilled by propellant produced by CO2 and water found locally. Vast fields of solar panels or fission reactors produce electricity to crack these molecules and reform them into oxygen and methane. A methane nuclear Starship needs nearly three times as much methane than a chemical Starship. It needs no oxygen, but that is a byproduct of the reaction that produces methane anyway - it is not a true saving. Three times more methane means that ISRU facilities have to be three times bigger or refuel three times less Starships, a hefty penalty. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Can the Nuclear Starship be saved?</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is possible to envision a nuclear Starship in the far future.
