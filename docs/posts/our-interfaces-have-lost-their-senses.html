<p>Think about how you experience the world—</p>
<p>you touch, you hear, you move.</p>

<div>
	

<div>
		
		<p>But our digital world has been getting flatter, more muted.</p>
		<p>Reduced to text under glass screens.</p>
		<p>This shift made interfaces simpler.</p></div></div>


<p>An interface is the bridge between
	</p>

			</p>

				</p><p>for ergonomics and ease of use</p></div>
			<div><p>and it should fit how the computer works.
			</p><p>for simplicity and a good mental model</p></div></div>

	<p>Recently, we&#39;ve been too focused on fitting to the computer&#39;s shape, and not enough to our own bodies.
	</p></div>
	</div>

<h2>The Great Flattening</h2>
<p>Computers used to be physical beasts.</p>
<p>We programmed them by punching cards, plugging in wires, and flipping switches. Programmers walked among banks of switches and cables, physically choreographing their logic. Being on a computer used to be a full-body experience.

<h2>The Joy of Doing</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve been successfully removing all friction from our apps — think about how effortless it is to scroll
	through a social feed. But is that what we want? Compare the feeling of doomscrolling to kneading
	dough, playing an instrument, sketching... these take effort, but they&#39;re also deeply
	satisfying. When you strip away too much friction, meaning and satisfaction go with it.
</p>

<p>Think about how you use physical tools. Drawing isn&#39;t just moving your hand—it&#39;s the
	feel of the pencil against paper, the tiny adjustments of pressure, the sound of graphite
	scratching. You shift your body to reach the other side of the canvas. You erase with your other
	hand. You step back to see the whole picture.
</p>

<p>We made painting feel like typing,</p>

<div>
	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/typing.png"/></p>
	
	<div><div><p>but we should have made <em>typing</em> feel like <em>painting</em>.

<h2>Putting the you back in UI</h2>

<p>So how might our interfaces look if we shaped them to fit us?
</p>


<div><p>We think in <em>movement</em>,
		<img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/movement.png"/></p>
	<p>in <em>space</em>,
		<img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/space.png"/></p>
	
	<div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/sound.png"/></p></div>
	<div><p>in <em>patterns</em>.
		</p><p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/patterns.png"/></p></div>
	</div>
<p>We use our hands to sculpt, our eyes to scan, our ears to catch patterns.
	</p>







<p>Our computers can communicate to us in many different formats, each with their own strengths:</p>

<div><div><div><p>Text</p>
			<p>Great for depth, detail, and precision.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/images.png"/></p><p>But it doesn&#39;t always have to be in full paragraphs. How about showing key points first, then letting users expand?
		</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Visualizations</p>
			<p>Ideal for spatial relationships, trends, and quick insights.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/vision.png"/></p><p>Can we show more content spatially? Or encode it in charts or colors?</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Sound</p>
			<p>Perfect for alerts and background awareness. Also, patterns.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/hearing.png"/></p><p>Why are most web UIs silent? Can we use subtle chimes or sonification to highlight patterns?</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Haptics</p>
			<p>Provides passive feedback (vibrations, force).</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/touch.png"/></p><p>Here&#39;s one I always forget about! We can vibrate phones to alert or convey patterns.
		</p></div></div>

<p>And what about the reverse! We can communicate to our computers in many different ways, each with their own strengths:
</p>

<div><div><div><p>Typing</p>
			<p>Precise, detailed, and familiar</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/typing2.png"/></p><p>Good for composing long-form thoughts, keyboard shortcuts, and rough direction.
		</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Clicking &amp; Dragging</p>
			<p>Direct, fine-grained control.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/clicking.png"/></p><p>Great for spatial tasks (design, organization) and pointing at things-on-a-screen.
		</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Tapping, Swiping, Pinching</p>
			<p>Intuitive for direct manipulation.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/tapping.png"/></p><p>Great for mobile, but do we have to limit guestures to mimicking mouse interactions?
		</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Gesturing</p>
			<p>Hands-free, fluid, and expressive.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/guesturing.png"/></p><p>Could be powerful for accessibility, quick actions, and complex fine control—reliable detection feels very possible at this time.
		</p></div>
	<div><div><p>Speaking</p>
			<p>Easy for loose thoughts.</p></div>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/speaking.png"/></p><p>LLMs have made speech more viable—can we let users think out loud or navigate roughly with their voice?
		</p></div></div>



<p>And the real magic happens when we combine different modalities. You can&#39;t read and listen and speak
	at the same time—try reading this excerpt while talking about your day:
</p>

<div><p>If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole life would have been
		entirely different. She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s
		engagement picnic and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear
		what happened to her because of it.
	</p>
	</div>

<div><div><p>But you can talk while clicking,</p>
		<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/click.png"/></p></div>
<div><p>listen while reading,</p>
	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/listen.png"/></p></div>
<div><p>look at an image while spinning a knob,</p>
	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/look.png"/></p></div>
<div><p>guesture while talking.</p>
	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/our-interfaces-have-lost-their-senses/guesture.png"/></p></div>
</div>

<p>Let&#39;s build interfaces that let us multitask across senses.</p>

<h2>Rebuilding the bridge</h2>
<p>So, what might a richer interface look like? I have strong conviction that our future interfaces should:
</p>
<ul><li>let us collaborate on <strong>tangible artifacts</strong>, not just ephemeral chat logs.</li>
	<li>support <strong>multiple concurrent modalities</strong>—voice, gestures,
		visuals, spatial components.
	</li>
	<li>respond to <strong>ambient signals</strong>—detecting context, organizing information, helping
		us think better.
	</li></ul>

<p>Last year, I did a rough exploration of what this could look like for a thought organizing tool. One that listened as you talked or typed, and organized your rambling thoughts into cards.
</p>



<p>This interface is very rough, but felt like a different way of working with technology. Especially how it let me bumble through rough ideas one second, then responded to commands like &#34;re-group my cards&#34; or &#34;add 3 cards about this&#34; the next.
</p>

<p>I would love to see more explorations like this!
</p>

<h2>Our interfaces have lost their senses</h2>
<p>All day, we poke, swipe, and scroll through flat, silent
	screens. But we&#39;re more than just eyes and a pointer finger. We think with our hands, our ears,
	our bodies.
</p>

<p>The future of computing is being designed right now. Can we build something richer—something that
	moves with us, speaks our language, and molds to our bodies?
