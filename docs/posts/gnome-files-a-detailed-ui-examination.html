<p><b>Old codger yells at software, part the latest.</b></p>
<p><i>Spring 2024</i></p>

<h3>The story so far</h3>
<p>
A great amount of my writing on this site revolves around <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/decusab">complaining</a> about <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/noconf">modern</a> user interface <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/usab2">design</a>. Some people agree with me, some don&#39;t. Most probably don&#39;t care at all. That&#39;s fine. What I find interesting is that many (but not all!) people who disagree either present extremely specific non-argument nitpicks like &#34;Something in Windows 3.1 was bad, too!&#34; and ignores the big questions posed, such as whether it&#39;s actually a good idea shoving everything into a single hamburger menu, or if mixing touch and desktop paradigms wildly between and sometimes within programs is actually beneficial to end users.
Others - despite my efforts to the contrary - use sweeping dismissals of the kind &#34;you just don&#39;t like flat design.&#34; That&#39;s true - I <b>don&#39;t</b> like flat design, but many of my arguments have nothing whatsoever to do with aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
Well, that&#39;s what writing on the net is like. But I shall not despair, nor shall I be silenced! Allow me, for a few moments, to focus on a very detailed example that&#39;s got nothing to do with flatness, but rather with how to access core program functionality.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s worth mentioning that I agree that the modern design paradigm probably <i>is</i> friendly to beginner users in many ways. But at some point, people stop being beginners. People who use computers several hours per day, performing a wide variety of tasks in many different programs, should also be taken in to account when designing software. As such, my critique comes from the point of what&#39;s usually called a &#34;power user&#34;. <b>It&#39;s also worth considering that the more an interface hides, the less it offers by way of opportunities for a user to grow and learn.</b>
</p>

<h3>Gnome sweet Gnome</h3>
<p>
For full transparency: It&#39;s no secret that I don&#39;t particularly enjoy the Gnome desktop. When I installed Ubuntu on my work laptop about a year ago, I wanted to see how long I could get by using Gnome. The answer was &#34;about five minutes&#34;. When I decided to switch the default desktop background image to a solid color, I discovered that <i>the only available option</i> in the configuration tool was to select images. Sure, I could google a solution to the problem, which involved a pretty lengthy command line incantation, but depriving the user of a simple option to select a background color was more than my patience could handle.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve written some pretty harsh critique about Gnome before, but I feel this is a project that does deserve critique. It&#39;s not just the default desktop environment in most major Linux distributions, it&#39;s also a project that&#39;s very vocal - opinionated, as the saying goes - about how to do things. A <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2021/07/13/community-power-4/">few examples</a> might be in order:
</p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;Our software is built to be usable by everyone. We care deeply about user experience.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Software should be structurally and aesthetically elegant.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;People&#39;s attention is precious. We pride ourselves in being distraction free.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The &#39;traditional desktop&#39; is dead, and it&#39;s not coming back. (...) Instead of trying to bring back old concepts like menu bars or status icons, invent something better from first principles.&#34;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gnome Files</h3>
<p>
Bold words, indeed! Let&#39;s see how they fare in the real world. Recently, in another sudden fit of open-mindedness, I decided to perform some light file organizing using Gnome Files. This isn&#39;t just any old Gnome application:
the file manager is a central point of any desktop environment, along with window management and a decent set of UI widgets. Surely the Gnome project will have spent a good amount of time and effort on making Gnome Files a flagship application, showcasing their superior UI philosophy from its absolutely best side.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/ListViewTT.png"/></p>

<p>
<b>Yes, it really was this hard for me to find the list view toggle.</b> The &#34;View Options&#34; dropdown didn&#39;t contain view options, but rather sort options, and I didn&#39;t realize it was a split button with two completely different functions. I was further confused when other actual view options were, in fact, only available in the &#34;Main Menu&#34;. To me, this doesn&#39;t feel like &#34;structural elegance&#34;. By now, my calm was replaced with frustration.

<h3>(Not) finding help</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/SearchLV.png"/></p>

<h3>Tipping point</h3>
<p>
While browsing the help, I noticed something else: frivolous tooltips.
Tooltips are a great invention and can be very useful, but a lot of programs nowadays seem to just sprinkle them everywhere, with no particular thought as to whether they&#39;re actually meaningful or not. Gnome Help is one such case.
</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>
Navigating using the Gnome Files UI is fine, for the most part. I&#39;m unused to the button locations, and I miss a button for going one level up, to the parent directory. There are buttons for going back and forward in the navigation history, but that&#39;s not the same thing. Clicking on a directory in the location bar will take you there, but it&#39;s much easier to misclick and thus less convenient.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/Ctrl-L.png"><img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/Ctrl-L.png"/></a></p>
<p>
Having no mouse-driven way of activating a fairly common UI task feels like a step back in discoverability. In fact, I thought the feature hadn&#39;t been implemented until I googled it. To be fair, it <i>is</i> listed in the Keyboard Shortcuts window, but call me old school for expecting GUI elements to be accessible with the mouse.
</p>

<h3>A thousand cuts</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/Shortcuts.png"><img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/Shortcuts.png"/></a></p>
<p>
Upon reaching page three, I learned that there&#39;s even a keyboard shortcut for opening the keyboard shortcuts window - but unlike some other shortcuts, it&#39;s not shown next to its corresponding GUI entry in the Main Menu. Inconsistent and confusing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure why, but the Gnome project has a strong aversion to menu bars. The keyboard shortcuts window may be &#34;reinventing from first principles&#34;, but to me this invention looks like <b>a flawed reinterpretation of a traditional menu bar</b>. A menu bar provides a way of exposing categorized program features in a familiar and always-visible UI, lists their keyboard shortcuts in a consistent manner <i>and it lets the user interact with the option immediately upon finding it</i>.
</p>
<p>
In Gnome Files, we&#39;re instead given a handful of features scattered across the UI. Hidden features (accessible solely through keyboard shorcuts) can only be learned by browsing what is best described as a non-interactive menu of the kind you&#39;d find printed on paper in a restaurant. This browsing brings a considerable context switch because the window is modal, so you can&#39;t keep it open while experimenting. You have to find what you&#39;re looking for, note the keyboard shortcut, close the shortcuts window, and then invoke the feature. Keyboard shortcuts aren&#39;t bad, but in a mouse driven environment, having no way of finding and invoking features through the GUI is limiting and confusing. And why force users to memorize a shortcut for something they might only do occasionally?</p>

<p>
In short, this feels like an afterthought rather than a revolutionary new, efficient approach to operating a GUI.
</p>

<h3>Top o&#39; the window</h3>
<p>
When trying to activate path editing using the mouse, my vigorous clicking just made the Gnome Files window move around. Since the window has no real title bar, it must be moved by clicking-and-dragging in the top part of the window. This is also where the toolbar resides, which means click-dragging <i>on UI controls that already have a completely different function</i>. You can use the search function by clicking on the search icon - but you can also click the search icon and start dragging the window around.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a location history available by either context-clicking or performing a &#34;long click&#34; on the back- and forward buttons, but nothing about the buttons indicate this (and the feature doesn&#39;t seem to have a keyboard shortcut), which introduces further ambiguity regarding the click-drag behavior. Confusingly, performing a long click on other items doesn&#39;t bring up their context menu.
</p>
<p>
Activating windows with the mouse is even worse: If I want to bring a window to the front of the stack, I have to search for a non-clickable area, lest I activate the search feature, skip upwards in the path, switch from list view back to icon view or accidentally access some other program feature. This introduces extreme ambiguity that makes me as a user feel insecure and uncomfortable: a simple mouse slip can give the most surprising results. The user is conditioned to be mindful of this, which increases the cognitive load for very simple and common window operations.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/PathContext.png"/></p><p>
You can, however, middle click on any directory name - <i>including the current directory</i> - to open it in a new tab. Which is also one of the options available in the context menu.
</p>

<h3>Scrollolololo</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/SmallScroll.png"/>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/gnomefiles/pic/BigScroll.png"/></p>

<p>
Moving the mouse about in Gnome Files reveals the scroll bar, as depicted in the first picture above. It&#39;s very small and very hard to see because of the low contrast, but it&#39;s there. But - Ah-hah! - the scroll bar is actually <i>hidden in two steps</i>! When moving the mouse pointer to it, it grows and becomes more visible, as in the second picture above. But when it does, <i>it also moves the entire width of its original size to the left</i>, meaning that my mouse pointer is now pointing at... nothing. Thanks, Gnomebama.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The Gnome Files UI feels haphazard, incoherent and sometimes even dangerous:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Menu names and their contents are confusing, with &#34;View Options&#34; actually being sort options. Actual view options are instead sprinkled across other parts of the UI.
</li>

<li>
Keyboard shortcuts aren&#39;t consistently listed in menus. 
</li>

<li>
Some common features are <i>only</i> accessible - and discoverable - through keyboard shortcuts. The keyboard shortcuts listing is non-interactive, modal, and incurs a substantial mental context switch.
</li>

<li>
Widgets don&#39;t behave quite as you&#39;d expect when compared to other, similar, modern applications.
</li>

<li>
Even within the closed world of Gnome Files, widget looks can be deceptive.
</li>

<li>
Tooltips are either misleading, or comically uninformative and thus annoyingly distracting.
</li>

<li>
Moving windows by clicking on icons that already have a specific function feels unintuitive and introduces an unnecessary risk of misclicking.
</li>

<li>
To activate a window without also activating a program feature, time must be spent searching for a non-interactive area of the UI.
</li>

<li>
Context-clicking in the top part of the window gives spurious and unpredictable results.
</li>

<li>
In the default theme, scroll bars jump away from their original position when you point at them.
</li>

<li>
Searching and then browsing the built-in help for &#34;list view&#34; didn&#39;t actually help me find out how to enable the list view. The only page I could find that contains the exact phrase appears as #15 among the search results.
</li>

<li>
Nomenclature differs between the help texts and the actual GUI.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The many various inconsistencies listed above makes it hard for me as a user to construct mental models and patterns for making efficient and reliable assumptions about the UI. I often have to double check things and look for features in the keyboard shortcuts window, since I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve been deigned a menu entry or toolbar icon. Ambiguous mouse behavior introduces unnecessary cognitive load, making it hard to build confidence even when performing basic tasks.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Designing user interfaces is hard. Writing software is hard. Designing great interfaces and writing great software is even harder. No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t please everyone. Functionally, Gnome Files lets me do file management. I could, if I had no other options, probably get used to its UI idiosyncrasies. But as I&#39;ve hopefully demonstrated above, there are many things about Gnome Files - a central part of the Gnome desktop - that can be considered objectively bad from a UI design standpoint.
</p>

<p>
This doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t other bad programs or that previous design paradigms were perfection incarnate. Neither does it mean that every little bit of Gnome Files is worthless, or that Gnome and Gnome Files are unique in employing these patters (but that&#39;s hardly a comfort). <b>But shouldn&#39;t this new design paradigm produce something better?</b> Isn&#39;t that its whole raison d&#39;être? After ten-fifteen years of the old mainstream desktop paradigm, we arrived at Windows 95 - which wasn&#39;t perfect, but pretty damn consistent, predictable and reliable. After ten-fifteen years of this new paradigm, we instead have constant redesigns and reworkings of solutions to problems we already know how to solve.
</p>

<p>
Examining these new solutions suggests to me that maybe proponents of the new UI paradigm should be a bit more humble in their approach to tried and tested patterns. <b>Nearly all of the criticisms examined above already have well known solutions that have been honed for a period of decades.</b> For example: Having actual window title bars, consistently listing keyboard shortcuts in menus, consistently categorizing menus and options, and using a richer design language. Old doesn&#39;t automatically mean worse, just as new doesn&#39;t automatically mean better.
</p>

<p>
My personal conclusion is that if this is the result of inventing &#34;something better from first principles&#34; to create &#34;structurally elegant&#34; and &#34;distraction free&#34; software &#34;usable by everyone&#34;, I guess I&#39;m just not &#34;everyone&#34;. And that would be fine, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that these days, I&#39;m often left with no choice but using programs with UI:s like these.
