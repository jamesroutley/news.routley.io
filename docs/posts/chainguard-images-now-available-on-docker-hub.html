With this new partnership, Chainguard Developer Images are now available on Docker Hub, providing developers everywhere with access to minimal, secure, hardened images for a wide range of open source and cloud-native projects.</p><p>‍</p><p>The introduction of the DVP program in 2021 further underscores Docker&#39;s dedication to securing the software supply chain — a vision we at Chainguard share and that our new partnership with Docker advances. The DVP program provides trusted content to Docker customers and users, allowing development teams to build securely and minimize access to malicious software.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VQug_4hqHU" title="Justin Cormack talks about Chainguard Images in Docker Hub | Chainguard"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Bringing the benefits of secure, minimal images to developers everywhere</h2><p>Docker Hub has been at the forefront of democratizing software development, offering an expansive library of container images for developers that allows teams to move quickly and build innovative products and services. </p><p>‍</p><p>By integrating Chainguard Developer Images into Docker Hub, we are providing Docker users with secure, minimal, and performant images. Chainguard Images are specifically designed to meet the needs of Docker Business and Trusted Content users, who rely exclusively on Docker to supply quality, secure, and hardened images that they can trust. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>&#34;Finally, Chainguard&#39;s hardened container images are accessible on Docker Hub. Starting today, I&#39;d estimate my Docker runs are now 70% more efficient,” said Darren Shepherd, Co Founder and Chief Architect, Acorn. “Seriously though, this is something I&#39;ve been asking Chainguard about for a while and I&#39;m glad to see the day has come. I can only hope the next critical innovation that happens is adding Wolfi into the library namespace.&#34;</strong></p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IN7ZjhmbNvI" title="Justin Cormack welcomes Chainguard to the Docker Verified Publisher program | Chainguard"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Get started with Chainguard Developer Images on Docker Hub today</h2><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img alt="Image of Chainguard profile on Docker Verified Publisher page of Docker Hub." src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/6228fdbc6c971401d02a9c42/65f20c97a5d7efd21b267e2a_Drn2L6dRmFslgPMvOM8vtQ1h0eriH4f85GhqQXWGL7XYGtxIvxy5LazvQ1A6FmtphuONcucLdSqpR8mL_U-hc1LBeSyc7jAmL7J3LEH-chf8McXUB2r3W-PdWfurDExEsZvfbQ2APIf7EPk5sn_gWRo.png"/></p></figure><p>Chainguard Developer Images are available for a wide variety of open source libraries and languages, including <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/argocd">ArgoCD</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/go">Go</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/redis">Redis</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/nginx">nginx</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/node">Node</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chainguard/python">Python</a> and more.
