<p>When reflecting on my six years at Google, its readability process
stands out as unique within the tech landscape.</p>
<p>As a readability mentor, I’ve reviewed roughly ~100,000 lines of
Python code at Google, written by hundreds of different authors. In
doing this, I am one of thousands at Google who collectively have
shepherded hundreds of thousands of Googlers through the readability
process. The sheer scale of this program has shaped the entire tech
industry’s conception of “idiomatic Python/Java/C++/Go”.</p>
<p>I want to discuss what readability is, how it affects Googlers
(myself and others), its cultural significance within Google, and
whether it makes sense to recreate it outside of Google’s walls.</p>
<h2 id="readability-at-google">Readability at Google</h2>
<p>At Google, every change is required to have one approval from a
maintainer of that corner of the codebase. Most companies do this -
nothing strange here. However, uniquely to Google, every change is
<em>also</em> required to have one approval from somebody who “has
readability”. Having readability means that you know the language’s ins
and outs, design patterns, ecosystem of libraries, and idiomatic usage
at Google, and are thereby trusted to catch any issues in language
usage. The readability requirement is satisfied if either the author or
any reviewer has readability. I would estimate that about a third to a
half of Googlers have readability in their primary work language.</p>
<p>To get readability, you submit code you’ve written, and a readability
mentor is randomly drawn from a pool to review your code. You are
encouraged to read and follow the relevant style guides to avoid trivial
back-and-forth. After writing enough “good” code in that language, you
are granted readability.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Readability in the <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html#readability_standardized_mentorship_thr">SWE
Book</a></p>
<h2 id="readabilitys-impact-on-individual-googlers">Readability’s impact
on individual Googlers</h2>
<p>To many Nooglers, Readability’s enshrinement at the very core of the
code submission mechanism seems like unnecessary bureaucracy. To many
veteran Googlers, readability <em>still</em> seems like unnecessary
bureaucracy. You can choose not to get readability (totally allowed!),
but if too few people on your team have readability, then the team’s
work can grind to a crawl when those reviewers go on vacation. Googlers
undertaking their readability pilgrimage will statistically encounter
that one readability reviewer who takes pride in their prowess as a
human code linter, or has a vendetta against some language feature.
These are just some of the many valid reasons to dislike readability at
Google.</p>
<p>Still, for every person who dislikes the readability process, there
are many others who have been helped. Many of my coworkers have greatly
benefitted from making the readability pilgrimage, and I hope that the
hundreds of diffs I’ve reviewed have improved the codebase at Google.
Readability’s systematic influence on the Google codebase also leads to
a more consistent baseline level of code quality, relative to other
companies of a similar size.</p>
<h3 id="readability-and-me">Readability and Me</h3>
<p>My own readability pilgrimage was rough. Early on, I made the mistake
of submitting a minor improvement to a former intern’s research code for
readability progress. The assigned reviewer tore the entire file apart,
not just the changes I’d made! That was an unpleasant and major
unanticipated scope creep, and from what I learned later as a
readability mentor, that negative review probably set me back 5-10
diffs’ of readability progress. Frankly, that early review was a total
waste of both our time, and probably cost Google $5,000 in lost
productivity if you also account for the additional unnecessary
readability reviews I had to undergo.</p>
<p>Later, as a readability mentor, I got to enjoy reading regular rants
on the mentor-private mailing list about various language features. My
work on AutoGraph’s AST compiler magic got a special callout, which I’m
actually quite proud of :trollface: (For the record: I was the one
person on the team who tried very hard to product manage the scope of
AutoGraph’s magic to the smallest useful set of composable
transformations. I am quite aware of the usability dangers of magic
language features!) So I definitely got to see all of the ugliness that
the readability process was capable of generating.</p>
<p>Still, I thought that readability, done right, was valuable, and
signed up to be a mentor. At first, it took me well over an hour per
diff reviewed - a glacial pace of one line of code per minute! It is
difficult to read a random diff from a codebase you’ve never seen
before, whose conventions you are unfamiliar with, from a workstream
you’ve never heard of, where the local maintainer has already worked
with the author to bring the code to an acceptable bar of quality - and
try to contribute something useful to the review.</p>
<p>I could have taken the easy way out by picking at nits that the
linter missed. But to me, readability mentorship meant Engineering
Excellence, broadly interpreted. Beyond just style and testing, I
commented on code architecture, maintainability, library usage, systems
design, build-or-buy decisions, and much more. Having experienced the
unexpected scope creep review myself, I knew that I should not ask for
the author to rewrite their entire codebase. I had a patience budget I
was allotted for each review, and I tried to use it as wisely as I
could.</p>
<p>Several months into my service as a readability mentor, I found that
I could review code 10 times faster than when I first started. I could
understand, within minutes, the change’s intent, the context of why the
surrounding codebase might look the way it did, and sometimes even the
author’s career history. (e.g. “You seem to come from a Java background.
This visitor design pattern is more concisely expressed in Python using
custom tree iterators.”) I’ve become a measurably 10x engineer, at least
in this one specific ability to review code.</p>
<h2 id="readabilitys-cultural-significance">Readability’s cultural
significance</h2>
<p>Readability is just the tip of the Google culture iceberg. In the
early days, Craig Silverstein, employee #1 at Google, would <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html#readability_standardized_mentorship_thr:~:text=In%20Google%E2%80%99s%20early%20days%2C%20Craig%20Silverstein">carefully
and thoroughly review</a> every new hire’s first CL for best practices
and uniform style. I don’t know if Craig anticipated what readability
would become, but it’s safe to say that he and other early Googlers
understood the multiplicative returns of consistent code style, engineer
fungibility, excellent tooling and centralized systems on programmer
productivity.</p>
<p>Today, Google boasts a unified build system, monorepo, bug tracker,
containerization system, database systems, big data systems, protobufs,
and more. Many secondary systems work their magic, like the ability to
<a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch22.html">manage
refactoring diffs spanning millions of lines of code</a> across many
files, and the ability to <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/04/sensenmann-code-deletion-at-scale.html">detect
and automate deletion of dead code</a>.</p>
<p>Google’s core technical thesis is that global conformity’s benefits
outweigh local inefficiencies. This engineering-centric culture probably
chases away many product-minded, entrepreneurial, and exploratory types,
to its detriment. In the Research org, I saw researchers who chafed at
readability and only tolerated Google systems to the extent that it got
them TPU compute time. On the positive side, Google attracts the world’s
best engineers, and it delivers technically superior results, even as
management pulls boneheaded product moves.</p>
<p>If you accept Google’s core thesis, readability is merely the scaling
mechanism and melting pot by which global conformity is accomplished. I
vividly remember one readability review for some thorny AutoGraph-laden
TensorFlow 2 code written by an engineer in a random not-researchy part
of Google. There were probably only 10 people in the world besides
myself who could have properly reviewed this code, and it happened to
land in my queue. I’m certain that among the readability mentors, there
are many other domain experts who distribute their expertise throughout
Google. The only other Google-wide melting pots I can think of are code
search and LLM-driven codegen tools, but these don’t have the human
touch that readability brings.</p>
<h2 id="should-your-company-implement-readability">Should your company
implement Readability?</h2>
<p>The criteria of readability at Google are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>consensus on a bar for readability</li>
<li>a process for mentoring engineers until they qualify for
readability.</li>
<li>programmatic enforcement that every change should be authored or
reviewed by someone with readability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two criteria are uncontroversial. Many companies have style
guides, and many companies have a single-language codebase with no room
for cultural drift. Many companies also have a tacit expectation that
senior engineers will review junior engineers’ code until they can be
trusted to review each other’s code.</p>
<p>Criterion (3) is the most difficult to implement, both technically
and organizationally. GitHub has a protected branches feature, but it
doesn’t have any way to add concepts like “Python readability”, and I
don’t think GitHub is in any rush to implement readability.
Organizationally, the programmatic enforcement is what causes the most
grumbling, and I could easily see a VP undermining readability by
declaring their upcoming product launch is more important than enforcing
readability.</p>
<p>What benefit would be worth putting a roadblock into the gameplay
loop of an engineer’s workflow? A safety-critical project, perhaps?
Alternatively, maybe you would like to replicate Google’s engineering
culture.</p>
<p>I personally disagree that Google’s global consistency outweighed
local inefficiencies. Apple and Amazon have a reputation for having a
very distinct working experience depending on where you land within the
company, and this is supposed to be bad. Yet, this also means that teams
can move quickly and without consulting the rest of the company. Google
felt like death by a thousand cuts; the larger Google got, the stronger
the pressures to use monolithic products and processes that were not
adaptable to every possible use case. I saw one particular story play
out repeatedly: “We never launched or demoed our research project
because our only deployment option was to go through all the
privacy/regulatory/legal/PR/Pubapprove signoff processes and spend
several months figuring out the TensorFlow serving stack.” Ultimately, I
believe it’s better to shard the company into smaller, more agile
divisions with distinct subcultures adapted to the needs at hand.</p>
<p>So, my answer is that no, companies should not implement Google’s
version of readability. This should be unsurprising; with how many
Xooglers are floating around, we would see more readability outside of
Google if it actually made sense. Simultaneously, Google’s culture has
too much momentum at this point; it should preserve the readability
process and embrace the types of products and problems that its
engineering-centric culture is best suited to.</p>
<h3 id="readability-lite">Readability Lite</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://promys.org/">summer math program</a> I attended in
high school had a phrase: “Prove or disprove and salvage if possible”.
Having disproven readability, I would like to salvage it by proposing
“Readability Lite”, which consists of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>consensus on a bar for readability</li>
<li>a process for mentoring engineers until they qualify for
readability.</li>
<li>a non-blocking mechanism to encourage people to get
readability.</li>
</ol>
<p>This variant salvages the mentorship program while hopefully
eliminating most of the grumbling. It differs from informal mentorship
because it creates opportunities to learn from engineers across the
company, not just within your own team, and it creates an organizational
expectation that engineers can and should strive to master their
craft.</p>
<p>For (1), I would suggest the bar should include an understanding of
the memory model of the language; awareness if not a solid grasp of
language solutions to typical tasks (servers/clients,
serialization/deserialization, regex, metaprogramming, arrays, time,
I/O, logging, performance measurement/debugging/optimization),
understanding of the nuances of dependency management, good testing
practices (including how to architect for easy testability), and some
understanding of why the company’s technical choices suits the company’s
technical/product requirements. Not all “typical tasks” will be
applicable to every company; pick and choose as appropriate! For (2),
you would want to find and incentivize senior/staff+ engineers who want
to mentor others, possibly through some sort of citizenship expectation
in performance evaluations. For (3), I think the simplest solution is to
make readability a requirement for promotion to senior engineer. [cue
flamewar on whether my bar is too high or too low for “senior”
engineers]</p>
<p>Implementation-wise, it’s best to start early. It’s difficult to
bootstrap readability past, say, 100 engineers, because you’d need to
get &gt;20 senior engineers to agree on a bar for readability. If you
assume a quarter of the company has readability (1:3 senior:junior
ratio), that the company is growing at 20% YoY (+25% new hires -5%
attrition), then ~6% of the company’s engineers will need readability
every year. Assuming one readability mentor can mentor 3-5 or so people
to readability every year, 1-2% of all engineers, or about 5-10% of
senior engineers need to be readability mentors.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I learned a great deal, both on the receiving and giving end of
Google’s readability process, and I’m really grateful that Google
invested so much in growing its engineering talent. I understand why
nobody else would want to implement Google’s readability, but I would
love to see more Readability Lite in the world. Please let me know if
you try this out at your company and how it turns out.</p>
