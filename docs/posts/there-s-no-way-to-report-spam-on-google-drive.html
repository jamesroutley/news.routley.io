    <h1>There&#39;s no way to report spam on Google Drive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>Recently, I&#39;ve been getting a lot of spam notifications from Google Drive. Here&#39;s a sample:</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Spam-notification.png" alt="" width="540" height="304"/></p><p>The notifications come direct to my Android phone via the Drive app - they don&#39;t appear in my Gmail spam folder.  There is <strong>no way</strong> to report the abuse.</p><p>If I go to the list of notification in the Android apps, there&#39;s no option to report that the notification is spam.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/List-of-notifications.png" alt="" width="540" height="881"/></p><p>If I&#39;m stupid enough to open the spam file, there is a context menu but - again - no way to report spam.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Spam-options.png" alt="" width="540" height="914"/></p><p>What about the detail pane? That&#39;ll have something, surely?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Spam-no-options-details.png" alt="The details pane is useless." width="540" height="866"/></p><p>Nope! Nothing.</p><p>Let me be me clear, just as Zawinski&#39;s law says &#34;<a href="https://www.jwz.org/hacks/">Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail</a>&#34; - so every Google app expands to be a vector for spam.</p><p>There&#39;s also no way to report the spam from the web version of Drive. The notifications simply don&#39;t appear there.</p><p>In typical Google fashion, there&#39;s no support forthcoming for users who are inundated with these messages. So the poor users howl into the void - desperate for Google to respond. But all Google will do is spout platitudes.</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there.

There is no central authority in Google who is in charge of ensuring a consistent and pleasant user experience.  Their customer service agents aren&#39;t empowered to actually help users - nor can they escalate emergent issues to management.</p><p>As an abusive monopoly, there&#39;s very little incentive for Google to fix this.</p><p>So, like a mug, I&#39;m attempting to catch the passing eye of some Google employee who can raise this internally.</p></div></div>
