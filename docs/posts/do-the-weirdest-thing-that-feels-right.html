    <h1>Do the weirdest thing that feels right</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>While agonizing over what to write last week, I tried to reverse engineer my writing wins. In the process, I discovered that the decision which separated my good writing from my bad writing expanded to my whole life, and was the dividing line between my triumphs and my regrets. </p><blockquote><p><em>“Do the weirdest thing that feels right.”</em></p></blockquote><p>I was shocked to hear myself say it. I had written 10 pages trying to crystallize my attitude toward the wandering, vulnerable, unexpected essays and stories which had resonated with people in the year since I started writing online. I closed my mouth when I saw my own dumbfounded face on the Zoom window. </p><p><span>“That’s good . . . that’s . . . that’s really good.” My friend stumbled over his words. He was as surprised as I was. He was helping me brainstorm what to write for my 32nd issue of </span><em><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/s/weekly-newsletter" rel="">Castles in the Sky</a></em><span>, my newsletter. I had originally planned a blithe, meandering roundup of my first year on Substack, but the stakes had gotten a lot higher. </span></p><p><span>Three days after my last issue, Substack featured my essay </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/a-pilgrimage-for-book-people" rel="">A Pilgrimage for Book People</a><span> in </span><a href="https://read.substack.com/p/substack-reads-47" rel="">Substack Reads</a><span>, the weekly roundup of their favorite things on the platform. I had since been flooded with compliments and congratulations, and my subscribers had grown by sixty percent. </span><em>Castles in the Sky 32</em><span> would be the first email from me a lot of these readers would receive, and so I was torn: should I keep writing about whatever felt right, or should I pivot and narrow down to writing mostly essays about book people? </span></p><p>Talking it through with my friend, I decided there was more I wanted to write about than bookstores and book people, and I’d rather lose subscribers because of who I am than keep subscribers for who I’m not. But then the question remained, what should I write about? So we reviewed which essays had “worked.” </p><p><span>A Pilgrimage for Book People was popular, but that was a deeply personal essay nobody else could have written and I spent months with multiple editors on it. Ironically, the essay which was most popular before I was featured in Substack Reads, </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/requiem-for-sean-in-f-minor" rel="">Requiem for Sean in D Minor</a><span>, was about something totally different and I wrote it in forty minutes, never expecting anybody to read it. After that was an essay about how cool </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/get-into-character" rel="">my Mom</a><span> is, why supporting </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/the-moral-case-for-small-business+" rel="">small businesses</a><span> is a moral decision, how </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/a-dirge-for-eastern-redwoods" rel="">an extinct tree</a><span> reminded me of my deceased uncle, and–even though the likes weren’t as high–I still regularly get messages concerning </span><a href="https://charliebecker.substack.com/p/the-masculine-urge-to-take-marzipan" rel="">a short story</a><span> about an alcoholic who takes a trip to see a magic giraffe. </span></p><p>My friend asked me how I decided to write those specific essays. And that’s where the mantra welled up from: </p><p><strong>“Do the weirdest thing that feels right.” </strong></p><p><span>It was so obvious, yet so elusive. Immediately, so much about my writing became clear. What I should focus on became obvious. I felt silly about ideas I had where I was playing dumb status games or “</span><em>shoulding</em><span>” myself. I started to draft the notes that would become this essay. </span></p><p>Later that night, I told my wife about it all before bed. As I was falling asleep, I sat bolt upright. The usefulness of this imperative wasn’t limited to my writing, it was a line through my entire life, separating my triumphs and my regrets. </p><p>I don’t think I’m alone in spending a lot of time wondering what the right thing to do is. Not like, “should I steal candy from this baby?” but like, “How should I balance my career and artistic endeavors? How do I vote? How much doom and gloom should I tolerate in the news to be an informed citizen? How do I model a balance of hope and realism for my child?” </p><p><span>It’s not that I’m not sure when something is right or wrong–wrong choices are clear. It’s that there seem to be so many options that all </span><em>feel right</em><span>. With endless research, discussions, daydreams, and deliberating, sometimes I forget what I actually think is right, or why I think the things I do. </span></p><p>I was laying in bed after talking to my wife thinking about a decision at work where there were a lot of good things I could do, and from nowhere I asked myself, “of all these good options, which is the weirdest?” And it became abundantly clear. </p><p><strong>I realized that when I think that something is ‘weird,’ it is not really about what I think at all.</strong><span> What I am actually doing is modeling what I think other people will think about it. For example, if I was going to order a lunch delivery, and I thought to myself, “well, I wouldn’t mind a ham sandwich, or a pepperoni pizza, or two dozen raw oysters,” I would probably think to myself, “Oysters? Weird.” But I don’t think oysters are weird, I think that other people will think it’s weird. </span></p><p><strong>Weirdness is a construct that is a stand-in for other people’s expectations. </strong></p><p><span>So if I have a bunch of equally viable options, I should pick the weirdest one, because it means that is the one that is </span><em>truest to me</em><span>. It means it has had to elbow its way in past what other people think, other people’s expectations, and any insidious fear I have of being judged for doing what I want or what I think is right. In the scenario above, yes other people might find it strange, but I should Doordash two dozen raw oysters. </span></p><p>And looking back at my life, I can easily find examples where I did something ‘weird’ and it went great, and where I didn’t do what was ‘weird’ and it was terrible. </p><p><span>For example, when I was 22 I moved to China with no language skills, no job, about $500, and no place to live. It was a weird decision but an amazing experience I wouldn’t trade for anything. But then I was thinking about leaving China after two years or so. My boss basically talked me into staying because he said I might be able to get into an Ivy League MBA Program. I didn’t really care that much, but the idea of that prestige was so seductive (and </span><em>not weird</em><span>) that I stayed another year, the last eight months of which were pretty awful. </span></p><p><span>My life is one long chain of times where I did something that I thought was weird and it went </span><em>great</em><span>, and times when I tried not to be weird and it went awful. Two things I hold in high value are self-knowledge, and overcoming fear. “Do the weirdest thing that feels right” is a way to immediately see where I’m afraid, and to better understand myself. </span></p><p>I plan to write about this a lot more, but I’m sharing it here because it’s been so useful for me already in just a week. It helped me short-circuit the culture war hamster wheels I found myself on after scrolling social media. It helped me decide which workout and diet to do. It helped me plan activities with friends. And it helped me decide that I should write this essay. </p><p><span>Because while I do want to write more about book people, the right people will appreciate that this essay is equal parts autobiographical, vulnerable, entertaining, and insightful. </span><strong>And maybe someone will read it, and with an upcoming choice they’ll ask themselves, “what’s the weirdest thing that feels right?” And a world where people are always asking themselves that is one I want to live in.</strong><span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
