      <p>It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed.  We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin&#39;s Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled.  We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience in the meantime.</p>
