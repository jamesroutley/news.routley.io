    <h1>Pinnacle – a modern tribute to the 1986 classic, The Sentinel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Originally released in 1986 by Geoff Crammond, The Sentinel, also known as The Sentry in the United States, was a pioneer in 3D graphics for home computers. It quickly became one of the highest rated games on the BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.</p><div uk-scrollspy-class=""><p>In the annals of video game history, certain titles stand out for their innovative gameplay, groundbreaking graphics, or compelling narratives. Among these is the 1986 game &#34;The Sentinel&#34;, published as &#34;The Senty&#34; in the USA.</p>
<p>Developed by Geoff Crammond, a British game designer renowned for his work on the Grand Prix series, The Sentinel pushed the boundaries of what was possible on home computers at the time, offering a unique blend of strategy, atmosphere and tension that captivated players and critics alike.</p>
<p>For its time, The Sentinel was a revolutionary game. It was one of the first games to use solid 3D polygon graphics on home computers, a significant leap forward in an era when most games were text based, using 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Geoff developed a technique where rather than rendering a complete view in real time - impossible on 8-bit hardware - the camera would rotate a number of degrees at set intervals. The edge portion of the screen would be rendered as it came into view.</p>
<p>This mechanic was built into the game play and for the first time on home computers allowed for a truly immersive 3D gaming experience.</p></div></div>
