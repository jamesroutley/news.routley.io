<h3 uk-scrollspy-class=""> A modern tribute to the 1986 classic, The Sentinel. </h3><div uk-scrollspy-class=""><p>Originally built by Geoff Crammond and published on 8-bit home computers in the late 1980&#39;s.</p>
<p>Pinnacle captures the ambience and mood of the original game while taking advantage of modern processing power.</p></div>

<div uk-scrollspy-class=""><p>As a teenager in the late 80s, I was profoundly influenced by The Sentinel and played it obsessively on my Commodore 64. 37 years later, I&#39;m thrilled to present Pinnacle, a modern tribute to the original game. A reimagining that is faster paced and makes use of modern features like global illumination, volumetric fog and shadows while staying true to the game&#39;s original concepts.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that players enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the original.</p></div>

<h2 uk-scrollspy-class=""> Immersive gameplay in a surreal world </h2><p>Pinnacle is a game of energy, entropy and in many ways the cycle of life itself. Harness the energy around you, use it wisely, conserve it. Like the tangible world around us, energy is perpetual. It is never destroyed, it just changes form.</p>

<p>Originally released in 1986 by Geoff Crammond, The Sentinel, also known as The Sentry in the United States, was a pioneer in 3D graphics for home computers. It quickly became one of the highest rated games on the BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.</p><div uk-scrollspy-class=""><p>In the annals of video game history, certain titles stand out for their innovative gameplay, groundbreaking graphics, or compelling narratives. Among these is the 1986 game &#34;The Sentinel&#34;, published as &#34;The Senty&#34; in the USA.</p>
<p>Developed by Geoff Crammond, a British game designer renowned for his work on the Grand Prix series, The Sentinel pushed the boundaries of what was possible on home computers at the time, offering a unique blend of strategy, atmosphere and tension that captivated players and critics alike.</p>
<p>For its time, The Sentinel was a revolutionary game. It was one of the first games to use solid 3D polygon graphics on home computers, a significant leap forward in an era when most games were text based, using 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Geoff developed a technique where rather than rendering a complete view in real time - impossible on 8-bit hardware - the camera would rotate a number of degrees at set intervals. The edge portion of the screen would be rendered as it came into view.</p>
<p>This mechanic was built into the game play and for the first time on home computers allowed for a truly immersive 3D gaming experience.</p></div>
