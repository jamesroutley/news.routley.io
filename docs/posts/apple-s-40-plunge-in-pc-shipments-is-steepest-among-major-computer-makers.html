<p>Over the past several months, I’ve felt increasingly unsettled by the incredible programming feats being performed by modern AI tools like Github Copilot and ChatGPT. They can <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/i-asked-chatgpt-ai-to-write-react-and-javascript-for-me-and-i-was-shocked-detailed-analysis-d68d55be7746">write React components</a>, <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/810715504?h=73e4c18772">make data visualizations</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/mortenjust/status/1636001311417319426">build full iOS apps</a>.</p>
<p>At first I paid little attention (it’s just hype, right?), but eventualy I couldn’t ignore it. To be honest, the more I learned the more I felt afraid.</p>
<p>I didn’t like this. What’s happening to me? I used to be so excited about new technologies. Am I worried that I’ll <a href="https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1627313436114780160?lang=en">fall</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1640120495700951040">behind</a>? That I’ll <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf">lose my job</a>? That it’ll <a href="https://newsletter.goodtechthings.com/p/when-programming-is-gone-will-we">suck all the fun out of programming</a>?</p>
<p>I’m not the only one feeling afraid. I recently read <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-americans-fear-the-ai-future">an eye-opening post</a> that mentioned how only 15% of Americans were more excited than concerned about increasing AI usage. In comparison, “65% of Chinese people were optimistic about AI creating jobs rather than destroying them.”</p>
<p>What happened to us Americans? We used to be so optimistic. Isn’t this supposed to be the land of opportunity? And now we’re cowering in fear?</p>
<p>AI is <a href="https://www.rhcbooks.com/books/43177/what-was-i-scared-of-by-dr-seuss">the pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them</a>. It’s new and it seems unnatural and threatening.</p>
<p>But being afraid is no way to live. So I decided that it’s time for me to confront the pants.</p>
<p>I’m planning to spend a bunch of time over the next several weeks digging into to AI tools for augmented development. I want to learn what’s out there and how it works. Just in the last week I got access to some of the more popular tools (ChatGPT, Github Copilot, etc) and I’m going to see what I can do with them.</p>
<p>It’s early but I’m already starting to feel that “new technology excitement” coming back.</p>
