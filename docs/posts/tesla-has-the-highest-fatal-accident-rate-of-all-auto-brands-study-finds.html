    <h1>Tesla has the highest fatal accident rate of all auto brands, study finds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-body="standard-article"><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0">Tesla&#39;s vehicles have the highest fatal accident rate among all car brands in America, according to a <a href="https://www.iseecars.com/most-dangerous-cars-study#v=2024" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.iseecars.com/most-dangerous-cars-study#v=2024" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recent iSeeCars study">recent iSeeCars study</a> that analyzed data from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). </p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1">The study was conducted on model year 2018–2022 vehicles, and focused on crashes between 2017 and 2022 that resulted in occupant fatalities. <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62894174/tesla-cybertruck-6th-recall-2024/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62894174/tesla-cybertruck-6th-recall-2024/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tesla">Tesla</a> vehicles have a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven, according to the study; Kia is second with a rate of 5.5, and Buick rounds out the top three with a 4.8 rate.  The average fatal crash rate for all cars in the United States is 2.8 per billion vehicle miles driven.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2">The study also breaks down some of the data for individual models. The <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a28796/tesla-model-s-update-here-it-is-for-real/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a28796/tesla-model-s-update-here-it-is-for-real/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tesla Model S">Tesla Model S</a> has a rate more than double than average, at 5.8 per billion vehicle miles driven; meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a26827259/2021-tesla-model-y-reveal-photos-specs-price/" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a26827259/2021-tesla-model-y-reveal-photos-specs-price/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tesla Model Y">Tesla Model Y</a> — the best-selling vehicle in the world has a fatal crash rate of 10.6, nearly four times the average. It ranked as the sixth worst vehicle overall. (The <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/venue" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/venue" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hyundai Venue">Hyundai Venue</a> took the top spot overall, with a fatal crash rate of 13.9.) <br/></p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3">The study&#39;s authors make clear that the results do not indicate Tesla vehicles are inherently unsafe or have design flaws. In fact, Tesla vehicles are loaded with safety technology; <a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/tesla/model-y-4-door-suv/2024" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/tesla/model-y-4-door-suv/2024" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named the 2024 Model Y as a Top Safety Pick+ award winner">the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named the 2024 Model Y as a Top Safety Pick+ award winner</a>, for example. Many of the other cars that ranked highly on the list have also been given high ratings for safety by the likes of IIHS and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, as well.<br/></p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4">So, why are Teslas — and many other ostensibly safe cars on the list — involved in so many fatal crashes? “The models on this list likely reflect a combination of driver behavior and driving conditions, leading to increased crashes and fatalities,” iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in the report. “A focused, alert driver, traveling at a legal or prudent speed, without being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is the most likely to arrive safely regardless of the vehicle they’re driving.”</p><section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-9" data-node-id="6"></section><section data-lazy-id="P0-11"></section></div></div>
