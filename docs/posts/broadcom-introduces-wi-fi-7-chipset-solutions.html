Broadcom claims that these Wi-Fi 7 chips double the performance of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E solutions commercially available today. </span><span id="more-81327"></span></p>
<center></center><center>(click images to enlarge)</center> 
<p><span>According to the specifications listed on Broadcom’s website most of these chips share similar features, for example 4096 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), Multi-Link Operations (MLO), Automated Frequency Coordination(AFC), ZeroWait Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and Uplink/Downlink OFDMA/MU-MIMO. Furthermore, all these chipsets are IEEE compliant to meet Wi-Fi 7 standards.</span></p>

<p><span>According to the datasheets for these devices, one of the main differences between residential and enterprise access point chips is the temperature range. The enterprise access point chips operate in a larger temperature range (-40C – 85C) compared to the commercial version (0 to 70C).</span></p>
<p><span>Broadcom also provided a Wi-Fi 7 router reference design that integrates a BCM4916 as the network processor. The BCM4916 is a  quad-core ARM v8 64-bit processor that includes an integrated NBASE-T(up to 10G) Ethernet PHY for WAN/LAN, a dual issue runner network processor and a high-performance Security Processing Unit (SPU). Other features include a 32-bit DDR3/DDR4 DRAM interface, extensive USB ports, quad integrated 1GbE PHYs, three USXGMII interfaces as well as secure boot and ARM trustzone. </span></p>
<center></center> 
<p><span>The BCM4398 targets mobile applications and AR/VR devices since it also includes Bluetooth 5 support. The System on Chip contains a simultaneous dual band (SDB) 2×2 IEEE 802.11be-compliant radio, a dual core Bluetooth radio (BT 5.2) and a scan core that improves BL and WLAN operations. </span></p>
<p><span>Specifications for the BCM4398 include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>20/40/80/160/320 MHz channels for the 2×2 5 GHz and 6 GHz radio</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>20 MHz channels for the 2×2 2.4 GHz radio</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Simultaneous dual-band (SDB) mode support</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Scan radio enhances 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz channel performance</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Dual-core Bluetooth support</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Bluetooth Class 1 or Class 2 TX operation</span></li>
