There are many reasons that I hold this opinion, but principally:</p><ul><li><p>It’s hard to be a great analytics provider, harder yet to be a great satellite imagery provider, and nearly impossible to be great at both simultaneously</p></li><li><p>You wind up competing with your customers, and that’s, like, not the vibe 💅</p></li><li><p>Satellite imagery is inherently applicable to many problems, so you’re fighting gravity to try to focus on just one while getting pulled in a thousand other directions</p></li></ul><p>But it gets worse, because satellite imagery companies are not the only offenders here.

After all, 99% of the people who can benefit from satellite imagery do not need to ever see it directly to receive that benefit (and wouldn’t even know how to open the file if you sent it to them).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif" width="500" height="374" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:374,&#34;width&#34;:500,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:148512,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/gif&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f997f3-acb0-48cc-adf6-8e7b89be9468_500x374.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a><figcaption>Most beneficiaries of satellite data can’t open a GeoTiff or  tie their own shoes.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It turns out some people <em>do </em>just want pixels and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on satellite data, so that part of the aphorism is wrong. </p><p>Even worse, the second part is wrong, too.

You can “fine tune” a generic “pre-trained” model with a relatively small number of examples (1-10K) and get incredible results this way. It’s a compromise, and it certainly does not produce 90% margin SaaS-like revenue, but at least it works and some people will pay for it.</p><h2>An alternative (and far better) business model </h2><p>Here’s the thing—the people launching data products are on the path to success.

They didn’t stop at the underlying data feed. They build <em>applications </em>that their customers use to take actions and solve problems. If you use an application every day, you don’t mind paying a subscription for it.</p><p>Even satellite imagery companies can take this approach.
