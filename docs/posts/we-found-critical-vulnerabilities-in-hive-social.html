    <h1>We found critical vulnerabilities in Hive Social</h1>

<p>Following the Twitter takeover, a number of services promising to be an alternative gained traction. One of those is “<a href="https://hivesocial.app">Hive Social</a>”, which reached more than a million users in the last weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, we were interested and took a look at Hive from a security standpoint. <strong>We found a number of critical vulnerabilities</strong>, which we confidentially reported to the company. After multiple attempts to contact the company we finally reached them by phone and they acknowledged the report. After multiple days and multiple reminders by us, they claimed to have fixed all issues. However multiple vulnerabilities we reported <strong>still exist</strong> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>
	⚠️ <strong>We strongly advise against using Hive in any form</strong> in the current state.
</p>
<p>The issues we reported allow any attacker to <strong>access all data</strong>, including private posts, private messages, shared media and even deleted direct messages. This also includes private email addresses and phone numbers entered during login.</p>
<p>Attackers can also overwrite data such as posts owned by other users, which we show in the following video:</p>

  <p>Screen recording of the Hive Social App on an iPhone. We are logged in with the zerforschung account, in our timeline are posts from a test account visible. The post &#39;Hello Hive!&#39; is shared by using the share sheet with a custom script. A text input field appears, showing the posts internal id and current text, allowing us to edit the text &#39;Hello Hive!&#39; to &#39;Goodbye Hive!&#39;. Our edit is confirmed, asking us to reload the timeline. The app gets force closed and opened again. The post of the test account is visible in the timeline again, this time with the text &#39;Goodbye Hive!&#39;</p>

<p>To not endanger the privacy of the people currently using Hive even further, we will not be publishing a more in depth analysis at the current time.</p>
<p>If you need an alternative to twitter, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">try mastodon</a>. You can <a href="https://chaos.social/@zerforschung">follow us on there, too</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll update this post with more details once Hive finally fixed their issues.</p>
