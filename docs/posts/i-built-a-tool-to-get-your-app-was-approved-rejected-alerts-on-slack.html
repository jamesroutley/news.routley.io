                                                <p>Statused is a great tool for developers, but what we didn&#39;t anticipate is that it filled a gap in Tellus&#39; processes, as the product and marketing teams now have a realiable and quick way of looking up our app&#39;s status.</p>

                                                <p>This service was immensely useful for us as a company. It helped non-technical people to self serve and get an update on the status of release without asking an engineer!</p>

                                                <p>It has been awesome to be able to be notified of the iOS app deployment stages via Statused. Everyone is able to self serve and be aware of where we stand on iOS. Wish we could also use it for android! (Editor&#39;s note: Android support has been added since this was written!)

                                                <p>Statused.com transcends its utility beyond the developer&#39;s domain, serving as a conduit for transparency amongst different departments. At Skeelo, it&#39;s become an indispensable tool, catalyzing a more engaged and informed team synergy.</p>
