                            <p>A running list of films I‚Äôve watched in 2024:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tampopo (1985) - Don‚Äôt let the broth boil or it‚Äôll get cloudy.</li>
  <li>Ikiru (1952) -  Last watched this when I was 17 and my mom rented all the Kurosawa films on DVD via the original Netflix.</li>
  <li>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) - Somehow I went into this movie not realizing it was a musical.</li>
  <li>Wonka (2024) - Also didn‚Äôt realize this was a musical.</li>
  <li>Strange Days (1995) - Ultimately a piece of coprogranada‚Ä¶ Angela Bassett insists multiple times that a film of two cops executing a black rapper should be shown to the media but two white men tell her that the ensuing riot would be her fault. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Days_(film)">‚ÄúThe scene where the crowd celebrates the turn of the new millennium at the end of the film was shot at the corner of the 5th and Flower streets, between the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and the Los Angeles Public Library. Over 50 off-duty police officers were hired to control an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, who had to pay $10 in advance to attend the event. The filmmakers also hired rave promoters Moss Jacobs and Philip Blaine to produce performances featuring Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite, as well as ‚Äúall the cyber-techno bands they could garner‚Äù. It was reported that a total of $750,000 was spent on the event, which included the rental of half of the 1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure. The event started at 9 pm on a Saturday night and ended shortly before its scheduled end at 4 am, as five people were hospitalized for suffering overdoses of ecstasy.‚Äù</a></li>
