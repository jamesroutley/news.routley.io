        <p>And I don&#39;t just mean that nobody uses it anymore. Like, I knew everyone under 50 had moved on, but I didn&#39;t realize the extent of the slop conveyor belt that&#39;s replaced us.</p>
        
        <p>I logged on for the first time in ~8 years to see if there was a group for my neighborhood (there wasn&#39;t). Out of curiosity I thought I&#39;d scroll a bit down the main feed.</p>

        <p>The first post was the latest xkcd (a page I follow). The next <em>ten posts</em> were not by friends or pages I follow. They were basically all thirst traps of young women, mostly AI-generated, with generic captions. Here&#39;s a sampler — mildly NSFW, but I did leave out a couple of the lewder ones:</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-thirst-traps.png" alt="A collage of Facebook posts of random women in revealing clothing"/></p><p>Click to show mildly sensitive content (revealing clothing)</p>
        </div>

        <p>Yikes. Again, I don&#39;t follow any of these pages. This is all just what Facebook is pushing on me.</p>

        <p>I know Twitter/X has worse problems with spam bots in the replies, but this is the <em>News Feed</em>! It&#39;s the main page of the site! It&#39;s the product that defined modern social media!</p>
        
        <p>It wasn&#39;t all like that, though. There was also an AI video of a policeman confiscating a little boy&#39;s bike, only to bring him a brand new one:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-police.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI generated video with a policeman and child"/>

        <p>And there were some sloppy memes and jokes, mostly about relationships, like this (admittedly not AI) video sketch where a woman decides to intentionally start a fight with her boyfriend because she&#39;s on her period:</p>
        
        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/boyfriend-sketch.png" alt="Facebook post of a video sketch"/>

        <p>Maybe that isn&#39;t literally about sex, but I&#39;d classify it as the same sort of lizard-brain-rot engagement bait as those selfies. Meta even gives us some helpful ideas for sexist questions we can ask their AI about the video:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions.png" alt="Suggested AI prompt: why do women feel refreshed after arguments?"/>

        <p>Yep, that&#39;s another &#34;yikes&#34; from me. To be fair, though, sometimes that suggested questions feature is pretty useful! Like with this post, for example:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions-2.png" alt="Facebook post with photos of a woman in a short dress, possibly AI. Suggested AT prompts are: why is she wearing pink heels? What is the woman&#39;s personality?"/>

        <p>Why <em>is</em> she wearing pink heels? What <em>is</em> her personality? Great questions, Meta.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>I said these were &#34;mostly&#34; AI-generated. The truth is with how good the models are getting these days, it&#39;s hard to tell, and I think a couple of them might be real people.</p>
        
        <p>Still, some of these are pretty obviously AI. Here&#39;s one with a bunch of alien text and mangled logos on the scoreboard in the background:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-football.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI photo of a woman in a football stadium"/>

        <p>Hmm, I wonder if anyone has noticed this is AI? Let&#39;s check out the comments and see if anyone&#39;s pointed that ou—</p>

        <p>...never mind. (I dunno, maybe those are all bots too.)</p>

        <hr/>
        
        <p>So: is this just something wacky with my algorithm?</p>
        
        <p>I mean... maybe? That&#39;s part of the whole thing with these algorithmic feeds; it&#39;s hard to know if anyone else is seeing what I&#39;m seeing.</p>
        
        <p>On the one hand, I doubt most (straight) women&#39;s feeds would look like this. But on the other hand, I hadn&#39;t logged in in nearly a decade! I hate to think what the feed looks like for some lonely old guy who&#39;s been scrolling the lightly-clothed AI gooniverse for hours every day.</p>

        <p>Did everyone but me know it was like this? I&#39;d seen screencaps of stuff like the Jesus-statue-made-out-of-broccoli slop a year or two ago, but I thought that only happened to grandmas. I hadn&#39;t heard it was this bad.</p>

        <p>I wonder if this evolution was less noticeable for people who are logging in every day. Or maybe it only gets this bad when there aren&#39;t any posts from your actual friends?</p>

        <p>In any case, I stopped exploring after I saw a couple more of those AI-generated pictures but with girls that looked like they were about ~14, which made me sick to my stomach. So long Facebook, see you never, until one day I inexplicably need to use your platform to get updates from my kid&#39;s school.</p>
