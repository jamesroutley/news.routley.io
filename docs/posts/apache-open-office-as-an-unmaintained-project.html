<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation">The Apache Software Foundation</a>
offers a suite of office productivity software named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Open_Office">Apache Open Office</a>.
Based on the <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>, you would
never guess the last major release of the software was made available in 2014.</p>
<p>With that bit of release history in mind, would it be fair to consider Apache
Open Office as an un-maintained project? In this blog post, I share a quick
recap of the history behind Apache Open Office, and my opinion on why The
Apache Software Foundation’s actions may be masking the answer to this question.</p>

<p>A proprietary office suite was developed in 1985 by a company named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Division">Star Division</a>,
aptly named StarOffice.</p>

<p>In the year 2000, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>
released the source code of StarOffice for free. This resulted in the first
release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> the following year.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice">LibreOffice</a> was first released in
2010 based on the OpenOffice.org source code. LibreOffice is actively
maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Document_Foundation">The Document Foundation</a>,
a non-profit created by members of the OpenOffice.org community for the express
purpose of managing and developing LibreOffice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>, having acquired Sun
Microsystems in 2010, now owned the OpenOffice.org trademarks. The year
following the acquisition, Oracle provided the OpenOffice.org trademarks
and any related Oracle-owned code to The Apache Software Foundation in 2011.
This resulted in the creation of Apache Open Office.</p>

<p>Between its first release with version 3.4 in 2012, and its last major release
with version 4.1 in 2014, Apache Open Office integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Symphony">IBM Lotus Symphony</a>,
after it was donated to The Apache Software Foundation, added a reworked sidebar
and some other new features, as documented in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Notes">4.1 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2014… Bug fixes, dictionary updates, bug fixes, dictionary updates,
whitespace “fixes”, dictionary updates, dictionary updates and <strong>did I
mention dictionary updates</strong>!?</p>

<p>You might want to sit down before opening the next link. Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/openoffice/commits/trunk">apache/openoffice</a> commits
made over the last several years.</p>
<p>What do we find? A lot of commits that don’t actually amount to much at all.
In many cases, the commits <strong>don’t even make any change to the program</strong>,
because they are only changing the blank space that surrounds the source code.</p>
<p>Why would someone do this? Two possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are legitimate whitespace issues that need to be addressed.</li>
<li>There is an incentive to make a project appear as though it were active, when it is actually inactive.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first is fair to assume in most cases, when we look at the list of
commits made to the repository, we find that whitespace changes are not just
part of the commits that Apache Open Office has been receiving, whitespace
changes make up a substantial amount of the commits added to the repository.</p>
<p>Projects become unmaintained every day. This is a fact of life, and is not the
issue I am taking with The Apache Software Foundation. It is the way the
foundation, and its contributors, do not disclose information relating to the
lack of substantial updates or changes for nearly a decade, and seems to
intentionally mask the lack of development.</p>

<p>We can tell The Apache Software Foundation that we, as a community of users, do
not support the foundation’s actions in regard to their management of Apache
Open Office. If this blog post motivated you, send an email to <a href="mailto:apache@apache.org">apache@apache.org</a>
saying something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Apache Open Office has not received substantial updates nor changes in nearly
a decade, yet there is no mention of this anywhere on the download page. In
the best interest of the community, please consider mentioning this
information, as well as providing a link for users to download other actively
maintained office software.</p>
<p>The Apache Open Office GitHub repository receives regular commits, but these
changes seem to largely be whitespace-only. This gives the impression that
the repository is more active than it really is, as non-substantial changes
seem to make up a large number of the commits added. Please archive the
repository if active development has ceased.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
</blockquote>
