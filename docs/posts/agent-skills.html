    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-title="Overview" data-page-href="/home" id="content"><p><span data-as="p">Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.</span></p><h2 id="why-agent-skills"><span>Why Agent Skills?</span></h2>
<p><span data-as="p">Agents are increasingly capable, but often don’t have the context they need to do real work reliably. Skills solve this by giving agents access to procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context they can load on demand. Agents with access to a set of skills can extend their capabilities based on the task they’re working on.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>For skill authors</strong>: Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>For compatible agents</strong>: Support for skills lets end users give agents new capabilities out of the box.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>For teams and enterprises</strong>: Capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages.</span></p><h2 id="what-can-agent-skills-enable"><span>What can Agent Skills enable?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain expertise</strong>: Package specialized knowledge into reusable instructions, from legal review processes to data analysis pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>New capabilities</strong>: Give agents new capabilities (e.g. creating presentations, building MCP servers, analyzing datasets).</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable workflows</strong>: Turn multi-step tasks into consistent and auditable workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Reuse the same skill across different skills-compatible agent products.</li>
</ul>

<p><span data-as="p">The Agent Skills format was originally developed by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthropic</a>, released as an open standard, and has been adopted by a growing number of agent products. The standard is open to contributions from the broader ecosystem.</span>
