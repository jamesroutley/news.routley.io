<div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="feature-1">

<p>
Connect to your media using any web browser on any device for a feature-rich dive into dynamic pages for every media file you have.
Play directly from the browser, or send to your devices.
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="privacy">

<p>
We do not track <strong>any</strong> actions you take in the program. How many other media servers can claim that?
Your server is as secure as your home network, and all external requests are made via secure connections.
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="renderers">

<p>
Support for the largest range of media renderers. Connect to your media via UPnP or DLNA on a large selection of devices, whether
television, audio device, gaming console, computer, smartphone or more, with regular improvements to all.
</p>
</div>


<div role="tabpanel" id="feature-3">

<p>
Access your media instantly, with no waiting for scans to finish.
We have scanning for extra features too, but you still have access to your media in the meantime.
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="feature-4">

<p>
Even if your video has no subtitles, or it has them in the wrong language, just enable our Live Subtitles feature to download them on the fly. Coupled with our interface which supports 40+ languages, we have first-class international support.
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="feature-5">

<p>
We support passing your media to your devices untouched if they support it, otherwise we will transform it to suit your network, device, and language preferences. We also provide support for your physical media with the ability to directly access your disc drives and disc images.
