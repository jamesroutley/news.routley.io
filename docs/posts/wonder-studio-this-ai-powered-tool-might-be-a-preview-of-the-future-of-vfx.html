<p>Startup company Wonder Dynamics has unveiled “an AI tool that automatically animates, lights and composes CG characters into a live-action scene”: at least, that’s the promise behind their upcoming tool, Wonder Studio.</p>

<h2>Wonder Studio: a bold pitch</h2>



<p>The video presentation is, let’s face it, quite impressive. Behind the scenes, Wonder Studio can be used thanks to a web interface. This tool can automatically animate a CG character by replacing an actor/actress from a plate (in other words, a live-action shot). Furthermore, the software also handles lighting and color correction. All of this, thanks to AI.  </p>



<h2>A tool to help artists, not replace them</h2>



<p>Even better: Wonder Studio is not a black box that will give you a video, but no way to adjust something if things go wrong. Even though Wonder Dynamics wants their product to be used by a wide audience (which is why you can use it with a simple drag and drop), the idea is to give studios and artists the tools they need to expand on the work done by the AI.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-about-the-training-data">What about the training data?</h2>



<p>As usual when a new AI tool is released, we must ask ourselves how the AI model was trained. In this case, Wonder Dynamics explained to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/wonder-dynamics-puts-a-full-service-cg-character-studio-in-a-web-platform/">Techcrunch</a> that they did not rely on pre-existing data scrapped without asking anyone involved.  In other words, Wonder Dynamics wants to stay away from the ethical and legal issues faced by other AI-powered tools. </p>



<h2>Fundraisers and big names</h2>



<p>Wonder Dynamics co-founders Nikola Todorovic and Tye Sheridan, managed to raise $12.5 millions de dollars in 2021 and 2022 from various investors, including Epic Games.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, an Advisory Board has also been set up. Yoy might note two big names: directors, producers and writers Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo. </p>

<h2>Is there room for VFX artists in a post-AI world? (Yes)</h2>



<p>Wonder Studio gives us a glimpse of a future where fastidious and repetitive tasks currently done by artists could be automated. </p>



<p>This will of course allow more people to create realistic projects, videos and even movies at a lower cost, similarly to what happened thanks to low-cost mocap suits or Blender. </p>



<p>This will also free up some time inside VFX studios: resources that could then be invested somewhere else, to improve the end result.</p>



<p>Can we hope this might also improve the working conditions of VFX artists worldwide, with less ovetime? Unfortunately, it seems unlikely. As Doug Chiang – Vice-President &amp; Executive Creative Director, Lucasfilm, explained us when we interviewed him a few weeks ago (starting 7’29” in the video below), 35 years of new technologies (previs, real-time rendering…) did not get rid of overtime. It therefore seems unlikely AI will have a different impact. </p>
