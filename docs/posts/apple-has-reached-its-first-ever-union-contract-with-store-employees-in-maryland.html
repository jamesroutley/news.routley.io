A vote is scheduled for Aug. 6. </p><p>“By reaching a tentative agreement with Apple, we are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains,” the union’s negotiating committee said in a statement. “Together, we can build on this success in store after store.”</p>
    

<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>The deal came after workers at the store <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-store-maryland-union-strike-960295499eb853d96287164349907088">authorized a strike in May</a></span>, saying talks with management for more than a year hadn’t yielded “satisfactory outcomes.” </p><p>The Maryland store is one of only two unionized Apple sites in the country. Employees there voted in favor of the union in June 2022, a few months before workers at a second Apple location in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, unionized with the Communications Workers of America. The second store has not secured a contract with the tech company. </p><p>Unions have scored headline-grabbing election wins in recent years, including at an Amazon warehouse in New York City, a Chipotle store in Michigan and hundreds of Starbucks stores across the country. But many of them have not secured contracts. </p>
