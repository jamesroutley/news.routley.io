    <h1>Wash trading gone wrong â€“ how a $100M/day crypto exchange bankrupted itself</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>This is the story of BaseFEX - a crypto exchange that unintentionally bankrupted itself through wash trading.</p><p>It&#39;s a cautionary tale for any crypto exchange looking to get ahead by faking volume - and a solid guide for anyone who knows a bit of coding, and wants to take advantage of shady crypto exchanges.</p><h2 id="the-founding-of-basefex">The founding of BaseFEX</h2><p>The BaseFEX crypto exchange was created in early 2019, by two Chinese nationals (Jesse Wu and Randolf Zhou). </p><p>It marketed itself as a &#34;Bitmex alternative&#34;, and featured a slick UI.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-11-38.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1253" height="773" srcset="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-11-38.png 600w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-11-38.png 1000w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-11-38.png 1253w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The BaseFEX UI.</figcaption></figure><p>The exchange had a rough start. Its documentation was copied straight off of the Bitmex site, which caused people on Bitcointalk (where the exchange was originally announced) to start <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5127951&amp;ref=blog.everstrike.io">questioning its legitimacy</a>. </p><p>Nonetheless, BaseFEX was eager to rise in the ranks and become the next Bitmex.</p><h2 id="faking-volume">Faking volume</h2><p>After being listed on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/da/rankings/exchanges/derivatives/?ref=blog.everstrike.io">Coinmarketcap</a> and a number of other sites, BaseFEX did what many exchanges also do: Fake volume.</p><p>Faking volume allowed the site to climb in the rankings on these sites, which exposed it to a greater audience of people, and, ultimately, more customers. Because the site had large volume numbers, potential customers immediately thought that it was legitimate.</p><p>However, there was a problem: Its way of faking volume was rudimentary, to say the least.</p><p>There are three different ways of faking volume.</p><h3 id="1-printing-fake-trades">1. Printing fake trades</h3><p>In this volume faking method, the exchange simply prints a ton of fake trades. The trades always take place within the spread, and the volume distribution of the trades is often uniform. No actual orders are submitted or matched.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="831" height="304" srcset="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png 600w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png 831w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Exchanges that fake trades often have &#34;pretty&#34; volume distributions.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-executing-real-trades-but-within-a-network-of-bot-accounts">2. Executing real trades, but within a network of bot accounts </h3><p>This method is more subtle than the previous one, and harder to expose. It&#39;s possible that it has been used by many of the top exchanges in the past, including Binance (Binance boss, CZ, is <a href="https://u.today/cz-trading-against-binance-clients-from-300-accounts-cftc-documents-claim?ref=blog.everstrike.io">allegedly</a> in control of more than 300 Binance accounts). It requires the exchange to synchronize a large number of fake accounts, making it technically non-trivial to pull off.</p><h3 id="3-executing-real-trades-by-having-a-bot-account-place-random-market-orders">3. Executing real trades, by having a bot account place random market orders</h3><p>This method is the easiest to implement, and also the riskiest. </p><p>Every few seconds, a bot account on the exchange will place a randomly sized market order.</p><p>The market order will match with another order on the exchange. Typically (but not always), this order is a limit order placed by one of the market makers of the exchange. </p><p>If the market maker is the exchange itself (many crypto exchanges also act like bucket shops, and <a href="https://protos.com/the-history-of-crypto-exchanges-trading-against-their-own-customers/?ref=blog.everstrike.io">trade against their own customers</a>), there is no harm done - the exchange will simply shuffle funds between two of its bot accounts.</p><p>If the market maker is someone else (such as a customer, acting as a market maker), the exchange is essentially paying the customer a spread. The spread can range from 0.01% to 1% of the value of the trade. If done repeatedly, this can cause the exchange to lose a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="basefex">BaseFEX</h2><p>BaseFEX initially used the third method. </p><p>Every couple of seconds, a market order was submitted by a BaseFEX-controlled bot account. The market order was either a buy or a sell, and was matched with another order in the order book. </p><p>Throughout the course of a day, thousands of market orders were submitted, accumulating a trading volume in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>This went well in the beginning, since BaseFEX was also the sole market maker on its platform. The BaseFEX-controlled market maker account would absorb all of the market orders, and earn all of the spread.</p><p>However, it wasn&#39;t long until someone figured out a way to to take advantage of the scheme.</p><h3 id="bertyar88">Bertyar88</h3><p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile%3Bu%3D2639394&amp;ref=blog.everstrike.io">Bertyar88</a> is your average Eastern European basement dweller - unemployed, and with $1,000 in his account. He came across BaseFEX in June 2019. </p><p>After watching the platform for a while, he discovered that most of the volume there was fake - and came up with a way to take advantage of it. </p><p>Armed with some rudimentary Python knowledge, Bertyar88 coded up a simple trading bot. The bot would place a limit order on each side of the order book on BaseFEX&#39;s TRX/XBT market, and periodically refresh the orders, as they were filled, or the price changed. In essence, his bot was a very simple market making bot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-16-23-51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="575" height="264"/><figcaption>Snippet from Bertyar88&#39;s bot. This section simply prints the orders that the bot submitted. The bot was less than 1,000 lines of code in total.</figcaption></figure><p>While simple, the bot turned out to be a massive success. </p><p>It absorbed thousands of market orders per day, earning Bertyar88 a 0.05% spread every time it was filled.</p><p>Within one month, the bot achieved a 1,000% return, turning 0.3 BTC into 3 BTC. </p><p>Bertyar88&#39;s bot went unnoticed for the most part. It was only when he tried to withdraw his earnings that the admins on BaseFEX <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5160738.0&amp;ref=blog.everstrike.io">discovered</a> the bot. They immediately banned his account, and blocked the withdrawal. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-30-51-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="698" height="609" srcset="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-30-51-1.png 600w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-30-51-1.png 698w"/><figcaption>BaseFEX blocked Bertyar88&#39;s withdrawal under the pretext of having found &#34;suspicious activities&#34; in his account.</figcaption></figure><p>Frightened by the fact that a single user could milk them for 2.7 BTC, the admins temporarily paused BaseFEX&#39;s wash trading bot.</p><p>The following day, BaseFEX&#39;s trading volume decreased by 99.99%.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-03-39.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1490" height="621" srcset="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-03-39.png 600w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-03-39.png 1000w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-14-03-39.png 1490w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Left: Volume while BaseFEX&#39;s wash trading bot was running. Right: Volume after the bot was turned off.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-end-of-basefex">The end of BaseFEX</h3><p>Since discovering that their wash trading bot had been exploited, the admins on BaseFEX never dared to turn on the bot again.</p><p>BaseFEX slid down to the bottom of the rankings on Coinmarketcap, and gradually faded into oblivion.</p><p>The BaseFEX platform was taken offline sometime during 2021. The people behind the site have successfully managed to erase the site from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/basefex.com">Wayback Machine</a> - however, a number of Bitcointalk threads <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=basefex+scam+bitcointalk&amp;ref=blog.everstrike.io">remain</a>.</p><p>Bertyar88 never managed to withdraw his funds - his account never got unbanned, and his withdrawal was never processed. </p><p>However, he can at least comfort himself with the fact that he single-handedly managed to take down a $100M volume/day crypto exchange - with just $1,000 in savings, and 1,000 lines of Python.</p>
