    <h1>Show HN: Ezno, a type checker for JavaScript and optimiser for React</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Published on Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup> September 2022</p><p><img src="https://kaleidawave.github.io/media/introducing-ezno-banner.png" alt="" width="1200" height="629"/></p><p>Ezno is an experimental compiler I have been working on and off for a while. <strong>In short, it is a JavaScript compiler featuring checking, correctness and performance for building full-stack (rendering on the client and server) websites</strong>.</p><p>This post is just an overview of some of the features I have been working on which I think are quite cool as well a bit on the project philosophy ;)</p><p><em>it is still work in progress, all the examples work but the tool is still in its infancy</em></p><p><strong>The core of Ezno is a type checker for JavaScript</strong>. Type synthesis is analysing syntax and formulating properties of terms. Comparing the information on terms and how those terms are used, a type checker can prevent errors at runtime.</p><p>Ezno&#39;s type checker is built from scratch. Getting the features I wanted requires a lot of different functionality and needed several new ideas that as far as I know aren&#39;t present in any type-system or existing checkers. The checker is fully compatible with TypeScript type annotations and can work without any type annotations at all.</p><h3>You can think of it as an extension to TSC, similar ideas but taken further</h3><p>The next few sections go into some unique features of the checker before going into the real benefit of having all this type information.</p><h2 id="dependent-typing" tabindex="-1">Dependent typing</h2><p>One of the key ideas with Ezno is that it attempts &#34;maximum&#34; knowledge of a source. This knowledge includes:</p><ul><li>Runtimes exception that could happen because of missing properties</li><li>Code that will never run</li><li>Expressions that could be collapsed to reduce work</li><li>Mutations to data</li></ul><p>Because of the dynamism of JavaScript, this requires including references to constants (aka known numbers, bools, strings, etc) in the type-system.</p><p>While TypeScript includes constant equality, Ezno has built on top of that doing more such as constant operator evaluation.</p><pre><code><div><pre><code><span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>

However, its internals are computationally expensive. With Ezno one of the goals was to provide enough static analysis to work with the expressiveness of React but use the information to make it do a lot less work.</p><blockquote><p>&#34;framework&#34; is a temporary name for the plugin written on-top of Ezno, Ezno is not the framework. The &#34;framework&#34; is a plugin using logic from the parser <strong>and checker</strong> and is entirely detachable.</p></blockquote><h2 id="eliminating-the-need-for-a-virtual-document-object-(vdom)" tabindex="-1">Eliminating the need for a Virtual Document Object (VDOM)</h2><p>Firstly a definition of the VDOM (from <a href="https://kaleidawave.github.io/posts/web-terminology/#vdom">web definitions</a>):</p><blockquote><p>The virtual DOM is a structure akin to the DOM. It is slimmer and has a subset of the API of the structures defined in the DOM JS spec e.g. <code>HTMLElement.</code> VDOM is a <em>virtual</em> representation of the document, actual DOM references the document (e.g. <code>.click()</code> isn&#39;t on VDOM structures).</p><p>It is used to add to or update the existing actual DOM / UI.</p></blockquote><p>VDOM implements declarative programming. When state changes it recreates the UI by rerunning the method with the declaration method. This allows programming as a <em>map</em> state of the rather than <strong>manually</strong> adding the imperative updates to the document at every state change.</p><h3 id="the-vdom-isn&#39;t-free%3A" tabindex="-1">The VDOM isn&#39;t free:</h3><p>Before we go into eliminating it we have to deal with the why? As well as the downsides that should occur in the alternative.</p><h4 id="every-update-requires-evaluating-the-ui" tabindex="-1">Every update requires evaluating the UI</h4><p>Every time an update to state happens, the runtime needs to rebuild the UI whole tree. This is necessary to find that any of the nodes have changed, but the majority of the new UI hasn&#39;t changed and you have to create and store duplicate nodes. The UI can require evaluating expensive calculations that often returns the existing value.</p><blockquote><p>Memoization partially solves this, parts of the tree can be wrapped and when compute them it looks for cached versions of the computation. While this solves the recreation time there is additional memory overhead to hold the cached results and hashing and lookup is not free. It is also developer overhead to realise what is static and independent. Extra explicivity-ness in the syntax (unless a auto memoising compiler was added), just overall more complicated.</p></blockquote><h4 id="memory%2C-computation-and-library-overhead" tabindex="-1">Memory, computation and library overhead</h4><ul><li>Because <code>x.innerHTML = newUI()</code> doesn&#39;t really work because it has to create new elements on browser and thus can lose state of old elements. Instead it uses the VDOM intermediate representation to work out updates actual to DOM nodes rather than fully replacing them. Holding this intermediate representation requires additional memory as now there is both a browser UI tree in memory and the framework interpretation.</li><li>To find the updates it uses a process named &#34;diffing&#34;. After a new frame has been built it has to be compared to an original frame, which requires walking these trees and comparing nodes.</li><li>And to do all this handling with the VDOM the library has to be shipped with a reconciler on top of the state handler and the diffing algorithm, all leading to <strong>larger JS payloads</strong>.</li></ul><h4 id="adding-event-listeners-to-existing-%2F-server-rendered-markup-is-more-expensive" tabindex="-1">Adding event listeners to existing / server rendered markup is more expensive</h4><p>Unless using event listener delegation ahead of time, when adding event listeners to existing markup VDOM requires a representation of the whole tree to find event listeners. And even if the event listeners are delegated, a VDOM framework requires creating the existing UI tree to perform updates on an existing server-rendered tree, which requires all loading state that only may be read by the UI.</p><h2 id="vdom-without-the-vdom%3A" tabindex="-1">VDOM without the VDOM:</h2><p>Again, One of the questions for this project was &#39;what analysis do you need to do to use JSX and the full range of JS expressions that React works with, without running into the complexities and execution expensiveness of a VDOM&#39;.</p><p>Ezno runs on <em>fine-grained reactivity</em> directly on the DOM.

Also logic for retreival increases the bundle size a little bit.</p><h3 id="page-loading%2C-adding-event-listeners-and-the-double-run-problem" tabindex="-1">Page loading, adding event listeners and the double run problem</h3><p>For upgrading existing HTML, rather than each element registering its own event listener (which can result in hundreds of <code>addEventListener</code> calls) it instead adds a single one at the top level. The output of the framework is still a work in progress but with the bijective property map the position of elements works without the notion of components.</p><pre><code><div><pre><code><span><span>createRoot</span><span>(document.body).</span><span>render</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> &lt;&gt;</span></span>

This is perfectly fine for most things but I think this is generally quite a heavy restriction, which prevents using a lot of cool backend technologies written in other languages like Rust, Python etc. Some tools have embeded a JavaScript runtime into the application (such as <a href="https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8">rusty_v8</a>). However joining these two systems together <em>can</em> lost type safety bridge and data often has to be copyied into the runtime which seems to void the performance improvements.</p><p>With type information it could allow Ezno to generate some format that is tightly integrate with the server language. This is quite simple to do for string elements and Ezno knows the shape of data and the pointer to every function it could easily transpile some of this stuff. However it is still up in the air how this would work if the server has to do something more complicated mutating data and I don&#39;t have a clear idea of what the format would be that could be used across languages would look like?</p><h4 id="linting" tabindex="-1">Linting</h4><p>With types you can restrict the code written. For example <code>Math.sin</code> is typed as being <code>(x: number) =&gt; number</code>, however JavaScript is more flexible and <code>Math.sin([4])</code> is still a valid call even though <code>[4]</code> is not a subtype of <code>number</code>.</p><p>With type information you can (optionally) check and deny some behavior based on the values of things. This could be used to enforce semantic HTML. e.g <code>img</code>s require a <code>alt</code> tag property, functions registered for the <code>click</code> event cannot make navigation calls unless they are a anchor tag...</p><p>There is quite a lot a more you can do with a type system other that checking you have spelt <code>JSON.stringify</code> correctly and using the information to optimising things to run slightly faster.</p><h4 id="auto-progressive-enhancement" tabindex="-1">Auto progressive enhancement</h4><p>As Ezno knows at compile time what functions have been bound to certain event listeners plus the internal effects it knows to extract runtime state mutations to the server to add a backup to client side interactions if JavaScript fails to load.</p><h2 id="plugins-and-extensibility%3A" tabindex="-1">Plugins and extensibility:</h2><p>Ezno is written in Rust and has several places/hooks for adding additional functionality:</p><h3 id="exterior-type-safety%3A" tabindex="-1">Exterior type safety:</h3><p>Because <a href="#objects">Ezno treats functions as unique</a> it allows for special handling of functions via Ezno&#39;s plugin system.</p><p>For example, the <code>fetch</code> function could be overwridden and for known strings could return a more precise type based of knowledge of what a endpoint returns.</p><h3 id="build-tool-front-ends%3A" tabindex="-1">Build tool front-ends:</h3><p>Aside from the CLI, there is a language server plugin (LSP) so you can use it in a editor. For those who donâ€™t like the command line build step, there is a half-working Nodejs runner, this means you can integrate the build step into the runner compressing running the source into a single command. For the web there is a WASM service worker runner that shouldn&#39;t need to touch the filesystem during development.</p><p>Enough with the features here is a roundup and some philosophy of the project</p><h3 id="types-and-typescript" tabindex="-1">Types and TypeScript</h3><p>Types are an integral part of JS with things like <code>instanceof</code> and <code>typeof</code> so I don&#39;t think some of these ideas are too foreign with the language. Type annotations in source code are treated as restrictions under Ezno and so are not strictly necessary. This differs from TypeScript which treats things like the return annotation as the source of truth, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABATwBQEMBcj1mQSmwGcoAnGMAc0QG8AoRRxUgUyhFKXToF8660AJnwA6IgBsYEFqmFA">allowing this to be validly checked</a>:</p><pre><code><div><pre><code><span><span>// Passes under tsc</span></span>

<span></span></code></pre></div></code></pre><p>TypeScript has a bit of a funky implementation around <code>any</code> allowing <code>a</code> to be cast as a string in the above example. Implementing <code>any</code> this way makes TypeScript easier to adopt and allows things to compile in weird environments. However for Ezno to do its optimisations this magic <code>any</code> type that has the property of all types without narrowing doesnâ€™t quite work.</p><p>From the previous section on events and some notions around generics, understandably, the information needed is more complex (and verbose) than simple annotations allow, thus treating Ezno types as the source of truth rather than annotations in the source code. However, some of these annotations are possible. To describe the &#34;root environment&#34; of the JS standard library, Ezno uses modified TypeScript definition files peppered with decorators that register information associated with functions such as function bindings and effects they can run.</p><p><strong>Donâ€™t take this as a knock on TypeScript, TypeScript is great</strong>. Ezno started off as pet project to re-implementing the features of TSC in Rust. But as things started to go well after adding more and more TSC features, it was apparent that bigger such as hydration and the reactive system goals werenâ€™t going to be possible directly following its path. It isnâ€™t possible to detect what can happen to state when called through a term that represents <code>any</code>. TypeScript <em>holes</em> arenâ€™t particularly critical if you just want code completions and some level of type safety. They allow the more complex parts to not be blocked by compiler errors. <strong>But for doing optimizations a single unknown result can make it impossible</strong>.</p><p>Currently Ezno isnâ€™t a feature-complete type checker. There are still a lot of things to still work on. For example Ezno &#34;proof via predicates&#34; is in the works to add to the existing &#34;proof by definition&#34; type system. So far the first section goes over the analysis on completely static code. The next steps are to apply these ideas to more dynamic structures. There are also some ideas not mentioned here to prevent this post from being too long ðŸ‘€.</p><h3 id="frameworks%3A" tabindex="-1">Frameworks:</h3><p>The output of the framework is still work in progress. There is still a few things to add to the type checker that are necessary to get &#34;the framework&#34; plugin to work in edge cases. Thus no benchmarks or definite output in this post. Most benchmarks show hand written JavaScript code to be the most efficient so the idea is to take the syntax and information about it to squeeze it into the closest of the hand written forms. The performance gains from all this optimisations are probably un-noticeable. This is really an exercise in attempting to get to the least amount of code to run to make a page interactive.</p><p>Some frameworks abstract through libraries and structure of functions. Some compiler-based frameworks abstract through syntax. Ezno is more unique it is based on data and the semantics of the program above what is visible from the syntax.</p><h2 id="ezno-today" tabindex="-1">Ezno today</h2><p>I am still unsure on the name. I think it is fun short and quirky and most importantly, not taken on package managers. It has a little bit of a hidden meaning (<em>&#34;easy? no&#34;</em> referring to doing static analysis on JavaScript).</p><p>I want to keep things moving but slowly. On initial viewing incomplete projects seem bad but I think that there is a good as they have space to add additional features and improve. Some projects I see which seem in closer to their goal have problems with improving. I think some tools are built too quickly and I donâ€™t want Ezno to fall into that category. It is a bit earlier than I want to speak about the project but I am keen to see feedback about what issues this fixes as well as other ideas to persue.</p><p>No demo binary out yet, need to finish of some things on more advanced events to get some of the cooler demos to work. Hoping for something demonstratable before the end of this year ðŸ¤ž</p></div></div></div></div>
