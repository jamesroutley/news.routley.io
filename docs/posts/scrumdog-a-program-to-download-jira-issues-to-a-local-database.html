<p>Scrumdog is a software program I created to help me automate my Jira Issue reporting.
Scrumdog downloads Jira Issues to a local SQLite database for analysis and reporting.
It is a really helpful tool if you are managing a complex, multi party project with both Jira and non-Jira users and you report regularly to a Steering Committee.
You can download Scrumdog from <a href="https://scrumdog.app/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-info-from-jira">Getting info from Jira</h2>

<p>Jira has many real-time dashboards and reports (“filters”) that can be used to manage Jira Issues.   Jira also provides you with the ability to export issues in CSV, XML or Excel/Google Sheets format.  However – if you find yourself (like me) downloading thousands of Jira issues regularly (e.g. daily) for reporting and analysis – it might be easier to just automate your steps.</p>

<p>The approach I took to automate Jira reporting consists of two steps: </p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://whoek.com/images/jira-scrumdog.jpg"/></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://whoek.com/b/use-jira-api-to-create-excel-reports">previous post</a> I showed how this can be done with Python.   However to simplify the process further, Scrumdog can be used to automate Step 1 without you having to write any code.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-scrumdog">When to use Scrumdog?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You have an overwhelming demand, up and down your organisation, for project status data</li>
  <li>You want to automate your Jira Issue reporting</li>
  <li>You are familiar with SQL e.g. basic <code>SELECT</code> statements</li>
  <li>You want to use SQL to do more complex analysis on your Jira Issues, rather than be limited to JQL</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-scrumdog">When not to use Scrumdog</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Existing Jira dashboards and reports (“filters”) give you exactly what you want</li>
  <li>No need to automate Jira reporting because reporting demands and issues are manageable in Jira</li>
  <li>You don’t know or want to use SQL</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-considerations">Design considerations:</h2>

<p>The following was important to me as a user of Scrumdog:</p>

<h4 id="must-have">MUST HAVE</h4>
<ul>
  <li>No need for the user to code themselves</li>
  <li>Local database must be SQLite, because:
    <ul>
      <li>No additional software is required to use</li>
      <li>No maintenance required of database</li>
      <li>It is a file-based database so easy to backup/delete a database. Just copy/delete the database file</li>
      <li>Standard SQL can be used</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use standard Jira APIs to download the Jira Issue</li>
  <li>Use JQL (Jira Query Language) to select issues to download</li>
  <li>It should be easy run the program on any PC:
    <ul>
      <li>With no installation required</li>
      <li>Just download and run single-file executable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Must be able to run program from the Command Line, so that it can be scheduled in batch mode to automate the download</li>
  <li>Basic setup / configuration should be quick and simple to do
    <ul>
      <li>The username, API key, JQL is listed in a simple text-based config file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="if-possible">IF POSSIBLE</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Program should be available to use on Windows, Linux or Apple Mac machines</li>
  <li>Use the Jira default field names but provide a way to override this is needed. Example for custom fields</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="development-of-scrumdog">Development of Scrumdog</h2>

<p>Almost any general purpose programming language could be used to develop Scrumdog.
The evaluation criteria I used to pick a suitable programming language:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Should enable fast development time</li>
  <li>Must be able to create small standalone executable with no dependancies</li>
  <li>Should be able to create executables for Windows, Linus and Mac</li>
  <li>Fun factor (totally subjective)</li>
</ul>

<p>I came up with the following shortlist of possible programming languages to use:  Python, C#, Java, D, OCaml and Go.  This list is based on my experience and requirements – yours will most definitely be different.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I know Python well</li>
  <li>Vast user base -  #1 in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe index</a> of the popular programming languages</li>
  <li>Works on all major operating systems</li>
  <li>Lots of libraries available</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not able to create single file executable without specialist tools</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c">C#</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Big user base - #5 in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe index</a></li>
  <li>Corporate sponsor - Microsoft</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not easy/possible to create single-file executable for Linux and Mac</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="java">Java</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Big user base - #3 in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe index</a></li>
  <li>Works on all major operating systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not able to create small single file executables without specialist tools</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="go">Go</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Growing user base - #12 in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe index</a></li>
  <li>Can create single-file executable for Windows, Linux and Mac</li>
  <li>Corporate sponsor - Google</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was not very familiar with  Go, but it looked easy enough to learn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="d">D</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can create a single-file executable for Windows, Linux and Mac</li>
  <li>Has the simplicity of Python but with speed of C/C++</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not a mainstream programming language, but great community and corporate sponsors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ocaml">OCaml</h3>

<p>Positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can create a single-file executable for Windows, Linux and Mac</li>
  <li>I have used OCaml before, so familiar with syntax, tools and libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Similar to D, also not a mainstream programming language</li>
  <li>Some of the key libraries, e.g. “Jane Street Core” libraries do not work on Windows</li>
</ul>



<p>I excluded Python, C# and Java based on the negatives listed above and decided to create simple prototypes using D, OCaml and Go.
The prototypes were 20-30 lines of code each to test the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability of program to perform an API call (https) to Jira</li>
  <li>Ability to create, read and update some SQLite tables and records</li>
  <li>Test that single-file executable is working on various Windows, Linux and Mac machines</li>
</ul>

<p>After evaluating the prototypes, Go was excluded based on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At a glance, the syntax of Go and D were similar and between the two I preferred the history and community of D over Go</li>
  <li>The Go generated binary (.exe file) was also a lot bigger than the one created by D or OCaml</li>
</ul>

<p>With OCaml and D left, I decided to proceed further with both. After a few hundred lines of code – I had the basics working for both the OCaml and D programs.</p>

<h2 id="and-the-winner-is-">And the winner is …</h2>

<p>At this point it was almost a coin-flip on which one to use, but I decided to continue with OCaml based on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was more familiar with OCaml – having used it before on other projects</li>
  <li>I felt OCaml forced me to keep my code structured and clean – which I appreciated</li>
  <li>Although I picked OCaml to develop Scrumdog, I will definetely re-visit D for future projects</li>
</ul>

<p>After a few more days of developement and testing I had a working version of Scrumdog and was able to use it in my own automated reporting workflow.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-sqlite">Working with SQLite</h2>

<p>You would need a tool to test SQL queries and manage the SQLite database files.
I find the SQLite command-line shell program a bit too minamilistic to use.
My prefered way to create and test SQL queries is with a (free) program called <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a>.
With DB Browser for SQLite it is also possible to display the database table contents and/or edit data, which is very handy during testing.</p>

<h2 id="creating-excel-reports-from-sqlite">Creating Excel reports from SQLite</h2>

<p>Although not the focus of this post – you may want to create Excel reports from SQLite.
Python has some great libraries to get you going very quickly.
Here is an example of how to create a simple Excel report using data from SQLite.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>import</span> <span>sqlite3</span>

<span># Get data from SQLite db
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlite3</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;jira.db&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>sql</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;select * from zz_issues; &#34;</span>
<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_sql_query</span><span>(</span><span>sql</span><span>,</span> <span>con</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span> 

<span># write to Excel
</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>to_excel</span> <span>(</span><span>&#34;report.xlsx&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>header</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="future-improvements-to-scrumdog">Future Improvements to Scrumdog</h2>

<p>Some enhancements in the pipeline:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Execution speed is OK but can be improved if API calls are done concurrently (not serially)</li>
  <li>Better management of database locking during updates</li>
  <li>Include some basic Excel reporting options</li>
</ul>
