  <p>Today, we are announcing an exciting development for the Swift programming language: its migration to a dedicated GitHub organization at <a href="http://github.com/swiftlang">GitHub.com/swiftlang</a>.</p>

<p>This migration reflects the growth and maturity of the Swift community and highlights Swift’s versatility beyond Apple’s own ecosystems. Over the last decade, many inspiring individuals’ hard and creative work has elevated Swift into various creative and practical applications. With a GitHub organization dedicated to Swift, we are creating an even more conducive environment for collaboration and innovation. This change will allow Swift to expand its reach to more platforms and use cases, sparking fresh possibilities and broadening Swift’s impact across the technology landscape.</p>

<p>The migration to the <code>swiftlang</code> organization will be phased over the coming weeks and months, striking a balance between minimizing disruption and ensuring a deliberate completion. Initially, the <code>swiftlang</code> organization will include foundational elements of the Swift project, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compiler and core tools</li>
  <li>Standard libraries and core APIs</li>
  <li>Samples</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://swift.org/">Swift.org</a> website</li>
  <li>Official clients, drivers, and other packages (<em>coming soon</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>As we move forward, we will address several key governance aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods for integrating new projects into the organization and guiding them through a successful maturity cycle</li>
  <li>Utilization of GitHub teams and other tools to expand our contributor base and clearly define roles for commiters</li>
  <li>Extend and augment continuous integration (CI) support to ensure Swift and all of its components is a well-tested, production-ready programming language for all use cases</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.swift.org/community/#community-structure">Various groups within our community</a> will spearhead this migration, including the Core Team, the Contributor Experience Workgroup, the Swift Server Workgroup, and the Website Workgroup. This initiative represents a community-wide effort, with full transparency as changes progressively unfold.</p>

<p>As a first step, we will move the <code>swift-evolution</code> repository today, with other repositories transitioning over the coming weeks. We will post updates to the accompanying forum posts as the migration unfurls.</p>

<p>On behalf of the core team, I want to express our deep gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the Swift dream, from its inception a decade ago to today.  Together, we are building the pathways for the next chapter of Swift!</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

<p>Ted (and the Swift Core Team)</p>
