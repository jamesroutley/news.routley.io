    <h1>Ventoy: Remove BLOBs from the Source Tree</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
<div>
          <h3 dir="auto">What happened?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Due to the recent XZ-Utils drama I checked the code and I&#39;m appalled. There are more BLOBS than source code.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no reason to have those not be build in the release process. Of course it&#39;s convenient, they are prebuild, it&#39;s fast and nobody has a problem with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Recent events however showed that these BLOBs can contain everything and nothing. The build instructions would not produce the exact same executable for everyone. It&#39;s better to have GitHub build it on-push and use them out of the build cache.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would do it myself, but unfortunately I&#39;m not familiar enough with the Ventoy build process to actually do it. I understand that removing BLOBs isn&#39;t a priority over new and shiny features. But due to recent events, this should be rethought.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for reading this and I hope for a productive conversation</p>
