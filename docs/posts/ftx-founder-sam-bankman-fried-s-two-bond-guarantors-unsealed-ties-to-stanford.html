They live near the university.</p><p>&#34;Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried have been close friends of my wife and I since the mid-1990s,&#34; Kramer told CNBC&#39;s Eamon Javers. &#34;During the past two years, while my family faced a harrowing battle with cancer, they have been the truest of friends — bringing food, providing moral support, and frequently stepping in at moment&#39;s notice to help. In turn, we have sought to support them as they face their own crisis.&#34;</p><p>Kramer said he was acting &#34;in my personal capacity&#34; and has &#34;no business dealings or interest in this matter other than to help our loyal and steadfast friends.&#34;</p><p>Kramer signed a $500,000 unsecured bond, while Paepcke signed the same type of bond for $250,000.</p><p>Paepcke, who graduated from Harvard University and has a Ph.D. in computer science from a school in Germany, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The only information provided in the unsealed documentation was the names of the guarantors and the dates they signed the documents. Their names match the identities of two Stanford University-associated individuals.</p><p>Bankman-Fried&#39;s initial release was secured by both his family home and by the two bonds. The former crypto billionaire will return to New York later this week for a hearing before a Manhattan federal judge over his bail conditions, and he&#39;s expected to face federal trial in October.
