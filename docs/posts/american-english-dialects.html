  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>A group of linguists had been gathering data on
  North American English dialects using a web-based survey. They asked for our

  with 3903 total responses in December 2012. You can see some preliminary

  <p>Thanks to all of you who have written expressing
  appreciation for the page! I donít promise to respond to every e-mail, but I
  am still trying to answer all those who sent in a sample or other
  information, or even a complaint. Unfortunately, my life is always very busy,
  and I can only dedicate a small portion of my time to this, so I have trouble
  even keeping up with current correspondence about this page. Worse yet, from
  time to time this page gets posted to another popular blog, and I get a new
  surge of e-mail, so I have doubts of ever being able to answer it all. But
  Iíll keep working at it!<i><span> 12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p>

  <p><b>There are 8 major
  English dialect areas in North America, listed below the map at left. These
  are shown in blue, each with its number, on the <a href="#SmallMapUnitedStates">map</a> and in the <a href="#DialectDescriptionChart">Dialect Description Chart</a> below, and are
  also outlined with blue lines on the map. The first 6 of these begin at the <a href="#SmallMapUnitedStates">eastern seaboard</a> and proceed west,
  reflecting western settlement patterns.<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p><b>The many subdialects are
  shown in red on the map and in the chart, and are outlined with red lines on
  the map. All of these are listed in the margins of the map as well.<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  
  <p><b>In the <a href="#DialectDescriptionChart">Dialect Description Chart</a> additional

  <p><b><span>Recent additions<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
  <p>ï¬†I
  did quite a bit of cosmetic adjustment to place name positioning and other
  things to make the map more readable. <i><span>New!
  5-Oct.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†I
  adjusted the name of the Mat-Su Valley dialect in Alaska from <span>Mat-Su Valley</span><span> </span>to <span>Mat-Su Valley </span><span>(North Central)</span><span>
  </span>to better clarify its status, as an Island of North Central in Alaska.
  <i><span>New! 4-Oct.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†Because
  native French speakers do not typically have the Canadian raising, I have now
  explicitly shown the pink Canadian-raising line as excluding the
  French-speaking area in Canada. (Earlier I had simply not shown it in this
  area, but the result was confusing even to me, so I put it in.) I also
  adjusted a few lines running across Hudson Bay. <i><span>Adj.
  4-Oct.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†I
  adjusted the main map to match the New Orleans inset in its southeast corner
  and added St. Bernard Parish, reflecting the fact that apparently all of St.
  Bernard Parish has the same dialect. <i><span>New!
  13-Sep.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†I
  have now finished reducing the size of the dots for cities and towns, except
  for the larger population centers, to reduce the clutter on the map. I have
  now completed this for all U.S. states and Canadian provinces. <i><span>Adj. 13-Sep.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†Oops!
  At some point I accidentally changed the color of the El Paso dialect from
  white to pink. It is now fixed. <i><span>New! 13-Sep.-2017</span></i></p>
  <p>ï¬†I
  made a number of cosmetic adjustments to the dialect descriptions and lines
  on the right side of the map (in the Atlantic Ocean), none of which affect
  the content of the map. <i><span>New! 13-Sep.-2017</span></i></p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>ï¬†<b><span>Continuing
  survey:</span></b> I only discovered in 2011 that many if not most Americans
  pronounce the ìlî in words like ìcalmî and other words ending in <span>ì-almî</span>, which surprised me very much, since I
  donít. Some also pronounce the ìlî in ìfolkî, and even a few may pronounce
  the ìlî in ìtalkî. See <a href="#PronunciationOfAlm">The Pronunciation of <span>ì-almî</span> and <span>ì-olkî</span>
  and <span>ì-alkî</span></a><b> </b>for more details. I would love to know if you do or do not
  pronounce the ìlî in such words, and where you grew up! Yes, I know many of
  you have sent in data, and I am still trying to get it all compiled. One
  thing that has discouraged me is that so far no very discernible pattern is
  emerging!<i><span> 8-Dec.-2014</span></i></p>

  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>I have made a number of
  adjustments to the map format based on comments and suggestions from people
  who write in. However, the main complaint, that the map is too complicated
  and confusing, I canít really fix: the subject is complicated, and I am well
  aware that I have tried to include too many features. However, if people have
  ideas on how to make the map or web page less confusing, I am all ears! <i><span>8-May-2013</span></i></p>

  <p><b><span>Dialect Survey of Individual Words<br/>

  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>Many of you have written in to ask, ìWhat about
  such-and-such a word? What is its distribution across North America?î And my
  answer has always been, ìThatís not what this map is about, itís about sound
  patterns affecting many words at once, itís about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic" target="_blank">phonemic</a>
  patterns.î Not that Iím not interested, I am, itís just that there is no
  place for this sort of information on my map. (The only such word that does
  appear on the map is the <a href="#Note6_OnLine">ìonî line</a>.)<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>However, finally someone has done just what many of
  you have wanted, they have mapped the distribution of lots of these
  individual words, as well as some grammatical constructions, and you can
  enjoy browsing through them <a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/maps.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
  If you donít want to struggle through the whole list, a selection of some of
  the most interesting with whimsical comments can be found <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6?op=1" target="_blank">here</a>. <i><span>21-Aug.-2013</span></i></p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>The link for this site was
  sent in by Joshua Katz. Thanks! Also, Joshua has <a href="http://spark.rstudio.com/jkatz/surveymaps/" target="_blank">redone the
  maps</a> to make a lot of them more readable, as for example his map of words
  for <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jakatz2/files/spcMap.png" target="_blank">carbonated
  beverage</a>. (Oops, these links seem to be obsolete. He still has <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jakatz2/project-dialect.html" target="_blank">this
  page</a>, but most of the links on it do not work, though the one for the
  poster does, and this does have the carbonated beverage map and a few others.
  The last link in the previous paragraph shows several more, though some of
  the links donít work there either.)<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>Sadly, they still donít have
  some of the ones Iím interested in, like <span>ìgreasy/greazyî,</span>
  which has a north-south distribution similar to ìonî! Does anyone know of a
  map of this?<i><span> 11-Nov.-2015</span></i></p>

    <p>Several people have asked if
    I intend to make posters of this map. I do not! Iím not going to get into
    marketing my hobby!</p>
    <p>However, I wanted a poster
    myself, so I figured out how to print it out in pieces and tape it
    together. You can do the same. It will print out on 9 pieces of standard
    letter size paper (81/2 x 11 inches), and you will then need to trim the
    inner margins with scissors or a paper cutter, and then tape the pieces
    together. I ended up with a nice poster, and you can too.</p>

Rick Aschmann</p><p>I discovered in late 2011 that much or all of the audio data

from this site as I have time, marked as ìANAE info and audioî. <i><span>26-Jan.-2013</span></i></p><p>The following notes refer to numbers on the map, and show
the corresponding section of the ANAE:</p><p><a name="Note2_LongOFronting"></a>2: <b>Long </b><span><b>/≈ç/</b></span><b> </b><span>[o ä]</span><b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel" target="_blank">fronting</a></b>:
See Map 20.2 in <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch20_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 20</a>. 2: The boundary between central-back and
central-front (the yellow dots) was used by the ANAE to define the boundary
between North and Midland, but this line then extends into the West. The deep
dip that it takes southwards in Utah and Nevada would seem to indicate
settlement of these areas by Northerners, probably represented by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Pioneer_era" target="_blank">Mormon settlement</a>. Thus this dip corresponds to a large
degree to the ì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Corridor" target="_blank">Mormon Corridor</a>î. Many of these settlers were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith,_Jr.#Establishing_a_church" target="_blank">originally from the Palmyra, New York, area and from Kirtland,
Ohio</a>. Another northern contribution may have been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada#History" target="_blank">early
northeastern organized crime influence in Las Vegas</a>. Now Iím not saying
that people in these areas sound like northeasterners: they donít, they sound
like westerners, with this one feature being dragged south because of this
origin.<i><span> 20-Jan.-2010</span></i></p><p><a name="Rdropping"></a><a name="Note3_RDropping"></a>3: <b>R-dropping</b>:
See Map 7.1 in <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch07_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 7</a>. R-droppers are also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents" target="_blank">non-rhotic</a> English speakers, though I find this term rather
obscure and academic, and prefer not to use it on a site like this, which is
not for academics. There are two types of r-droppers, which I call Systematic
R-droppers and Simple R-droppers.<i><span> 11-May-2015</span></i></p><p><b>Systematic R-droppers</b> are found in the northeastern
U. S., in much of England, and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India,
much of the Caribbean, and other places. Systematic R-droppers have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_R" target="_blank">linking and intrusive
<span>rís</span></a>. <a href="#JFK">John F. Kennedy</a>
is an excellent example of a Systematic r-dropper. In a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Jr03ADQmk" target="_blank">speech he
gave prior to being elected</a>, he says ìThe hungry children I <span>sawr</span> in West <span>Vaginia</span>.î This quote has one intrusive r, and one
dropped r, both highlighted in red. In another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbfkXu9qEIM" target="_blank">speech during
the Cuban missile crisis</a> he says, starting at 4:55: ì...Soviet foreign <span>minist<span>a</span></span> Gromyko
told me in my office that he was instructed to make it <span>clea<span>h</span></span> once again, as he said his <span>gov<span>a</span>ment</span> had
already done, Soviet assistance to <span>Cuba<span>r</span></span>, and I quote, ...î, which again has one
intrusive r, and three dropped rís, again highlighted in red.<i><span> 11-May-2015</span></i></p><p><b>Simple R-droppers </b>are found in parts of the <a href="#Southern">Lowland South</a>. As a general rule, they do not have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_R" target="_blank">linking and
intrusive <span>rís</span></a>. All of the areas in
the South marked as r-droppers on my map are Simple R-dropper areas, though New
Orleans shows some tendency to retain final rís before a vowel, though not
enough to make it systematic. (It turns out that <a href="#HawaiianEnglish">Hawaiíi
Creole English</a> is also of this type.)<i><span>
11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>Numerous examples of both kinds of r-droppers are given in
the audio samples below. This pattern is receding, so occasionally only much
older speakers retain the r-dropping in a given location. These are surrounded
on the map by a dotted green circle, and in the chart below will be indicated
with the phrase ìOlder r-dropperî.<i><span> 3-Apr.-2010</span></i></p><p><a name="Note4_CanadianAndTidewaterRaising"></a>4: <b>Canadian
and Tidewater <span>raising</span></b>: See Map 15.5
in <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch15_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 15</a>, noting only the info for the <span>/<b>ou</b>/</span> <span>[a ä]</span> vowel (which
he writes <span>/aw/</span>), not the <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span>
<span>[a…™]</span> vowel (which he writes <span>/ay/</span>). The ANAE does not show this information on
any map for the Tidewater South, so I have gleaned the info from various
sources, including stray comments in ANAE. This is also found in one, and
apparently only one, of the <a href="#NewOrleans">New Orleans subdialects</a>,
St. Bernard Parish, which is far away from either Canada or the Tidewater
South! Why this should be the case is a mystery. <i><span>Adj.
16-Sep.-2017</span></i></p><p><a name="Note6_OnLine"></a>6: <b>ìOnî line</b>: See Map 14.2
in <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch14_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 14</a>. This is the only lexical item included in
this analysis, but it seems to correlate with the phonological data, and as the
ANAE points out, largely follows the North-Midland boundary. Why it turns north
at its western end in the Dakotas and does some contortions is unclear. (The
ANAE did not have Mitchell, SD or Ashley, ND, which are the surprises. I had
earlier thought Mitchell was north of the line, but actually it is south of
it.) Miles City, Montana, an outlier of Western North, is also below the line.
In San Francisco the pattern seems to be reversed, with the ìDonî group
possibly representing a later influx of some type.<i><span>

  <p>This site has been completely redone, perhaps in 2013, and
  is vastly improved, since it now provides a lot more information about the
  speakers, including place of birth and sometimes a list of places where they
  have lived, plus a lot of other information!</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>However,
  I still find that many of the samples do not represent well the bedrock
  pronunciation of the area, but instead represent those who have tried to
  sound less ìlocalî. Also, locations are often limited (though I see that more
  have been added recently), and often only urban locations are given.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>Even
  so, in many cases the data is useful, and I have used it in the sound samples
  below, especially when clearer indications are given of ìnativenessî, and now

  finds any of these that I have left out and shouldnít have, please let me

</tbody></div><p>In many places on this web page the pronunciation of a name

forms: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic" target="_blank">phonemic</a>
guide between slashes <span>/¬†/</span>, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling_for_English#Traditional_respelling_systems" target="_blank">Traditional Dictionary Pronunciation System (TDPS)</a> that is
found in many dictionaries, especially American ones<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[12]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>,
and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic" target="_blank">phonetic</a>
guide (providing the phonetic details) between square brackets <span>[

different dialects to use the same pronunciation key and get the right result
for each dialect. For this guide I have mostly followed the <a href="http://www.ahdictionary.com/application/resources/misc/pronkey.pdf" target="_blank">TDPS system</a> used in the <a href="http://ahdictionary.com/" target="_blank">American Heritage Dictionary</a><a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[14]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>,
rather than the one used by <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/pronsymbols.html" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling_for_English#Traditional_respelling_systems" target="_blank">others</a>, since it is more complete and applies to more
dialects.<i><span> 31-Aug.-2015</span></i></p><p>However, I have included the phonetic guide as well, partly
to give a more precise phonetic pronunciation of local variants, and partly
because many have complained that they prefer the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA" target="_blank">IPA</a> or are familiar
only with it. (This guide includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone#Examples_in_English_vs._other_languages" target="_blank">allophonic variation </a>such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant" target="_blank">aspiration</a>
on voiceless consonants, which is conditioned by stress and word position.
However, it would be impractical to represent all the fine detail, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labialisation#Where_found" target="_blank">rounding
that many English consonants have</a>, or the differences between ì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_L" target="_blank">clear l</a>î <span>[l]</span> and ì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_l" target="_blank">dark l</a>î <span>[…´]</span>.)<i><span> 18-July-2013</span></i></p><p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span>1.<span>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

system, described in <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch02_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 2</a>. This system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic" target="_blank">phonemic</a>, like

the vowel letters, yes, but Iím talking about our spoken language: How many
significant vowel sounds are there? Well, if you consult any popular American
English dictionary, and study the Pronunciation Key, there will be a long list
of vowels. In the <a href="http://www.ahdictionary.com/application/resources/misc/pronkey.pdf" target="_blank">Pronunciation Key to the American Heritage Dictionary</a>, 19
different vowel symbols are listed (not counting the ones only used in foreign
words)! However, some of these are special vowels that only occur before the <span>/r/</span> sound, which are ìcoloredî by the <span>/r/</span>,
so these can be separated out as special cases. And one of these vowels, <span>/<span>…ô</span>/</span>,
only occurs in weak syllables (completely <a href="#Stress">unstressed</a> syllables),
never in <a href="#Stress">stressed</a> syllables, so it also can be separated
out as a special case. This leaves us with 15 Ordinary Vowels that can occur in
stressed syllables. Very few North American English speakers have all of these
vowels: Many have 14 (lacking the <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> vowel), and many have only 13 (lacking both <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> and <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span>). Greater
New York City has 16 Ordinary Stressed Vowels, the 15 in the American Heritage
list plus one that is not usually listed in dictionary pronunciation guides,
found in the word ìbadî, which it makes sense to spell <span>/<b>‚</b>/</span>, since in this dialect it is
the same as the r-colored vowel that occurs before <span>/r/</span>
in words like ìbearingî! This vowel also occurs in the Atlantic Midland
dialect. (I had initially spelled this vowel as <span>/<b>ƒÉ…ô</b>/</span>,
but there is no need to use additional symbols when this is not necessary.)<i><span> 31-Aug.-2015</span></i></p><p>These 16 vowels are listed below in the second column, with
sample words shown in the first column. Those with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve" target="_blank">breve</a> Àò over
them, <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>,<b>ƒï</b>,<b>ƒ≠</b>,<b>≈è</b>,<b>≈≠</b>,<b>≈è≈è</b>/</span>,
are those vowels that historically were short vowels in English (and still are
in British English), while those with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron" target="_blank">macron</a> Àâ
over them, <span>/<b>ƒÅ</b>,<b>ƒì</b>,<b>ƒ´</b>,<b>≈ç</b>,<b>≈ç≈ç</b>/</span>,
are those vowels that historically were long vowels in English (and still are
in British English). In American English these vowels are no longer
phonetically long or short, though the ìshortî ones tend to be phonetically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness" target="_blank">lax</a>, and the
ìlongî ones <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness" target="_blank">tense</a>.
As a general rule the short/lax ones do not occur at the end of a word or
syllable, only before a consonant; this rule has no exceptions in British
English, though it does seem to have a few in American English. (The remaining
Ordinary Stressed Vowels <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span>, <span>/<b>‚</b>/</span> (in Greater New York City and Atlantic Midland), <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span>, <span>/<b>oi</b>/</span>, and <span>/<b>ou</b>/</span> fit in
more with the long/tense group in terms of their pronunciation, history, and
distribution.) (See also the section <a href="#HowIUseTheIPA">How I Use the IPA
(and how I donít)</a> for more discussion about this.)<i><span> 10-Nov.-2015</span></i></p><p>The remaining columns show what happens to vowels before
final r, showing the ìR-coloredî vowels used in most of North America, and
showing the Southern System in the final column, representing the system used
in much of the South, which does not have ìR-coloredî vowels.</p><p>(I have included the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA#Vowels" target="_blank">IPA equivalents</a>
of these vowels in brackets <span>[ ]</span> as well. However, keep
in mind that the actual pronunciation of a given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic" target="_blank">phonemic</a> vowel
may vary greatly from region to region. For example, the <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span> vowel is pronounced as <span>[a]</span>, an open front unrounded vowel, in much of the Inland
North, but is pronounced as <span>[…î]</span>, an open-mid back
rounded vowel, in England. A whole gamut of vowel sounds in between these two
occurs somewhere in North America: in much of Canada and in some other
ìcotî=ìcaughtî areas the pronunciation is <span>[…í]</span>,
whereas most others use <span>[…ë]</span> or <span>[a]</span>
or something in between. Many other vowels have similar variants. The most
distinctive Southern pronunciation is shown in a separate column. However, keep
in mind that I have not listed all possible variants for any region.)<i><span> 3-July-2010</span></i></p><p>If anyone finds that any of the symbols in the chart do not
display properly on their web browsers, please let me know. Most of them are
standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_characters" target="_blank">Unicode characters</a>.</p><p>On Android phones and tablets: up until Android version 4.3
in 2013, in the standard Android browser and in Chrome the symbols <span>/<b>»Ø</b>/</span>, one of the R-colored vowels below,
and uppercase <span>/∆è/</span>, used in the <a href="#WriteTheWayWeSpeak">phonemic respelling section</a>, did not display
correctly. And up until version 5 they still hadnít fixed a few of the IPA
characters, like <span>[·µø]</span>, which I use to show the
Southern pronunciation of the vowel in ìbootî, nor had they fixed other font
problems, like for Ancient Greek, leaving me frustrated with my Android phone
for a long time! However, now in version 5 they finally seem to have fixed all
of these issues. However, if you have an older version of Android the solution
is simple: just use the Firefox browser, which displays these characters
properly in spite of Android.<i><span> 31-Aug.-2015</span></i></p><div>

it is by far the most common. In other words, for those who say all three the

more sense to make the default vowel <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span>, because of the way it interacts with a following dropped

nowhere else in the world! They both come out <span>[Ààw…í…ôd]</span>,

since there is not a practical way to display such a combination in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_characters" target="_blank">Unicode</a>,
I have followed the example of <a href="http://dictionary1.classic.reference.com/help/ahd4/pronkey.html" target="_blank">this web site</a> (part of <a href="http://www.reference.com/" target="_blank">reference.com</a>, though they do not now use the AHD

treatments of the system.

Thus, there really is no ìlong <span>/<b>≈´</b>/</span>î

the same, and are more properly represented as a neutral weak diphthong <span>/…ôw/</span>. They may be right for many speakers, and
are probably right for me in many cases, but no other dictionary that I have
found agrees with them. They are probably right for most Southerners, and
possibly for most Britishers.<i><span> 8-Feb.-2013<a name="Consonants"></a><o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p><span><span>[<sup>ENE</sup>]</span></span> Pronunciations marked

the answer is not based on the traditional English alphabet. Most English

spelled this way in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English" target="_blank">Old English</a>. Most English speakers no longer have this

America, and in certain regions, particularly the South, nearly all speakers
do.)<i><span> 8-July-2013</span></i></p><p>The <a href="http://www.ahdictionary.com/application/resources/misc/pronkey.pdf" target="_blank">AHD</a> uses <span>/<i>th</i>/</span>, in

ìthisî (which is different from the voiceless <span>ìthî</span>
sound, as in ìthinî), and for a long time I did the same on this page, but I am
now using <span>/≈ßƒß/</span> for this sound, for several
reasons, one of which is that using a formatting feature like italics limits
the places this writing system can be used, and anyway I would prefer to keep
italics for their usual purpose.<i><span> 31-Aug.-2015</span></i></p><p>Note that the letters <b>c</b>,

show the comparison below:</p><p><span>The Stress Pattern of English,
and How it Messes with the Pronunciation<br/>
</span><i><span>(8-Feb.-2013)</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p>American English (and most other varieties of English) has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#Stress.2C_rhythm_and_intonation" target="_blank">three levels of stress</a> on each syllable of a word, primary
stress, secondary stress, or no stress. Only one syllable in the word can have
primary stress, and this is the syllable that is pronounced with the greatest
intensity or loudness. The other syllables can have either secondary stress or
no stress. An example is the word ì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English#Common_words_in_general_text" target="_blank">counterrevolutionary</a>î, pronounced <span>/<b>koun</b>t…ôr<b>rƒïv</b>…ô<b><u>l≈ç≈ç</u></b>sh…ô<b>n‚r</b>ƒì/</span> <span>[Àåk ∞a ä</span><span><span>…æÃÉ</span>…öÀå…π…õv…ôÀàlu É…ôÀåne…πi]</span>.
This word has 8 syllables, divided with hyphens as <span>/<b>koun</b>-t…ôr-<b>rƒïv</b>-…ô-<b><u>l≈ç≈ç</u></b>-sh…ô-<b>n‚r</b>-ƒì/</span> <span>[Àåk ∞a ä-</span><span><span>…æÃÉ</span>…ö-Àå…π…õv-…ô-Ààlu- É…ô-Àåne…π-i]</span>.
It has one syllable with primary stress, <span>/<b><u>l≈ç≈ç</u></b>/</span> <span>[Ààlu]</span>, marked with bold and underline in the dictionary
spelling and with <span>[Àà]</span> before it in the IPA. It has
three syllables with secondary stress, syllables 1, 3, and 7, marked with bold
in the dictionary spelling and with <span>[Àå]</span> before them
in the IPA, and four with no stress, syllables 2, 4, 6, and 8. As is true with
many words in English, especially long ones, every other syllable is weak
(unstressed).<i><span> 10-Aug.-2013</span></i></p><p>In stressed syllables (whether primary or secondary) all of
the Stressed Vowels in the chart above can occur, but in completely unstressed
syllables (weak syllables) in English a phenomenon called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction#Weakening_of_vowels" target="_blank">vowel weakening or neutralization</a> occurs. As a result, most
of the vowels in these syllables are weakened or neutralized to the vowel <span>/<span>…ô</span>/</span>, and
the rest of the vowels are weakened or neutralized to a very small group,
listed under ìOther Vowels that Can Occur in Weak (Completely Unstressed)
Syllablesî above. This vowel weakening is a characteristic of English in
particular (though it does occur in other languages as well), but it does not
occur at all in some languages, like Spanish, which makes it especially hard
for English speakers to speak good Spanish or vice versa, since they are each
always subconsciously trying to apply their own pattern to the other language.<i><span> 22-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>We can see this weakening process in action in many groups
of words in English. For example, ìmelodyî, ìmelodiousî, and ìmelodicî are
spelled as if they should have the same vowel sounds, but in fact they do not,
being <span>/<b><u>mƒïl</u></b>…ôdƒì/</span>
<span>[Ààm…õl…ôdi]</span>, <span>/m…ô<b><u>l≈ç</u></b>dƒì…ôs/</span> <span>[m…ôÀàlo ädi…ôs]</span>, and <span>/m…ô<b><u>l≈èd</u></b>ƒ≠k/</span> <span>[m…ôÀàl…ëd…™k]</span>. The vowel in the second
syllable has three pronunciations, two stressed and one unstressed (weak), and
the vowel in the first syllable has two. Spanish has equivalents of these three
words, <span><span lang="ES-EC">ìmelodÌa, melodioso, melÛdicoî</span></span>,
but unlike English, the vowels are pronounced exactly as they are spelled in
IPA, with no changes at all in the vowel quality, even though the stress falls
on a different syllable in each word.<i><span>
22-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>So, just to see if youíve got the idea, take the word
ìsupercalifragilisticexpialidociousî, invented for the Walt Disney movie Mary
Poppins. How many syllables does it have? Which syllables are completely
unstressed (weak)? Which syllable has the primary stress? The answers can be
found in the endnote.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[20]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><i><span> 22-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>In the <a href="#Vowels">vowel section</a> above, we saw
that there are a limited number of vowel sounds that can come before <span>/r/</span> at the end of a word, or when the <span>/r/</span>
comes before another consonant, and that these are usually ìcoloredî by the <span>/r/</span>, that is, they are changed so that they donít really
match any of the ordinary vowels. (These vowels are also known as ìr-controlled
vowelsî.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[21]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>)
Some speakers have as few as 5 of these r-colored vowels in stressed syllables,
others have 6 or 7, and this variation is found in both North America and Great
Britain.<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>What about words like ìhireî or ìsourî? Arenít these
additional vowels that can come before <span>/r/</span>? At first
glance it might seem so, but in fact, in most if not all English dialects,
these words actually rhyme with words like ìhigherî and ìpowerî, meaning that
they are actually two-syllable words pronounced <span>/<b><u>hƒ´</u></b>…ôr/</span> <span>[Ààha…™…ö]</span> and <span>/<b><u>sou</u></b>…ôr/</span> <span>[Ààsa ä…ö]</span>, so no new vowel before <span>/r/</span> occurs.</p><p>For r-droppers the <span>/r/</span> itself is
usually dropped, but the vowel still remains unique, in most cases different
from the ordinary vowels.</p><p>Originally these rís were not colored, but were just like
all the other vowels, and at least one dialect retains this old system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English#Phonology" target="_blank">Scottish
English</a>, which does not color these vowels at all, pronouncing them instead
very much the way they are spelled. This system can be seen at the bottom of
the table above.<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>Thus in Scotland ìbirdî has a vowel close to that of ìbeardî
for many Americans, whereas ìbeardî has the same vowel as ìbeetî! (I have shown
all of the <span>/r/</span>s in the Scottish pronunciation in the
preceding chart as <span>[…æ]</span>, an alveolar flap, though
the <span>[…π]</span> used in North America is also common in
Scotland.)<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>The following chart shows how this system works in a
selection of dialects, both in and outside of North America. Those items in <span>dark red </span>have a one-syllable r-colored vowel.
Those items in <span>orange </span>have a two-syllable
r-colored vowel sequence (these do not actually add any new distinct vowels to
the system). Those items in <span>blue</span> are not
r-colored in the indicated dialect, but are r-colored by many Americans. In
each column the number and nature of the one-syllable r-colored vowels is given
at the top of the column. As always on this page, if you know for sure that I
have the pronunciation of one of these words wrong, please let me know.<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>Okay, but what about rís in the middle of words, with a
vowel on both sides? Are the vowels before the <span>/r/</span>
still limited to these few r-colored vowels in the dialects that color their <span>rís</span>? Well, no, certainly not, we can have words
like ìrerunî, ìpayrollî, and ìprorateî. In other words, vowels that commonly
occur at the end of a word, especially the historically long vowels, can freely
occur before <span>an</span> <span>/r/</span>
in the middle of a word, when there is a clear syllable break before the r.<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p><p>But what about the historically short vowels like <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>,<b>ƒï</b>,<b>ƒ≠</b>,<b>≈è</b>,<b>≈≠</b>/</span>?
Surprisingly, these do occur in many dialects, especially in Britain but also
in parts of eastern North America, but most Americans replace them with the
r-colored vowels. Thus, the word ìmarryî is pronounced <span>/<b><u>mƒÉr</u></b>ƒì/</span> <span>[ÀàmÊ…πi]</span> by Britishers and by many speakers in the
Eastern U.S., From Maine to the South (and apparently also in Montreal), and
most of these speakers would pronounce the words ìmarryî, ìmerryî, and ìMaryî with
three different vowels, but most Americans pronounce all three of these exactly
the same, as <span>/<b><u>m‚r</u></b>ƒì/</span>
<span>[Ààme…πi]</span>. This feature of allowing <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>,<b>ƒï</b>,<b>ƒ≠</b>,<b>≈è</b>,<b>≈≠</b>/</span>
to occur before <span>/r/</span> in the middle of a word (but not
at the end) is one of the features that makes speakers from the east coast
sound different from other Americans, even in the case of radio and television
personalities who have otherwise modified their speech to General American. So
how many vowels can come before an r followed by another vowel? It varies hugely
from one dialect to the next!<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p><p>The following chart shows a lot of these variations, though
there are certainly others. Those items in black are not r-colored in any
dialect. Those items in <span>dark red </span>have a
one-syllable r-colored vowel. Those items in <span>orange
</span>have a two-syllable r-colored vowel sequence (these do not actually add
any new distinct vowels to the system). Those items in <span>blue</span>
are not r-colored in the indicated dialect, but are r-colored by many
Americans. In each column the number and nature of the one-syllable r-colored
vowels is given at the top of the column. This does not count ìtiringî, in
which the r-coloring is two syllables, not one. As always on this page, if you
know for sure that I have the pronunciation of one of these words wrong, please
let me know. <i><span>21-Aug.-2013</span></i></p><p>As you can see, the first three columns have an almost
identical system, differing only in a few minor details. The same is true of
the last two columns. Southern and Scottish stand entirely on their own, and in
fact have more similarities with each other than they have with any of the
others.<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p><p>For some Southerners ìfourî may rhyme with ìrawerî, in which
case ìfourî would be <span>/<b>fÙ</b>…ôr/</span> <span>[Ààf…í ä…ö]</span>, and they would not actually have
the <span>/<b>»Ør</b>/</span>¬†<span>[o…π]</span>
vowel (however, I need to test this further, since initial testing with some
Alabamians did not show this to be true). </p><p>In the phonemic texts below, the dialect provided is my own,
without any of the blue vowels in the table in <span><a href="#RBetweenVowels">Rís Between Vowels: To Color or Not to Color</a></span>.
In the phonemic texts below, any vowels that would be one of these blue vowels
for one of the first two columns above (British or GNYC) is marked in <span>dark red</span>.<i><span>

  <p>*For those speakers who have this vowel <span>{o}</span> but not <span>{aa}</span>,
  in other words for those who rhyme ìfatherî with ìbotherî (most North
  Americans), at the end of a word this vowel must be spelled as <span>{aa}</span> instead of <span>{o}</span>. It should also be spelled <span>{aa}</span> before <span>{h}</span>.
  Thus ìahaî would be spelled <span>{aahaa}</span>
  rather than <span>{oho}</span>, ìahî would be
  spelled <span>{aa}</span> rather than <span>{o}</span>, and ìlaî would be spelled <span>{laa}</span> rather than <span>{lo}</span>. To be consistent we really should
  spell them all as <span>{aa}</span> rather than <span>{o}</span>, but that would make for far too many
  cases of <span>{aa}</span>, and this would really
  end up looking different from our traditional spelling. Since <span>{o}</span> is far more common than <span>{aa}</span> in those dialects that have them both,
  doing it this way will reduce difficulties for all concerned.<i><span> 21-Aug.-2013</span></i><span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

</tbody></div><p><span>You may notice in
the above phonemic writing samples that I write several very common words in more
than one way. I do this because I pronounce them more than one way, according
to some fairly clear rules, and so do most English speakers. All of these are
what linguists call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word" target="_blank">function words</a> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word" target="_blank">content words</a>.</span><i><span> 14-Jan.-2013</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>The simplest group
of these is shown in the chart below. The unstressed form always has the weak
vowel</span> <span>/<span>…ô</span>/</span><span>, whereas the stressed form can have various
vowels. This is not an exhaustive list, though such words are quite a small
group.</span><i><span> 19-June-2013<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p><span>A second group of
these words has a special pattern when unstressed (weak), depending on whether
the following word starts with a vowel or a consonant. In one case the
traditional spelling represents this pattern, that of ìaî before a consonant,
and <span>ìanî</span> before a vowel. But at least two
other words have a similar pattern, but because the standard spelling does not
represent it, we are usually unaware of it. These are listed in the following
chart. Examples of most are found in the sample above, or in the footnotes. The
following list is probably complete.</span><i><span>
22-Mar.-2013</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p>When I show the pronunciation of a place, I try to always
show how someone from that place would actually pronounce it. However,
occasionally even the natives canít agree. For instance, many <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071029135507AABaHWW" target="_blank">Chicagoans</a> say <span>/shƒ≠<b><u>kÙ</u>g≈ç</b>/</span> <span>[ É…™Ààk ∞…íÀå…°o]</span> or even <span>/shƒ≠<b><u>kÙ</u></b>g…ô/</span>
<span>[ É…™Ààk ∞…í…°…ô]</span>, but there
are also many who say <span>/shƒ≠<b><u>k≈è</u>g≈ç</b>/</span> <span>[ É…™Ààk ∞aÀå…°o]</span>,
and the latter group may be growing. (I had originally had the impression that
the former group was larger, but contributor and native Chicagoan Richard R.
says that they are about evenly matched. He says, ëI suspect that this is a
North Side versus South Side and/or West Side thing, as my Cubs fan friends
tend to say ìahî, but my Sox fan friends (and Richard Daley) say ìawî. FWIW, I
grew up in the western suburbs saying ìahî.í) Keep in mind that all of these
speakers definitely have <span>ìcotî‚â†ìcaughtî</span>.
I have always called it <span>/shƒ≠<b><u>k≈è</u>g≈ç</b>/</span> <span>[ É…™Ààk ∞…ëÀå…°o ä]</span>,
with a couple of slight vowel differences, since I donít have an Inland North
accent!<i><span> 18-July-2013</span></i></p><p>I have noticed that many people who use the IPA to show the
pronunciation of place names on <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></span> do several
things that I have chosen not to do.</p><p>For one thing, they often write both <span>[…ô]</span>
and <span>[</span><span><span>…®</span>]</span> in showing the pronunciation of the weak
vowel <span>/…ô/</span> in American English. Now this is not
incorrect, since for me the word ìsofaî <span>/<b><u>s≈ç</u></b>f…ô/</span> would
usually be phonetically <span>[Ààso äf…ô]</span>, whereas
the word ìbrokenî <span>/<b><u>br≈ç</u></b>k…ôn/</span>
would be phonetically <span>[Ààb…πo äk</span><span><span>…®</span>n]</span>.
However, it should be understood that this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic" target="_blank">phonetic</a>
difference, not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic" target="_blank">phonemic</a> one, so that the difference is incidental rather
than significant. And in actual practice I find I have a lot of variation: for
instance, ìsofa bedî <span>/<b><u>s≈ç</u></b>f…ô
bƒïd/</span> would usually come out <span>[Ààso äf</span><span><span>…®</span>Àåb…õd]</span>,
and ìsofasî <span>/<b><u>s≈ç</u></b>f…ôz/</span>
could come out <span>[Ààso äf…ôz]</span> or <span>[Ààso äf</span><span><span>…®</span>z]</span> depending on how deliberately I am
speaking, or its position in the sentence. And I find that others have the same
problem: in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" target="_blank">Appalachian Mountains</a> article the pronunciation is given as
<span>ì/ÀåÊp…ôÀàle</span><span><span>…™ É…®</span>n/</span>
or <span>/ÀåÊp…ôÀàlÊt</span><span><span> É…®</span>n/î</span>; for
me the vowels shown as <span>[…ô]</span> and <span>[</span><span><span>…®</span>]</span>
in these pronunciations are exactly the same for me, probably both <span>[</span><span><span>…®</span>]</span>.
So for strictly practical purposes I am writing both <span>[…ô]</span>
and <span>[</span><span><span>…®</span>]</span> as <span>[…ô]</span>.<i><span> 18-July-2013</span></i></p><p>Another thing I find people doing is using British phonetic
transcription to show the pronunciation of American place names. For instance,
in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Indiana" target="_blank">Lafayette,
Indiana</a> article the pronunciation is given as <span>ì/Àål</span><span><span>…ë</span></span><span><span>Àê</span>fi</span><span><span>Àê</span>Àà</span><span><span>…õ</span>t/î</span>.
Now, in British English there truly are phonetically long and short vowels:
ìbeatî is phonetically <span>[Ààbi</span><span><span>Àêt</span>]</span>, where the vowel <span>[</span><span><span>i</span></span><span><span>Àê</span>]</span> is
phonetically long, whereas ìbitî is phonetically <span>[Ààb…™t]</span>,
where the vowel <span>[…™]</span> is phonetically short. However,
in nearly all North American English dialects, this is not the case: both
ìbeatî <span>[Ààbi</span><span><span>t</span>]</span> and ìbitî <span>[Ààb…™t]</span> have
vowels which are phonetically the same length, in spite of the fact that the
first has what is traditionally called a ìlong eî, while the second has what is
traditionally called a ìshort <span>iî.</span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English#Phonology" target="_blank">Scottish
English</a> is like American English in this respect. And it turns out that the
<span>ì/Àål</span><span><span>…ë</span></span><span><span>Àê</span>fi</span><span><span>Àê</span>Àà</span><span><span>…õ</span>t/î</span> pronunciation given in the Wikipedia
article is wrong for both British and American English: in British it would
usually be <span>[Àål</span><span><span>…ë</span></span><span><span>Àê</span>f</span><span><span>…™</span>Àà</span><span><span>…õ</span>t]</span>
or <span>[Àål</span><span><span>…ë</span></span><span><span>Àê</span>f</span><span><span>i</span>Àà</span><span><span>…õ</span>t]</span>, the <span>[</span><span><span>…™</span>]</span>
or <span>[</span><span><span>i</span>]</span> being short because it is unstressed (weak),
whereas in American English (at least in <a href="http://www.forvo.com/word/west_lafayette/" target="_blank">West
Lafayette, Indiana</a>) it would be <span>[Àål</span><span><span>…ë</span>fiÀà</span><span><span>…õ</span>t]</span>,
phonemically <span>/<b>l≈èf</b>ƒì<b><u>ƒït</u></b>/</span>.<i><span> 18-July-2013</span></i></p><p>Words in pink in the chart in the <a href="#Vowels"><span>How Many Vowels are there in American
English?</span></a> <span>section above are</span>
from John Wellsís <a href="http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Standard
Lexical Sets</a>. Note that he has a sample word for each of the 15 Ordinary
Stressed Vowels and the 7 ìR-coloredî Stressed Vowels in the American Heritage
Dictionaryís list, but not for the more localized <span>/<b>‚</b>/</span> vowel found in ìbadî in GNYC
and Atlantic Midland. I have included all of the words in John Wellsís list
except for the following two words, which we could call Skew Words, since they
have different vowels in different regions:<i><span>
18-July-2013</span></i></p><p>This skewing of the <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span> and <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> vowels between the British and
American systems is typically seen only before the consonant phonemes <span>/f/</span>, <span>/th/</span>, and <span>/g/</span> (<span>[f]</span>, <span>[Œ∏]</span>,
and <span>[…°]</span>), as can be seen in the chart of Other
Examples in <a href="#CotCaughtMerger"><b>The Cot-Caught Merger</b></a> article,
comparing the blue items with those in the preceding column.<i><span> 10-Aug.-2013</span></i></p><p>However, it seems to me that John Wellsís list above was not
well selected to show contrasts in a similar environment. Instead, I would draw
your attention to all of the words in blue below, all of which end in <span>/t/</span>, and most of which begin with <span>/b/</span>,
and also to the words in <span>dark red</span>, which
similarly show contrasts in other environments. Thus, my lexical sets would be
the following:<i><span> 1-Oct.-2010</span></i></p><p>She did this after interviewing me on her program in March
of 2011, where I explained the need for more samples of this kind. To listen to
the interview, go to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/03/spark-142-march-27-30-2011" target="_blank">www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/03/spark-142-march-27-30-2011</a>, then scroll
down till you see ìYouTube Dialects Mapî, or search for ìYouTube Dialects Mapî
or ìRick Aschmannî. The interview can be heard by clicking the link below the
paragraph.</p><p>If you grew up in one particular place in Canada or the
U.S., then I would very much like a sample from you. In particular, if you
lived in one town for most of your childhood, in particular between the ages of
5 and 15, and speak like people from that place, then you should be a great
sample. (That is, unless you tried to consciously change your accent after
that: I know a gal who moved from the South to the Midland before her senior
year of high school, and she was subjected to so much ridicule that she
completely changed her way of speaking.) And obviously, if you moved around a
lot throughout your childhood, then you wonít really work for my map.</p><p>You can do just a simple recording, like Nora did, as short
or as long as you like, just telling a bit about yourself and where you grew
up. Or, if you want to be quite thorough about it, or just donít know what to
say, I have prepared a version of <a href="https://veera.app/index_collection/Goldilocks%20and%20the%20Three%20Bears%20plus.doc" target="_blank">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a> (slightly expanded to
include certain key words) that you can read. This way if I need to check a
particular word to nail down the dialect of your hometown I will be able to. <span>Either way, please be sure to say where you grew up,
and if only for part of your childhood, from what age to what age.</span></p><p>All of your clips sent in like this will be labeled
ì(Self-recording for this site. Thanks!)î <span>in</span>
the table below, so that will make them easy to find.<i><span> 30-Mar.-2011</span></i></p><p>Note to Canadians: Nora points out that Canadians are
currently underrepresented on the map. So, this is your chance to change that!
Send in your samples!</p><p>Here you can hear audio
samples of different local dialects. These are all found on the Internet:<span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p>As far as possible these have been restricted to people who
were raised in the location, and in many cases have lived there nearly all
their lives, and have presumably retained the local dialect, except where
indicated. (For most of these people, their birthplace and life history can be
found on <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org</a></span>, or at the links provided.) Items
in <span>pink</span> are doubtful as to whether they
represent accurately the dialect indicated, or, in the case of the <span><a href="#Rejected">rejected samples</a> at
the bottom of the chart, definitely do not represent their local dialect</span>.<i><span> 1-July-2010</span></i></p><p><b>DISCLAIMER: I do not necessarily agree with all of the
people speaking here: I have simply selected them as good examples of their
dialect!</b> Nor does the fact that many of them are politicians indicate that
I particularly like politicians: The fact is that politicians tend to retain
their local dialect more than other public professions (actors, artists), to
maintain their identity with the locals. Also, they talk in public a lot, so
the data is readily available. Country singers and southern gospel singers also
tend to be reliable,<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[31]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
and I like them better than politicians. Somewhat surprisingly to me, NASCAR
racers seem to be very reliable, also: even though they travel a lot for the
races, they tend to raise their families in their old home town, from
generation to generation, and donít care in the least how they talk!<i><span> 4-Aug.-2010</span></i></p><p>You may also notice that I prefer older people to younger
people. This is simply because there has been a lot more dialect mixing among
the younger generation than in previous generations.</p><p>As mentioned <a href="#Sounds">above</a>, the pronunciation
of some of the names is given after the name. If anyone thinks I have the
pronunciation of a place wrong, please <a href="mailto:Map@Aschmann.net">let me

  This speaker does not drop rís, suggesting that the younger generation no
  longer speaks Classical Southern. However, I visited Brewton in February of
  2012, and spent quite a bit of time with an older gentleman who was born and
  raised there, and who does speak Classical Southern, and talked briefly with
  others who also do, making it clear that this is part of the Classical
  Southern area with older r-droppers.<i><span>

  higher class than football coaches and players? It doesnít make sense.
  However, it is clear that there are significant numbers of both Inland and
  Lowland white speakers in this small town, with all of the blacks speaking
  Lowland. Perhaps one part of the puzzle is that the town was settled well
  after the Civil War as a coal-mining community (see <a href="#SouthernSettledLater">Southern Areas Settled after the Civil War</a>),
  but this factor doesnít help much either, since all of the other examples of
  this speak only Lowland! It will have to remain a mystery for now.<i><span> 4-Nov.-2015</span></i></p>

  Crippen</a> describes this dialect as Mat-Su Valley English, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat-Su_Valley" target="_blank">Matanuska-Susitna
  Valley</a> where it is spoken. James Crippen has now kindly provided me with
  information that allows me to set its borders fairly accurately. He says that
  it probably extends no further west than Willow, no farther northeast than
  Sutton, and is probably dying out in much of the area anyway, because of a
  continued influx of people from other parts of Alaska.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>So
  why do they talk like this? Because this area was almost entirely settled
  during the Great Depression by people from Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan
  as part of a federal project. Historical info can be found in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer,_Alaska" target="_blank">Wikipedia
  article</a>, and on <a href="http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-matanuska.htm" target="_blank">this page</a> sent in by contributor Susan Alexander. Thanks!<i><span> 23-Apr.-2011</span></i></p>

  the Inland Southern is particularly noticeable in the introduction. <i><span>New! 29-Sep.-2017</span></i></p>

  video</a>, I have finally decided that for Loretta, <span>ìcotî‚â†ìcaughtî</span>. The problem is that she is inconsistent: In
  both an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9eHp7JJgq8" target="_blank">early</a>
  and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb6eMEVJ_jo" target="_blank">recent<span> </span></a>version
  of ìCoal Minerís Daughterî, she always says <span>/<b><u>d≈èt</u></b>…ôr/</span> <span>[Ààd…ë</span><span><span>…æ</span>…ö]</span>, using exactly the same vowel sound
  as in ìlotî later on in the song, never <span>/<b><u>dÙt</u></b>…ôr/</span> <span>[Ààd…í ä</span><span><span>…æ</span>…ö]</span>, <span>the</span>
  typical Southern pronunciation. This was what made me think that she had
  ìcotî=ìcaughtî, along with the fact that she grew up very close to the
  ìcotî=ìcaughtî area. However, even in this song she uses <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> <span>[…í ä]</span>
  in the word ìallî, but <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span> <span>[…ë]</span> in the word ìhollerî, both before <span>/l/</span>, so she clearly has the phoneme contrast. Similarly,
  in this early version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_wwP8UZR1o" target="_blank">ìYou <span>Ainít</span> Woman Enough
  (To Take My Man)î</a>, the word ìoughtî is clearly <span>/<b><u>≈èt</u></b>/</span> <span>[Àà…ët]</span>, not <span>/<b><u>Ùt</u></b>/</span> <span>[Àà…í ät]</span>,
  but in the same song there are clear cases of <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> <span>[…í ä]</span>
  in <span>ìícauseî</span> and ìcaughtî. <i><span>26-July-2012</span></i><span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

  Janet said, ìMy mother just told me that Ann Patout was born Ann Bolner, and
  her family was from the Alexandria, Louisiana, area, so her speech would not
  be typical of Jeanerette or New Iberia. Alexandria is not a Cajun area and
  was settled by Scots Irish and other English-speaking descendants from
  Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, etc.î Based on this, and the fact that
  she is quite distinct from the Jeanerette clip below, I am listing her for
  Alexandria, even though Iím not sure where she was born or lived her early
  years. She is clearly an older speaker who speaks Classical, as is the clip
  from Marksville below, which moves the Classical line north. Young people in
  Alexandria, including my son-in-law, do not drop rís.<i><span> New! 2-May-2018</span></i></p>

  According to Marc Sketchler, this is a good sample from this area. However, I
  notice that he is a bit inconsistent: he doesnít always drop his rís or have
  the Southern pronunciation of the long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> <span>[a(…™)]</span>

  There are three speakers on this clip, Janet, her father, and the guy who
  says ìholy crapî near the end. The only one of interest is Janetís father,
  who is first heard at 0:10, though his best clip is toward the end. He is

  <p><b><span>I have arranged this and the following New Orleans speakers
  in a graduated sequence ranging from almost pure Greater New York City to
  pure Lowland Southern. No two of them are at exactly the same point in the
  sequence! Originally I had listed the ones I am now calling ìPeripheral New
  Orleansî as ìClassical Southernî, but I realized that they had some
  distinctive New Orleans features, and needed to have their own category. The
  dialect names are simply my tentative divisions of New Orleans based on these
  samples:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  <p><b>New Orleans Downtown</b> dialect: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFDNTo4DNg" target="_blank">YouTube
  video</a> (Her clip is at the beginning of this video.) Not Southern at all,
  as shown by her pronunciation of ìninthî and ìBywaterî, and sounds very much
  like Greater New York City, though impossible to tell in this short clip
  whether ìhadî rhymes with ìbadî (though the <span>Mehrvigne</span>
  sample below suggests that it does), whether ìfatherî rhymes with ìbotherî
  (though the other New Orleans samples make it almost certain that this is not
  true), or whether ìpinî=ìpenî (though the other Central New Orleans samples
  make it almost certain that that this is not true, as shown on the map).
  However, clearly ìonî rhymes with ìDawnî, which is not like GNYC.<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p>

  video</a> She also sounds very much like Greater New York City, hardly
  Southern at all, but is Lowland Southern as far as her long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> <span>[a(…™)]</span> is concerned. Clearly <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî</span>! However, in fact there are quite a few other
  differences from New York City, which match many other Southern dialects.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>For
  example, unlike New York City, but like many other Southerners, she clearly
  has the <span><a href="#HorseHoarseCardCord">card-cord
  merger</a>, thus </span>the contrast between <span>/<b>‰(r)</b>/</span>
  and <span>/<b>Ù(r)</b>/</span> has disappeared, both
  being pronounced <span>[…î…ô]</span>! However, because she
  is also a strong <a href="#Note3_RDropping">r-dropper</a>, this leads to some
  unusual losses of contrast: for her ìcartî=ìcaughtî and ìparkî rhymes with
  ìhawkî and ìwalkî. <span>Mehrvigne</span> confirmed
  all this for me (see the texting below the clip), and gave the sample
  sentence, <span>ìAh cawt the cawt as it was rollin
  dowína pawk sidewawk.î</span> (ìI caught the cart as it was rolling down the
  park sidewalk.î) However, she just as clearly does not have the <span><a href="#HorseHoarseCardCord">horse-hoarse merger</a>,
  which we would expect from someone with the card-cord merger: in the first
  clip at 5:36 she says ìstoryî as </span><span>[Ààsto…ô…πi]</span>
  <span>(<span>/<b><u>st»Ør</u></b>ƒì/</span>),
  but at 5:42 she says ìfor íimî as </span><span>[Ààf…î…ô…π…™m]</span>
  <span>(<span>/<b><u>fÙr</u></b>ƒ≠m/</span>),
  and </span>in the second clip at 2:45 she clearly says, ìLetís start <span>[Ààst…î…ôt]</span> again, letís be more <span>[Ààmo…ô]</span> careful.î <span>This
  also matches all of the other New Orleans samples</span>.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>She
  also texted me: ìBad, had, lad, mad: They all have the same a vowel sound,î
  which shows that in this also New Orleans is not like GNYC!</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>One
  way in which the <b>St. Bernard Parish </b>dialect is unlike all of the other
  New Orleans dialects is that it has the Tidewater raising, as pointed out by
  contributor Todd Meredith! This is unexpected, since the only other place
  this is found in the United States is on the eastern seaboard. It is also
  unexpected that it would only apply to the <b>St. Bernard Parish </b>dialect
  and not to any other New Orleans dialect. Ah, well, this project never ceases
  to surprise!</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>As stated
  in the <a href="#Note3_RDropping">r-dropping</a> discussion, the r-dropping
  areas in the South are all mainly simple r-droppers, not systematic
  r-droppers. However, she shows some tendency to retain final rís before a
  vowel, though not enough to make her systematic.<i><span>

  I had posted this <span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtiPVdczhi8" target="_blank">YouTube
  video</a></span> as a sample for Walter Brennan. However, contributor Shirley
  Tessler wrote: ìI looked at the YouTube video of Walter Brennan that you
  provide as an example of a Lynn Massachusetts dialect. Lynn is my home town.
  Although Mr. Brennan was born in Lynn, he is speaking as an actor in that
  YouTube video in a dialect of an unschooled farmer from Texas (or similar
  location very far from Lynn Mass).¬†I suggest that you no longer point to
  the Walter Brennan video, since it is not a true example of a Lynn dialect.î</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>My
  initial reaction on her comments was, ìNo way! He sounds very Eastern New
  England to me!î Thatís because the vowels he uses in words like ìfarmî <span>[a]</span> and ìonî <span>[…í…ô]</span> are so
  ENE as to be unmistakable. No place else in the world are those vowels
  pronounced precisely that way! Anyone from outside of ENE who knows accents
  would immediately know he is ENE.<i><span> 17-Aug.-2015</span></i></p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>In
  fact, after I started this map, I thought, ìNow who was that old actor whose
  accent I remember so vividly from when I was a kid? He was clearly ENE. Letís
  see... He played in ëThe Tycooní, I remember.î And thatís how I found him.
  However, I didnít initially find a clip from ëThe Tycooní, but posted the
  second clip instead.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>However,
  in listening again to that clip, I realized that Shirley was partly right: in
  that clip he is <i>trying </i>to do some
  kind of western farmer accent, but he is doing a very bad job of it: his ENE
  features keep bleeding through. Even so, certain words, like ìaboutî, do not
  have ENE vowels at all.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>I
  eventually found the first clip, which <i>is</i>
  from ëThe Tycooní, and shows a more accurate accent. But check out the clip
  of Rick Starbard above, for an even better sample for Lynn.<i><span> 25-Mar.-2011</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.atlas.mouton-content.com/secure/generalmodules/anae/samples/south/dmahan/start.html" target="_blank">ANAE info and audio</a> This is the sample provided in the <a href="#ANAE">ANAE</a> to show that Springfield, Missouri is Lowland Southern,
  which seems quite unlikely for its location. This sample is clearly not
  Inland Southern, since multiple cases of the long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> <span>[a…™]</span>
  vowel occur before voiceless consonants, and only one word, ìtimesî shows the
  Lowland Southern pronunciation, and this has the long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> <span>[a]</span>
  vowel before a nasal consonant, which is the one place it is often heard in
  otherwise Midland accents according to the <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch18_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE Ch. 18, p. 243</a>. Therefore I do not think that this
  sample demonstrates Southern at all.<i><span>

  This pushes the Inland South boundary north. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton,_Missouri" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
  says that Stockton is known as ìWhere the South Beginsî, and the dialect
  confirms this. (Of the four deputies, the last two are clearly Inland, the
  second is clearly Southern, though he doesnít happen to use any diagnostic
  words for Inland, and the first is a bit ambivalent, though clearly Southern
  on some words.)<i><span> 25-Sep.-2015</span></i></p>

  that was before I made the dots smaller. I had observed that she had
  ìpinî=ìpenî, so I assumed this applied to Scottsbluff also. However, I
  recently met a gentleman from Scottsbluff, and he assured me that he had <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî</span>. I listened to him say
  them, and though they are very close, they are indeed different. So evidently
  the line runs between Scottsbluff and Gering. Thus Scottsbluff is like
  Torrington, Wyoming, and unlike Alliance, which makes the pin-pen line twist
  a bit more around Scottsbluff and Alliance, but a little less around
  Torrington, so it comes out about even. <i><span>Adj.

  Nebraska except for four years in St. Paul, from the ages of 5 to 8. However,
  he talks like St. Paul, not like Hastings, as I have confirmed by
  interviewing two natives of Hastings, who definitely have ìpinî=ìpenî and
  ìcotî=ìcaughtî. Like the sample from Ashley, ND, this shows that a phonemic
  system can be set before the age of 10, and never change after that.<i><span> 17-Jan.-2012</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZXNTvyBb8w" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> I finally found a video for Valentine,
  which allows me to assign it clearly to the West Midland dialect! I wasnít
  sure about that, since it lies very close to the boundaries of The West and
  Western North, and I wasnít sure which of the three it belonged to. However,
  the fact that it lies on the north edge of the Nebraska Sandhills seems to be
  the determining factor! Clearly ìcotî=ìcaughtî, <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî, and itís </span>below the bite-bout line. (Not all of

  Thanks! Ben said, ìAs Iím sure many people do for their hometowns, I thought
  Iíd submit this clip, as I think it gives a better representation of the
  Seacoast, NH accent, as opposed to the samples you currently have which
  includes Boston to the South, and Manchester and Laconia inland. The clip
  features a number of local citizens, but personally, I thought the best

  Contributor Jane McMullen set me straight on this one: ìYour sample [for] Lou
  Costello is terribly wrong. It is not a New York accent. Lou was born and
  raised in Paterson, NJ. He sounds just like my father (born 7 years later),
  also born &amp; raised there, and all my relatives. The class is correct,
  classic working class, children of recent Italian immigrants. And itís
  classic Paterson.î</span></p>
  <p><span><span>††††††††††††††† </span>Sigh! I find that I sometimes
  focus on certain prominent features, and those features make me ignore other
  features, which are more important. I had listed Lou Costello as being from
  New York City, even though I knew he was born in Paterson. I failed to
  realize that he was also </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0182579/" target="_blank"><span>raised there</span><span></span></a><span>.
  But what really led me astray was that he has nearly all of the secondary
  features of the classic working class of Greater New York City: <span>/≈ßƒß/</span> </span><span><span>[]</span> becomes <span>/d/</span> </span><span><span>[d]</span>, and ìfirstî is
  <span>/<b><u>foyst</u></b>/</span>
  </span><span><span>[Ààf</span></span><span><span><span>…ú…™</span>st]</span> instead of <span>/<b><u>f˚rst</u></b>/</span> </span><span><span>[Ààf</span></span><span><span><span>…ù</span>st]</span>. I had not realized that the latter was
  historically found in a few places outside of the Greater New York City
  dialect area, so I assumed that he had grown up in New York City. However, he
  actually lacks the primary defining features of GNYC: he drops very few rís,
  and he does not have the bad-had split, as seen in many of the words in the
  clip above, and in the pronunciation of ìbadî at the end of this clip: </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1EH96nCoTc" target="_blank"><span>YouTube video</span><span></span></a><span>.
  Instead, he actually has the Eastern North pattern for these words. Thanks
  for keeping me straight, Jane!<i><span> 27-Oct.-2011</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

  This cannot be simply a variant of what I am calling ìEast Midlandî, but I

  GNYC there is no working-class tendency to change <span>thís</span> to d or t, and several of the vowels have a slight hint of

  <p>The east end of Long Island, often called ìThe Hamptonsî,
  is unusual in that it has been a rich peopleís playground for generations.
  Thatís why I was glad to find the previous clip, which shows the dialect of
  ordinary people, rather than the rich and famous.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>All
  three of the following samples of rich and famous people from East Hampton
  have quite distinct accents, although they also have certain things in
  common, in particular their pronunciation of the ìawî or <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> vowel (see <a href="#CotCaughtMerger"><span>The
  Cot-Caught Merger</span></a>), which is <span>[o…ô]</span> like
  Greater New York City.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iklkeV8UHk" target="_blank">YouTube
  video</a> (<a href="http://www.easthamptonstar.com/dnn/Obituaries/tabid/4486/Default.aspx" target="_blank">more info</a>) This ladyís ancestors have lived in the East
  Hampton area since the mid 1600ís, and she grew up there, unlike so many rich
  kids from the area who were sent off to boarding school. Her accent is fairly
  close to the ìbenchmarkî Bonacker pronunciation above.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>One
  particular difference among the three speakers is that Mary Gardiner
  pronounces almost all her <span>rís</span>, David
  Carmichael drops a few, and Jackie Kennedy is a consistent <a href="#Rdropping">Systematic R-dropper</a>. They all do it a little,
  confirming that the original Hamptons pattern is r-dropping.</p>
  <p><span>††††††††††††††† </span>I had
  thought for a while that ìonî rhymed with ìDawnî in this dialect, based on
  Mary Gardiner, but it doesnít actually. She (and Stewart Vorpahl) almost
  seems to rhyme it with ìbarnî, if the r is dropped, something a few GNYC
  speakers may also do.<i><span> 3-Mar.-2011</span></i></p>

  the other two speakers featured on this video, both of whom speak Inland

  African Americans in the South, speaks Lowland Southern, in fact speaks <a href="#Classical_Southern">Classical Southern</a> (including a few cases of <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>

  English (AAVE)</a>. Now Iím curious about how the white people in the town
  speak! The town is clearly in the mountains, so based on <a href="#TheoryOfSettlement">my settlement theory</a> it should speak Inland.
  However, the town also is 12.5% Black according to Wikipedia, suggesting that
  she speaks Classical only because she belongs to the African American
  community, and that this tells us nothing about the white dialect. Granted,
  she herself said that she played more with white kids than black kids when
  small, but it is also clear from one of the pictures in the video that she
  attended a segregated school. So we can say nothing with confidence about the
  white dialect here.<i><span> 23-Sep.-2015</span></i></p>

  speakers have very strong Inland Southern accents. The only identification of
  location is Graham County at 1:20 (though with a pronunciation I found
  unexpected), and that it is near Waynesville at 0:44, but this is enough to
  pin it down as being Graham County, North Carolina.<i><span> 29-Aug.-2015</span></i></p>

  speakers who make the distinction pronounce it <span>/…ô<b><u>gƒïn</u></b>/</span> <span>[…ôÀà…°…õ</span><span><span>n</span>]</span>, which simply
  means that Columbus is very close to the line. This forced me to revise the
  dialect lines around Columbus to reflect this. The two following samples,
  which have ìpinî=ìpenî and which I had thought were representative of
  Columbus, I now realize are not. <i><span>17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p>

  certainly there is a slight accent from certain older <span>generations</span> who have grown up in rural Oregon, but he sounded
  like an ìout-of-townerî to me, and I would agree with you in ascribing it to

  Thanks!) Okay, this is not a good sample for at least two big reasons:
  1)¬†Itís a spoof, exaggerating and poking fun at the Northeast
  Pennsylvania accent, so of course it is not natural, and 2)¬†The main
  actor playing the teacher who is modeling the dialect isnít even from the
  area! He was born and raised in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0466277/bio" target="_blank">Great Falls,
  Montana</a>! He clearly gets parts of the dialect right, like <span>/th/</span> <span>[Œ∏]</span> ‚Üí <span>/t/</span> <span>[t]</span> and <span>/≈ßƒß/</span>
  <span>[]</span> ‚Üí <span>/d/</span> <span>[d]</span>, but he also gets other parts wrong, in particular the
  pronunciation of the distinctive <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>/</span> and <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> vowels. But itís fun, and it points out various grammar
  and vocabulary features that are probably dying out, so I stuck it in.
  Besides, multiple contributors have suggested that I include it, so I really
  had to say something about it. No, the dialect is not really called <span>Heynabonics,</span> they just made that up! <i><span>16-May-2013</span></i></p>

  Lowland, but mixed with Inland. Actually, in the last one, from 1:59 to 2:05
  he says ìCoors Liteî with what sounds like <span>[a</span><span><span>…™</span>]</span>,
  though it is awfully fast, ìtwiceî with a clear <span>[a…™]</span>,

  accent is such perfect Inland Southern. <i><span>1-May-2012</span></i></p>

  one from Rafael Eledge, it is almost pointless to include this one. His
  pronunciation here is mostly Lowland, which might be explained by the fact
  that he has worked extensively as an actor, and could presumably adjust his
  speech accordingly. However, I decided to include it anyway, because in spite
  of all this he does pronounce a few words with a clear Inland pronunciation,
  notable the word ìicebergî, suggesting that his native dialect is Inland. <i><span>1-May-2012</span></i></p>

  Contributor Eva Griffin suggested that the Grundy County dialects are
  mountain dialects, i.e. Inland Southern, and she was quite right. Grundy
  County is up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Plateau" target="_blank">Cumberland Plateau</a>, all of which is solidly Inland
  Southern. (See comments about the Cumberland Plateau in the <a href="#Southern">Inland and Lowland Southern</a> section.) <i><span>16-Mar.-2013</span></i></p>

  she was born and raised there, so I have reinstated her as a valid sample.
  She is mostly Lowland Southern, with a few signs of Inland Southern, which <span>is</span> not too surprising given how close to the
  border she lives. In the first part of the sample, which was rote reading,
  she seemed to pronounce a few of her long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> <span>[a(…™)]</span>

  video</a> Sent in by Carlisle Childress. Thanks! He comments: ìIíd like to
  offer the following video as a candidate for a native Richmond speaker. Doug
  Wilder was the first elected African-American governor in the US in 1990.
  Although you have said that you were not following African American dialects,
  he does speak just like my father and his siblings (all Caucasians), all born
  in the same neighborhood about the same time (Church Hill neighborhood in
  Richmond VA, in the 20ís and 30ís).î I am now including some <a href="#Classical_Southern">African American</a> samples, but only in the
  Lowland South where their dialects originated. However, I hardly perceive any
  <a href="#Classical_Southern">AAVE</a> features in Doug Wilderís
  pronunciation, and wonder how he compares with other African Americans in
  Richmond. He has both the Tidewater raising and Classical Southern, which
  made me redraw both of these lines. <i><span>25-Apr.-2013</span></i></p>

  heís from De Queen, Arkansas, and he speaks Inland Southern.î Turns out I was
  wrong on both counts. First, he is totally inconsistent: he sometimes sings
  Inland, as in this clip, but usually sings Lowland, as in the first song on
  this interview clip: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDkXj-3CGpM" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>, but he doesnít actually talk Southern at
  all, as can be heard in the interview. Also, though he was born in De Queen,
  he was raised <a href="http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Collin-Raye.html" target="_blank">someplace
  in Texas</a>. The first clip is a cool song, and I had at first assumed that
  it was a true story about Collin Rayeís grandparents, but I can find nothing
  to indicate this. Even so, he probably sang it in Inland Southern because he
  was thinking of his own grandparents, who may have been from De Queen. (I
  only included all this because I like the song.)<i><span>

  Nicole Garzino had proposed this speaker as representative of Pittsfield,
  even though he clearly has an Inland North accent. What makes it all
  confusing is that he apparently was raised and born in Pittsfield, at least
  according to the above web site, and for a while I adjusted the map assuming
  that he was representative, even though it makes some weird bends in the
  lines. However, I have finally had to reject him, for reasons given under <a href="#Kitmacher">Gary Kitmacher</a>.<i><span>

</tbody></div><p>The three largest dialects that are characterized by the
cot-caught merger, The West and the two main Canadian dialects, also have one
other feature in common: the vowel of ìtooî is significantly more fronted than
the vowel of ìtoeî. Now this situation is not seen in England, but it is in
Scotland, where the difference in fronting of ìtooî and ìtoeî is even more
extreme. And it turns out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English#Phonology" target="_blank">many
speakers of Scottish English also have the cot-caught merger</a>! (In fact,
they only have 12 vowels, having also merged the vowels in ìgoodî and ìfoodî.)
Canadian English has other features like Scottish English, in particular the
pronunciation of the ìlong vowelsî in ìboatî and ìbaitî as pure vowels rather
than diphthongs, and the lower, more central pronunciation of the vowel in
ìbatî. Therefore, it seems likely that Canadian English, which had very heavy
Scottish immigration, took all of these features from Scottish English. (<a href="#Newfoundland" target="_blank">Newfoundland</a> also had very significant
Irish influence, and this has given its English a distinctive Irish
pronunciation, especially in <a href="#Dialects_Canada">Irish Newfoundland</a>.)
The dialect of the West in the U.S. may then have taken just the cot-caught
merger and the fronting of the vowel of ìtooî from Canadian English, since no
other U. S. dialect has the latter.<i><span> 4-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p>How the other dialects with the cot-caught merger got it is
less clear, but it is evident from the map that they are all close to the
Canadian border! In particular, based on the western settlement patterns, it
seems fairly clear that the North Central dialect is simply a case of speakers
from the North dialect who have adopted the cot-caught merger from the West and
from Canada.</p><div>

  <p>The Father-Bother distinction</p>
  <p>In Eastern New England (ENE), many Greater New York City
  (GNYC) speakers, England, Australia, various other former British colonies,
  and possibly a few speakers in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Father-bother_merger" target="_blank">Maritime Provinces of Canada</a>, the words ìfatherî and
  ìbotherî do not rhyme, having different vowels in the first syllable. Not
  only that, but in all of these areas except Eastern New England and possibly
  the Maritimes the words ìfatherî, ìbotherî, and ìbroaderî all have different
  vowels. However, the words with <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> (the vowel in ìfatherî) are relatively few, so there
  are few <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Dialect-dependent_homophones#Cot-caught_and_father-bother_mergers" target="_blank">minimal pairs</a> (scroll down to the second group; I found a
  few more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_low_back_vowels#Father.E2.80.93bother_merger" target="_blank">here</a>).<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p>
  <p>I have only found one minimal triple, which was only
  possible by including the name Bach, which is not an English word in the
  strictest sense. The three words ìBachísî, ìboxî, and ìbalksî would each be
  pronounced differently in most of these areas, including England. However, in
  Greater New York City ìBachísî and ìboxî are the same (confirmed by GNYC
  contributor Kevin McNamara), even though GNYC speakers make the three-way
  distinction in the other words listed, because of the fact that the phonetic
  pronunciations of <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span>
  and <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span>
  are reversed from the other regions, as shown in the chart.<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[55]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
  In Eastern New England ìboxî and ìbalksî would be the same, but ìBachísî
  would be different. (In the chart, MEA means ìMany Eastern Americansî.
  Obviously, all of those with the <a href="#CotCaughtMerger">cot-caught merger</a>
  would say them all with the same vowel, and I have not shown this.)<i><span> 11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p>
  <p>Part of the issue is the limited number of consonants
  which may follow the <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> vowel. That is, native English words with <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> are
  relatively few if you donít count words in which an r has been dropped in the
  pronunciation, since most of these areas (though not the Maritimes) are <a href="#Note3_RDropping">systematic r-dropping</a> regions. Thus, in most of
  these areas the words ìfatherî and ìfartherî are identical, and most words
  spelled with <span>ìarî</span> are pronounced with <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span>.<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p>
  <p>But apart from these words with dropped rís, or with <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> before an
  <span>/r/</span> between vowels as in the second row in the
  chart, native English words with <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> before a consonant are almost nonexistent, the only
  genuine cases being ìfatherî and the <span>ìalmî </span>words.
  (This is why I had to add the foreign names marked with <sup>Ü</sup>, just to
  help fill out the chart, and even these donít work in GNYC.) On the other
  hand, there are quite a number at the end of a word, as the last five rows of
  the chart show, but none of these have minimal pairs with short¬†<span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span>,
  only with <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span>.<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p>
  <p>The chart on the left shows examples of these three groups
  of words.<i><span> 26-Sep.-2016</span></i></p>
  <p>There is another group of words that have <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> in
  southern England (and occasionally in Eastern New England), but <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>/</span> in
  most of North America and the rest of Britain, like ìstaffî, ìpassî, ìhalfî,
  ìbathî, ìratherî, etc. I have not included any of these in the chart.<i><span> 30-Mar.-2010<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
  <p>Scotland is a special case: ìfatherî and ìbotherî do not
  rhyme, but there is no distinction between <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> and <span>/<b>ƒÉ</b>/</span>, so ìpalmî=ìPamî, ìpsalmî=ìSamî,
  and ìfatherî rhymes with ìratherî. See the <a href="#CotCaughtMergerScottish">previous
  section</a> for more info about the Scottish vowel system.<i><span> 11-Jan.-2011</span></i></p>
  <p>Those who lack the father-bother distinction will
  pronounce the vowels in the first two columns the same, except that the word
  ìhorridî is variable, being pronounced <span>/<b><u>h≈èr</u></b>id/</span>
  <span>(</span><span>[Ààh…ë…π…™d]</span>
  or even <span>[Ààha…π…™d]</span>) in the northeastern
  U.S., but <span>/<b><u>h»Ør</u></b>id/</span> <span>[Ààho…π…™d]</span> by most Americans. (There may or may
  not be an intermediate group that says <span>/<b><u>hÙr</u></b>id/</span>
  <span>[Ààh…î…π…™d]</span>.) Many similar words have
  this same variation, as in ìhorribleî, ìporridgeî, ìcoralî.<i><span> 7-Feb.-2013</span></i></p>

some speakers pronounce ì<span>my </span><span>folks</span>î without the
ìlî, but ì<span>folk</span> <span>song</span>î with an ìlî.
Similarly, some speakers pronounce ì<span>corn</span> <span>stalk</span>î

(a verb) with an ìlî. If any of you who have already answered the survey find
that you do the same, please let me know. <i><span>15-May-2012<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>In English the number of words
which end in <span>ì-almî or ì-almsî</span> is
limited. The only ones of these which are really common, well-known words are
listed in the first column of the first chart above, although obviously there
are other words derived from these that are also common, like ìembalmî or
ìbecalmî or ìpsalmsî. (<a href="http://www.morewords.com/most-common-ends-with/alm/" target="_blank">This
web site</a> lists a few more, but they are so rare they donít even show up in
standard dictionaries. The word ìrealmî doesnít count, since its pronunciation
is completely different.) So, the list is short, though it is clearly a
pronunciation pattern. Now, around the world most English speakers, including
myself, do not pronounce the ìlî in these words, and these words contribute to
the short list of words containing the <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> vowel for those speakers who
do not rhyme the words ìfatherî and ìbotherî, as discussed in the <a href="#FatherBother">previous section</a>. For this reason this list of words,
though short, is somewhat important when discussing how many vowels a
particular speaker has.<i><span> 19-May-2011</span></i></p><p>Until 2011 I had assumed that
historically the ìlî in all of the red words above was completely lost in all
English dialects, and that the few speakers who did pronounce the ìlî did so
because it had been reintroduced based on a ìbookishî pronunciation. However, I
seem to have been quite wrong. A number of contributors to this page have
written in and told me so, after seeing the <span>ì-almî</span>
words listed in the <a href="#FatherBother">previous section</a>, and marked as
having a ìsilent lî. Thus, contributor Jon from Sacramento, California
disagrees: ìI would also note that all of the words that you list with a silent
ëlí in your father-bother distinction (balm, psalm, palm, alms, calming) I
would say with a swallowed but still present to varying degrees ìlî sound, and
I think the majority of people I grew up with in Sacramento would too.î Thus he
pronounces ìbalmî as <span>/<b><u>b≈èlm</u></b>/</span><span> (</span><span>[Ààb…í…´m]</span>
(he does not distinguish ìcotî and ìcaughtî), with a ì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_l" target="_blank">dark l</a>î, which
would sound almost ìswallowedî, as he describes it, though clearly there. <i><span>15-May-2012</span></i></p><p>I should have realized that it
wasnít a bookish pronunciation, since it only applies to certain groups of
words, as shown in the first chart above, not to all words with silent ìlî, of
which there are <a href="http://www.deimel.org/language/l.htm" target="_blank">many</a>.
I have listed the main groups in the first chart above.<i><span> 3-June-2011</span></i></p><p>After I was challenged by these
two contributors, I went looking on the Internet, and found that there is
indeed one American dictionary that lists a pronunciation of some of these
words with the ìlî pronounced, the Online Merriam-Webster dictionary, in all of
these words: <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calm" target="_blank">calm</a>, <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palm" target="_blank">palm</a>,
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balm" target="_blank">balm</a>,
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psalm" target="_blank">psalm</a>,
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qualm" target="_blank">qualm</a>,
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alms" target="_blank">alms</a>,
and <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/napalm" target="_blank">napalm</a>,
and even provides audio samples of the ìlî pronunciation. This was surprising
to me, since most dictionaries, both American and British, give only a
pronunciation with no ìlî. (Merriam-Webster also gives another pronunciation <span>/<b><u>kƒÉm</u></b>/</span>
for ìcalmî, which would evidently be the Scottish pronunciation, like ìpalmî
mentioned above.)<i><span> 16-May-2011</span></i></p><p>Contributor Y.I. has pointed out
to me that the <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch02_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE Ch. 2, p. 14</a> had also observed this phenomenon: ìWords
with vocalized <span>/l/</span> formed a part of this class: <i>calm</i>,
<i>palm</i>, <i>balm</i>, <i>almond</i>, though a large number of North
Americans have retained or restored the <span>/l/</span>.î Like
me, they are apparently unsure whether the ìlî was retained or restored, and
unfortunately they have not provided any help about the regional distribution.
(In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=many speakers now pronounce the l&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=many speakers now pronounce the l&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this book</a>, also found by Y.I., the assumption is simply
made that these <span>ìlîs</span> are retained because
of spelling pronunciations, without providing any evidence.) I had not
previously thought of the word ìalmondî as belonging to this class, since <a href="#AboutMe">I myself</a> pronounce the ìlî in this word, as <span>/<b><u>Ùl</u></b>m…ônd/</span><span> (</span><span>[Àà…ílm…ônd]</span><span>,</span> quite different from my ìcalmî <span>/<b><u>k≈èm</u></b>/</span><span> (</span><span>[Ààk ∞…ëm]</span><span>.</span> (I distinguish ìcotî and ìcaughtî but not
ìfatherî and ìbotherî.) However, after consulting my many dictionaries, none of
them recognize such a pronunciation, but say that the proper pronunciation is
either <span>/<b><u>‰</u></b>m…ônd/</span>
or <span>/<b><u>ƒÉm</u></b>…ônd/</span>!
I checked with my wife, who is from Nebraska and does not pronounce the ìlî in
ìcalmî, though she does in ìbalmî, and she <i>does</i>
pronounce it in ìalmondî, just as I do. The <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/almond?show=0&amp;t=1304968712" target="_blank">Online Merriam-Webster dictionary</a> <span>comes</span> the closest to our pronunciation, at least recognizing that
some people do pronounce the ìlî, but they give the options as <span>/<b><u>‰</u></b>m…ônd/</span>,
<span>/<b><u>ƒÉm</u></b>…ônd/</span>,
<span>/<b><u>‰l</u></b>m…ônd/</span>,
or <span>/<b><u>ƒÉl</u></b>m…ônd/</span>.
I find the third of these four options extremely unlikely, and speculate that
perhaps a speaker for whom <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span> = <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span> = <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> may have worked on this entry.) Most American
dictionaries give both <span>/<b><u>‰</u></b>m…ônd/</span> and <span>/<b><u>ƒÉm</u></b>…ônd/</span>, and
according to contributor Marna Ducharme, her grandmother who always lived in
New York City said <span>/<b><u>ƒÉm</u></b>…ônd/</span>
<span>[ÀàÊm…ônd]</span>. Not only that, but several
contributors (Emmor Nile, James Divine, John Kelly), have told me that it has
the <span>/<b><u>ƒÉm</u></b>…ônd/</span>
<span>[ÀàÊm…ônd]</span> pronunciation throughout Californiaís
Central Valley, where they grow lots of them! In any case, it seems clear that
ìalmondî often does not go along with the other <span>ì-almî</span>
words. <i><span>2-Oct.-2011</span></i></p><p>Later I realized that a lot of
people also pronounce the ìlî in ìfolkî and ìyolkî, as shown in the <a href="#AlmSurveyResults">Initial Survey Results</a> chart below. Almost all of
these also pronounce the ìlî in ìcalmî, suggesting that the two word groups are
part of the same pattern of ìlî retention.<i><span> 8-June-2011</span></i></p><p>So this seems to be a
conservative feature harking back to a time when the ìlî in the red words was
pronounced by all speakers, and as such, is probably a regional feature like
the others on the map. <i><span>8-June-2011</span></i></p><p>If this is a conservative
feature, then it must have been brought over to the U.S. from some region of
Great Britain or Ireland. However, there is almost no trace of this ìlî
anywhere in this area, not even in Scotland or Ireland, from which many of the conservative
features in American English came. However, my trusty contributor Y.I. has been
able to track down one possible source: what is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country" target="_blank">West Country
of England</a> (really the extreme southwest) apparently continues to pronounce
this ìlî, according to John Wells in <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=a3-ElL71fikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=accents of english&amp;pg=PA346#v=onepage&amp;q=palm&amp;f=false" target="_blank">The Accents of English<span>, page
346</span></a></i>, in a section describing the vowels in the West Country.
According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_dialects" target="_blank">this article</a>, &lt;&lt;The West Country accent is probably
most identified in American English as ìpirate speechî - cartoon-like <span>ìOoh arr, me íearties! Sploice the mainbrace!î</span>
talk is very similar. This may be a result of the strong seafaring and
fisherman tradition of the West Country, both legal and outlaw.&gt;&gt; Clearly
this accent could have had influence in the Americas (as suggested in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2OljaOxwJ4kC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;ots=OQX1_O4DsX&amp;dq=ìAs a result of a long seafaring traditionî&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=ìAs a result of a long seafaring traditionî&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this linguistics book</a> tracked down by contributor Y.I.),
though why the influence has been so pervasive is unclear.<i><span> 6-Sep.-2011</span></i></p><p>In any case, the retention of
this ìlî thus does not seem to depend on whether or not ìcotî=ìcaughtî, since
it occurs across the continent. However, I am fairly certain that all speakers
who are <a href="#Note3_RDropping">systematic r-droppers</a> always lack the
ìlî in the ìcalmî group, and that all speakers with the father-bother
distinction do too. This makes sense, since the resulting vowel is <span>/<b>‰</b>/</span>, which
mainly occurs as the result of r-dropping. It is less clear why the ìyolkî
group would drop the ìlî for this group, since the resulting vowel <span>/<b>≈ç</b>/</span><span> </span><span>[o ä]</span> does
not normally occur as a result of r-dropping.<i><span>
2-Oct.-2011</span></i></p><p>Unlike the other data on the main
map, this data is not from audio or video sound samples, but from self-analysis
and direct interviews, since finding individual words in sound samples is
almost impossible. It appears that the vast majority of Americans pronounce the
ìlî in ìcalmî, except for those in <a href="#Note3_RDropping">systematic
r-dropping</a> areas (as mentioned in the <a href="#FatherBother">previous
section</a>), and nearby areas like Poughkeepsie and Port Chester, New York, in
the Eastern North dialect. (New Orleans seems to have followed GNYC in this as
in many other features, at least as far as the common words go.) So it would
seem that I am in a small minority! Evidently <a href="#AboutMe">my dialect</a>
was influenced by my parents more than I realized: my Dad was from Port
Chester, New York, an area that does not pronounce the ìlî, and my mother was
originally from Australia, which is a systematic r-dropping area, and so again
does not pronounce the ìlî. Even so, I canít believe I didnít even notice such
a widespread pattern for so long! As for Canada, it seems likely that many or
most there also retain the ìlî, though so far I only have data for one location.<i><span> 6-Sep.-2011</span></i></p><p>We now seem to have enough data
that the geographical pattern is becoming clear for the ìcalmî group and to a
lesser extent for the ìyolkî group, though the ìtalkî group remains unclear.
However, we clearly still need more data to map these patterns fully. In
particular we need more locations where the ìlî in these words is definitely <i>not</i> pronounced. Help me out, people.
This is a very simple thing for you to write in and tell me: ìI grew up in X,
and I pronounce the ìlî in all these words,î or ìI grew up in Y, and I donít
pronounce the ìlî in any of these words except ëalmondí,î or whatever the case
may be. <i><span>15-May-2012</span></i></p><p>* Although she grew up in
Burlington, she was strongly influenced by her NYC relatives, and retains the
distinction.<i><span> 23-May-2011</span></i></p><p>Inland and Lowland Southern and their relationship to the extent
of slavery before the Civil War</p><p>Before discussing the distribution of Inland Southern and
Lowland Southern, I need to define them more clearly, since I find that there
is a lot of confusion as to what I mean by Inland Southern versus Lowland
Southern.<i><span> 17-Apr.-2013</span></i></p><p><span>Inland Southern has full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English#Shared_features" target="_blank">monophthongization</a> of long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> </span><span>[a…™]</span><span> to </span><span>[a]</span><span>.</span>
This means that all long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> vowels are not diphthongs <span>[a…™]</span>,
but essentially pure vowels, usually <span>[a]</span> (which is
clearly distinguished from <span>/<b>≈è</b>/</span> <span>[…ë]</span>). Thus, the <span>ìiîs in</span> ìrideî, ìbuyî, and ìrightî are all the
same, and all sound quite Southern! However, this doesnít mean that ìrideî <span>[Àà…πad]</span> is pronounced the same as ìrodî <span>[Àà…π…ëd]</span>, or that ìrightî <span>[Àà…πat]</span>
is pronounced the same as ìrotî <span>[Àà…π…ët]</span>:
these words still have distinct pronunciations, though Yankees may have trouble
hearing the difference!<i><span> 27-Apr.-2013</span></i></p><p>Lowland Southern is similar, except that <span>Lowland Southern only has partial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English#Shared_features" target="_blank">monophthongization</a> of long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> </span><span>[a…™]</span><span> to </span><span>[a]</span><span>.</span>
This means that the vowels of ìrideî and ìbuyî have the Southern vowel <span>[a]</span> just like Inland, but the vowel of ìrightî is a diphthong <span>[a…™]</span>, with a pronunciation a bit more like other parts of
the United States. The specific rule is this: before voiceless sounds the vowel
is a diphthong, but elsewhere it is not. Voiceless sounds are <span>/p,t,ch,k,f,s,sh,th/</span> (as is ìpythonî <span>/<b><u>pƒ´</u></b>th…ôn/</span>
<span>[Ààp ∞a…™Œ∏…ôn]</span>, where it is
voiceless, not as in ìlitheî <span>/<b><u>lƒ´≈ßƒß</u></b>/</span>
<span>[Ààla…™]</span>, where it is voiced). Why does it work
that way? Ah, that kind of question doesnít have a good answer in human
language! However, to put it another <span>way,</span>
how is it that they follow such a technical rule without knowing it? That does
have an answer: patterns such as this are common in human language, even though
the speakers are totally unaware of them at a conscious level.<i><span> 17-Apr.-2013</span></i></p><p>Thus, to determine if a particular speaker speaks Inland or
Lowland Southern, first make sure he speaks Southern at all by listening to
words like ìrideî and ìbuyî. If he does, then listen to words with voiceless
sounds like ìripeî, ìbiteî, ìrighteousî (which has a <span>/ch/</span>
sound in spite of the spelling), ìlikeî, ìlifeî, ìiceî (s sound), ìpythonî,
etc.</p><p>The <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch18_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 18</a> uses more complex criteria to distinguish
their varieties of Southern, but I find theirs to be unwieldy, so I have gone
for the simpler criterion, which seems to be sufficient, as seen in the next
paragraph.</p><p>A surprising pattern seen on the map is the peculiar way in
which the two Southern dialect areas are intertwined. It turns out that the
current pattern of Lowland Southern matches to an amazing degree the areas with
a high percentage of slaves before the Civil War, as shown by <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/akerman/maps_slavery.html" target="_blank">this famous antique map</a> (viewable in one piece and
downloadable <a href="http://www.loc.gov/item/99447026" target="_blank">here</a>).
Granted, there are a few minor surprises, but what <span>is</span> astonishing <span>is</span> not the
occasional surprises, but how few the surprises are!<i><span>
8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>What seems likely is that the Inland Southern dialect spread
west and south first, and then the Lowland Southern dialect was spread later by
the slaveholding ìaristocracyî, but never penetrated into areas unsuitable for
large plantations, such as mountainous areas or dryer areas in the west. An
exceptional area is Virginia and West Virginia, where Lowland Southern spread
westward into non-slaveholding areas (see <a href="#InlandSouthOrigin">My
Theory about the Original Area of Inland Southern</a> below for more on this).
Another exceptional area seems to be <span>south</span>
Georgia and north Florida, which no Inland Southern speakers apparently ever
reached. Other exceptional areas are discussed below in <a href="#SouthernSettledLater">Southern Areas Settled after the Civil War</a>.<i><span> 8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>The ìr-droppingî areas (the green lines) and ìTidewater <span>raising</span>î (the pink line) also seem to be
restricted to these slaveholding areas.</p><p>One result of this later spread of Lowland Southern is that
Inland Southern was nearly broken into two sections, divided by what might be
called the <span>ìNashville-Florence Corridorî</span>. If you
look at a satellite map of this area, you can actually see this corridor in a
lighter color outlined by darker forests, a fascinating geographic
demonstration of my theory. This is not to say that, as a general rule, Inland
areas are forested and Lowland areas are not, though this is often the case,
and holds true in this case. The forested area to the east of the corridor
matches rather precisely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Plateau" target="_blank">Cumberland
Plateau</a>, a stretch of higher and often rugged land which often rises
abruptly from the flatter land to the west. In fact, the line dividing Inland
Southern from Lowland Southern seems to follow exactly the northwest edge of
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Plateau" target="_blank">Cumberland
Plateau</a> from just west of Monterey, Tennessee all the way to Hackleburg,
Alabama, with the entire plateau being solidly Inland Southern (except for its
southern tip in Alabama, which was mostly <a href="#SouthernSettledLater">settled
later</a>). <i><span>16-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>A narrow neck around Iuka, Mississippi remains to connect
the two sections of Inland Southern. <i><span>16-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>However, as more data comes in an expected result of this
should be that there will be occasional islands of one dialect surrounded by
the other. I had thought that Chattanooga, Tennessee was such a case. This is
an important city in southeastern Tennessee. I most recently spent some time
there in October, 2011, and was able to listen to many native speakers, all of
whom spoke Lowland Southern. However, I have since realized that these speakers
were all higher class speakers, since my exposure was socially quite limited.
Since then I have heard various working class speakers from Chattanooga (mainly
policemen) on TV, and have confirmed that Chattanooga is Inland Southern, and
that Kevin Burke, whom I had originally assumed was not from Chattanooga, is
actually a native, and represents the dialect quite well. However, many higher
class speakers speak Lowland Southern, as discussed below in <span><a href="#SouthernClassDistinction">Possible Southern
Class Distinction?</a>.</span> So we will have to look for another example of
such a linguistic island! <i><span>11-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>The obsolete terms <a href="https://veera.app/Tuckahoe%20and%20Cohees">Tuckahoe
and Cohee</a>, used in the northeastern part of the South before the Civil War,
seem to have been used to reflect the strong cultural and linguistic
differences between these two groups, though again West Virginia was clearly
Cohee without getting the Inland Southern dialect. The article confirms my
analysis of the settlement patterns, saying, ìAs the frontier moves westward,
the third zone (slave-based plantation society) moves into land formerly held
by the second (the frontier society).î<i><span>
8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p><b><span>One interesting corroboration</span><span> of my theory is political</span></b>: After the Civil War,
the former slave states tended to elect exclusively Democratic Party
candidates, rejecting the Republican Party as the party of Lincoln. This
phenomenon is referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_south" target="_blank">Solid South</a>,
which remained so at least up into the 1960ís. However, certain areas of the
south, primarily in mountain areas like the Appalachians and the Ozarks, where
little or no slavery had existed, resisted this tendency, and aligned
themselves with the Union and with the Republican Party, consistently electing
Republican candidates throughout this period. The fascinating map on <a href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/FORUM/index.php?topic=97612.0" target="_blank">this web page</a> shows what areas of the south these were, at
least in the 1940 election. (Notice particularly the circled areas, and the
discussion about these.) Notice the correlation between these areas, my map,
and the <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/akerman/maps_slavery.html" target="_blank">slavery map</a> mentioned above: If we exclude the areas in
Texas (which apparently represent later German immigration, at least according
to the discussion on the web page), none of these areas is Lowland South
(except for Sampson County, North Carolina, for which I have no explanation).
Instead, ignoring the exceptions mentioned, they are all Inland South, except
for part of Missouri, which is Midland! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_County,_Alabama" target="_blank">Winston
County, Alabama</a>, is in fact famous for the degree to which it opposed
secession during the Civil War, being known as the ìFree State of Winstonî!</p><p>This is not to say that Inland South areas in general voted
Republican: they didnít, and in Texas and Oklahoma they were as Solid South as
anywhere else. I am only saying that such areas are consistently in the Inland
South region. (Nowadays, of course, everything has changed, and the south
overwhelmingly votes Republican.) <i><span>9-Mar.-2012</span></i></p><p>Charleston is clearly a special case of Lowland Southern, as
is clear by listening to it. The Down East &amp; Outer Banks dialect doesnít
sound very Southern at all, but does at least have the ìTidewater raisingî.
Florida doesnít count, since it had a huge influx of Yankees in the 20th
century. In fact, Florida is effectively upside down: the farther south you go
in Florida, the more Northern people sound! <i><span>19-Nov.-2011</span></i></p><p>Obviously areas in the South settled after the Civil War may
not follow this pattern, especially those which are near the border between the
two subdialects. The Birmingham, Alabama area is a case in point. Birmingham
did not exist before the Civil War, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama" target="_blank">was
founded in 1871</a> as a steel production center, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama#People_and_culture" target="_blank">grew so fast between 1880 and 1920</a> that it was given its
well-known nickname ìThe Magic City.î It lies in a very mountainous area (part
of the Cumberland Plateau mentioned above), and thus was probably originally in
the Inland South, but because of the huge influx of people from all over the
South, it is now Lowland Southern. <a href="http://www.trussville.org/content.asp?ID=89209" target="_blank">Trussville
was founded much earlier, around 1820</a>, but remained small until it was swamped
by the growth of Birmingham, and now follows its pattern, as do the other
nearby towns, but towns just a little farther removed like Odenville or Jasper
do not. <i><span>16-Mar.-2013</span></i></p><p>However, it turns out that there is at least one town south
of Birmingham and Anniston which speaks Inland Southern and which was
definitely settled before the Civil War, the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylacauga#Early_history" target="_blank">Sylacauga</a>,
which was originally incorporated in 1838, though it had been a Creek (or
Shawnee?) <span>Indian village as far back as 1748.</span>
The name of the town is pronounced <span>/<b>sƒ≠l</b>…ô<b><u>k≈èg</u></b>…ô/</span>
<span>[Àås…™l…ôÀàk ∞…ë…°…ô]</span>,
not <span>/<b>sƒ≠l</b>…ô<b><u>kÙg</u></b>…ô/</span> <span>[Àås…™l…ôÀàk ∞…í ä…°…ô]</span>,
in spite of the spelling: it was originally called <span>Syllacoga</span>, which in turn was derived from the Indian name <span><i>Chalaka-ge</i></span>,
according to the Wikipedia article). So far I have not been able to find any
good sound clips for Sylacauga (if you know of one please send it me!), but I
made a visit there in the spring of 2012, where I met a native who clearly
spoke Inland Southern, and who had lived there all her life. In November of
2012 I met two more natives of Sylacauga and talked with them at length, and
they also spoke clear Inland Southern. As can be seen by looking at a map of
the Talladega National Forest, which runs in a northeast to southwest direction
just to the east of Anniston, and which includes the highest point in Alabama,
Mount Cheaha, Sylacauga lies at the tail end of the southernmost ridge of the
Appalachian mountains. (This ridge can also be clearly seen on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cumberlandplateaumap.png" target="_blank">this map</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greatvalley-map.jpg" target="_blank">this
map</a>.) <i><span>12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>Because of all this, the Inland South line makes several
sharp curves along its southern edge in Alabama. Presumably at the time of the
civil war, Inland Southern was spoken throughout the entire Cumberland Plateau
and the southern part of the Appalachian Mountains, shown fairly well on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greatvalley-map.jpg" target="_blank">this
map</a>, whereas the Piedmont was mainly Lowland Southern.<i><span> 26-Aug.-2014<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>Another example is the Asheville-Waynesville area of North
Carolina. Both of these towns existed before the Civil War, but they both saw
massive growth after the war, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina" target="_blank">Asheville</a>
more than tripling in size between 1910 and 1930, apparently because of strong
growth of manufacturing, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waynesville,_North_Carolina#History" target="_blank">Waynesville</a> only beginning to grow after the arrival of the
railroad in 1884. In both cases this seems to have brought in Lowland Southern
speakers, whereas the surrounding towns are still solidly Inland Southern. (The
one exception seems to be Burnsville: why it is Lowland is unclear.)<i><span> 8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>It has been often been suggested (or assumed) that in some
areas there is also a social-status distinction between what I have called
ìInland Southernî (sometimes referred to as ìhillbillyî or ìcountryî, as in ìHe
sure talks country!î) and ìLowland Southernî, with people from higher-class
family backgrounds favoring the ìLowland Southernî pattern, and this would make
sense if my hypothesis as to its spread is true. Even so, evidence of such a
social distinction does not appear in very many places, and only near the
border between these two regions. <i><span>11-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>Two such areas are an area surrounding Dallas and Fort Worth
in Texas and an area around Greenville in South Carolina, which are evidently
Inland Southern areas, but in which a number of people born and raised there
(like Ross Perot, Jr. or Kenny Marchant) have Lowland Southern accents, mostly
people in the middle and upper socioeconomic class. <i><span>11-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>A third such area is Little Rock, Arkansas, which is clearly
a Lowland Southern area, but in which several samples of people born and raised
there show traces of Inland Southern, notably people in what are often viewed
as working class professions. <i><span>11-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>Recently (2014) I have realized that Chattanooga, Tennessee
is a fourth area where this holds true, which makes it unusual in that it is
not on the border between the two dialects, but is surrounded on all sides by
solidly Inland South areas, though Lowland South areas are not far away, such
as Decatur and Florence (and partially Huntsville) down the Tennessee river.<i><span> 4-Nov.-2015</span></i></p><p>Most such areas are marked on the map surrounded by a dotted
red line, and with both background colors as alternate bars. Samples showing
this variation will often refer to the <span><a href="#SouthernClassDistinction">Possible Southern Class Distinction?</a></span><i><span> 4-Nov.-2015</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>If only one town seems to
have both Inland and Lowland speakers, with this presumed class distinction
distinguishing them, then rather than the dotted line I simply run the dialect
boundary through the middle of the town. Examples of this are Huntsville and
West Blocton, Alabama and Kannapolis, North Carolina.</span><i><span> 4-Nov.-2015</span></i></p><p><span>Very rarely I run the dialect
boundary through the middle of a town if the only sample I have is highly
mixed, as in the case of Junior Johnson from Ronda, North Carolina.</span><i><span> 4-Nov.-2015</span></i></p><p><span>However, ìInland Southernî is NOT
equivalent to ìhillbillyî, nor do people who talk ìreally, really southernî or
even ìreally, really countryî necessarily speak Inland rather than Lowland.</span>
Some people who sound ìreally, really Southernî actually speak Lowland Southern
based on the definition I am using, which seems to match high slave density
areas, whereas some people whose speech doesnít sound quite as ìstrongî, or who
are obviously well educated and sophisticated, actually speak Inland Southern.
Even so, it <i>is</i> true that areas
generally recognized as more ìhillbillyî, such as the Appalachians or the
Ozarks, do indeed fall within Inland Southern, so one could say that
ìhillbillyî is definitely a subset of Inland Southern and not of Lowland
Southern. As for ìredneckî, this term has absolutely no linguistic meaning, so
donít try using this map to find out where the ìrednecksî live!<i><span> 12-Dec.-2011</span></i></p><p>According to contributor A.T.W., in Texas the status of
Inland Southern is different from its status in the east:</p><p>But all this leaves the question: Where did Inland Southern
start out? What was its original area? If we look at this <a href="http://www.emersonkent.com/map_archive/us_exploration_1800.htm" target="_blank">map showing settlement as of 1800</a>, we see that the earliest
settled areas of what is now the Inland South region are located on either side
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Gap" target="_blank">Cumberland
Gap</a>, which allowed easy crossing of the Appalachian Mountains and through
which nearly all of the western settlement from the South took place after the
Revolutionary War in 1776. This settlement process would have involved much
mixing of populations and dialects, and it seems likely that Inland Southern
was the result of this mixing, thus distinguishing it from the more settled
Lowland Southern. I have marked the Cumberland Gap on my map, and it can be
seen that it lies almost exactly in the center of the northernmost node of
Inland Southern, which would have been its original area. The Appalachian
Mountains themselves, including the Cumberland Gap area, were not settled until
later, since it was not desirable land, but the settlers were evidently
speakers moving south from this original area, as the map suggests.<i><span> 7-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>Technically the Cumberland Gap allowed easy crossing of the <span>western ridge </span>of the Appalachian Mountains, called at
this point the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Mountains" target="_blank">Cumberland Mountains</a>, not the <span>eastern
ridge</span>, which is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains" target="_blank">Blue
Ridge</a>. This western ridge (technically the eastern escarpment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Plateau" target="_blank">Appalachian
Plateau</a>) was generally harder to cross than the eastern ridge. Between the
two runs the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Appalachian_Valley" target="_blank">Appalachian Great Valley</a> (the map on that page shows fairly
clearly the two ridges and the valley). As can be seen on the map mentioned in
the preceding paragraph, part of this valley, the upper reaches of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tennesseermfinal.jpg" target="_blank">Tennessee
River valley</a>, was settled fairly early, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overmountain_Men#The_Overmountain_settlements" target="_blank"><span>Overmountain</span> Settlements</a>
from the late 1760s, in what is now the extreme northeast corner of Tennessee.
It is possible that these settlements formed the original melting pot that
created Inland Southern.<i><span> 8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>Does this mean that Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett spoke
Inland Southern, since they lived in this area? Well, in spite of the fact that
many of us grew up hearing Texan <a href="#FessParker">Fess Parker</a> play him
on television with an Inland Southern accent, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Boone#Youth" target="_blank">Daniel
Boone</a> certainly did not have the accent, for two reasons. One is that he
was born and raised in Pennsylvania, not in the South at all, and didnít move
to the south until he was 16, in 1750. The second is that he lived way too
early, long before Inland Southern would have even formed according to my
theory, being born in 1734. He was one of the prime movers in encouraging the
population movement that would have created it, but he would have been an old
man before it really coalesced. His grandchildren probably did speak it.<i><span> 12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>What about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett" target="_blank">Davy Crockett</a>?
His is a different story, and he very likely did speak it. He was born about 50
years after Daniel Boone, in 1786, and was born in the heart of the Inland
South area, in the <span>Overmountain</span>
Settlements mentioned above, during the existence of the short-lived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Franklin" target="_blank">State of
Franklin</a>.<i><span> 8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>This does not explain why Inland Southern is almost
non-existent in West Virginia (except for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield-McCoy_feud" target="_blank">Hatfield-McCoy</a>
area), which speaks almost entirely Lowland Southern in the southern part, in
spite of being almost entirely mountains, and Midland in the north. It turns
out that its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia#Trans-Allegheny_Virginia" target="_blank">settlement pattern</a> was different from the rest of the
Appalachians (check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WVStatehoodVote.png" target="_blank">this
interesting 1861 voting map</a>, which lines up very closely with my map,
showing that most of those who voted for statehood spoke Midland, not
Southern). In any case Inland Southerners apparently tended to move east and
south into new lands, not north.<i><span> 8-Nov.-2013</span></i></p><p>The r-dropping areas in the Lowland South (marked with a
dark green line) could be described as ì<span>Classical
Southern</span>î. This is the accent that Scarlett OíHara (Vivien Leigh) is
attempting to imitate in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nACj50uq6_s" target="_blank">clip from <i>Gone with the Wind</i></a>. This area
represents the heart of the old plantation system, as can be seen on the <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/akerman/maps_slavery.html" target="_blank">map</a> mentioned above. However, this feature seems to only
occur in older settled areas, and does not occur in western areas on the
Mississippi River or farther west <a href="http://www.emersonkent.com/map_archive/us_exploration_1820.htm" target="_blank">that were settled after about 1825</a>.<i><span> 23-Sep.-2015<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>Within this area older speakers seem to be consistent in
maintaining this pattern. However, many younger ones in this area seem to be
pronouncing all of their rís, and I will include some of these with a comment.
Outside of this area (but always within the Lowland Southern area) there will
occasionally be much older speakers who do speak Classical Southern. I will
comment individually on each of these, and will mark their city surrounded by a
dotted green line.<i><span> 23-July-2011</span></i></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English" target="_blank">African American Vernacular English (AAVE)</a>, the dialect of
most African Americans in the United States, is derived from Classical
Southern, and shares its main features and many other features. However, it
also has a number of distinctive features. I have not generally included AAVE
in this study, since its geographical distribution tends to be independent of
ìwhiteî dialects, primarily because after the Civil War large numbers of former
slaves moved to all parts of the U.S., and tended to form their own
communities, retaining their unique dialect. <span>However,
in many areas of the Lowland South no such migration occurred, and in these
areas AAVE and ìwhiteî dialects share features and clearly have developed
together, so in these areas I have sometimes included AAVE samples.</span> AAVE
tends to retain r-dropping more than ìwhiteî dialects do, even among younger
speakers, and throughout the United States in African American communities. <i><span>2-Jan.-2012</span></i></p><p>One feature that was formerly common among (white) speakers
of Classical Southern is their special pronunciation of the vowel <span>/<b>˚r</b>/</span> in words
like ìhurtî, ìturningî, and ìconcerningî as <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>,
much like Greater New York City, rather than the now more common <span>[…ù]</span>. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina is an excellent
example (see his sample). (Unlike GNYC, this vowel <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>
is quite distinct from the <span>/<b>oi</b>/</span> vowel in words like ìcoinî, which is usually pronounced <span>[…î…õ]</span> in the South.)</p><p>Contributor Jason Reid provides further info: ìAccording to
the linguist <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=484eVQ7t8TMC&amp;pg=PA545&amp;lpg=PA545&amp;dq=ìbut in preconsonantal position a closing diphthongî&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xEYtqAhIoh&amp;sig=Zgp9E0RoWRqBO-u-uBhsw05DoyA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLOxT5z3IpCu8QTgy8n8CA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ìbut in preconsonantal position a closing diphthongî&amp;f=false" target="_blank">John Wells in his book <i>Accents of English</i></a> (1982),
this pronunciation was at one time common. Erik R. Thomas in his very detailed

very few speakers born after 1930 show it (Strom Thurmond was born in 1902).î</p><p>The latter writerís indicated range seems to cover all of my
Lowland Southern area except North Carolina and Virginia (and Florida, though I
have personally heard it there also, from African American speakers, many of
whom retain it to the present day). This same pronunciation can also be heard
in most of the <a href="#NewOrleans">New Orleans samples</a>, from both whites
and blacks, and is still heard today. In general, my observation is that it
persists today among some African Americans, especially older ones, in many
regions, an example being Elizabeth Allen of North Carolina (see her sample).</p><p>However, I visited with a number of older white speakers in
Augusta, Georgia, in the spring of 2012, and though they all had consistent
Classical Southern accents, none of them showed any sign of the <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>
pronunciation. Nor did I hear it from the Classical Southern speakers I met in
Brewton, Alabama in February of 2012. However, the <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>
pronunciation is not dead among whites in the older south: in November of 2012
I met an older gentleman from Sumter, South Carolina, who spoke Classical
Southern and used the <span>[</span><span><span>…ú…™</span>]</span>
pronunciation in a number of words.</p><p>Not even all Classical Southern speakers from this area born
before 1930 have it: George Wallace does not, nor <span>do</span> Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.</p><p>As can be seen on the map, the pin-pen merger is primarily a
Southern feature, but has spread well beyond the South. I suspect that this has
happened for two principal historical processes, both of them involving
Southerners moving west and North.<i><span> 12-June-2010</span></i></p><p>1. The first was the settlement of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Territory" target="_blank">Kansas</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Territory" target="_blank">Nebraska</a>
territories, driven in part by the political issues concerning slavery
surrounding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas-Nebraska_Act" target="_blank">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> of 1854. Evidently the bulk of the
Southern settlement stopped at the Platte River in what is now eastern
Nebraska, as can be seen by the comment about people ìsympathetic towards the
Confederate causeî in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article about Lincoln, Nebraska</a>. This is where the pin-pen line runs in
Eastern Nebraska: south of the Platte River. (The rest of Nebraska was not
really settled until after the Civil War, and the line crosses to the north
side of the Platte River west of Grand Island, though it does return to it
briefly between Gothenburg and North Platte. At North Platte the river splits
into the North and South Platte, and as the pin-pen line moves west it stays
north of the North Platte.) <i><span>7-Nov.-2011</span></i></p><p>2. Farther west the line runs much further north, and, I
suspect, was spread north up the cattle drive trails from Texas in the late
1800ís, presumably by Texas cowboys who hired on for a drive and decided to
settle down somewhere along the trail home. This can be seen by comparing the
pin-pen line with this map of the <a href="http://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1b/6a/a1/1b6aa1a1163db38e9172f3751aab4f82.jpg" target="_blank">cattle drive trails</a> (replaced bad link). (The sites I originally
had for this map are all gone, and no full-size map seems to be available
except for purchase.) This map is quite accurate, even though the red trails
were added to show details from a fictional book, and the ìHat Creek Cattle
Companyî is fictional. Other maps corroborating the northern extent of the
cattle trails are: <span><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cattle-trails.jpg" target="_blank">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cattle-trails.jpg</a></span>
and <span><a href="http://nps.gov/hfc/carto/RELIEFS/GRKOrelief3_c.jpg" target="_blank">nps.gov/hfc/carto/RELIEFS/GRKOrelief3_c.jpg</a></span>

neither shows the full course of the Bozeman Trail, which can be seen here: <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman_Trail" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman_Trail</a></span>. See also <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States</a></span>,
where Miles City, MT and Medora, ND are specifically mentioned.<i><span> 26-Sep.-2016</span></i></p><p>In fact, the pin-pen line seems to only have been stopped in
its northward progress by the Canadian border! Apparently none of the cattle
drives felt free or were invited or were contracted to cross that border.<i><span> 26-Sep.-2016</span></i></p><p>Most of these trails stayed in the Great Plains, not
venturing into the mountains, because it was much easier to move cattle on the
flatlands. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Story" target="_blank">Nelson Story</a> certainly used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman_Trail" target="_blank">Bozeman Trail</a>
to bring cattle from Texas to Bozeman, which is west into the mountains. And
one trail shown on the <span><a href="http://nps.gov/hfc/carto/RELIEFS/GRKOrelief3_c.jpg" target="_blank">nps.gov/hfc/carto/RELIEFS/GRKOrelief3_c.jpg</a></span>
map, the 1870-78 Kohrs Trail, also moves west into the mountains, but
apparently this was only used by <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Kohrs" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Kohrs</a></span>
to move cattle to his ranch at Deer Lodge, which is west of Helena and Butte
and is not in the pin-pen merger area. In any case, these movements may partly
explain why the pin-pen line bends west of the <b><span>western edge of the Great Plains </span></b>line
to encompass all of Wyoming and parts of Idaho. <i><span>Adj.
2-May-2018</span></i></p><p>This doesnít quite explain why the pin-pen merger also
reached the Salt Lake City area, which was solidly Mormon throughout this
period and would not seem to have had much settlement by Texas cattle drivers.
Contributor Trevan Richins suggested the following: ´I think the answer is
because of the Mormon missionary program and their desire to ìgather in
Zionî.<span>† </span>Up until the turn of the century
(1900), almost all converted Mormons would move to Utah.<span>† </span>In the 1870 census, it showed that 1 in 3 <span>Utahns</span> were born outside of the United
States.<span>† </span>There was an extensive
missionary program at that time to convert people from all of the United
States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere.<span>†
</span>So, the pin/pen probably reached Utah on the tongues of Southern
converts.ª Seems reasonableÖ <i><span>Adj. 14-Sep.-2017</span></i></p><p>In addition to these two major influences, there are several
additional areas for the pin-pen merger. One, which is no surprise, is that
there is a small area of pin-pen merger that spreads west from the tail end of
the Southern area. This seems to reach as far west as Arizona, but does not
reach California. This area was settled by a mixed population even before the
Civil War, but these included a large proportion of <span>southerners,</span> and during the Civil war the southern half of what
became Arizona and New Mexico seceded from the Union, as discussed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Arizona" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article on Traditional Arizona</a>.<i><span> 29-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p>Another very interesting area is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley" target="_blank">San
Joaquin Valley in California</a>, which apparently adopted the <a href="#Note1_PinPenMerger">pin-pen merger</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">Great
Depression</a>, as a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okie" target="_blank">over a million ìOkiesî</a> who moved there in the 1930ís. The <a href="#Note1_PinPenMerger">ANAE</a> had marked just Bakersfield as ìpinî=ìpenî,
but the merger appears to cover the entire valley. However, obviously older
speakers do not have it: contributor James Divine, who grew up mostly around
Fresno, and was born in the mid 1940ís, has <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî</span>.
(I had previously thought that this merger also extended north to include parts
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Valley" target="_blank">Sacramento
Valley</a> as well, which is the northern part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Central_Valley" target="_blank">Californiaís
Central Valley</a>, but contributor Jon, a native of Sacramento, assures me
that in Sacramento <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî</span>).<i><span> 20-May-2011</span></i></p><p>My wife and I are from
Nebraska. She was born in Omaha and I was born in Lincoln. More than once Iíve
asked her to ìhand me that penî and she replies ìThe pen or the pin?î Iíve
tried to convince her that there is no difference in the pronunciation: of
course, I donít hear it. I was pretty amused to learn that we speak different
sub-dialects.<i><span> 14-Feb.-2011</span></i></p><p>The Greater New York City dialect is the second most unusual
dialect in all of North America (after New Orleans). It has many unusual
features, and, more than any other city, New York seems to have historically
shown great variation by social class, which is why I give so many audio
examples. The following descriptions explain the classes marked in the chart
with **:<i><span> 10-May-2011</span></i></p><p>The classic working class dialect has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_diphthongs#Coil-curl_merger" target="_blank">ìcurlî=ìcoilî</a>, and ìdeseî and ìdoseî; the latter is still
heard in the modern working class dialect. Bennett Cerf and Humphrey Bogart are
classic middle class, and have ìcurlî=ìcoilî, but not ìdeseî and ìdoseî. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_diphthongs#Coil-curl_merger" target="_blank">curl-coil merger has nearly died out, according to William
Labov</a>, though there are plenty of well-known examples in recent history.
Actually, it hasnít completely died out! I have recently found two clips of
people from Greater New York City who <span>do</span>
still retain the curl-coil merger, <a href="#Au_New_Jersey">Tommy DeVito</a>
and <a href="#Tollefson">Skip Tollefson</a>. And even Regis Philbin still seems
to use the old pronunciation of the ìcurlî/îcoilî vowel in a few words, like
ìcircusî in his video clip.<i><span> 3-Mar.-2011</span></i></p><p><a name="MidAtlantic"></a>Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy
Roosevelt both speak what is sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_English" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic
English</a>, (quite distinct from what the <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch17_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE chapter 17</a> calls Mid-Atlantic, which I am calling
Atlantic Midland). According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_English" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article</a>, Teddy speaks more ìnaturallyî than Franklin, but structurally I
see little difference between their dialects. They do not seem to have the
had-bad distinction of Greater New York City, reflecting instead the British
15-vowel system. Eleanor Roosevelt, Teddyís niece and Franklinís wife, went to
an even greater extreme, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rDoS7XErcw " target="_blank">spoke
almost pure Standard British English</a>. (She was raised mostly in the U.S.,
but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_roosevelt" target="_blank">was
educated with private tutors, and went to finishing school in England</a>.)
Another sample, that of Doris ìGranny Dî Haddock, shows the Eastern New England
variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_English" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic English</a>, with only the 14 vowels of Eastern
New England.<i><span> 14-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p><span>The <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch17_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><u><span>ANAE chapter 17</span></u></span></span></a> says</span>
that ìOne of the most startling facts about New York City is the narrow extent
of its influence in the surrounding area,î and that its boundary ìhas remained
fixed for more than two centuries... This geographic restriction appears to be
associated with the negative prestige of the New York City vernacular...î In
other words, everybody thinks the New York City dialect is really weird, even
though we are all fascinated with it!</p><p>The differences are of class, not section of town, according
to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/11/14/051114ta_talk_seabrook" target="_blank">William Labov</a>: <span>The <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch17_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><u><span>ANAE chapter 17</span></u></span></span></a> says</span>
ìWithin this metropolitan linguistic area, there is no reliable evidence for
geographic differentiation. The stereotype Brooklynese is used to refer to
working-class GNYC speech, whether the speaker is a resident of Brooklyn,
Queens, the Lower East Side of Manhattan, or Jersey City. Many members of the
public are convinced that they can recognize a Queens or Bronx or Jersey
accent, but it appears that these geographic labels are in fact labels for
perceived social class differences.î</p><p>Though its influence on the surrounding area has been
limited, it has had a lot of effect on the speech of <a href="#Dialects_Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> and of <a href="#NewOrleans">New
Orleans</a> (see the <b><a href="http://aschmann.net/AmEng/Data-InternetMyDomainWebPageAmEngî l" target="_blank">Dialect Description Chart</a></b>), and shares the short-a
split with the Atlantic Midland region.</p><p>The various dialects of New Orleans make it the most unusual
dialect situation in all of North America. Some neighborhoods speak <a href="#Classical_Southern">Classical Southern</a>, and other neighborhoods speak
a dialect which doesnít sound Southern at all, but instead sounds exactly like
Greater New York City until you listen for a while, and others are somewhere in
between. I have taken <a href="#Au_Louisiana">several dialect samples</a> from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFDNTo4DNg" target="_blank">this clip</a>
from the ìYEAH, YOU RITEî documentary. This clip is a dialect studentís dream,
and explains in some detail the dialect situation in New Orleans. I used four
samples from this clip because it was clear what neighborhood of New Orleans
they were each from, and now I have tentatively added the guy on the park
bench. I would have used more, but it was impossible to determine what part of
town the other speakers were from, or else they had too much General American
to be a useful sample.<i><span> 17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p><p>The entire documentary does not seem to be available on the
Internet, except for purchase. I did, however, find a <a href="http://www.cnam.com/downloads/yyr_ts.html" target="_blank">transcript</a>,
which helped a bit in identifying speakers.<i><span>
14-Jan.-2011</span></i></p><p>New Orleans seems to be the only city in North America that
has <span>more than one distinct dialect</span>.<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[56]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
In this respect it is like London of the early 1900ís, as is implied by the
speaker on the park bench who refers to <span>ìíEnry
íIggins</span> or Higginsî, the dialect expert in the movie <i>My Fair Lady</i>. This fact, explained in
some detail by several of the speakers in the ì<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFDNTo4DNg" target="_blank">YEAH, YOU
RITE</a>î documentary, seems to have been missed by the <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch18_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE (Ch. 18)</a> (see pages 259 and following), since they
treat the city as a whole in their descriptions.<i><span>
17-Dec.-2015</span></i></p><p>Thanks to samples that many of you sent in, and others that
I have found, I now have a much clearer picture of the New Orleans
neighborhoods and their dialects. Even so, I would still like to know who the
guy on the park bench is, and where exactly he grew up. (Contributor Charles
Meeks cited below has at least confirmed that he is evidently <span>Uptown,</span> so I added him tentatively to the map.)
<i><span>11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p>Actually, my biggest question now is about what I am calling
the Downtown New Orleans dialect, the only New Orleans dialect with no Southern
features at all (most importantly, all of her long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> vowels are <span>[a…™]</span>, making her not <a href="#Southern">Southern</a> by
the definition we are using here), and which I have listed under the Greater
New York City dialect. I only have one sample for this, Deborah Chauvin, which
is very short, and the transcript suggests that this is the only time she
speaks, even in the full documentary. Every other New Orleans sample I have
found has at least some long <span>/<b>ƒ´</b>/</span> vowels reduced to <span>[a]</span>, which
reduces my Downtown New Orleans dialect to just the Ninth Ward. Is this valid?
For now I will continue to assume that it is, but I need more data to confirm
this. <i><span>11-Mar.-2016</span></i></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_of_New_Orleans" target="_blank">Wards</a>: It is not uncommon for New Orleanians to identify
where they are from by their ward number, and several of the speakers do so.
These are not neighborhoods, but voting wards, and seem to radiate away from
the Mississippi River in long strips. <span>For a map
of the wards see: <a href="https://veera.app/index_collection/wards.pdf" target="_blank">wards.pdf</a>.</span>
(This map was originally at <a href="http://www.louisianarebuilds.info/files/wards.pdf" target="_blank">www.louisianarebuilds.info/files/wards.pdf</a>,
but this link is no longer valid.) <i><span>26-Jan.-201<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>Where do they speak without an accent? Or where do they
speak ìGeneral Americanî?</p><p>This question implies that there is an accepted standard of
spoken American English which is perceived as not having any strictly regional
features. In other words, any features which are distinctly northern, southern,
eastern or western would be excluded. And indeed there is such a standard, used
by most radio and television news staff throughout the U.S. Applying such a
definition rigorously leaves us with the orange striped areas on the map, in
parts of the Central Midland and South Florida, and the southern fringe of the
North. Applying a slightly less rigorous definition would also include some
neighboring areas on the map, although these all have some noticeable regional
features. For instance, San Francisco and East Midland both sound just a little
bit too eastern, areas below the pin-pen line sound just a bit southern, etc.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article on General American</a> covers the question fairly well, and in some
detail, and I recommend reading it. The area mapped in that article covers the
same general area in the Midwest as mine, but I would not include all of the
cities included there.</p><p>The Canadian standard dialect is obviously distinct from the
American one, and corresponds to what is spoken in most of Canada, excluding
the Atlantic Provinces. The dialect of eastern Ontario or of most of British
Columbia would probably be considered more standard than the Prairie Provinces
and western Ontario, since these are above the bite-bout line, as shown on the
map.<i><span> 15-Aug.-2015</span></i></p><p>Obviously there are many differences in pronunciation
details between Canadian and American English, as explained in the description
of the Canadian dialects in the <a href="#DialectDescriptionChart">Dialect
Description Chart</a>, but most of these are not structural details affecting
how many distinct sounds (phonemes) the dialects have. However, there is one
very important difference between ìGeneral Americanî and ìGeneral Canadianî,
and that is the <span><a href="#CotCaughtMerger">Cot-Caught Merger</a></span>: ìGeneral Americanî makes
the distinction, whereas no Canadian dialect does. People from California might
disagree with me, claiming that their dialect is as ìGeneral Americanî as any,

it is that they were settled very rapidly during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills#History" target="_blank">1875-1878

most densely populated part of Dakota Territory. This gold rush also probably
pushed the eastern edge of <span>the West</span> dialect farther east to include it, so it is more
similar to areas much farther west than it is to those that are closer. <i><span>Adj. 5-Oct.-2017</span></i></p><p>The <b><span>Appalachian

For a long time I have been saying that this marks the border between the South
and the Midland for much of Kentucky, but it really doesnít! In fact, the line
follows the river very little, spending most of its time north of it, but
dipping south of it near Cincinnati. <a href="#LarryBird">Larry Bird</a>, the
Hick from French Lick finally did that notion in! (Thatís really his nickname,
I didnít make it up!) Even so, there still seem to be a few stretches where it
follows the river. How much of this was due to geography (it was easier for
settlers to stay on their own side of the river as they went west), and how
much was due to politics (slavery was only allowed on the south side of the
river) is unclear. Probably mostly the latter, since the line only dips south
of the river once.<i><span> 17-Apr.-2013</span></i></p><p>The <b><span>Cumberland Gap</span></b>:
According to <a href="#InlandSouthOrigin">my origin theory</a>, this was the
area where Inland South originated and spread.<i><span>

and the Erie Canal</span></b>: The North dialect, and its central subdialect
the Inland North were largely spread westward by way of these two waterways, as
discussed in <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch14_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE Ch. 14, pp. 212-213</a>. This partially explains the
strange hourglass shape of the Inland North subdialect, since all of the
settlement came by boat to Buffalo and then continued up Lake Erie. (Originally
the hourglass did not have quite so tight a waist, since originally Erie,
Pennsylvania and probably also Ashtabula and Painesville, Ohio were part of the
Inland North, as explained in <span><a href="#BorderFeatures">Shared Features Across the U.S. - Canada Border</a></span>.)<i><span> 11-Feb.-2011</span></i></p><p>I have also included a few geographical features which do
not seem to have any correlation with dialect features:</p><p>The <b><span>Sacramento
River</span></b>: Unlike the San Joaquin River above, this does not seem to
have any special features.<i><span> 28-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p>The <b><span>Mississippi
River</span></b>: In spite of being the greatest river in the U.S., and forming
state boundaries for almost its entire course, it has had absolutely no effect
on dialect patterns! Of course, it stood perpendicular to the entire western
settlement flow, so people had no alternative but to find a way across!</p><p>The <b><span>Tennessee </span></b>and<b><span> Cumberland
Rivers</span></b>: (Not labeled for reasons of space.) These rivers run mostly
through rugged mountains or broken plateau country, and for the most part do not
have a wide flood plain suitable for plantation agriculture, required,
according to <a href="#TheoryOfSettlement">my settlement theory</a>, for the
spread of Lowland Southern. The only areas that do are the middle section of
the Cumberland River, centered on Nashville, one section of the Tennessee River
in Alabama, and the small area around Chattanooga.<i><span>
23-Sep.-2015</span></i></p><p>No, they donít! From the map it is clear that the dialect
boundaries totally <span>ignore state and provincial borders</span>,
except for a very few exceptions. One of the few places where a dialect
boundary does seem to follow a state boundary is certain sections of the
northern border of Kentucky, which also mark the northern border of the South.
However, even in this case it is not the state border that is being following
but a geographical feature, the Ohio River, and even then the line doesnít
follow it all that much. <i><span>4-Sep.-2012</span></i></p><p>In spite of this, one often hears people refer to a ìTexas
accentî (there are really three, just considering the blue and red lines!), or
a ìMassachusetts accentî (there are really four!). In fact, there isnít a
single dialect area on this map that could be described as a ìstate dialectî:
they are all either significantly larger or smaller than a state!<i><span> 17-Aug.-2010</span></i></p><p>As for which state has the most distinct dialect areas
(defined by the blue and red lines), the winner appears to be Pennsylvania,
with five dialect areas, though Louisiana may also have five, depending on how
New Orleans is treated.<i><span> 17-Aug.-2010</span></i></p><p>The runners up, with four, are: Illinois, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Nebraska, and Ohio, and possibly also Maryland and New York
(data is lacking for the latter two). It could also be argued that West
Virginia has four, since in all other cases I have treated the loss of a vowel
phoneme as grounds for defining a new dialect, but I am hesitant to introduce a
new dialect on these grounds alone, ìAllegheny Lowland Southernî, since this
phoneme loss here may be viewed as a minor spillover from up north.<i><span> 23-Mar.-2011</span></i></p><p><a name="CanadaBorder"></a>The U.S. - Canada Border and the
ìBadge of Identityî</p><p>How about the national border between Canada and United
States? This is a different story, and in fact this border is also the southern
boundary of the Canadian dialect for its entire length. This dialectís notable
characteristic is the ìCanadian raisingî of the vowels in words like ìoutî and
ìhouseî (where the vowel is followed by a voiceless consonant), but not in
ìloudî and ìnowî. This feature appears to be viewed by Canadians as a sort of <span>badge of identity</span>, and defines the border rather
clearly! Granted, it also occurs in the Tidewater South, but since this is far
from the Canadian border, and since their dialect bears no other resemblance to
Canadian English, it doesnít matter! <i><span>Adj.
4-Oct.-2017</span></i></p><p>I suspect that historically the retention of this <span>badge of identity</span> has been to some degree conscious
and intentional: It is important for Canadians to counter the idea that many
Americans have that ìCanadians are really just like usî, and to have some kind
of distinct identity. I really like <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau" target="_blank">Pierre
Trudeau</a>ís famous quote: ìLiving next to you is in some ways like sleeping
with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I
can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and gruntî.<i><span> 15-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p>However, this doesnít fully explain the situation. At least
two Canadian contributors have written in and begged to differ with this
analysis, saying that the vast majority of Canadians are totally unaware of how
they pronounce things, and are certainly not consciously putting on the
Canadian raising as a kind of affectation. And of course they are absolutely
right! The vast majority of speakers of any language are totally unaware of the
fine detail of their pronunciation system, and most Americans and Canadians
cannot tell what side of the border someone is from simply by their
pronunciation. So why hasnít this feature seeped across the border to the U.S.
side at any point? Other features have crossed the border freely, as the <a href="#BorderFeatures">next section</a> shows, but this one has not. Well, part
of the explanation may be that a small percentage of people <i>are</i> able to discern features like
Canadian <span>raising</span>, and perhaps some of
these people, perhaps on both sides of the border, have lit on this particular
feature as being a <span>badge of identity</span> for
Canadians, and have helped keep it from crossing the border. So maybe itís as
much the Americans as the Canadians who have kept it a Canadian feature!<i><span> 6-Sep.-2011</span></i></p><p>On the other hand, at least one section of Canada, southern
British Columbia, was evidently settled mostly by Americans or Europeans, with
little direct immigration from previously settled areas of Canada, since the
center of the country was still largely unpopulated, as discussed in the <a href="#Geographic">ì<span>Do some geographic
features coincide with dialect boundaries or areas?î</span></a> <span>section under the discussion of the bite-bout line.</span>
And yet all of these settlers adopted the Canadian raising, and the line
follows the U.S.-Canadian border all the way to the Pacific. Why did this
happen unless at least some people felt that this was a <span>badge of identity</span> for Canadians?<i><span>
15-Apr.-2011</span></i></p><p>However, there is <span>one exception</span>
to this rule about Canadian raising and the national border: Newfoundland and
Labrador do not have Canadian <span>raising</span>.
Again, since they are nowhere near the national border, in a way this doesnít
matter, but it is unexpected, given how solid the feature is throughout the
rest of Canada and even in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English#Maritimes" target="_blank">Maritimes</a>!
However, contributor Bob Goudreau has pointed out that there is really a simple
explanation that actually bolsters my badge of identity theory: ìThe province
of Newfoundland and Labrador did not even join Canada until 1949. ëNewfiesí
would have had no reason to sound self-consciously Canadian, because they were
NOT Canadian until then (just a British colony a la Bermuda, etc.).î Cool.
(Parts of Baffin Island also seem to follow the Newfoundland / Labrador accent,
as can be seen by the various lines in this area. This presumably resulted from
greater influence from this area than other parts of Nunavut.) <i><span>Adj. 2-Oct.-2017</span></i></p><p>For a while I had thought that there was a second exception,
because I thought I had found an area in Southeastern Quebec where Canadian
raising did not apply, specifically the cities of Montreal and Sherbrooke.
However, the samples I had selected were ethnic French speakers, and even though
their English showed no trace of a French accent, Chris Harvey says that ethnic
French speakers are not the best samples of the native English Montreal accent.
Check out the <a href="#Au_Quebec">two samples</a> I have now included for
Montreal. It seems my entire idea was wrong that, because the Stanstead area
was settled by Americans, they would still speak like Americans rather than
Canadians. Chris Harvey assures me that they do not. Apparently the <a href="#CanadaBorder"><span>ìBadge of
Identityî</span></a> applies here, too! However, I am still looking for good
sound samples for Sherbrooke and Stanstead. Please send me some if you have
them!<i><span> 17-July-2010<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>Because native French speakers do not typically have the
Canadian raising, I have now explicitly shown the pink Canadian-raising line as
excluding the French-speaking area in Canada. (Earlier I had simply not shown
it in this area, but the result was confusing even to me, so I put it in.) <i><span>Adj. 4-Oct.-2017</span></i></p><p>This is not to say that this is the only feature that
distinguishes Canadian from American English: The Canadian shift, discussed in
detail in <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch14_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE Ch. 14</a>, affects many Canadian vowels. However, the
Canadian raising is what most people tend to notice, which is why I think that
it has become the <span>badge of identity</span>.<i><span> 29-Dec.-2010<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p>Read the next section for more insight on this question.<i><span> 15-Apr.-2011<o:p></o:p></span></i></p><p><span>Shared Features <span>Across</span> the U.S. - Canada Border<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>Another thing that suggests that Canadian raising is a <span>badge of identity</span> is that plenty of other dialect
features cross the border freely. If we look at the map we see that in the west
several dialect feature lines cross the border, in particular the bite-bout
line, making parts of British Columbia sound more like the neighboring
Americans than the neighboring Canadians, except of course that they do have
the Canadian raising. In the Great Lakes area the bite-bout line again crosses
the border three times, making Windsor similar to its neighbor Detroit in only
this one feature, and farther north making the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie
share this feature as well, but on the other side of the line.</p><p>But of course the big thing shared by Canadians with many
Americans, in both the east and west, is the cot-caught merger. In fact, this
feature is shared along the western two-thirds of the border, and it seems
almost certain, simply by a quick look at the map, that the North Central
dialect borrowed this feature from Canada, since this is the only feature that
distinguishes North Central from the North. How much the West derived this
feature from Canada is uncertain, but it must have been significant, since they
not only share this feature, but also the fronting of the long <span>/<b>≈ç≈ç</b>/</span><span> </span><span>[u]</span> vowel.</p><p>In the east there are two areas along the border where this
feature is shared across the border. Obviously the border shared by the
Maritimes and Quebec with New England is one of them, and it is extremely
probable that this feature was shared across this border very early in the
history of the two nations, or even before they split into two nations in 1776!
The other area is Lake Erie, where there are a line of cities on the American
side that have the cot-caught merger. Was this due to Canadian influence? It
would seem unlikely, except that another dialect feature crosses into Canada at
this same point: one of the <span><a href="#Note2_LongOFronting">long o fronting</a></span> <span>lines of dots (the pink ones)</span>, and another dialect line is split
at this point, the bite-bout line. So who knows? On the other hand, the <a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch14_2nd.rev.pdf" target="_blank">ANAE Ch. 14, pp. 203-206</a> suggests that there was no such
influence, since the city of Erie, Pennsylvania was originally part of the
Inland North (and presumably Ashtabula and Painesville were also, though these
are not mentioned in the ANAE), and only later became Allegheny Midland.
Because of this I have not shown the cot-caught line crossing Lake Erie. <i><span>12-Mar.-2013<span><o:p></o:p></span></span></i></p><p>However, even with various features crossing the border,
this does not mean that towns on opposite sides of the border will sound
particularly similar. As mentioned above, Windsor and Detroit sound extremely
different, sharing only one important feature. But even towns sharing more
features donít really sound that close: Tammy Faye Bakker Messner from
International Falls, Minnesota, and Duncan Keith from across the river in Fort
Frances, Ontario pronounce their <span>/<b>≈ç</b>/</span> <span>[o]</span> vowels the same, and also
their <span>/<b>ou</b>/</span>
<span>[…ë ä]</span> vowels in words like ìdownî, but many of
their other vowels are very different. The fact that they are neighboring towns
in a remote area doesnít seem to matter: one is American and the other
Canadian, and that matters more! <i><span>8-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>The information in most of these layers is described in the
legends on the map and elsewhere on this site.</p><p>You can make each layer visible or invisible by clicking the
checkmark for that layer in the Layers window. You should usually keep layers
1, 2, 3, 13, and 15 visible (those outlined in <span>red </span>below),
except when you really want to see something without the clutter. However, even
then you should leave level 1 visible, because otherwise you get <span>a weird</span> cross-hatching which is the ìinvisible
colorî. Level 10 (outlined in <span>blue</span>) is the most
important data on the map, but it can be made visible or not depending on
whether you want the main dialect lines <i>over</i> or <i>under</i> the other
lines, since all of the data in level 10 is also included in level 2. This data
can only be made completely invisible by making both layer 2 and layer 10
invisible. <i><span>12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>(Oops, I only recently, 20-Oct.-2016, realized that I had
swapped the order of layers 10 and 11 on the map, though the intended order was
correct in the chart above. I donít know how long I had it wrong. I have now
adjusted these.) <i><span>20-Oct.-2016</span></i></p><p>I am a professional linguist and a Christian missionary,
working in indigenous Amerindian languages. My work has nothing to do with
English, so that is why this project is just a hobby.</p><p>A few readers have asked where I am from, and what dialect I
speak. Actually, I am the total opposite of the kind of people I am looking for
<span>for</span> the sound samples on my map: They
have each been born and raised in one specific place in the U.S. or Canada. I
was born in Mexico City, the son of Christian missionaries, and moved back and
forth between Mexico and various places in the U.S. throughout my childhood,
spending most of my time in the U.S. in the Oklahoma City area. My parents met
in Mexico.<i><span> 6-Nov.-2015</span></i></p><p>My father was born and raised in Port Chester, New York. He
spoke a number of different languages. He did not have a Port Chester accent
(Eastern North; check out the two <a href="#PortChesterNY">sound samples</a> I
have listed), but instead spoke essentially General American, the one relic of
his Eastern North upbringing being that he distinguished words like ìmerryî <span>/<b><u>mƒïr</u></b>ƒì/</span>
<span>[Ààm…õ…πi]</span> and ìmarryî <span>/<b><u>mƒÉr</u></b>ƒì/</span> <span>[ÀàmÊ…πi]</span>.</p><p>My mother had an even more interesting background. She was
born in Sydney, Australia, of parents who emigrated there from Scotland. When
she was 10, the family moved to Berkeley, California. When she arrived, she had
a strong Australian accent, but due to the ridicule of her peers, she quickly adopted
a Bay Area accent, and sounded thoroughly American for the rest of her life.
However, the Australian system had apparently established itself in her
subconscious, because after I got interested in English dialects, I asked her
if the words ìfatherî and ìbotherî rhymed for her (see <a href="#FatherBother">The
Father-Bother Distinction</a><b> </b>above).
She said, ìOh, no, they are quite different!î <span>ìReally?î</span>
I said. ìSay them for me.î And when she said them, they both had the very same
vowel, rhyming perfectly, following the Bay Area pattern. But they still <i>felt</i> different to her, because in her
childhood she had pronounced them with very different vowels, and that phonemic
system was apparently still there, though covered up by a Bay Area surface
system. She also clearly distinguished ìmerryî and ìmarryî, which is not a Bay
Area feature, but evidently a remnant of her Australian childhood. She also
rhymed ìonî with ìDonî, which matches both Berkeley and Australia. (For other
cases in which a phonemic system can be fixed by the age of 10, see the
footnote for <a href="#Au_North_Dakota">John Hoeven</a>).<i><span> 12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p><p>So, what accent do I have? I turns out that I speak fairly
pure General American, probably because all of my schooling was in English in
an American style school, even when I lived in Mexico. For the most part I
donít follow my parentsí speech patterns. For instance, they both distinguish
ìmerryî and ìmarryî, and I do not. Specifically, in my dialect <span>ìcotî‚â†ìcaughtî</span> (with a clear Central Midland
pattern, not the raised <span>/<b>Ù</b>/</span> <span>[o…ô]</span> of the northeastern
U.S.), <span>ìpinî‚â†ìpenî</span>, and ìonî rhymes
with ìDonî. Even though I spent seven years in the Oklahoma City/Norman area
between the ages of 7 and 18, I didnít pick up any influence there, since in
this area ìpinî=ìpenî and ìonî rhymes with ìDawnî.<i><span>
8-June-2011</span></i></p><p>The one area in which I seem to have followed my parents,
and differ from most Americans, is that I donít pronounce the ìlî in ìcalmî or
ìyolkî or ìtalkî (see <a href="#PronunciationOfAlm">The Pronunciation of <span>ì-almî and ì-olkî and ì-alkî</span></a>).<i><span> 8-June-2011</span></i></p><p>So what area matches my dialect? No area matches my dialect
exactly, though the closest seems to be South Florida, especially the southern
part below the ìonî line, though I think my native pronunciation of the <span>long </span><span>/<b>≈ç</b>/</span><span> </span><span>[o ä]</span> vowel is a bit more backed, and
I donít know yet how South Florida handles the words in <a href="#PronunciationOfAlm">The Pronunciation of <span>ì-almî
and ì-olkî and ì-alkî</span></a>). (I had previously thought that Canton, Ohio
was also a close match, but it has a strongly raised ìbatî vowel, whereas I do
not.) I suspect that many others who moved constantly in their youth, such as
ìarmy bratsî or missionary kids like me, will have a similar pattern, which
could be called something like ì<span>Transient General
American</span>î. (South Florida was populated by transients, especially the
southern half, so the fact that it has this dialect should not be surprising.)
On the other hand, most people who grow up in those Central Midland areas which
have a General American accent as their native dialect normally rhyme ìonî with
ìDawnî, not ìDonî.<i><span> 12-Aug.-2014</span></i></p></div>
