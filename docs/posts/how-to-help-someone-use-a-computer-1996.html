    <h1>How to help someone use a computer (1996)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p> Nobody is born knowing this stuff.

</p><p> You&#39;ve forgotten what it&#39;s like to be a beginner.

</p><p> If it&#39;s not obvious to them, it&#39;s not obvious.

</p><p> A computer is a means to an end.  The person you&#39;re helping
probably cares mostly about the end.  This is reasonable.

</p><p> Their knowledge of the computer is grounded in what they
can do and see -- &#34;when I do this, it does that&#34;.  They need
to develop a deeper understanding, but this can only happen
slowly -- and not through abstract theory but through the real,
concrete situations they encounter in their work.

</p><p> Beginners face a language problem: they can&#39;t ask questions
because they don&#39;t know what the words mean, they can&#39;t know what
the words mean until they can successfully use the system, and
they can&#39;t successfully use the system because they can&#39;t ask
questions.

</p><p> You are the voice of authority.  Your words can wound.

</p><p> Computers often present their users with textual messages, but
the users often don&#39;t read them.

</p><p> By the time they ask you for help, they&#39;ve probably tried
several things.  As a result, their computer might be in a strange
state.  This is natural.

</p><p> They might be afraid that you&#39;re going to blame them for the
problem.

</p><p> The best way to learn is through apprenticeship -- that is,
by doing some real task together with someone who has a different
set of skills.

</p><p> Your primary goal is not to solve their problem.  Your primary
goal is to help them become one notch more capable of solving
their problem on their own.  So it&#39;s okay if they take notes.

</p><p> Most user interfaces are terrible.  When people make mistakes
it&#39;s usually the fault of the interface.  You&#39;ve forgotten how
many ways you&#39;ve learned to adapt to bad interfaces.

</p><p> Knowledge lives in communities, not individuals.  A computer
user who&#39;s part of a community of computer users will have an
easier time than one who isn&#39;t.

</p></div><div>

<p> Don&#39;t take the keyboard.  Let them do all the typing, even
if it&#39;s slower that way, and even if you have to point them
to every key they need to type.  That&#39;s the only way they&#39;re going
to learn from the interaction.

</p><p> Find out what they&#39;re really trying to do.  Is there another
way to go about it?

</p><p> Maybe they can&#39;t tell you what they&#39;ve done or what happened.
In this case you can ask them what they are trying to do and say,
&#34;Show me how you do that&#34;.

</p><p> Attend to the symbolism of the interaction.  Try to squat down
so your eyes are just below the level of theirs.  When they&#39;re
looking at the computer, look at the computer.  When they&#39;re
looking at you, look back at them.

</p><p> When they do something wrong, don&#39;t say &#34;no&#34; or &#34;that&#39;s wrong&#34;.
They&#39;ll often respond by doing something else that&#39;s wrong.  Instead,
just tell them what to do and why.

</p><p> Try not to ask yes-or-no questions.  Nobody wants to look foolish,
so their answer is likely to be a guess.  &#34;Did you attach to the file
server?&#34; will get you less information than &#34;What did you do after you
turned the computer on?&#34;.

</p><p> Explain your thinking.  Don&#39;t make it mysterious.  If something
is true, show them how they can see it&#39;s true.  When you don&#39;t know,
say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  When you&#39;re guessing, say &#34;let&#39;s try ... because
...&#34;.  Resist the temptation to appear all-knowing.  Help them learn
to think the problem through.

</p><p> Be aware of how abstract your language is.  &#34;Get into the editor&#34;
is abstract and &#34;press this key&#34; is concrete.  Don&#39;t say anything
unless you intend for them to understand it.  Keep adjusting your
language downward towards concrete units until they start to get it,
then slowly adjust back up towards greater abstraction so long as
they&#39;re following you.  When formulating a take-home lesson (&#34;when it
does this and that, you should try such-and-such&#34;), check once again
that you&#39;re using language of the right degree of abstraction for this
user right now.

</p><p> Tell them to really read the messages, such as errors, that the
computer generates.

</p><p> Whenever they start to blame themselves, respond by blaming the
computer.  Then keep on blaming the computer, no matter how many times
it takes, in a calm, authoritative tone of voice.  If you need to
show off, show off your ability to criticize bad design.  When they
get nailed by a false assumption about the computer&#39;s behavior, tell
them their assumption was reasonable.  Tell *yourself* that it was
reasonable.

</p><p> Take a long-term view.  Who do users in this community get help
from?  If you focus on building that person&#39;s skills, the skills
will diffuse to everyone else.

</p><p> Never do something for someone that they are capable of doing
for themselves.

</p><p> Don&#39;t say &#34;it&#39;s in the manual&#34;.  (You knew that.)
