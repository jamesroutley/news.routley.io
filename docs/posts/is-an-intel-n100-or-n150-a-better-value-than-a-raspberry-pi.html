<p>About one year ago, I bought an Intel N100 mini PC (specifically the <a href="https://amzn.to/41EtTMk">GMKtec N100 NucBox G3</a>) and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">compared it to the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, and we have <a href="https://amzn.to/41gFu2O">a newer $159 16GB version of that mini PC</a> with a slightly-faster Intel N150, and a new <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/who-would-buy-raspberry-pi-120">16GB Raspberry Pi 5</a>.</p>

<p>I re-ran all my benchmarks, and <em>this time</em> compared like-for-like, installing Linux on the Mini PC. Many people argued comparing the OOTB experience running Windows 11 Pro (which came on the Tiny PC) to Raspberry Pi OS (which I installed on the Raspberry Pi 5) was unfair.</p>

<p>I have a video that goes through everything in this post, embedded below:</p>

<h2>N100 PCs are not created equal</h2>

<p>In the video, I ran through four myths to test whether they hold waterâ€”one of the most difficult to assess is whether the N100 is <em>faster</em> and <em>more efficient</em> than a Pi 5.</p>

<p>Because unlike the Pi, an N100 (or the newer N150) is just the SoC used on dozens (maybe <em>hundreds</em> now?) of boards, from prebuilt Tiny PCs to full-on motherboards. Manufacturers pair the SoC with different types of RAM, IO, and cooling options.</p>

<p>All that to say, if you&#39;re comparing an N100 paired with slow DDR4 RAM and a weak laptop fan to one running fast DDR5 RAM with a huge desktop CPU cooler, you&#39;re going to have a pretty different experience.</p>

<p>But even the slower DDR4-based systems beat the Pi 5 in raw performance, in my testing. <em>How much</em> depends a lot on the thermals and power limits.</p>

<p>On the NucBox G3, with DDR4 RAM and some thermal constraints which required me to pop the top off and place a fan over the back side of the main board, it was between 1.5-2x faster than a Pi 5, depending on the benchmark.</p>

<p>For example, High Performance Linpack saw almost double the performance:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/nucbox-g3-plus-n150-pi-5-hpl-benchmark.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-70107755-5244-42ad-8ce2-003efeeef77b" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;70107755-5244-42ad-8ce2-003efeeef77b&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Intel N150 NucBox G3 Plus versus Pi 5 Benchmark - HPL"/></p>

<p>But note the <em>efficiency</em> scores. Despite the N150 using &#39;Intel 7&#39; (a 10 nm process node), it gets less work done per watt than the Pi 5 (whose Arm BCM2712 chip uses a 16nm process). So the maxim of &#34;better process node == better efficiency&#34; does <em>not</em> apply universally (not to mention comparing different process nodes is a fun experiment these days, because 1nm can mean a lot of different things!).</p>

<p>Architecture, feature sets, and chip design still matters.</p>

<p>I have <em>all</em> the dozens of benchmark results (and a log of the full process getting them) for both computers on my <a href="https://sbc-reviews.jeffgeerling.com">SBC Reviews website</a>.</p>

<h2>Used Tiny PCs are Cheaper</h2>

<p>In news that should be obvious to anyone who thinks about it for more than half a second: <em>used Tiny PCs are cheaper</em>. Cheaper than both new fully-kitted-out Raspberry Pi 5s, and cheaper than new Tiny PCs.</p>

<p>Because of the massive quantity of leased Tiny/Mini/Micro PCs for business use (every doctor&#39;s office and hospital on the planet seems to have a dozen), there&#39;s a constant churn of 3-5 year old models, and many end up on eBay.</p>

<p>I acquired a couple old Lenovos this way, with 7th and 8th-gen Intel CPUs. Even though they burn a few more watts at idle, they&#39;re an excellent deal if you just need a little PC to run something in a homelab, or for a lightweight desktop.</p>

<p>They usually have more expansion options than a cheap Tiny PC or Pi have.</p>

<p>But newsflash: <em>used is different than new</em>. Just like used gaming consoles are cheaper than new ones... you can&#39;t say &#34;Tiny PCs are cheaper than Raspberry Pis&#34; based on <em>used</em> pricing versus <em>new</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s enough to say Tiny PCs are cheaper than Raspberry Pis if comparing <em>like for like</em> specs on <em>new</em> machines:</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 16 GB model, with 512 GB of SSD storage, Raspberry Pi&#39;s NVMe HAT, an Active Cooler, an RTC battery, a 27W power adapter, and a rubber bumper case, costs $208, compared to the similarly-specced GMKtec NucBox G3 Plus.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-pricing-208.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-e6059e7e-05ce-43e6-91c4-5aa14c114c15" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;e6059e7e-05ce-43e6-91c4-5aa14c114c15&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 16 GB full system pricing"/></p>

<p>But you can&#39;t find a new fully-kitted Tiny PC in the $60-80 range that competes with the Pi 5, which starts at $50 for the bare Pi 5 board (for a 2 GB model). The most direct comparison is the Radxa X4 (which is a very close Intel-based replacement for the Raspberry Pi). But that board&#39;s pricing is very closely aligned to the Pi, as you need to add on accessories to have a fully functional system.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-intel-nuc-n150-mini-pc-on-top.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-e4415c0f-011d-402a-8b40-876f053694be" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;e4415c0f-011d-402a-8b40-876f053694be&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 on top of NucBox G3 Plus mini N150 PC"/></p>

<p>All of this to say: value is complicated. The Pi 5 is <em>much</em> more compact and slightly more power efficient (especially at idle) compared to the cheapest N1XX Intel systems. The Intel systems are better suited for a desktop use case. The Pi 5 can be run off PoE power, for easier one-cable networking + power. The Intel systems are more compatible with a wider range of software (not the least of which is <em>anything requiring Windows</em>).</p>

<p>The idle power is the difference of maybe $10-20/year of power consumption. So it&#39;s not <em>that big a deal</em> for most users. But it&#39;s substantial if you&#39;re running off PoE power for remote use cases, or need to run a computer off solar or battery power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that useful to say one is cheaper than the other, because it&#39;s like saying &#34;a bicycle is cheaper than a car.&#34; If you need to transport 4 adults 150 miles as quickly as possible, one choice is obviously better!</p>

<ul>
<li>The NucBox G3 Plus I was sent was ordered through Amazon <em>by GMKtec</em> as a review sample; so it comes from the same stock that&#39;s shipping to customers. My unit had a defective power adapter, only supplying 0.14V. Luckily I had my old adapter from the original NucBox G3 that I bought, and it worked fine.</li>
<li>The fan connector on the NucBox G3 is actually the same JST connector / pitch that the Pi 5 uses; just an interesting observation, as I haven&#39;t seen that connector used for fans outside of SBCs like the Pi 5 before.</li>
<li>DDR5 SO-DIMMs are not compatible with DDR4 SO-DIMM slotsâ€”just something I learned on this project... I knew full-size DIMMs were incompatible due to the extra on-stick ECC circuit on DDR5 RAM, I just didn&#39;t know the same applied to SO-DIMMs. Obvious in hindsight, but something to keep in mind.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04 required a kernel update to 6.12 (I used Mainline Kernels to do it) to work with the iGPU on the N150 SoC.</li>
