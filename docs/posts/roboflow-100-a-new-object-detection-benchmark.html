              What is the Roboflow 100?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Roboflow 100 introduces domain-specific benchmarks beyond common
              objects in context to identify how models adapt to diverse
              problems in healthcare, aerial imagery, video games, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Object detection benchmarks have traditionally focused on a single
              dataset for fine-tuning and evaluation such as Microsoft COCO and
              Pascal VOC. While semantically diverse within their domain, these
              benchmarks focus on optimizing a single metric for a single
              dataset, which does not show the degree of generalization learned
              by the model.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this paper we introduce the Roboflow 100 object detection
              benchmark consisting of 100 projects that span a wide array of
              imagery domains and task targets. We derived our benchmark
              selection from over 90000 public datasets, 60 million public
              images that are actively being worked on in the open on Roboflow.
