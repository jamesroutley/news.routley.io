    <h1>Nx compromised: malware uses Claude code CLI to explore the filesystem</h1>

                    <p>At least 1.4k people are learning today that they have a new repository prefixed by <strong>s1ngularity-repository</strong> in their GitHub account. This repository was created by a malicious post-install command executed by the install of the <code>nx</code> build kit. That malware steals wallets and API keys (`.npmrc`, env variables, etc.) and pushes them in that repository in the <code>results.b64</code> file. Interestingly, the malware checks for the presence of Claude Code CLI or Gemini CLI on the system to offload much of the fingerprintable code to a prompt.</p><p><em>Ongoing Security Alert: Investigation and remediation continues as new information becomes available. Check back for updates. <a href="https://github.com/nrwl/nx/security/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c">Official advisory from nx</a>. Last updated 2025-08-27 12:00 UTC</em></p><h2>TL;DR What You Should Do Now</h2><h3>Are you impacted?</h3><p>Check your Github organization for evidence of compromise: <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+s1ngularity-repository&amp;type=repositories"><u>https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+s1ngularity-repository&amp;type=repositories</u></a> ; check regularly.<strong><br/></strong></p><h3>Are you using a compromised version of nx?</h3><p>Run <code>semgrep --config r/oqUk5lJ/semgrep.ssc-mal-resp-2025-08-nx-build-compromised</code> to find if any of your packages are using a vulnerable version of <code>nx</code>.</p><p>Alternatively, you can run <code>nx –version</code> or check your lockfile to see if you are running one of the impacted versions of <code>nx</code>: </p><ul><li><p>21.5.0 - v21.8.0</p></li><li><p>v20.6.0 – v20.12.0</p></li></ul><p>These have been removed from npm already.</p><h3>What to do?</h3><p>Log into your GitHub account and check to see if a repository with a name starting with <code>s1ngularity-repository</code> exists. </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Update <code>nx</code> to the latest safe versions <code>21.4.1</code> (the impacted versions have already been removed from <code>npm</code>).</p></li><li><p>Copy then delete the repository from your GitHub account.</p></li><li><p>Now, you need to rotate the secrets that were part of the dump.</p><p>a) Unfortunately, the dump is very wide, from crypto wallets to API keys.</p><p>b) Rotate tokens/credentials for github, npm, and any ssh keys or env variables you may have had leaked.</p></li><li><p>Look in the shell files (bashrc, etc.) for the shutdown directive and remove it.</p></li></ol><h2>What Is NX</h2><p>Nx is a popular build system that is designed to handle large codebases by managing multiple projects in one place. It analyzes your code to only rebuild and re-test what has changed so a fundamental component of most monorepos projects. It’s a very popular system used by 2.5 million developers every day!</p><p>If you use tools like the VSCode Cursor extension you will automatically pull latest versions so could have had it update without realizing.</p><h2>Incident Timeline</h2><p>The incident is still ongoing. We&#39;ve observed that a requestor has been created. Be sure to watch out for your organizations. If you see any <code>s1ngularity-repository</code> being created, make them private and delete them.</p><ul><li><p>2025-08-26 ~06:00 PM PDT | 8 malicious <code>nx</code> versions published including (v20.9.0 - v20.12.0; v21.5.0 - v21.8.0)</p></li><li><p>2025-08-26 ~08:30 PM PDT | First user reported suspicious activity on GitHub</p></li><li><p>2025-08-26 ~10:45 PM PDT | <code>npm</code> removed compromised versions</p></li><li><p>2025-08-26 ~11:45 PM PDT | org owner (nrwl) removed compromised npm account</p></li><li><p>2025-08-27 ~01:00 AM PDT | Additional scope of npm packages listed to include those under <code>@nx/</code> </p></li></ul><h2>How The Malware Works</h2><p>Utilizing the <code>nx</code> post install hook, <a href="https://telemetry.js">telemetry.js</a> is used to run malicious code.</p><p>It checks for the presence of Claude Code CLI or Gemini CLI on the system. If found, it calls them with the following prompt to discover wallets and secrets on the file system.
