    <h1>Tell HN: The popular Chrome extension ModHeader is injecting ads into searches</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Not much more to say than the title. I enabled ModHeader to test something a couple days ago and started noticing the same add showing up in the sidebar on both Google and Bing. I keep a constant vigilance with uBlock Origin and denying all 3rd party cookies.</p><p>Since that was the only extension I&#39;ve modified recently, I disabled it and refreshed a search page and voila, the ad is gone.</p></div></div></div>
