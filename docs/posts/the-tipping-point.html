    <h1>The Tipping Point</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>We all feel it. The United States (and therefore the world, like it or not) is at a tipping point. A crossroads. A fork in the river. Whatever metaphor you prefer, it&#39;s clear that this is A Moment where change is possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are years, centuries, in which nothing happens, and there are days [...] into which a whole lifetime is compressed.</p>

<p>I dont know what&#39;s going to happen next; I dont think anyone does.<sup title="If you think that you do, congratulations on your upcoming illustrious career as a stock trader. No spoilers!"><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> All I <em>do</em> know is that things are going to get worse before they might get better, especially for vulnerable populations like immigrants, disabled people, and trans people. Luckily us <em>normal</em> people dont have to worr- aw shit, I&#39;m a trans people aren&#39;t I.</p>
<p>I&#39;m scared. I have some savings, an escape plan, and people who support me, but none of that makes it easier, not really. Not when I&#39;m constantly alert with my head on a swivel<sup title="And spending too much time on social media doesn&#39;t help."><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>, wondering if today is going to be the day I need to grab everything and go.</p>
<p>But the fascists haven&#39;t won yet. They&#39;re ascendant, and all of our &#34;elites&#34; and &#34;institutions&#34; have failed us, but (for my own sanity) I have to believe that the people are against them. Our strength is greatest when we work together and are in community with each other. I have been to two protests<sup title="I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re a leftist because, y&#39;know, you&#39;re on my blog. If that&#39;s not how you identify, then maybe think about that. In times like this there are only fascists and antifascists, and the most dedicated antifascists are communists."><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> in the last two weeks, and they have both inspired me. But I also went to a friend&#39;s block party, shared a cake I made with my new neighbor, and got permission to distribute zines at my local coffee shop. The thing about a tipping point is that it&#39;s a moment of leverage for everyone, including us as leftists.<sup title="I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re a leftist because, y&#39;know, you&#39;re on my blog.

<p>When we fight, we win. 
Trans lives matter.
Solidarity forever.</p>
