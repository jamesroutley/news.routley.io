    <h1>Woman appears cured of HIV after umbilical-cord blood transplant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>A woman in the New York City area appears to have been cured of an HIV infection, joining a small group of people whose recovery is providing researchers with road maps to beat one of natureâ€™s most resilient viruses.</p>
         <p>The woman has shown no detectable signs of the human immunodeficiency virus in extensive testing since she stopped antiretroviral treatment in October 2020 following a transplant of stem cells with a rare genetic mutation that blocks HIV invasion, her doctors said.</p>
