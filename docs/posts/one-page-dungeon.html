Anyway, the idea is very simple: the generator builds imperfectly symmetrical dungeons. Every dungeon is grown recursively and when a room needs to be expanded, usually identical wings are spawned to the left and to the right from it. Usually, but not every time - occasionally these wings are not identical, but still (imperfectly) symmetrical. How often this happens depends on the desired level of chaos. This all is supposed to produce something in between boring perfectly symmetrical cross-like or T-like plans and too chaotic layouts typical for more common algorithms. That&#39;s it.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-5676286" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:5676286,&#34;user_id&#34;:5828224}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/shiveroni"></a><div><p>Hello, Â I wanted to ask if youÂ´re getting any money from <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Dungeon-Maps-Game-Master-Customizable/dp/B0982NMQ8T" rel="nofollow noopener" referrerpolicy="origin">this</a> .

The problem here is not that someone makes money from it and I don&#39;t, but that this book is actually a fraud, the &#34;author&#34; sells stuff which is supposed to be free.

I&#39;ll say right away that that isn&#39;t me, but I understand why they&#39;d sell them.
</p>
<p>Fraud is a strong word and I don&#39;t think it applies  because you never say anywhere on the generator details not to sell them  and you imply that you&#39;re ok with them being used commercially  with the way you phrase things. You say credit is not required either. Theres at least 1 post on reddit that I just found that  comes to the same conclusion as well.<br/></p>
<p>To  have these words up there for all this time, since October 2019 according to &#39;TheWaybackMachine&#39;, and  then voice anger about it and possibly condone some action against it when  you find out someone took advantage of something you say is ok to take  advantage of...</p>
<p>Â Wouldn&#39;t that in itself be the fraud or some kind of trickery? Thats likely how it would feel from their POV, as you&#39;re basically saying &#34;You own the rights to what you generate. Do as you like with them.&#34; To act against someone for doing so is pretty much a &#39;rug pull&#39;.</p>
<p>You may not like that they are selling the maps, but you literally gave them the right to do it.<br/></p>
<p>I doubt  there was any malicious intent on their part. For one thing you didn&#39;t have that  license on your neighborhood generator for a long while, and in that  time that seller never made a neighborhood map book. You only just  recently added it, but since you did I&#39;m sure a book will pop up eventually. On top of that, they actually mention it in the details that it is generated, which they are not actually even obligated to do.<br/></p>
<p>Â It is perfectly  reasonable for them, or anyone, to believe that you were either ok with how they&#39;re being used or just did not care. I&#39;m  not a lawyer, I don&#39;t know about the legality of changing it after all  this time, but even if you did I don&#39;t think it would be fair to whoever  that seller is or anyone else that acted before some change was made to it.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-5707150" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:5707150,&#34;user_id&#34;:3082392}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/00teonis"></a><div><p>I came here for the same reason, I found that many of the product sold by Silent Wave Press are just prints from your generators.

It doesn&#39;t look like the generator itself is open source, however is there any (preferably free) licensing available? The why: We run a volunteer camp for kids in the area, and one of the main things the kids like doing the most (and let&#39;s face us, us adults as well) is playing tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. We just got donated a license to FoundryVTT which has an amazing importer for this tool, but our issue is while we have tools and everything for kids to play on the campsite, the site itself has no signal or internet available, so unless we pre-generate a multitude of dungeons in advanceÂ we won&#39;t be able to get any new ones for the kids to play with once we&#39;re actually out there.Â </p><p>So if there&#39;s any way at all possible to run a local copy of the generator at our campsite to be able to make on-demand content to use that would be so amazingly useful. Thanks for such an amazing and free tool, and I hope to hear from you whether the news is good or bad. :)</p><p>I&#39;m not sure the easiest way to contact outside here, but I have Discord and normal contact options as well like email etc. Thanks again!</p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="post-5677171" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:5677171,&#34;user_id&#34;:34770}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/watabou"></a><div><div dir="auto"><p>Hi!
