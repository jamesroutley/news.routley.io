	       			   				   			<p>Really enjoyed this collection.  Quite a few of these I&#39;ve never seen.  I agree with others that commented on the early Italian designed and or influenced cars, versus the later vehicles.  Some really great looking vehicles early on, but with some exceptions, concepts just seem to get goofy as time goes on.  </p>
<p>Fun looking at some of these, but I cannot imagine anything like them on the street.  A clear exception is the Infiniti Essence is very elegant, and seems to be a nod to Aston Martin.  The Nissan Pivo on the other hand, along with many of the later vehicles, just seem to be an exercise in absurdity.</p><p>
