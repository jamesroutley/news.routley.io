    <p>This recipe has been a staple ever since a friend of mine showed it to me a few months back. The original version is great, but I’ve been slowly tweaking it over the months to suit my need for low-effort weekday dish.</p>

<p>I’ve finally landed on a version that I’m happy with and has kept us well fed. If you give it a shot let me know how it goes! I’d also love to hear any other tweaks that make it even better.</p>
