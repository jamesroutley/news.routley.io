    <h1>I changed my mind about advertising</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to be very anti-advertising. I believed that in addition to being annoying, it was unnecessary—that if for some reason
advertising became infeasible, sure, some companies would go out of business, but they&#39;d be replaced by better companies
with other business models, and the rest of us would be better off for it.</p>
<p>I even made <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20542993">this prediction</a> in a Hacker News discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m working on an early-stage startup right now, and I&#39;m certainly not going to use ads as part of my revenue model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward two years and several pivots, and my slightly-less-early-stage business is doing $900 per month in revenue... from ads.
Along the way I&#39;ve also adopted a new mental model for advertising.
Basically I think of attention as a currency and advertising as a foreign exchange. When you use an ad-supported service, you&#39;re not <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/3229">&#34;the product,&#34;</a> you are the customer. You pay with attention, and the service trades some of that attention to an advertiser in exchange for regular currency.
The great thing about attention-as-a-currency is that it has certain properties that make it a viable way to charge for some services where regular currency isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In particular, attention is a form of <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1406902219086069766">micropayment with low friction</a>.
When you create a product that provides a little value to a lot of people (vs. a lot of value to a few people),
any friction or transaction costs can easily dominate the amount you charge and make the product unviable. <a href="https://thesample.ai">The Sample</a> (my business) makes almost 1 penny
per user per day thanks to <a href="https://silken-cafe-474.notion.site/About-The-Sample-a989b5bd39054b37a51432d6999beac3#897e7ab4bba742ba9a5830097ac33eb8">paid forwards</a> (enough to cover the cost of sending email with plenty of margin left over, fortunately).
Theoretically, that&#39;s equivalent to charging everyone a subscription of $3.65/year, not including Stripe fees—except that
charging attention instead means no one has to put in a credit card, and they don&#39;t even have to decide up front if the cost is
worth it since it&#39;s pay-as-you-go. If it&#39;s not worth it, people try it for a bit and then unsubscribe.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t address more salient concerns with advertising, like <a href="https://warzel.substack.com/p/the-internets-original-sin">sharing data with 3rd parties</a> or
the question of if it pushes companies to <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/breaking-off-the-engagement">maximize for engagement</a> more than they otherwise would.
(There&#39;s also the fact that some ads are just plain annoying, but that&#39;s no different from a product that&#39;s too expensive.) However, this small mental shift
is what made me think we should try to work out solutions for those problems that don&#39;t involve simply <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">abandoning ads</a> altogether.</p>
