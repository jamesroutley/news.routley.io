<h5>No Scaling!</h5>
<p>At the conference, TSMC talked about both the original base N3 (N3B) node as well as the enhanced variant (N3E) which is a <a href="https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/7048/n3e-replaces-n3-comes-in-many-flavors/">slightly more relaxed variant of the N3B</a>. What’s interesting is, for the new N3E node, the high-density SRAM bitcell size as not shrunk at all. Coming in at 0.021 µm², this is exactly the same bitcell size as their N5 node. The N3B variant which isn’t expected to make it into too many products did have a scaled SRAM bitcell; however, at 0.0199µm², it’s a mere 5% scaling (or 0.95x shrink).</p></div>
