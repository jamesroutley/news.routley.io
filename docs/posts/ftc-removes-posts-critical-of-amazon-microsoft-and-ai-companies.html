    <h1>FTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI Companies</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.</p><p>On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance">business-related blogs and guidance</a> no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.</p><p>One now deleted blog, titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?”</a> explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance”</a> instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information">allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data</a> from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.</p><p>“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.</p><p>Another removed FTC blog titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/luring-test-ai-engineering-consumer-trust">“The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust”</a> outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog <a data-offer-url="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/&#34;}" href="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">won an award in 2023</a> for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”</p><p>The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/">started to roll out AI products like GSAi</a>, a general purpose government chatbot.</p><p>The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.</p><p>Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.</p><p>Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-bogus-fears-of-censorship-could-spell-the-end-of-content-moderation/">longstanding allegations that social media platforms</a>, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html&#34;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the New York Times reported in December</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWYo_w_A_uU&amp;themeRefresh=1">In an interview with CNBC last week</a>, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. &#34;If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there&#39;s a competition problem,” he said.</p><p>Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.</p><p>“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that&#39;s a change big tech would be very happy with.”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
