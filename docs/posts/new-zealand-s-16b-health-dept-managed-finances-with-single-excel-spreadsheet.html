    <h1>New Zealand&#39;s $16B health dept managed finances with single Excel spreadsheet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The body that runs New Zealand’s public health system uses a single Excel spreadsheet as the primary source of data to consolidate and manage its finances, which aren’t in great shape perhaps due to the sheet’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet-using agency is Health New Zealand (HNZ) which was established in 2022 to replace 20 district health boards in the expectation it would be more cost-effective and deliver more consistent services. The org has a budget of $NZ28 billion ($16 billion) and advised lawmakers it would stay within it for FY 23.24.</p>
<p>That prediction was incorrect and HNZ blew its budget, leading to a review of its finances that last week delivered a damming <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/HNZ-Financial-Review-Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF] that found the org lost “control of the critical levers that drive financial outcomes” and had an “inability to identify and respond to the disconnect between expenditure and revenue.”</p>

    

<p>The Deloitte-penned report also found an Excel spreadsheet was the “primary data file used by HNZ to manage its financial performance” and was used for “consolidation, journals, business-critical reporting, and analysis.”</p>

        


        

<p>The report also noted five big problems with the sheet used at HNZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial information was often &#39;hard-coded,&#39; making it difficult to trace to the source or have updated data flow through.</li>

<li>Errors such as incorrectly releasing accruals or double-up releases were not picked up until following periods.</li>

<li>Changes to prior periods and FTE errors in district financial reporting Excel submissions, would not flow through to consolidated file.</li>

<li>The spreadsheet can be easy to manipulate information as there is limited tracking to source information where information is not flowing directly from accounting systems.</li>

<li>It is highly prone to human error, such as accidental typing of a number or omission of a zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relying on the spreadsheet also meant Health NZ moved slowly: The report found “monthly financial reporting usually took 12-15 days to consolidate and five days to analyse.”</p>
<p>The report suggests that’s a long way short of where Health NZ needs to be.</p>
<p>“The use of an Excel spreadsheet file to track and report financial performance for a NZ$28bn expenditure organisation raises significant concerns, particularly when other more appropriate systems are present on the IT landscape,” the report states.</p>

</ul>
<p>It gets worse: Health Minister Simeon Brown last week delivered a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/speech-businessnz-health-forum">speech</a> in which he said HNZ operates “an estimated 6,000 applications and 100 digital networks” – or roughly one application for every 16 staff members.</p>
<p>He also said HNZ’s Senior Leadership Team members “have only just begun weekly in-person meetings, and have continued to operate from different offices, despite the majority living in Auckland and the organization being two and a half years old.” Most work in different buildings.</p>

        

<p>However the Minister doesn’t have a plan to get off Excel, or fix HNZ’s tech leadership woes.</p>
<p>In his speech, Simeon promised to investigate “creating a separate Health Infrastructure Entity under Health New Zealand, to manage and deliver physical and digital assets.” But there’s no word on when that investigation might conclude</p>
<p><i>Reg</i> writers who learn of organizations that contemplate ERP as the fix for an unruly estate of legacy apps, with Excel holding things together in the middle, know they’re a chance of spending years chronicling the resulting mess. So good luck, HNZ, you might one day wish for the bad old days of running the org with spreadsheets. ®</p>
