    <h1>Practical Common Lisp (2005)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This page, and the pages it links to, contain text
               of the Common Lisp book <i>Practical Common
               Lisp</i> published by <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781590592397">Apress</a> These pages now contain the final text as it
               appears in the book. If you find errors in these
               pages, please send email
               to <a href="mailto:book@gigamonkeys.com">book@gigamonkeys.com</a>.
               These pages will remain online in perpetuityâ€”I hope
               they will serve as a useful introduction to Common
               Lisp for folks who are curious about Lisp but maybe
               not yet curious enough to shell out big bucks for a
               dead-tree book and a good Common Lisp tutorial for folks who want to get down to real coding right away. However, don&#39;t let that stop you from
               buying the printed version available from Apress at
               your favorite local or online bookseller. For the
               complete bookstore browsing experience, you can read
               the <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/letter-to-reader.html">letter to the
               reader</a> that appears on the back cover of the
               treeware edition of the book.</p><div>

    Whatever. Apress took a chance, publishing this book when other
    publishers thought there was no market for a Lisp book. While
    it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll get rich off my royalties, we don&#39;t have
    to sell all that many copies for Apress to turn a profit and show
    the naysayers that Lisp has legs yet.</p>
