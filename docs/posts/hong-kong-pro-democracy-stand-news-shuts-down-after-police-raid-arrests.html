Human Rights Office in Geneva which said it was alarmed at the &#34;extremely rapid closing of the civic space and outlets for Hong Kong’s civil society to speak and express themselves freely&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Stand News, set up in 2014 as a non-profit organisation, was the most prominent remaining pro-democracy publication in Hong Kong after a national security investigation this year led to the closure of jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai&#39;s Apple Daily tabloid.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The raid raises more concerns about press freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that a wide range of individual rights would be protected.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;Stand News is now stopping operations,&#34; the publication said on Facebook, adding all employees had been dismissed.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Steve Li, head of the police national security department,  told reporters Stand News had published news and commentary inciting hatred against authorities.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">He said some of the articles said protesters went missing during the city&#39;s 2019 pro-democracy unrest or were sexually harassed, which he called &#34;factually baseless&#34; and &#34;malicious&#34;. Li also said some articles falsely claimed the Communist Party extended its powers through the city&#39;s independent courts or called for foreign sanctions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Li did not specify the exact articles. Reuters has not independently reviewed any Stand News articles.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Li said police seized assets worth HK$61 million ($7.82 million) as well as computers, phones and journalistic materials, and that he did not rule out further arrests.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;We are not targeting reporters.
