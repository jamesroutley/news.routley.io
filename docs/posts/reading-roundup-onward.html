<p>Three papers from <a href="https://sigplan.org/Conferences/Onward/" rel="external" target="_blank">Onward!</a> today.</p>
<p>A Case for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689809" rel="external" target="_blank">Feminism in Programming Language Design</a>.</p>
<p>On which note, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000635/" rel="external" target="_blank">Finally continuing…</a> in Python:
LWN reporting on <a href="https://github.com/iritkatriel/finally/blob/main/README.md" rel="external" target="_blank">this proposal</a>.
A case in point of Hermans &amp; Schlesinger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, what is accepted in PL are overwhelmingly quantitative methods and formal methods.</p>
<p>…how easy the goalposts can be moved…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everything need be quantified to be meaningful.
For instance, you could use
A <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3426428.3426927" rel="external" target="_blank">Rhetorical Framework</a>
for Programming Language Evaluation.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563835.3567657" rel="external" target="_blank">Digital Crochet: Towards a Visual Language for Pattern Description</a>. Formalizing some of the (existing) visual pattern language, removing ambiguities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The varying tool support for pattern creation in crochet
and knitting results from the difference in the degree to
which the techniques themselves are mechanized….
there are no machines that are able to industrially produce
fabric based on the technique of crochet.</p>
