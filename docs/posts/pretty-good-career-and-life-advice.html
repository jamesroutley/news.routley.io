    <h1>Pretty good career and life advice</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>To my great surprise, young people now somewhat frequently contact me in order to solicit <em>career advice</em>.
They are usually in college or highschool, and want to know what the best next steps are for a career in 
security or software development.</p>

<p>This is, honestly, a really complicated question, mostly because I’m usually concerned that the question
itself might be the wrong one to be asking. What I want to say, more often than not, is something along
the lines of <em>don’t do it</em>; when I got out of highschool and focused on the answer to that same 
question, it was very nearly one of the biggest mistakes of my life.</p>

<p>Since I get these inquiries fairly regularly, I thought I’d write something here that I can use as a sort 
of canonical starting point for a response.</p>



<h3 id="tyler-durden-was-wrong-you-are-your-job">Tyler Durden was wrong, you <em>are</em> your job.</h3>

<p>In 1971, Dr. Philip Zimbardo conducted a psychological experiment that is now popularly known as
the “Stanford Prison Experiment.”  He constructed a makeshift simulated prison in the basement of
Stanford University’s psychology department, took a group of volunteers who tested as psychologically 
“normal” with no criminal background, flipped a coin, and assigned half of them to be “prisoners”
and half of them to be “prison guards.”</p>

<p><img src="https://moxie.org/blog/images/stanford-prison-experiment-bars.jpg"/></p>

<p>Initially, everyone acted awkwardly; the situation was so obviously foreign to their sense of self and 
their lived experience that they found it strange and even humorous.  Fairly quickly, however, the situation
eclipsed all of that.  The prisoners became divorced from their former identities, and began to act from the 
place of being a prisoner.  They alternated between staging minor protests and ratting each other out, to 
going on hunger strike and suffering psychological breakdowns.</p>

<p>The prison guards also <em>became</em> prison guards, even though they were allowed to return to their normal
lives in between their eight hour shifts. They went so far as to invent forms of psychological punishment, 
create solitary confinement cells, pit prisoners against each other in order to break them, and give long 
speeches while slowly pacing the hallway and rattling their wooden batons across the bars of the cell doors.</p>

<p>Had the coin landed differently, the individual people would have been on the reverse sides of the cell
doors, but the roles would have been the same.</p>

</iframe>

<p>Things got so out of control that the experiment, originally scheduled for two weeks, had to be ended after 
six days.</p>

<p>The experiment was positioned as a comment on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">institutions</a>, but the simpler lesson 
I draw from it as an individual is just <em>be careful what job you take, because your job will change you</em>.</p>

<p>This is obviously true for these types of hyperbolic examples — it’s not hard to imagine that a customs
agent (who spends 40 hours a week looking suspiciously at people, thinking skeptically about the honesty
of what people say, scientifically observing people’s eye movement, and trying to trip people up with 
confusing questions) might approach a conversation with someone they’ve just met at a party differently 
than they would have before taking the job.</p>

<p>It’s equally easy to imagine that someone who has worked as a prison guard for a decade might approach a 
romantic relationship differently than someone who has worked as a grief counselor for the same period.</p>

<p>But it’s not just cops, prison guards, and customs agents.  The context of one’s life defines not just <em>what</em>
but <em>how</em> one thinks, and a job tends to dominate the context of one’s life — particularly when that job
is considered to be part of a career. Your job will change you.</p>

<h3 id="the-choices-we-make">The choices we make.</h3>

<p>I recently got around to reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Cometbus">Aaron Cometbus’</a>
enjoyable “Cometbus #54, In China With Green Day?!!”  One of my favorite quotes was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some things are like that—they strike you as repugnant for instinctive
reasons, probably having to do with your culture and the way you were
raised. The French word “gauche” comes to mind, but I preferred the
Hebrew word “treyf.” Literally, it means not kosher, but I also use it
to describe things like cars, bars, strip clubs, guns, dogs, rock-n-roll,
and football games. Things that are treyf, you avoid, not because you
hate them per se, but because in avoiding them you keep yourself from
becoming like the people you hate.</p>

  <p>– <cite>Aaron Cometbus, “Cometbus #54”</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept resonates with me for the same reasons.  Like Aaron, I have my own list of things that 
are <em>treyf</em>, not because I find them necessarily unenjoyable, but because they <em>add up</em> to something
that I ultimately dislike.</p>

<p>For instance, whenever I get on an airplane and walk past first class, I inevitably go through a familiar 
mental process.  First, I’m envious.  The passengers are already in their comfortable seats, drinking from 
champagne flutes, contemplating the moment after takeoff when they can recline into their cocoons and watch 
a movie of their choice on demand.</p>

<p>But then, I register who is sitting in those seats.  It’s usually almost all predominantly unhealthy looking 
middle-aged white men, who it is clear from a glance have spent literally hundreds of hours of their lives 
over the past year in these airplanes.  And suddenly, I’m glad that I’m not sitting there.</p>

<p>Those seats are <em>treyf</em> for me, not because I don’t envy extra leg room, but because I don’t envy the people 
sitting in them.  There’s a reason the bulk of the first class passengers resemble each other, just as there’s 
a reason prison guards tend to act the same.  I know that by making choices designed to land me in the first 
class cabin, it would be difficult to avoid also inheriting the dreariness associated with its current occupants.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-is-looking-back-at-you">The future is looking back at you.</h3>

<p>In the context of a career, these concepts make it simple to look into the future. Jobs at software 
companies are typically advertised in terms of the difficult problems that need solving, the impact the project 
will have, the benefits the company provides, the playful color of the bean bag chairs. Likewise, jobs in other 
fields have their own set of metrics that they use to position themselves within their domains.</p>

<p>As a young person, though, I think the best thing you can do is to ignore all of that and simply 
<em>observe the older people working there</em>.</p>

<p>They are the future you. Do not think that you will be substantially different. Look carefully at how 
they spend their time at work and outside of work, because this is also almost certainly how your life will 
look. It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often young people imagine a different projection for themselves.</p>

<p>Look at the real people, and you’ll see the honest future for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="be-careful-not-to-discover-a-career-before-youve-discovered-yourself">Be careful not to discover a career before you’ve discovered yourself.</h3>

<p>This all presupposes we’re starting from a point where considering these questions is a real possibility. 
Sure, pure objectivity is impossible; after all, society itself <em>also</em> defines the context of our thoughts, 
and by now it’s way too late to effectively remove ourselves from <em>that</em>. So how can we evaluate what 
experiences we want for ourselves, when it is experiences themselves which transform our very desires?</p>

<p>At the moment when young people are considering their career strategy, they have typically made all of
their life choices completely within supporting structures.  Even having worked hard to get where they are, 
and even though things like class and race can mean that some have the cards stacked against them, it’s 
rare for young people to have substantially departed from supporting frameworks.  Highschools have “college 
counselors” (not “dropout counselors”), scholarships and financial aid packages lead in a single direction, 
and university overlaps with internships — which then culminates largely in a series of “career fairs.”</p>

<p>When we arrive at the ends of these funnels, it’s possible that the direction we’re facing is more a
reflection of those structures than it is a reflection of ourselves.  Self-determination in a moment like 
that can’t simply be about making a choice, it has to start with transforming the conditions that <em>constitute</em>
our choices.  It requires challenging the “self” in “self-determination” by stepping as far outside of those
supporting structures as possible, for as long as possible.</p>

<p>This is necessarily terrifying.  I think a lot about a quote from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_M._Bonanno">Alfredo Bonanno</a>, an anarchist and habitual bank robber, 
on the feeling of leaving prison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The instant you get out of prison you have the sensation that you are leaving something dear to you.
Why? Because you know that you are leaving a part of your life inside, because you spent some of your
life there which, even if it was under terrible conditions, is still a part of you.  And even if you
lived it badly and suffered horribly, which is not always the case, it is always better than the nothing
that your life is reduced to the moment it disappears.</p>

  <p>– <cite>Alfredo Bonanno, “Locked Up”</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that the most significant and meaningful periods of my life have all been moments that I could have 
never rationally chosen or even <em>known as possibilities</em> had I not been foolish or lucky enough to step into 
the nothingness that Alfredo Bonanno writes about.  I try to remind myself that if leaving prison is scary,
the same is likely true for any genuine process of discovery.</p>

<h3 id="theres-no-rush-to-get-started-early-on-a-never-ending-task">There’s no rush to get started early on a never-ending task.</h3>

<p>Everything before a career has defined beginnings and endings.  Elementary school, middle school, junior high,
highschool, university.  There’s always been a predefined end, and that contributes a lot to making the
indignities of those institutions bearable.  Once you start working full time, though, it’s just One Long 
Semester that you’re expected to attend for <em>the rest of your life</em>.</p>

<p>So consider caution if you’re overly excited to start down that road as quickly as you can.  Other than being 
forever, it’s not as different from what’s come before as you might imagine.</p>

<h3 id="by-way-of-an-explanation">By way of an explanation.</h3>

<p>This is all just to explain why, when people write me for career advice, I’m as likely to respond 
with something like <em>“if I were you, I’d hitchhike to Alaska this summer instead.”</em></p>

<p>My career advice usually falls within the framework of doing the absolute minimum amount of work necessary 
to prevent starvation, and then doing something that’s not about money, completely outside of supporting 
structures, and not simply a matter of “consuming experience” with the remaining available time.</p>

<p>Learn three chords, start a band, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5g8u-2TI3g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m20s">go on tour</a>. Ride a bicycle 
<a href="http://www.microcosmdistribution.com/catalog/zines/2821/">as far as you can</a>. Go <a href="http://www.wwoof.org">WWOOFing</a> 
or start a <a href="http://hayesvalleyfarm.tumblr.com/">community garden</a> in your neighborhood. Put together a <a href="http://mrpuppetarmy.wordpress.com/">traveling 
puppet show</a>. Build a drone to engage the emerging drones 
<a href="http://www.newser.com/story/156143/sheriff-in-oakland-wants-surveillance-drone.html">controlled by domestic police</a>. Do whatever — but make it uncomfortable (like leaving prison!) and <em>make it count</em>.</p>
