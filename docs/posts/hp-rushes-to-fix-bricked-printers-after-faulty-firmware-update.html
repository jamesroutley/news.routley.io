<p>HP is working to address a bad firmware update that has been bricking HP Office Jet printers worldwide since it was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>While HP has yet to issue a public statement regarding these ongoing problems affecting a subset of its customer base, the company told BleepingComputer that it&#39;s addressing the blue screen errors seen by a &#34;limited number&#34; of users.</p>
<p>&#34;Our teams are working diligently to address the blue screen error affecting a limited number of HP OfficeJet Pro 9020e printers,&#34; HP told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>&#34;We are recommending customers experiencing the error to contact our customer support team for assistance: https://support.hp.com.&#34;</p>
<p>Impacted printers include HP OfficeJet 902x models, including HP OfficeJet Pro 9022e, HP OfficeJet Pro 9025e, HP OfficeJet Pro 9020eAll-in-One, HP OfficeJet Pro 9025e All-in-One Printer</p>
<p>Affected customers report that their devices display blue screens with &#34;83C0000B&#34; errors on the built-in touchscreen.</p>

<p>Since the issues surfaced, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HP+officejet++83C0000B+site:hp.com&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=qdr:m&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSzcGUnIL_AhUBuaQKHcHXAP8QpwV6BAgBEBg&amp;biw=1644&amp;bih=769&amp;dpr=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">multiple threads</a> have been started by people from the U.S., the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Poland, New Zealand, and France who had their printers bricked, some with more than a dozen pages of reports.</p>
<p>&#34;HP has no solution at this time. Hidden service menu is not showing, and the printer is not booting anymore. Only a blue screen,&#34; one customer <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Error-83C0000B-on-OfficeJetPro-9022e/m-p/8685233/highlight/true#M978161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;I talked to HP Customer Service and they told me they don&#39;t have a solution to fix this firmware issue, at the moment,&#34; another <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Error-83C0000B-on-OfficeJetPro-9022e/m-p/8685233/highlight/true#M978161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/HP-9020e-error-code-83C0000B/m-p/8686002/highlight/true#M978320" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that the only to address the issue is to send the printer for servicing to HP and that &#34;The firmware doesn&#39;t even load partially, it instantly fails... HP remotely bricked our devices! Some users said that HP would be sending out a replacement.&#34;</p>
<p>Since the buggy update seems to install automatically onto Internet-connected printers, HP customers are advised to disable their devices&#39; Internet connection and wait for a firmware update to fix the bricking issue.</p>
<p>ASUS also <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/asus-routers-knocked-offline-worldwide-by-bad-security-update/" target="_blank">apologized earlier today</a> for a server-side security maintenance error that led to a wide range of impacted router models losing network connectivity.</p>
