<p>As an Emacs user, I eventually made the leap over to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">dired</a> as my file manager of choice. Dired has <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired/">magical things like wdired</a>. But this post isn&#39;t so much about dired and more about the occasional need to peek at media files (images, audio, and video) from Emacs (including dired).</p>
<p>To view images in Emacs, there&#39;s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image-Mode.html">image mode</a>, a fantastic major mode for taking a quick look without leaving your editor. Image mode strikes a great balance. You can get in quickly and out. The <code>q</code> keyboard binding is fabulous for bailing out. While viewing an image, you may quickly open the previous/next one by using <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> keyboard binding. For me, this is just about all I need within my text editor. For anything else, I resort to my favorite image viewing app (macOS&#39;s Preview).</p>
<p>For audio and video, we aren&#39;t as lucky with Emacs built-in features (even for a quick peek). While Emacs faithfully opens the files, it&#39;s not realistically practical for my typical needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.com/images/ready-player-mode/no-handling.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>There&#39;s a convenient package aptly named <a href="https://github.com/jpkotta/openwith">openwith</a>, which automatically opens specific files in an external app. This isn&#39;t just for media files, but anything really. It works well with office docs, for example. While I&#39;ve used it for quite some time, I found always bouncing to an external app for peeking at audio/video somewhat suboptimal.</p>
<p>While a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dtnjy7/is_there_imageview_but_for_audio">reddit post</a> yielded some handy options, none were in the same spirit as image mode. Having said that, I did come across <a href="https://github.com/xFA25E/mediainfo-mode">mediainfo-mode</a> on my search, which is pretty neat for viewing media metadata quickly. Bonus points for <code>q</code> keyboard binding to exit and <code>mediainfo-mode-open</code> command to open with an external app. There may be other packages out there (I&#39;d love to hear about them), though most seemed to focus on listening to music (and playlist management), which is a different flow from what I&#39;m after.</p>

<p>With all that, I had no choice (I kid of course) but to go and throw some lines of elisp together and see if I could get to my ideal media experience, and so <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">ready player mode</a> was bornâ€¦</p>

<p>As core features, <code>ready-player-mode</code> has two buttons: one to play from within Emacs and one to open media in the preferred external app. You can <code>TAB</code> your way to the buttons. <code>RET</code> or <code>click</code> actions the buttons, in addition to the <code>SPC</code> keyboard binding to toggle playback.</p>
<p>Like image mode, <code>ready-player-mode</code> offers <code>n/p</code> navigation to open the next/previous media file in the current directory.</p>
<p><code>ready-player-mode</code> attempts to display basic metadata if possible, courtesy of <code>ffprobe</code> and <code>ffmpeg</code>. You&#39;ll need these installed on your system if you want the optional metadata.</p>
<p>Playback is handled by your favourite command line utility. <code>ready-player-mode</code> will try to use either <code>mpv</code>, <code>vlc</code>, <code>ffplay</code>, or <code>mplayer</code> (in that order), but you can customize that.</p>
<p><code>ready-player-mode</code> is available on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">GitHub</a> if you&#39;re keen to check it out. Keep in mind this is a brand new package (a day old!), so it may need some improvements. If you do give it a try, <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium">I&#39;d love to hear</a> how you got on. I&#39;ve only tested on macOS so far.</p>
