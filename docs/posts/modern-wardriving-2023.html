						<p>Let‚Äôs start by defining the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">Wardriving</a>: it is the search for WIFI wireless networks from a vehicle equipped with a computer. This would be the classic definition. I define modern wardriving as the search for WIFI networks, Bluetooth devices and GSM towers independently whether we are in any type of vehicle (plane, boat, bicycle, scooter, skateboard, etc.) or even walking.</p>
<p>I have been analyzing wireless networks since the beginning of 2000 and in 2022 I obtained the well-known Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP) certification, you can read <a href="https://simonroses.com/2022/08/offensive-security-wireless-professional-oswp-my-experience/">my post about it</a>. Below is an image of the old cards that I used at that time for wardriving and WIFI audits that I still have out of nostalgia.</p>
<p><a href="https://simonroses.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oswp_img1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://simonroses.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oswp_img1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"/></a></p>
<p>Modern wardriving requires more advanced hardware as we now have WIFI on 2.4GHz and 5GHz with WIFI 6 and 7 looming on the horizon, Bluetooth devices (with billions of devices in the world and counting) and GSM towers. In addition, we must combine it with a GPS device to save their location.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image, I use different devices for Wardriving and Radio Frequency (RF) audits from my company <a href="https://vulnex.com/">VULNEX</a>. And what is shown here is not all the gadgets I use üòä With these devices we can perform everything from wardriving to sophisticated RF attacks (a story for another day).</p>

<p>Do you want to get started in wardriving? My advice is that you buy an Android phone (it doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive or top of the range) and install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wigle.wigleandroid&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">WiGLE WiFi Wardriving</a> App. It is the fastest and most comfortable way to enter this fascinating world. As you progress you can expand your collection of wardriving devices.</p>
