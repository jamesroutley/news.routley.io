    <h1>“Streaming vs. Batch” Is a Wrong Dichotomy, and I Think It&#39;s Confusing</h1>

				<p>Often times, &#34;Stream vs. Batch&#34; is discussed as if it’s one <em>or</em> the other, but to me this does not make that much sense really.</p>
<p>Many streaming systems will apply batching too, i.e. processing or transferring multiple records (a &#34;batch&#34;) at once,
thus offsetting connection overhead, amortizing the cost of fanning out work to multiple threads,
opening the door for highly efficient SIMD processing, etc., all to ensure high performance.
The prevailing trend towards storage/compute separation in data streaming and processing architectures
(for instance, thinking of platforms such as WarpStream, and <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/streaming-vs-batch-wrong-dichotomy/blog/what-if-we-could-rebuild-kafka-from-scratch/">Diskless Kafka</a> at large)
further accelerates this development.</p>
<p>Typically, this is happening transparently to users, done in an opportunistic way:
handling all of those records (up to some limit) which have arrived in a buffer since the last batch.
This makes for a very nice self-regulating system.
High arrival rate of records: larger batches, improving throughput.
Low arrival rate: smaller batches, perhaps with even just a single record, ensuring low latency.
Columnar in-memory data formats like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> are of great help for implementing such a design.</p>
<p>In contrast, what the &#34;Stream vs. Batch&#34; discussion in my opinion should actually be about,
are &#34;Pull vs. Push&#34; semantics:
will the system query its sources for new records in a fixed interval,
or will new records be pushed to the system as soon as possible?
Now, no matter how often you pull,
you can’t convert a pull-based solution into a streaming one.
Unless a source represents a consumable stream of changes itself (you see where this is going),
a pull system may miss updates happening between fetch attempts, as well as deletes.</p>
<p>This is what makes streaming so interesting and powerful:
it provides you with a complete view of your data in real-time.
A streaming system lets you put your data to the <em>location</em> where you need it,
in the <em>format</em> you need it, and in the <em>shape</em> you need it (think denormalization),
immediately as it gets produced or updated.
The price for this is a potentially higher complexity,
for example when reasoning about streaming joins (and their state),
or handling out-of-order data.
But the streaming community is working continuously to improve things here,
e.g. via disaggregated state backends,
transactional stream processing, and much more.
I’m really excited about all the innovation happening in this space right now.</p>
<p>Now, you might wonder: &#34;Do I really need streaming <em>(push)</em>, though? I’m fine with batch <em>(pull)</em>.&#34;</p>
<p>That’s a common and fair question.
In my experience, it is best answered by giving it a try yourself.
Again and again I have seen how folks who were skeptical at first,
very quickly wanted to get real-time streaming for more and more,
if not all of their use cases,
once they had seen it in action once.
If you’ve experienced a data freshness of a second or two in your data warehouse,
you don’t want to ever miss this magic again.</p>
<p>All that being said,
it’s actually not even about pull <em>or</em> push so much—​the approaches complement each other.
For instance, backfills often are done via batching, i.e. querying, in an otherwise streaming-based system.
Also, if you want the completeness of streaming but don’t require a super low latency,
you may decide to suspend your streaming pipelines (thus saving cost) in times of low data volume,
resume when there’s new data to process, and halt again.</p>
<p>Batch streaming, if you will.</p>
