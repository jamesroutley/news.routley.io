    <h1>OpenAI just replaced its core values with completely different ones</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>Oh, okay.</h2><h2>Artificial, In General</h2><p>In recent weeks, OpenAI quietly changed its &#34;core values&#34; list to include a focus on artificial general intelligence (AGI) that wasn&#39;t explicitly listed there before.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/12/2023/openai-quietly-changed-its-core-values"><em>Semafor</em> reports</a>, the firm as recently as September 21 listed its values on a job openings page as &#34;Audacious,&#34; &#34;Thoughtful,&#34; &#34;Unpretentious,&#34; &#34;Impact-driven,&#34; &#34;Collaborative&#34; and &#34;Growth-oriented,&#34; per a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230925141144/https://openai.com/careers">snapshot of the page on the Internet Archive</a>.</p><p>When one goes to the page now, though, they&#39;ll see an entirely different list that includes &#34;AGI focus&#34; as its very first value. Its other new core values: &#34;Intense and scrappy,&#34; &#34;Scale,&#34; &#34;Make something people love,&#34; and &#34;Team spirit.&#34;</p><p>Sure, it&#39;s all corporate blather. But you can&#39;t help but wonder: if you can replace all your core values at the drop of a hat, were they really core values to begin with?</p><h2>Whiplash!</h2><p>And let&#39;s zoom in on that number one core value, &#34;AGI Focus,&#34; because it&#39;s a perfect example of how the company&#39;s favorite terms can feel like works in progress.</p><p>In February, OpenAI&#39;s inscrutable CEO <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman wrote</a> in a company blog post that AGI can broadly be defined as &#34;systems that are generally smarter than humans,&#34; but in a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">wide-ranging <em>New York Magazine</em> interview</a> published last month, he&#39;d downgraded the definition to AI that could serve as the &#34;equivalent of a median human that you could hire as a co-worker.&#34;</p><p>So which is it, then? Does OpenAI and its CEO think that AGI, its purported new core value, will be comprised of superhuman artificial intelligence, or is it an AI that&#39;s just about as smart as the average person?</p><h2>Shifting Tides</h2><p>While we&#39;ve reached out to OpenAI to clear up that pretty wide discrepancy in definition, the answer may not become clear anytime soon given that the company&#39;s goals have, like its values, shifted over time as well.</p><p>Founded in 2015 by Altman, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-horrified-openai">Elon Musk</a>, and a handful of others who are by and large no longer affiliated, OpenAI was created as a nonprofit research lab that was meant, essentially, to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-billions-bad-ai">build good AI to counter the bad</a>. Though the firm still pays lip service to that original goal, its drift away from nonprofit AI do-gooders to a <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-elon-musk-openai-profit">for-profit endeavor</a> led to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-quits-research-group">Musk&#39;s exit in 2019</a>, and that purpose-shifting appears to have bled into its self-descriptions as well.</p><p>So yeah, the new core values list feels like a bunch of fluff. It does, however, seem to show OpenAI&#39;s hand when it comes to its single-minded focus looking forward.</p><p>&#34;We are committed to building safe, beneficial AGI that will have a massive positive impact on humanity&#39;s future,&#34; the OpenAI job postings page now explains. &#34;Anything that doesn’t help with that is out of scope.&#34;</p><p><strong>More on OpenAI:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-electricity-use-spiking-power-entire-country"><em>AI&#39;s Electricity Use Is Spiking So Fast It&#39;ll Soon Use as Much Power as an Entire Country</em></a></p></div></div>
