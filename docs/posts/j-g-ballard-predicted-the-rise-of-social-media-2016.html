<p>Say you were a fan of Steven Spielberg’s mov­ing com­ing-of-age dra­ma <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, set in a Japan­ese intern­ment camp dur­ing World War II and star­ring a young Chris­t­ian Bale. Say you read the <a href="http://amzn.to/1pLgbCQ">auto­bi­o­graph­i­cal nov­el</a> on which that film is based, writ­ten by one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard">J.G. Bal­lard</a>. Say you enjoyed it so much, you decid­ed to read more of the author’s work, like, say, <a href="http://amzn.to/1pLgi18">1973’s <em>Crash</em></a>, a nov­el about peo­ple who devel­op a sex­u­al fetish around wounds sus­tained in staged auto­mo­bile acci­dents. Or you pick up its pre­de­ces­sor, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Rq5r5Q" rel="nofollow">The Atroc­i­ty Exhi­bi­tion</a></em>, a book <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/the-outlaw-2">William S. Bur­roughs</a> described as stir­ring “sex­u­al depths untouched by the hard­est-core illus­trat­ed porn.” Or per­haps you stum­ble upon <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Rq5w9w">Con­crete Island</a></em>, a warped take on Defoe that strands a wealthy archi­tect and his Jaguar on a high­way inter­sec­tion.</p>



<p>You may expe­ri­ence some dis­so­nance. Who was this Bal­lard? A real­ist chron­i­cler of 20th cen­tu­ry hor­rors; per­verse explor­er of—in Bur­roughs’ words—“the non­sex­u­al roots of sex­u­al­i­ty”; sci-fi satirist of the bleak post-indus­tri­al waste­lands of moder­ni­ty? He was all of these, and more. Bal­lard was a bril­liant futur­ist and his <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5221560/remembering-jg-ballards-science-fiction-legacy">dystopi­an nov­els and short sto­ries</a> antic­i­pat­ed the 80s cyber­punk of William Gib­son, explor­ing with a twist­ed sense of humor what Jean Lyotard famous­ly dubbed in 1979 <em><a href="http://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Lyotard_Jean-Francois_The_Postmodern_Condition_A_Report_on_Knowledge.pdf">The Post­mod­ern Con­di­tion</a></em>: a state of ide­o­log­i­cal, sci­en­tif­ic, per­son­al, and social dis­in­te­gra­tion under the reign of a tech­no­crat­ic, hyper­cap­i­tal­ist, “com­put­er­ized soci­ety.” Bal­lard had his own term for it: “media land­scape,” and his dark visions of the future often cor­re­spond to the vir­tu­al world we inhab­it today.</p>

<p>In addi­tion to his fic­tion­al cre­ations, Bal­lard made sev­er­al <a href="http://biographile.kinja.com/back-to-the-future-the-eerily-accurate-predictions-of-1669123401" rel="nofollow">dis­turbing­ly accu­rate pre­dic­tions</a> in inter­views he gave over the decades (col­lect­ed in a book titled <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1pLgxJC">Extreme Metaphors</a></em>). In 1987—with the film adap­ta­tion of <em>Empire of the Sun</em> just on the hori­zon and “his most extreme work <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Rq5RsR">Crash</a></em> re-released in the USA to warmer reac­tion,” he gave an <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/jg-ballard-predicted-social-media-in-i-d-27-years-ago">inter­view to <em>I‑D</em> mag­a­zine</a> in which he pre­dict­ed the inter­net as “invis­i­ble streams of data puls­ing down lines to pro­duce an invis­i­ble loom of world com­merce and infor­ma­tion.” This may not seem espe­cial­ly pre­scient (see, for exam­ple, E.M. Forster’s 1909 “<a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a>” for a chill­ing futur­is­tic sce­nario much fur­ther ahead of its time). But Bal­lard went on to describe in detail the rise of the Youtube celebri­ty:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Every home will be trans­formed into its own TV stu­dio. We’ll all be simul­ta­ne­ous­ly actor, direc­tor and screen­writer in our own soap opera. Peo­ple will start screen­ing them­selves. They will become their own TV pro­grammes. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The themes of celebri­ty obses­sion and tech­no­log­i­cal­ly con­struct­ed real­i­ties res­onate in almost all of Ballard’s work and thought, and ten years ear­li­er, in an essay for <em>Vogue</em>, he described in detail the spread of social media and its total­iz­ing effects on our lives. In the tech­no­log­i­cal future, he wrote, “each of us will be both star and sup­port­ing play­er.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Every one of our actions dur­ing the day, across the entire spec­trum of domes­tic life, will be instant­ly record­ed on video-tape. In the evening we will sit back to scan the rush­es, select­ed by a com­put­er trained to pick out only our best pro­files, our wit­ti­est dia­logue, our most affect­ing expres­sions filmed through the kind­est fil­ters, and then stitch these togeth­er into a height­ened re-enact­ment of the day. Regard­less of our place in the fam­i­ly peck­ing order, each of us with­in the pri­va­cy of our own rooms will be the star in a con­tin­u­al­ly unfold­ing domes­tic saga, with par­ents, hus­bands, wives and chil­dren demot­ed to an appro­pri­ate sup­port­ing role.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Though Bal­lard thought in terms of film and television—and though we our­selves play the role of the select­ing com­put­er in his scenario—this descrip­tion almost per­fect­ly cap­tures the behav­ior of the aver­age user of Face­book, Insta­gram, etc. (See Bal­lard in the inter­view clip above dis­cuss fur­ther “the pos­si­bil­i­ties of gen­uine­ly inter­ac­tive vir­tu­al real­i­ty” and his the­o­ry of the 50s as the “blue­print” of mod­ern tech­no­log­i­cal cul­ture and the “sub­ur­ban­iza­tion” of real­i­ty.) In addi­tion to the <em>Vogue</em> essay, Bal­lard wrote a 1977 short sto­ry called “The Inten­sive Care Unit,” in which—<a href="http://www.ballardian.com/j-g-ballard-predicts-social-media-cctv-reality-tv" rel="nofollow">writes the site Bal­lar­dian</a>—“ordi­nances are in place to pre­vent peo­ple from meet­ing in per­son. All inter­ac­tion is medi­at­ed through per­son­al cam­eras and TV screens.”</p>
<p>So what did Bal­lard, who died in 2009, think of the post-inter­net world he lived to see and expe­ri­ence? He <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/17952/1/jg-ballard-interviewed">dis­cussed the sub­ject in 2003 in an inter­view with rad­i­cal pub­lish­er V. Vale</a> (who re-issued <em>The Atroc­i­ty Exhi­bi­tion</em>). “Now every­body can doc­u­ment them­selves in a way that was incon­ceiv­able 30, 40, 50 years ago,” Bal­lard notes, “I think this reflects a tremen­dous hunger among peo­ple for ‘reality’—for ordi­nary real­i­ty. It’s very dif­fi­cult to find the ‘real,’ because the envi­ron­ment is total­ly man­u­fac­tured.” Like <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/baudlldsimulTnmainframe.html">Jean Bau­drillard</a>, anoth­er pre­scient the­o­rist of post­moder­ni­ty, Bal­lard saw this loss of the “real” com­ing many decades ago. As he told <em>I‑D</em> in 1987, “in the media land­scape it’s almost impos­si­ble to sep­a­rate fact from fic­tion.”</p>
