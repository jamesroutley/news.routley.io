    <h1>Ask HN: Has meetup.org been replaced by anything?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In ~2015 when I was living in Chicago and frequently traveling, I could reliably find something interesting to do through Meetup.org. It seems that that are far fewer things being listed now. Are there really fewer things being organized in general or have people gravitated to another site/app?</p></div></div>
