<p>This book is designed to help C++ programmers learn Rust. It provides translations of common C++ patterns into idiomatic Rust. Each pattern is described through concrete code examples along with high-level discussion of engineering trade-offs.</p>
<p>The book can be read front-to-back, but it is designed to be used random-access.
When you are writing Rust code and think, &#34;I know how to do this in C++ but not Rust,&#34; then
look for the corresponding chapter in this book.</p>
<p>This book was hand-written by expert C++ and Rust programmers at Brown University&#39;s <a href="https://cel.cs.brown.edu/">Cognitive Engineering Lab</a>. Our goal is provide accurate information with a tasteful degree of detail. No text in this book was written by AI.</p>
<p>If you would like updates on when we add new chapters to this book, you can <a href="https://forms.gle/rcrdZihmT81LWy6F6">drop your email here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a href="#other-resources">Other resources</a></h2>
<p>If you have zero Rust experience, you might consider first reading <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/">The Rust Programming
Language</a> or getting a quick overview at <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/rust/">Learn X in Y Minutes</a>.</p>
<p>If you are primarily an embedded systems programmer using C or C++, this book is
a complement to <a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/">The Embedded Rust Book</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to resources like the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/">Rustonomicon</a> and <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists</a>, this book is less about &#34;Rust behind the scenes&#34; and more about explicitly describing how Rust works in terms of C++.</p>
