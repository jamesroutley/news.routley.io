    <h1>Dubai real estate data leak – Exposes criminals, officials, and politicians</h1>

It was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24, which coordinated an investigation into the real estate.</p><p>The leak provides the first detailed public overview of those who bought property in this important Middle Eastern financial center. In this initial phase of the project, reporters focused on the European names on the list.</p><p>Many of them are residents or legitimate investors. But reporters identified many owners of Dubai real estate who have been accused or convicted of crimes or are under international sanctions. Others are public officials who have not declared their assets or whose ownership of pricey properties is difficult to square with their known incomes.</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">Russian elite</h2><p>They include more than 100 members of Russia&#39;s political elite, public officials, or businesspeople close to the Kremlin, as well as dozens of Europeans implicated in money laundering and corruption. Several European officials and lawmakers who have been accused of mishandling public funds are also among the listed owners — and some have failed to officially declare their Dubai properties.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>MØTTE PUTIN: Baisarov hadde flere møter med Putin i fjor.

In practice, this means wanted criminal suspects can hide out in Dubai to avoid facing justice.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>RULER: Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, and ruler of the Emirate of Dubai.</span><span> FAYEZ NURELDINE / AFP</span></figcaption></figure><p>Representatives of the United Arab Emirates’ Foreign Office and the Dubai Land Department did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. But the UAE Embassy in Oslo did provide a statement to E24, OCCRP, and their media partners.</p><p>«The allegations made with regard to Dubai property ownership records are factually inaccurate. The UAE operates clear regulatory frameworks that comply with international laws and standards designed to combat financial crime,» the Embassy said. </p><p>«Dubai Land Department processes and activities are a cornerstone of these efforts.»</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">A Real-Estate Blind Spot</h2><p>Dubai is a sheikhdom with internal autonomy and is part of the United Arab Emirates. But it has built its economy around being a home for expatriates.</p><p>In the 1990s, the emirate’s oil revenues plummeted and its leadership began looking abroad for investments. It found its path forward in real estate, constructing scores of new residential developments, the tallest building in the world, and two artificial peninsulas shaped like palm trees. (One was never finished due to the financial crisis of 2008, when many real estate projects ground to a halt due to credit shortages.)</p><p>Since then, real estate development has been a significant source of income for the emirate, attracting foreign capital and wealthy people from around the world. Today, Dubai has three million residents, but only half a million are Emirati nationals.</p><p>The leak of property data examined by reporters includes a total of 800,000 Dubai properties owned by 274,000 private individuals and companies from around the world. It shows that the average owner in Dubai possesses more than three properties.</p><p>– Until now, no one has had this kind of information about the whole real estate market in such a well-known tax haven, says Annette Alstadsæter, a professor of tax economics and director of the Skatteforsk Centre for Tax Research at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>Annette Alstadsæter, professor of tax economics and director of the Skatteforsk Centre for Tax Research at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.</span><span> Foto: Javad Parsa / VG</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alstadsæter leads an international group of academics who are now researching the leaked material and will publish their findings shortly in conjunction with this investigation.</p><p>Based on publicly available information on property prices, the researchers estimate that foreign individuals and companies have invested over $145 billion in Dubai&#39;s housing market. In comparison, offshore-owned real estate in London, also considered a major hub for foreign property investors, was<a aria-label=" estimated to be worth $66 billion in 2019" href="http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Bomare2019.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> estimated to be worth $66 billion in 2019</a>.</p><p>People and companies connected to Europe and Russia — the focus of this investigation — own more than $31 billion of this total.</p><p>Not all properties in the leak belong to individuals. A substantial portion are owned by shell companies registered in other tax havens. For this reason, the actual beneficial owners of these properties are often unknown.</p><p>– The estimates for specific countries and regions only include properties for which we have been able to assign a country to the owner. A substantial portion of the properties - in total worth USD 99 billion - belong to owners whose country of the actual and benefiting owners is still uncertain, says Andreas Økland, doctoral fellow at NMBU and one of the researchers working on the Dubai-leak.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>RESEARCHER: Andreas Økland, doctoral fellow at NMBU and one of the researchers working on the Dubai-leak.</span><span> Privat</span></figcaption></figure><p>This makes up seven percent of the owners and almost 20 percent of the property market in terms of net value, explains Økland.</p><p>– This is the first time we have an actual evident sum of net worth of both offshore and locally owned properties in a tax haven, says Gabriel Zucman, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Zucman is one of the world&#39;s leading experts on tax havens. He heads the EU tax observatory hosted by the Paris School of Economics has followed the research into leaked data from Dubai and co-authors an upcoming report on the subject.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>ECONOMIST: French economist Gabriel Zucman speaks during a news conference on the launch of the European Tax Observatory, in Brussels, last year.</span><span> Photo: Francois Walschaerts / Reuters</span></figcaption></figure><p>– Until recently we could not address this kind of hidden wealth with concrete numbers, but this leak changes that. This project is a first step of shedding light on the rise of investments in real estate in tax havens as part of the broader globalization. It has not been studied much before because of the lack of data, Zucman says.</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">Moscow on the Gulf</h2><p>A noteworthy glimpse into Russian property ownership in Dubai was provided last year by the team of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.</p><p>In December, his Anti-Corruption Foundation published a <a aria-label="lengthy investigation" href="https://navalny.com/p/6579/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link">lengthy investigation</a> into Alexander Borodai, a Russian lawmaker who bought a 104-square-meter apartment in the luxurious Grandeur Residences-Maurya complex on Palm Jumeirah, an elite man-made peninsula in the shape of a palm.</p><p>Borodai bought the apartment, worth over $400,000, in 2015, just as his star was rising in Russian politics.</p><div role="presentation" data-test-tag="gallery" aria-label="Galleri med 2 bilder"><figcaption data-test-tag="gallery:figcaption"><span>IN UKRAINE: Alexander Borodai (blue) in 2014 with body guards close to where Malaysian airlines-plane carrying 298 peopler was shot down by seperatists .</span><p><span>1 av 2</span><span>DOMINIQUE FAGET / AFP</span></p></figcaption></div><p>In early 2014, he became «prime minister» of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed and internationally unrecognized pro-Russian statelet in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. He held that post for roughly four months before ceding it to a Donetsk local and becoming his deputy.</p><p>He returned to Russia and, in 2021, was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, as a member of the ruling United Russia party. He did not list his Dubai apartment in his mandatory asset declaration.</p><p>The data in the C4ADS leak matches the findings of Navalny’s team, confirming that Borodai — who is under U.S., EU, U.K., Swiss, Canadian, and Australian sanctions — owns the apartment.</p><p>It also includes much more: As it turns out, more than 5,300 citizens and people connected to the Russian Federation are listed as owning over 9,700 properties in Dubai, making Russians among the largest groups of foreign real estate investors there. </p><p>Though most are little-known private individuals, others are prominent politicians, state officials, and oligarchs.</p><p>Roman Lyabikhov, another Duma lawmaker, is also listed as owning a Dubai property: a 109-square-meter apartment in the Amwaj 4 building, part of an older development in the Dubai Marina area. It is worth approximately $430,000. Like his fellow legislator, he also did not list it in his asset declaration.</p><p>He is under U.S., U.K., EU, and Canadian sanctions.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>EKSLUSIVT: Ekslusive Dubai Marina er en favoritt blant mange kjøpere.

He has reportedly lived in Europe since 2010, after he was forced to sell his majority share in the Russian mineral fertilizer producer Uralkali to three well-connected Russian businessmen.</p><p>Rybolovlev, a Cypriot citizen, is currently majority shareholder and president of the AS Monaco soccer club. In 2018, a judge in Monaco named the Russian oligarch a formal suspect in a corruption investigation, alleging that he had used gifts and football tickets to influence local law enforcement in a conflict with an art dealer.</p><p>That was not Rybolovlev’s first tangle with controversy. In 2008, he purchased a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from Donald Trump for $95 million — netting the future U.S. president a reported $54 million in profit. That would later draw scrutiny after Trump was elected president and faced accusations that Russia had conspired to help him win the election. Rybolovlev later sold off the property.</p><p>Another prominent Russian who appears in the leak is Ruslan Baisarov, who is listed as owning five apartments in the Tiara Residences, a group of luxury high-rises on Palm Jumeirah’s trunk, and a villa on the Palm’s al Bumaan frond.</p><p>Together, the six properties are worth about $8.5 million.</p><p>Baisarov is known for his close ties to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been implicated in grave violations of human rights, including torture, and has supplied soldiers and military resources to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year.</p><div role="presentation" data-test-tag="gallery" aria-label="Galleri med 2 bilder"><figcaption data-test-tag="gallery:figcaption"><span>SAMARBEIDET: Baisarov bygget Kadyrovs prestisjefylte skianlegg i Veduchi utenfor hovedstaden Groznyj.</span><p><span>1 av 2</span><span>Musa Sadulayev / Ap</span></p></figcaption></div><p>Baisarov has financed Kadyrov’s prestigious<a aria-label=" Veduchi ski resort " href="https://tass.com/russia/713286?utm_source=google.com&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=google.com&amp;utm_referrer=google.com" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> Veduchi ski resort </a>outside the Chechen capital Grozny, supported the Chechen leader’s<a aria-label=" sometimes-bizzare projects" href="https://ph.news.yahoo.com/tears-mohammed-relic-brought-chechnya-191458332.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> sometimes-bizzare projects</a>, and made public appearances with him,<a aria-label=" including " href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-st-petersburg-russia-19th-june-2015-ruslan-baisarov-2nd-l-front-chairman-84385982.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> including </a>at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.

Two companies Kinahan co-founded over the years have listed the same unit, number 3005, as their office, according to business records and a <a aria-label="recent article in the Irish Times" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/the-kinahan-files-leaked-documents-expose-workings-of-global-empire-1.4859293?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fcrime-and-law%2Fthe-kinahan-files-leaked-documents-expose-workings-of-global-empire-1.4859293" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link">recent article in the Irish Times</a>.</p><p>Information about Kinahan’s passport and Emirates ID in the leak suggests he acquired this property between the spring of 2017 and January 2018. At that time, his alleged involvement in drug trafficking had already been publicly known for years.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>ETTERLYST: Irsk politisjef foran plakaten med etterlysningen av Kinahan i april.</span><span> Foto: Niall Carson / Pa Photos</span></figcaption></figure><p> A<a aria-label=" U.S. diplomatic cable " href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09FREETOWN462_a.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> U.S. diplomatic cable </a>sent from Sierra Leone to Belgium in 2009, and published two years later by Wikileaks, named Kinahan and described him as “an Irish businessman involved in narcotrafficking throughout Europe and currently the target of a major investigation.”</p><p>The «Kinahan Organized Crime Group» (KOCG) has operated in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United Arab Emirates for years. Irish and U.K. courts have concluded that the group is involved in international drugs and firearms trafficking and in international money laundering.</p><p>«The KOCG also frequently uses Dubai as a facilitation hub for its illicit activities» and the activity has led to numerous murders, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement last month, announcing sanctions on Kinahan and other members of the group.</p><p>The announcement followed a major investigation involving multiple police agencies, and the U.S. ambassador to Ireland has announced a $5 million reward to anyone who helps arrest Kinahan or his father or brother, who are also sanctioned.</p><p>Kinahan has <a aria-label="denied" href="https://www.ft.com/content/96082e8e-bcf2-441b-b5d4-1805f5f5874d" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link">denied</a> being a crime boss.</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">Convicted owners</h2><p>Journalists in several countries have gathered and reviewed available court records on individuals listed as owners of Dubai real estate in the leak.</p><p>In Norway journalists have found that convicted criminals and people facing criminal charges own approximately 20 percent of all properties registered to current Norwegian residents and some former residents who fled Norway for Dubai to escape charges at home.</p><p>The offences include cases of large-scale drug smuggling, bank fraud, tax and VAT fraud, multiple robberies, violence and illegal possession of firearms. On average, the owners in the leak who are linked to crimes in Norway own more than two properties each, more than other owners.</p><p>– Almost one in five properties belonging to criminals is a high number. It is worrying, says State Attorney Petter Nordeng of the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic Crime.</p><p>– This gives rise to suspicion that proceeds of criminal acts in Norway have been used to buy property in Dubai, says Nordeng.</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">Skipping taxes</h2><p>All individual taxpayers in Norway and Denmark are required to report ownership of property abroad to their national authorities. Foreign real estate is a subject to tax in both countries.</p><p>Probes by journalists in Norway and Denmark show that few listed owners of Dubai properties report that property to their national tax authorities as required.</p><p>214 of the registered owners of real estate in Dubai were tax residents of Norway by the end of 2019.</p><p>However, that year only 39 Norwegian taxpayers reported to own property in the UAE to the Norwegian tax authorities, according to aggregated data received through a freedom of information request.</p><p>– These are very interesting findings and high numbers that shed light on a segment and networks in which we are particularly interested, says department director Erik Nilsen at the Norwegian Tax Administration task force on criminal activity.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>– VERY INTERESTING: Department director Erik Nilsen at the Norwegian Tax Administration task force on criminal activity.</span><span> Fredrick Christian Ekeseth / VG</span></figcaption></figure><p>Journalists have revealed a similar pattern in Denmark:</p><p>507 individuals listed as owners are Danish nationals or have ties to Denmark in the Dubai data leak. Only 38 Danish taxpayers did in fact report owning property in Dubai on their tax returns at the end of 2019, according to information provided following a request for information.</p><p>Consequently, the government has potentially missed out on millions of dollars in tax revenues each year.</p><p>– It is not illegal to own properties in Dubai. However, the unique insights provided by journalists show that most properties are in fact not reported. This indicates that these properties are hidden and that taxes are evaded, says professor Alstadsæter.</p><h2 data-test-tag="paragraph-header">Meat and cryptocurrency</h2><p>Another colorful character who appears in the data is Francesco Giordano, a Milan-based businessman who works in the meat industry. </p><p>Giordano and his business partner, Larisa Andreea Hangiu, are listed as owning three apartments together in Dubai. They’re also listed as owning one apartment each separately. Together, these properties are worth over $550,000.</p><p>Giordano’s business selling meat back home in Italy may explain these assets — but that might not be the whole story.</p><p>In 2018, Giordano was arrested by the Italian anti-mafia police along with 27 other people and charged with tax evasion.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>UCHARTERED ISLANDS: Man made islands of the coast are ready to house more rich people looking for a place in the sun.</span><span> Ole Martin Wold</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to investigators, he had established a complex network of companies in northern Italy through which he dodged taxes on the profits from his business. He then laundered the money to companies in Apulia, his home region, with the help of a local mafiosi.</p><p>Through a network of nominees, they withdrew cash from the bank and stashed it in various locations, including the walls of villas. Hangiu was also charged after police found cash hidden in her villa outside Milan.</p><p>The police seized 27 companies, luxurious villas, and cars. No Dubai assets were found at the time. However, in 2015 Giordano was stopped by customs officers at an Italian airport while on his way to the Emirates carrying over 200,000 euros in checks and cash.</p><p>Two years later, thanks to a wiretapped conversation, the police discovered that a crooked cop had tipped Gioradano off that he was under investigation for money laundering and that the police knew he was laundering his profits into restaurants in Rome and Dubai.</p><p>In February 2022, Italian prosecutors charged Giordano, Hangiu and 73 other people with 180 million euros’ worth of international tax evasion. Giordano is currently in pre-trial detention.</p><p>Neither his lawyer nor Hangiu responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Evading taxes on meat profits sounds old-fashioned. But another European with Dubai property allegedly had a much more modern criminal enterprise.</p><p>According to the leak, Tibor Bokor, a Czech venture capitalist, is listed as owning three apartments in Dubai worth $455,000.</p><p>He previously served as the executive director of a sanctioned Czech-registered cryptocurrency exchange based in Moscow. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the exchange, called SUEX OTC, last year,<a aria-label=" alleging " href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link"> alleging </a>that 40 percent of its transaction history was associated with illicit actors. It was the first case of the U.S. imposing sanctions on a cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>The emirate is also reportedly the hideaway of a Slovak businessman wanted on corruption charges. Miroslav Výboh was a well-known lawyer and lobbyist and had even served as Monaco’s honorary consul in Slovakia.</p><figure data-test-tag="image"><figcaption data-test-tag="image:caption"><span>BYGGER: Dubai er fortsatt en gigantisk byggeplas, der stadig nye leilighetsbygg står klare for utenlandske kjøpere.</span><span> Foto: Ole Martin Wold</span></figcaption></figure><p>He has been sought by Slovak police since August 2021, when two of his alleged co-conspirators in a corrupt scheme related to IT service orders for a government agency were arrested.</p><p>Výboh himself could not be found at the time.

Construction was completed only in 2021, and the apartment is currently in a «shell and core» condition.</p><p>Due to the rise in UAE real estate prices, Výboh is currently trying to sell the apartment, Smejkal said.</p><p><strong>Extradition</strong></p><p>Many countries have bilateral or multilateral extradition treaties with other countries, enabling them to extradite their own or other nationals charged with criminal offences.</p><p>Police in several European countries have lists of people residing in Dubai they want prosecuted and imprisoned for serious crimes, but little hope of extraditing them in practice.</p><p>A <a aria-label="leaked" href="https://euobserver.com/world/153528" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-test-tag="external-link">leaked</a> report written by Europol last year details plans to target a number of expat crime bosses, described as «high-value targets», for extradition. Several drug cartels and violent criminals who live in Dubai were on the list. According to the document Dubai has emerged as a «key location for key organisers and money-laundering activities associated with the cocaine trade in the EU.»</p><p>Police from nine EU states, as well as non-members Norway, Switzerland, and the United States, were conducting joint operations «to locate and extradite the “untouchable” expat criminals and to confiscate their criminal assets».»</p><p><strong><em>With reporting by Pavla Holcova, Atanas Tchobanov, Ana Poenariu, Attila Biro, Cecilia Anesi, Francesca Cicculli, Edoardo Anziano, Riin Aljas, Oliver Kind, Márton Sarkadi Nagy, Zuzana Šotová.</em></strong></p></div></div>
