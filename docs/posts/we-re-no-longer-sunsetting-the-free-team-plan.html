<p>After listening to feedback and consulting our community, it’s clear that we made the wrong decision in sunsetting our Free Team plan. <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/we-apologize-we-did-a-terrible-job-announcing-the-end-of-docker-free-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last week</a> we felt our communications were terrible but our policy was sound. It’s now clear that both the communications and the policy were wrong, so we’re reversing course and no longer sunsetting the Free Team plan:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you’re currently on the Free Team plan, you no longer have to migrate to another plan by April 14. </li>



<li>Customers who upgraded from a Free Team subscription to a paid subscription between the sunsetting announcement on March 14 and today’s announcement will automatically receive a full refund for the transaction in the next 30 days, allowing them to use their new paid subscription for free for the duration of the term they purchased.</li>



<li>Customers who requested a migration to a Personal or Pro plan will be kept on their current Free Team plan. (Or they can choose to open a new Personal or Pro account via our website.)</li>



<li>In the past 10 days we received &amp; accepted more applications for our <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker-Sponsored Open Source program</a> (DSOS) than we did in the previous year. We encourage eligible open source projects to continue to apply and are currently processing applications within a couple of business days.</li>
</ul>



<p>For more details, you can <a href="https://www.docker.com/developers/free-team-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit our FAQ</a>. We apologize for both the communications and the policy, and vow to be an ever-more trustworthy community member in the future.</p>
