    <h1>Ask HN: I Need to Talk to Someone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Laid off 6 months ago. Was on an H1-B visa. Moved to spouse’s dependent visa. I have just around year left on my H1-B and my previous employer was mid way through the PERM process when they laid me off.</p><p>Most companies don’t want to hire me because of the delays in the processing of PERM these days since I have just a year left. And I just recently switched careers from construction to data.</p><p>Feeling really hopeless and alone. My spouse has a good job, but this stress of not getting any work has been devastating to me. It took me around 8 months of job searching to find a role as a career switcher and now I’m back to square one in a bad market. I don’t have anybody I can talk to and just want to talk about my problems.</p><p>I’m parked outside a Burger King parking lot in the car by myself and don’t have a clue on what I should do.</p><p>Feeling hopeless.</p></div></div></div>
