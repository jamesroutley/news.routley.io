                Bing Search APIs are invoiced based on number of transactions (also known as API calls). These plans are pay-as-you-go and doesn’t incur additional cost for complex queries and more than 10 results (up to 50 results in most cases).

    <div>
        <p>
                If you happen to exceed the mentioned number of transactions per second (TPS), your usage will be throttled to be within the mentioned limit. If your application needs to have higher TPS than the ones mentioned on this page, please reach out to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/create-ticket/" aria-label="Contact our support team.">support team</a>.

    <div>
        <p>
                For billing purposes, a transaction is a successful Bing API call request (though there are caveats for DoS attacks). For logging and reporting purposes such as for the Bing Statistics Add-in, it is any Bing API call irrespective of whether it is successful or not.

                You can change the tier of service anytime. Please make sure you use appropriate keys in your API calls. If you are having enterprise agreement with Microsoft, please work with your account executive.

                No, Bing Custom Search is curtailed to meet specific offering of each Tier. For example, Tier S3 is meant for customers wanting to utilize only custom web results and custom image results for their selected set of domains. The S3 Tier also offers statistics capabilities. The API response will differ depending on the endpoint called within a specific tier. Each endpoint has its own response schema.

                Tiers are priced based on the number of transactions. As an example, for Tier S3, the price per 1,000 transactions is $6 and for Tier S4, the price per 10,000 transactions is $4. At the end of the billing period, if 20,000 transactions are logged for the Tier S3 and 40,000 transactions are logged for the Tier S4, then the total will be $136 calculated as $6*(20,000/1,000) + $4*(40,000/10,000).

                The Custom Autosuggest feature is offered as a separate tier than Tier S4. Custom Autosuggest can be purchased separately and can be incorporated to get auto suggestions for either S1, S2 or S3 Tiers. For example, if a customer wants to use S1 Tier and S4 tier, they will need to buy both the tiers separately and the billing will work as follows:<br/></p><p>If in S1 Tier a customer has used a total of 3,000 transactions and in S4 tier if a customer has used a total of 40,000 transactions, then the total billing will be $28 calculated as $4*(3,000/1,000) + $4*(40,000/10,000).</p>
