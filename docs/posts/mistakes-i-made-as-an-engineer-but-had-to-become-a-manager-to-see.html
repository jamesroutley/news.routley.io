    <h1>Mistakes I made as an engineer, but had to become a manager to see</h1>

Each time, I didn’t pay attention and stayed focused on my projects.</p><p><span>As a manager, I now have a higher-level view of how everyone is doing. It’s much more obvious how people problems affect the team even before anyone decides to leave. </span><strong>Having motivated, happy teammates is critical to getting things done</strong><span>. For that reason, people problems are just as important as problems with the code itself.</span></p><p>I always ignored hiring when I was an engineer. It felt like a side hobby compared to shipping projects that had business impact. After hiring 3 engineers last year and seeing the impact they are having, I’m shocked at how wrong I was.</p><p><span>Think about it this way - even if you work extra hours, you might only be able to contribute an additional 50% to your team if you’re lucky. But, </span><strong>if you hire just one strong engineer, your team gains an additional 100% of your productivity</strong><span>. Not to mention that hiring takes much less time than working longer hours.</span></p><p>When I was a junior engineer, I only focused on my code. I never went to social events because I was so focused on having an impact. Although I was a little extreme, many engineers tend to share a similar mindset.</p><p><span>The problem is that </span><strong>all projects of consequence come from working together with others</strong><span>. If you don’t build connections with relevant people, you’ll realize it only too late when you reach out and they aren’t responsive.</span></p><p>I was lucky to have an excellent manager that made it so that other teams helped me and my teammates. Now that a large part of my job is to do the same, I see how important it is.</p><p><strong>Junior engineers often focus a little too much on just the code</strong><span>. There are plenty of other areas where a small time investment will go a long way. Learn from my mistakes to get ahead of this.</span></p><p><strong>Over to you: How would you rate yourself when it comes to these? Are you blind like I was?</strong></p><p><span>Thanks for reading,</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
