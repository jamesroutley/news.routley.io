    <h1>The Truth Matters and Secular Humanists Should Defend It</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-165082">


 <div>
<p>There is nothing more essential to secular humanism than the truth. Secular humanists are the people who looked at thousands of years of received authority and said, “Yeah, sorry, no.” We needed more than ancient books and the near universal buy-in by everyone else to convince us that supernaturalism is real. We needed empirical evidence.</p>
<p>When none was forthcoming, we drew the necessary conclusions.</p>
<p>That means the truth matters to us. It matters more than our acceptance by the faith-infused wider society. It matters more than our reputation as being neither upstanding nor moral (an undeserved slander on us, of course). It matters more than our standing in the community. And for some, it matters more than maintaining family relationships.</p>
<p>But the truth is under a sustained assault right now, and secular humanists need to stand up for it, even when that is hard.</p>
<p>It was relatively easy for most of us to condemn the allergic-to-truth rantings of former President Donald Trump. His lies were so transparent and prodigious that anyone outside the MAGA-verse could easily see through them. Many of us collectively recoiled at the reality-distortions he spun and how they were lapped up with religious-like zeal by his followers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of how America’s right wing is a danger to truth-seeking institutions and standards. That is not what I want to focus on.</p>
<p>Because there is also truth-slaying happening in progressive circles generally in the name of social justice. And because so many secular humanists lean toward liberalism, it is here that we need to shine a light and, frankly, stop the insanity.</p>
<p>I commend to everyone Jerry Coyne’s terrific blog <em>Why Evolution Is True</em> (https://whyevolutionistrue.com/), which you can subscribe to for free. An emeritus biology professor at the University of Chicago and a classical liberal himself, Coyne has been closely following the excesses and illiberalism of the woke Left.</p>
<p>There is no more stark example than the ways science has been twisted to conform to a social justice agenda.</p>
<p>Coyne describes the controversy in New Zealand where there is an official government effort underway to equate the indigenous Maori system of knowledge called “Matauranga” with the scientific methods of conventional Western science and that this different way of knowing be taught in science classes.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>An appalled biology colleague of Coyne’s in New Zealand <u>described </u>some of the god stories of the Matauranga: “Tane the god of the forest is said to be the creator of humans, and of all plants and creatures of the forest. Rain happens when the goddess Papatuanuku sheds tears.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>There is some practical knowledge as part of the Matauranga, but much of its “science” is laden with superstitions, story-telling, and myths.</p>
<p>An obvious parallel is the teaching of creationism in science classes in the United States, which humanists reasonably decry as the injection of religion into a secular subject. As Richard Dawkins bluntly stated in a tweet on the issue: “Equally daft case for teaching Viking ‘ways of knowing’ in Norwegian science classes, Druid ‘ways of knowing’ in British science classes … Navajo, Kikuyu, Yanomamo ‘ways of knowing’ etc. All different. Truths about the universe don’t depend on which country you are in.”</p>
<p>Truth must be of higher value for secular humanists than acceding to equity demands from a minority group, no matter how sympathetic to them we may be.</p>
<p>A prime of science under siege by the social justice police—those who seek to impose their own view of social justice at the expense of free inquiry and the open-ended search for the truth—is in behavioral genetics. It’s a field that could not be more fraught. Any scientist who chooses to enter it risks being called a eugenicist or racist.</p>
<p>Kathryn Paige Harden’s excellent book <em>The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality</em> makes a progressive case for why we should accept what the data demonstrate, which is that a complex interplay of genes plays a role in personal development, educational attainment, and ultimately in life outcomes. The professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin studied the massive amount of data available to draw well-grounded conclusions that help explain how genes can exacerbate social inequality among individuals. She made no study of differences between racial or ethnic groups, but that hasn’t stopped critics<sup>3</sup> from trying to discredit her and suggest that the entire field of study is a subversively racist enterprise.</p>
<p>Then there is the current most radioactive subject of all: What medical interventions are appropriate for minors who may be suffering from gender dysphoria? This is a medical question with immense consequences, and the correct answer may depend on a range of individualized factors, making this highly politicized issue a medical quagmire.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Politics has elbowed in in disgraceful ways such as the order by Texas Governor Greg Abbott sending state investigators to inspect homes where minors are receiving gender affirming medical treatment, equating it with child abuse.<sup>5</sup> As if these families aren’t facing challenges enough.</p>
<p>But the political Left has also gotten ahead of the science in ways that could be seriously harmful for children. For instance, James Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project, promotes puberty blockers for children as a hormonal way to pause puberty while a minor is gaining clarity on their condition.<sup>6</sup> He calls the intervention “completely safe and totally reversible.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not a scientifically supportable statement. The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom says there is not enough data to draw that conclusion. The NHS website on treatment for gender dysphoria says “little is known” of the long-term side effects of puberty blockers and it is “not known” whether puberty blockers “affect the development of the teenage brain or children’s bones.”<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Legitimate questions have been raised not only about the appropriate age of medical interventions but whether young girls are at risk of being unduly influenced by social pressure to claim transgender status. This is not a big deal if all we are talking about is pronouns, but it is a very big deal once medical science is employed. Statistics from the United Kingdom indicate that 70 percent of those seeking to transition in the past decade are girls wanting to become boys,<sup>8</sup> which is significantly different from the past when by large margins males wanted to transition to female.</p>
<p>These questions are about getting at the truth. Yet just raising them is enough to bring down the wrath of the political Left and get you labeled a transphobe.</p>
<p>A recent column by the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who cofounded Heterodox Academy, said he warned back in 2016 that “the conflict between truth and social justice is likely to become unmanageable.”<sup>9</sup> Well, that time has come.</p>
<p>Haidt is resigning from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) because of a new rule. Now, to present a research paper at the SPSP annual conference, demonstrating excellent science is no longer enough. In addition, it has to advance “the equity, inclusion, and anti-racism goals of SPSP.”</p>
<p>Haidt is not opposed to anti-racism goals for SPSP.  But to force every speaker to demonstrate that their work promotes that goal inevitably will distort the science. Social psychologists may now be forced to fudge their findings to make their research fit this requirement even if their research simply has nothing to do with the issue or more concerningly draws conclusions that the social justice police would find untenable.</p>
<p>Finally, I urge every secular humanist to read Jonathan Rauch’s important book <em>The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth. </em>In clear terms, Rauch explains the dangers to our social order of abandoning not only the truth but the objective rules we use to test whether a claim is valid.</p>
<p>We cannot have differing rules based on the speaker’s skin color, gender, or political affiliation. No one has a higher claim to the truth because of their group identity. “Who you are does not count;” Rauch says, “the rules apply to everybody and persons are interchangeable.”</p>
<p>“Anyone who does try to shut down inquiry or debate, or anyone who tries to preordain the outcome of an inquiry or a debate, is by definition removing herself from the knowledge-making business,” Rauch writes.</p>
<p>This is a direct message to the social justice police to stop canceling people who have the audacity to challenge the latest progressive gospel. Because choking off dissent damages the essential underpinnings of a reality-based community. These actions, no matter how good the intentions, are helping to dismantle the knowledge-based world. The world that secular humanists are committed to supporting and protecting, and most importantly the world we need for all of us to continue to thrive.</p>
