<p>
In this document, the internals of PostgreSQL for database administrators and system developers are described.
</p>
</div>
-->

<p>
PostgreSQL is a well-designed open-source multi-purpose relational database system which is widely used throughout the world.
It is one huge system with the integrated subsystems, each of which has a particular complex feature and works with each other cooperatively.
Although understanding of the internal mechanism is crucial for both administration and integration using PostgreSQL, its hugeness and complexity prevent it.
The main purposes of this document are to explain how each subsystem works, and to provide the whole picture of PostgreSQL.

<p>
This document is based on the book I wrote in Japanese in 2012, and covers version 14 and earlier.

<!-- Given name: Hironobu / Family name: SUZUKI -->
<p>
I graduated from graduate school of information engineering (M.S. in Information Engineering),
have worked for several companies as a software developer and technical manager/director.
I published <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8+%E5%95%93%E4%BF%AE&amp;search-alias=books-jp&amp;text=%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8+%E5%95%93%E4%BF%AE&amp;sort=relevancerank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seven books</a> in the fields of database and system integration (4 PostgreSQL books and 3 MySQL books).
In June 2019, the <a href="https://item.jd.com/12527505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese book</a> of this document was published.
</p>

<p>
As a director of the Japan PostgreSQL Users Group (2010-2016), I organized the largest (non-commercial) technical <a href="http://www.postgresql.jp/wg/shikumi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seminar/lecture</a> of PostgreSQL in Japan for more than six years,
and also served as the program committee chair of the Japan PostgreSQL Conference in 2013 and as a member in 2008 and 2009.
</p>

<p>
In 2021, I released <a href="https://github.com/s-hironobu/pg_plan_inspector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_plan_inspector</a> that is a framework to monitor and improve the performance of PostgreSQL using Machine Learning methods.
</p>

<p>
Cuando era joven,  vivió en Sudamérica por unos años. Recientemente, a veces vuelve a allí.
</p>

<p>
Now I live in Zürich.
<!--
<br />
I love Swiss and like the company I work for, however, I would like to challenge applying ML and AI technologies to DBMS, and also it has been cleard that I cannot expect a salary increase anymore due to the company’s financial problems
-->
<!--
even though I am working below <a href="http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=210&loctype=1&job=783&jobtype=3" target="_blank">the average Swiss salary</a> compared to my experience.

I love Zürich and like the company I work for, so I am working below <a href="http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=210&loctype=1&job=783&jobtype=3" target="_blank">the average Swiss salary</a> compared to my experience.
I wanted to raise my salary since Swiss is expensive everything, however, the company refused it because of their financial problems whose cause is that they built a luxurious company building with a gym, despite being under this pandemic.
I realized it was time to look for my next job in Swiss or the EU.
