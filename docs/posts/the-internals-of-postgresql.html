<p>Since publishing my content, I’ve been fortunate to receive a lot of positive feedback, which is truly gratifying.
However, unfortunately, I’ve encountered individuals in the past who tried to misuse my content for self-promotion <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<!--
However, unfortunately, I've had to deal with some unpleasant experiences in the past.
Here are a few examples:

- Repeated Manuscript Requests: Several individuals persistently requested my entire text for proofreading purposes.
Their intention, however, became clear soon: to plagiarize my work.
Althgough I offered them to ask proofreading a portion and I then review their results, they persisted to get all source (text + html framework) at once.
- Deceptive Publishing Proposal: One person pressured me to publish a book under his company name, not my name.
He misrepresented his motives, claiming he wanted to make my content widely recognized for my benefit, not his company's.
- Unauthorized Translations: I've encountered requests to surrender the text and rights for unauthorized translations into various languages several times.

These include companies that are still active in the PostgreSQL community.
