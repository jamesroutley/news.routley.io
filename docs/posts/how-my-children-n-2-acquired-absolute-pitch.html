    <h1>How my children (n=2) acquired absolute pitch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>We were sitting outdoors in a café, wrapping up lunch on a warm summer afternoon, when my 5-year-old son started banging on the metal table in front of us. “Mommy, what’s this sound?” “It’s the sound of you banging on the table. And it’s quite annoying. Could you please stop?” My kids burst into laughter. “No, mommy, it’s F sharp!”</span></p><p><span>Both of my sons have absolute pitch (AP). This means that they can produce and identify musical pitches without any reference notes. If I ask them to sing a </span><em>do</em><span>, they instantaneously retrieve the exact pitch from memory and sing it. For my older son this ability has translated into what seems like a stunning effortlessness when it comes to his music lessons. He finds it easy to sit down at his instrument and improvise in any key. He composes beautiful music. He has been taking piano for a few years now, and even though he practices no more than 30 minutes a day on average, if he’s motivated, he can learn to play a simple Chopin composition within a week or two. </span></p><p>And he never struggles with memorizing the music he is assigned. It’s enough that he listens to a piece and practices it a few times: the music then plays in his head, and since he has the exact sound-to-note and sound-to-key mapping embedded in his brain, remembering what the piece sounds like translates into remembering how to recreate it. He often improvises his fingering on the spot, too, which tells me he doesn’t rely on his muscle memory a lot either. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png" width="1456" height="515" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:515,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:48269,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7750c66-6f81-4c67-a7f4-965a3cddef60_2080x736.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Based on a pun courtesy of my younger son. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Neither my husband nor I have absolute pitch.

I think it was her writing that sparked my interest in running my n=2 experiment to see if I can help my children develop a good ear, despite my initial skepticism. And skeptical I was. The culture I grew up in, especially my family culture, was that of a strong belief in genetic determinism, particularly when it came to musical talent. But Deutsch’s writing was intriguing enough for me to start questioning my long-held beliefs. For example, I appreciated her discussion of how children who grow up speaking a tonal language are more likely to develop/retain perfect pitch. You might think it probably has something to do with genes, but it doesn’t seem to be the case. The more fluent Asian students are in a tonal language, the more likely they are to have AP. And if they don’t speak a tonal language at all, they fare no better on AP tests than Caucasian students. </span></p><p><span>Let me highlight two other studies that influenced by thinking on this subject. One is </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-14218-007" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the research done by Jenny Saffran</a><span>, suggesting that all 8-month old babies have sensitivity to absolute pitch. The other is a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0305735612463948" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Japanese investigation</a><span> of 24 children, aged 2 to 6, who were intentionally trained to retain/acquire AP. (All but 2 who dropped out successfully acquired the ability through the training.) </span></p><p><span>Now, to be clear, I was far from convinced that AP can be taught when I first started teaching music to my boys. Yes, sure, there were all those studies, but there are </span><em>always</em><span> studies to support your pet hypothesis… as well as the other guy’s pet hypothesis that just happens to run completely counter to yours. (Excuse my epistemic helplessness here — as a mother of young kids I didn’t have enough time to properly dissect the research.) Anyway, I </span><em>was</em><span> intrigued enough to give it a shot. Realistically, my expectation was that whatever early music exposure I would provide for my children might at least prevent them from inheriting my tone deafness.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg" width="548" height="343.5369545859305" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:704,&#34;width&#34;:1123,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:548,&#34;bytes&#34;:112072,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30a6326d-dec6-4bdd-b21c-fb897b56e0e6_1123x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>No, I didn’t make payoff tables in Excel when my kids were little, but I made this one just for you.

The central idea was to consistently expose my boys to labeled pitches. There&#39;s no one-size-fits-all here — it&#39;s all about tailoring your approach to each child&#39;s temperament and interests. However, let me share the three key methods that proved effective for my family, in hopes they might be helpful to others: a labeled keyboard, solfeggio practice, and the use of a handful of apps.</p><h5>Labeled Keyboard</h5><p>When my older son was around 2, I bought him a cheap Yamaha keyboard, “cheap” being the key criterion. I wanted something for a toddler to be able to play with as he pleases, whether that meant an enthusiastic pounding on the keys or transforming the keyboard into an impromptu percussion instrument. Bottom line, you’ll need something sturdy and not so high-end that you’d feel bad gluing labels on it.</p><p><span>As for the labels, I used these </span><a href="https://globalmusiceducation.com/products/solfeggio-piano-key-stickers-english" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">stickers designed by Hellene Heiner</a><span>. I like them because they&#39;re not only charming but also incorporate images alongside note names, making them ideal for kids who can&#39;t read yet.

But you can still see remnants of some of the stickers that I put on it years ago.</figcaption></figure></div><h5>Solfeggio</h5><p><span>When teaching note names to my kids, I decided to go with solfeggio (</span><em>do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do</em><span>.) The reason was that I wanted labels that were distinct from letter names, which the children would encounter in many other contexts. The less ambiguity the better. Fortunately, teaching these names to little ones is really straightforward. You can start by simply singing the note names as you press random keys on your instrument, or sing nursery rhymes using note names instead of the lyrics. So, substitute </span><em>mi-re-do-re-mi-mi-mi</em><span> for “Mary had a little lamb”, and so on. </span></p><p>Now, I was only able to do the singing when I was in close proximity to the keyboard, as that was the sole reliable way for me to make sure my pitches were spot on. In the same vein, if you play any musical instruments around your kids, it’s crucial to always keep them properly tuned. I should also note here that it’s important to check whether any musical toys you might have at home (as well as any apps you might use) produce the correct pitches. Believe it or not, we once had a  xylophone that didn’t! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png" width="334" height="282.27985074626866" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:906,&#34;width&#34;:1072,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:334,&#34;bytes&#34;:216297,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b5a9a9-64c7-48e8-8ba1-4f294021e797_1072x906.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>My kids’ first xylophone</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>At first, especially with younger children, you should focus on input. Don’t expect them to produce any significant output early on. Sure, you can encourage them to sing the note names with you, but don’t force it if they show no interest.

At times, whenever my brain chose to hyperfocus on other endeavors, I skipped weeks or even months. It didn’t seem to matter in the end. I wish I had kept a better record of how much time I put in, but, frankly, once it became a habit to consistently name pitches and spend a few minutes a day playing with the labeled keyboard, it was so seamlessly integrated into our routine that I rarely gave it much thought.</p><h5>Apps: Little Musician</h5><p>OK, so there’s this app. It seems to suffer from memory leaks. It doesn’t work on the Mac. It’s not cheap. It’s old and doesn’t work properly without Flash. It was written by people who are into this whole “right brain learning” thing, which I’m rather skeptical about. But if I were to point to what I believe was the number two most important tool in our absolute pitch acquisition journey, second only to the labeled keyboard play, this would be it.

First, it made it easy for me to be consistent. To be perfectly honest, during the baby and toddler years, my reserves of energy and creativity often ran low. With this app, all I needed to do was launch the lesson, sit with my child for 5 minutes while listening, oohing-aahing, clapping and what not, and then I was done. No creativity and not much energy required. I used this program with both of my kids when they were around 2.5-4. Not </span><em>very </em><span>consistently, but I did use it a lot. It has the chords, it has the sounds, it has the note names. And the children liked it.</span></p><h5>Other Apps</h5><p><span>I also highly recommend getting an app that recognizes pitches. This way, whenever there is some persistent sound in your environment, you can figure out what it is and draw your child’s attention to it. “Oh, listen, honey, the truck is beeping. The beep is a </span><em>so.” </em><span>And later on in your journey, you can use it to verify if your kids are producing the correct pitches. “Can you sing </span><em>do</em><span> for me? Spot on!” </span></p><p>The app I currently use on my Android phone for this purpose is called VocalPitchMonitor, but, to be perfectly honest, I didn’t do my due diligence on it, so I have no idea if it steals my soul and sends it to Eastern Europe. There are plenty of similar apps, so you can choose something that works for you. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg" width="208" height="399.8222222222222" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:2076,&#34;width&#34;:1080,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:208,&#34;bytes&#34;:167778,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad0d81e-a4cd-4843-8918-8556df4fb183_1080x2076.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>VocalPitchMonitor</figcaption></figure></div><p>There are also some cute apps on the iPad that are designed to teach notes to children.

I was humming a tune, and he began correcting me. Now, as I may have already mentioned once or twice, I’m really bad at music. My immediate thought was that I was messing up the melody, but it turned out the melody was fine. My son didn’t like the way I sang it, however, because it was in the wrong key. I was incredulous. I even </span><em>momsplained</em><span> to him that humans, with rare exceptions, can’t identify actual pitches without reference sounds. Yet as I was saying this, it started dawning on me that I was perhaps now dealing with one of those rare humans. </span></p><p>So I proceeded to play random notes on the keyboard for him to name, and he identified all of them with ease. He could recognize all the white key sounds across several octaves. Amazed, I kept repeating the test: early in the morning, before he could hear any possible reference sounds, and during walks, when I would ask him to produce various pitches for my phone app to recognize. And he consistently got them all. Well, almost all.</p><p>Black keys still stumped him at that time. But he knew that he didn’t know them. Over the next few months, he learned to identify them as we started to play and label them more frequently. I think it’s OK to focus just on the white keys first. I am guessing that once sensitivity to absolute pitch is established, naming the black key sounds is just a matter of attaching labels to them. It’s like when you know green and blue, and then see this weird in-between color: all you have to do is learn that its name is “teal” and you’re all set. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg" width="362" height="271.5" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1092,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:362,&#34;bytes&#34;:812585,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba49054b-bb4b-4e3e-9a02-dec3dbb38721_4576x3432.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>My older boy sees these colors in his mind when he hears the corresponding pitches. When he first told me about his sound-to-color associations, I thought he may have been influenced by a conversation about </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">synesthesia</a><span> that he had with his friend. However, the consistency of his sound-to-color mapping suggests otherwise. This picture, which I asked him to make for me today, precisely matches my old notes on his earlier descriptions of the colors he “hears”.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>After discovering the older boy’s perfect pitch 3 years ago, I renewed my efforts with my younger son, who was about 3.5 at that point. We restarted the Little Musician lessons and I made a greater effort to include some keyboard play on most days. I also began conducting little quizzes: after turning out the lights, I’d play some notes and ask the boys to name them. My little boy wasn’t all that good at it at first, but that was perfectly fine. I think it helped to set the expectation that this was something learnable. One of the earliest signs of his sensitivity to absolute pitch was his ability to consistently produce the middle </span><em>do</em><span> without any reference sounds at all. The next milestone was recognizing all the white keys of the middle octave, followed by the white keys of the adjacent octaves. He can sing them without any reference sounds, too. He’s 6.5 now, and not terribly eager to practice, so we don’t do it often. I’m curious to see if he’ll develop the ability to name the black keys in the same way his older brother did. (I’ll try to be back here with an update.)</span></p><p><span>Parents often have the desire to give their children that which they themselves were missing when growing up.</span></p><p><span> That’s what motivated me to introduce my boys to music when they were very young. I know there’s some disagreement as to whether absolute pitch is a big deal or not, and there are, of course, plenty of unbelievable musicians who don’t have it. But the fact is, by giving my boys AP, I made sure that, unlike me, they will find learning music easy. AP is not a necessary condition for that, but it </span><em>is</em><span> sufficient. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png" width="320" height="309.1383812010444" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:740,&#34;width&#34;:766,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:320,&#34;bytes&#34;:27434,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122423b3-6caa-4827-8d2f-c6fde7e763f8_766x740.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Thanks to my buddy Alexandros for sending me </span><a href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1669340417404575747" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">this tweet</a><span>.
