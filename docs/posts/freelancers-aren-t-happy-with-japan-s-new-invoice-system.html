    <h1>Freelancers aren’t happy with Japan’s new invoice system</h1>

                                      <p>From Oct. 1, a new tax regulation decades in the making will go into effect — and hundreds of thousands of workers in Japan are angry.</p><p>The Qualified Invoicing System, which requires taxable businesses to issue invoices containing tax information for transactions, has generated a full-fledged movement against it. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9-%E5%A4%9A%E6%A7%98%E3%81%AA%E5%83%8D%E3%81%8D%E6%96%B9%E3%81%A8%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%92%E8%A1%B0%E9%80%80%E3%81%95%E3%81%9B%E3%82%8B%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E3%81%AB%E6%8A%97%E8%AD%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99?recruiter=1179158869&amp;recruited_by_id=f5fb8ad0-6736-11eb-8938-3522fb397ea3&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=d68579ea3ff94d3a82a6a6eb02d9dd29&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_content=cl_sharecopy_31387213_ja-JP%3A4"><u>A petition on Change.org</u></a> to halt the regulation has received nearly 450,000 signatures. The social movement #STOPインボイス (invoice) has held regular demonstrations and conferences advocating against the law, alongside significant protest from the world of pop culture: Animators, filmmakers, voice actors, manga artists and V-tubers of all stripes have joined together against it.</p><p>While the law is complex, the reason it’s hated is not: It’s effectively a tax increase. While the system was created to ensure that businesses will properly pay consumption tax, for many freelancers and small businesses the result will amount to a 10% increase in taxes — a high enough jump to potentially devastate creatives who already make a living by the narrowest of margins.</p>
