                                        <p>The German hosting and cloud provider Hetzner is now offering three new dedicated servers which are particularly impressive due to their excellent price-performance ratio.</p><p>The new EX101 Dedicated Server from the EX line houses the high-end Intel® i9-13900 processor and displays impressive performance on a wide range of applications thanks to its hybrid architecture and its 24 cores. It has 16 energy efficient cores, which process background workloads, plus 8 powerful performance cores, which are designed for intense workloads, such as data analysis and AI. Larger L2 and L3 caches significantly speed up data retrieval. Hetzner has cleverly equipped the EX101 with not just any RAM, but 64 GB of DDR5 ECC RAM, giving the extra reliability of error correction code plus the boosted performance of DDR5. It’s one of the first Hetzner server models with this type of memory. This power pack of a server also comes with two 1.92 TB Datacenter Gen4 NVMe SSDs to give users lots of storage. Most impressively, the EX101 Dedicated Server is affordable; together with an IPv4 address, its price is a very do-able € 84 a month plus a one-time setup fee of just € 39.</p><p>The new EX44 Dedicated server’s hidden gem is the Intel® Core™ i5-13500 processor. This 13th generation chip with hyper-threading boasts 8 energy-efficient cores and 6 powerful performance cores and together they provide very good overall performance. Shining alongside the i5-13500 is 64 GB of DDR4 RAM and two quick 512 GB Gen4 NVMe SSDs. This dazzling package pushes the definition of an entry level server; it will more than suit users’ needs for a variety of use cases. The price is also convincing, at just € 44 per month plus a one-time setup fee of just € 39.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the new AX52 Dedicated Server; it provides remarkable performance with its AMD Ryzen™ 7 7700 processor, which is based on Zen4 architecture. It’s well-suited for a wide range of multi-threading intense workloads thanks to its 8 cores and 16 threads. The AX52 houses 64 GB of DDR5 RAM and includes 2 fast 1 TB Gen4 NVMe SSDs, all for just € 59 a month plus a one-time setup fee of just € 39, making the AX52 a perfect all around performer.</p><p>For more information on the new models, see the <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/matrix-ex#Hetzner%20EX Dedicated Server">EX line</a> and <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/matrix-ax#Hetzner%20AX Dedicated Server">AX line</a>.</p><p>All prices excl.
