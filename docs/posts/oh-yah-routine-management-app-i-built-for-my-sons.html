    <h1>Show HN: Oh Yah – Routine management app I built for my sons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
                    Oh Yah! is for families who need routine management that works with their child&#39;s unique needs — not
                    generic productivity apps that overwhelm.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>You should try Oh Yah! if:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your child struggles with daily routines and needs constant reminders</li>
                        <li>Mornings and after-school time are stressful battles</li>
                        <li>You&#39;ve tried reward charts and systems that didn&#39;t stick</li>
                        <li>Your child needs clear structure but gets overwhelmed easily</li>
                        <li>You want to build independence without constant nagging</li>
                        <li>You need a solution that works for the whole family</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
