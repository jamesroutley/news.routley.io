    <h1>Show HN: MARS – Personal AI robot for builders (&lt; $2k)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey, we’re Axel and Vignesh, cofounders of Innate (<a href="https://www.innate.bot/">https://www.innate.bot/</a>). We just launched MARS, a general-purpose robot with an open onboard agentic OS built on top of ROS2.</p><p>Overview: <a href="https://youtu.be/GEOMYDXv6pE" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/GEOMYDXv6pE</a></p><p>Control demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/_Cw5fGa8i3s" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/_Cw5fGa8i3s</a></p><p>Videos of autonomous use-cases: <a href="https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-example-use-cases">https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-example-use-cases</a></p><p>Quickstart: <a href="https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-quick-start">https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-quick-start</a>.</p><p>Our last thread: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42451707">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42451707</a></p><p>When we started we felt there is currently no good affordable general-purpose that anyone can build on. There’s no lack of demand: hugging face’s SO-100 and LeKiwi are pretty clear successes already; but the hardware is unreliable, the software experience is barebone and keeps changing, and you often need to buy hidden extras to make them work (starting with a computer with a good gpu). The Turtlebots were good, but are getting outdated.</p><p>The open-source hobbyist movement lacks really good platforms to build on, and we wanted something robust and accessible. MARS is our attempt at making a first intuitive AI robot for everyone.</p><p>What it is:</p><p>- It comes assembled and calibrated</p><p>- Has onboard compute with a jetson orin nano 8gb</p><p>- a 5DoF arm with a wrist camera</p><p>- Sensors: RGBD wide-angle cam, 2D LiDAR, speakers</p><p>- Control via a dedicated app and a leader arm that plugs in iPhone and Android</p><p>- 2 additional USB ports + GPIO pins for extra sensors or effectors.</p><p>- And our novel SDK called BASIC that allows to run it like an AI agent with VLAs.</p><p>It boots in a minute, can be controlled via phone, programmable in depth with a PC, and the onboard agent lets it see, talk, plan, and act in real-time.</p><p>Our SDK BASIC allows to create “behaviors” (our name for programs) ranging from a simple hello world to a very complex long-horizon task involving reasoning, planning, navigation and manipulation. You can create skills that behaviors can run autonomously by training the arm or writing code tools, like for an AI agent.</p><p>You can also call the ROS2 topics to control the robot at a low-level. And anything created on top of this SDK can be easily shared with anyone else by just sharing the files.</p><p>This is intended for hobbyist builders and education, and we would love to have your feedback!</p><p>p.s. If you want to try it, there’s a temporary code HACKERNEWS-INNATE-MARS that lowers the price to $1,799.</p><p>p.p.s The hardware and software will be open-sourced too, if some of you want to contribute or help us prepare it properly feel free to join our discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/YvqQbGKH" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/YvqQbGKH</a></p></div></td></div></div>
