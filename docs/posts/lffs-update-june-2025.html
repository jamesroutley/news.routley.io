    <h1>LFFS update, June 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, June 15, 2025</em></p><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve written anything here, especially about <a href="https://bytes.zone/projects/local-first-from-scratch/">Local-First from Scratch</a>. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been up to:</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><ul><li>I took a little break (just a couple weeks) to learn about MiniZinc. Mainly I learned that it&#39;s a very opaque systemâ€¦ even getting a problem optimized enough to even be solved is challenging (at least at my skill level.)</li><li>Signed up for <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2024/08/do-quests-not-goals/">One Big Win</a> as a framework for writing.</li><li>During OBW (8 weeks), I did a lot of research to backfill the theoretical fundamentals of my writing work, as well as breaking ground on a new implementation.</li><li>Since OBW, I&#39;ve been continuing with the implementation.</li></ul><p>At this point, I&#39;ve got maybe 25% of the code I need to write an actually-decent version of the book. It&#39;s going slow-ish, so I&#39;m trying to reserve some time to write. Hopefully I can start publishing more regularly here!</p></article><section><p>If you&#39;d like me to email you when I have a new post, sign up below and I&#39;ll do exactly that!</p><p>If you just have questions about this, or anything I write, <a href="https://bytes.zone/open-invitation/">please feel free to email me</a>!</p></section></div></div>
