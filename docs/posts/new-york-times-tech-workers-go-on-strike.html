The sticking points in recent days were over whether they could get a “just cause” provision in their contract, which means workers can be terminated only for misconduct or another such reason; pay increases and pay equity; and return-to-office policies.</p><p>Times management said in an email to workers on Sunday that it had offered a 2.5 percent annual wage increase, a minimum 5 percent pay increase for promotions and a $1,000 ratification bonus. It also said that the company would maintain its current in-office work requirements of two days a week through June 2025, while allowing employees to work fully remotely for three weeks per year.</p><p>The guild said in a statement that its members would protest daily outside the company’s headquarters starting at 9 a.m. on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line,” Kathy Zhang, the guild’s unit chair, said in the statement. “Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the finish line.”</p><p>The guild said it was asking readers to honor its digital picket line by not playing Times Games products, such as Wordle, and not using the Cooking app. It added that it had filed numerous unfair labor practice charges against The Times with the National Labor Relations Board over the company’s return-to-office mandates and its attempts to interrogate members about their intentions to strike.</p><p>Hannah Yang, the company’s chief growth and customer officer, and Jason Sobel, its chief technology officer, said in an email to the tech workers on Sunday night that management had “a strong offer on the table.”</p><p>“We are disappointed that the Tech Guild leadership is attempting to jeopardize our journalistic mission at this critical time,” they said in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.</p><p>The Times Tech Guild, the country’s biggest union of tech workers with collective bargaining rights, was certified in a National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/business/media/new-york-times-tech-union.html" title="">election</a> in March 2022. It has been negotiating for a contract since then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The union voted on Sept. 10 to authorize the strike with the intention of walking off the job around Election Day, when a jump in readership is expected. The union’s more than 600 members maintain the back-end systems running The Times’s digital operation.</p><p>A Times spokeswoman said that the company had “robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfill our mission and serve our readers.”</p><p>Many New York Times workers are represented by other unions. Times reporters and some editors are part of the Times Guild, while a number of workers at Wirecutter, The Times’s product review website, are also unionized. Those unions, as well as the Times Tech Guild, are affiliated with the News Guild of New York.</p><p>Wirecutter Union workers went on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/business/media/wirecutter-union-contract.html" title="">five-day walkout</a> in 2021 over the prime Black Friday shopping weekend to pressure management to agree to a contract. Times reporters and editors held a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/business/media/new-york-times-union-walkout.html" title="">24-hour strike</a> in December 2022 over contract negotiations.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Washington Post:</strong> Hugh Hewitt, the conservative pundit, said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/media/hugh-hewitt-washington-post-jonathan-capehart.html">he would no longer write columns for the Post</a>, where he had been a regular contributor to the paper’s opinion pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comcast: </strong>The company’s president, Mike Cavanagh, said Comcast was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/media/comcast-cable-networks-spin-off.html">weighing whether to cleave its cable networks from the rest of the company</a> and also was considering finding a partner for its Peacock streaming service.</p></li><li><p><strong>CNN:</strong> The network <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/business/cnn-pager-comment-mehdi-hasan.html">barred the conservative commentator Ryan James Girdusky</a> from its programs after he made on-air remarks that seemed to imply that another guest, the pundit Mehdi Hasan, was a member of Hezbollah.</p></li><li><p><strong>L.A.
