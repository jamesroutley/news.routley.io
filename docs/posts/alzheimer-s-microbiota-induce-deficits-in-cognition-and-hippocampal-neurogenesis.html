Technology is a tool that enhances the power of the wielder.
</p>
<p>
Our tools are getting more and more powerful. Some tools, such as nuclear fission, are
so powerful that they pose an existential threat to all of humanity, because
human society has a history of wielding tools to maintain power over each other at any cost.
</p>
<p>
The dark desire to subjugate one another is the ultimate enemy of innovation,
because the conquerors are content to have their needs met by human labor,
while the conquered are too busy laboring to become scientists.
</p>
<p>
Human societies are systems. Systems are themselves tools. Free Market
Capitalism is a system. It has tech specs just like any computer - features,
limitations, and tradeoffs. We will not settle for a deprecated system when
there is a new and improved one that can be created, discovered, and iterated
upon.
</p>
<p>
Venture capital is an outdated tool. It leads to monopolies, anti-competitive
practices, generational wealth, and environmental externalities.
Non-donation-based non-profit organizations are an underexplored alternative,
especially for tech companies where the number of users is large and size of
the organization is relatively small.
</p>
<p>
Religion is an outdated tool, used to control, weaken, and exploit the masses.
It causes societies to maintain unscientific practices, especially in healthcare and
justice, and leads to war.
</p>
<p>
War is a means to destroy the wealth created by technology.
</p>
<p>
War turns technology against mankind.
</p>
<p>
War is opportunity cost for every scientist and engineer who works on national defense.
</p>
<p>
War makes it dangerous to research advanced technology.
</p>
<p>
As techno-optimists, we believe that we <em>must</em>, <strong>and we
will</strong>, create more advanced human systems to prevent war forevermore.
Human society <em>will</em> mature and overcome its
barbaric history, learning to cooperate with each other so that we can create technological
works of global magnitude, such as orbital rings.
</p>
<p>
We cannot meaningfully explore space while borders exist on Earth.
</p>
<p>
Every dollar spent on the military is a blight on the country&#39;s honor. We
believe that military budget reductions are a cause for celebration because
they symbolize progress towards the space age. We believe that the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the most horrifying, shameful thing
ever done by humanity, to itself. Importantly, <strong>we believe that it will
never, ever happen again.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We believe that there are irreversible destructive actions. While some amount of
species extinction is a natural process, the outlier extinction event currently happening
due to the emergence of homo sapiens is a tragedy. We believe that it is our duty to
not only improve technology to enhance our own lives, but also enhance technology
to preserve natural diversity. We believe that Free Market Capitalism is an outdated
technology that has failed to prevent irreversible destruction to our home planet. However,
we believe that human society will migrate to a better system without these flaws,
and will prevent the ultimate irreversible action of self-destruction.
</p>
<p>
We believe in the simple, physical fact that endless growth is unsustainable,
and we refuse to resolve this problem with war. Instead, we will improve
efficiency and work within the limits of the system, whatever they may be.
We will upgrade our economic system to one that is capable of supporting these
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, finally, we believe that it is justified to spend one&#39;s life or
career in pursuit of science, engineering, and technology, because we believe
in humanity&#39;s ability to mature and improve to the point where it can wield
ever more powerful tools responsibly.
