    <h1>My writing process, and how I keep it sustainable</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, a reader wrote to me and asked about my writing process and burnout.
They had an image in their head that I could sit down at a computer and type up a full post on a given topic, but were unsure if that&#39;s the right approach when they start blogging.
And they were concerned about how to keep things sustainable for themselves, too.
I started to write back to them, but decided to ship my answer for everyone else, as well.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear: this is <em>my</em> writing process.
There are many other very valid approaches, such as what <a href="https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/10/advice-for-aspiring-bloggers.html">Gabriella wrote</a>.
But I think outlining my process here will at least help break some of the mystique around writing, because I certainly do <em>not</em> just sit down and plunk out a post.</p>
<p>Well, it often <em>looks</em> like that if you&#39;re an outside observer<sup><a href="#window">1</a></sup>.
But that&#39;s only what&#39;s visible.</p>

<p>The very first piece of any blog post for me is an idea, some inspiration, something I want to share.
These ideas come from a variety of places.
Some of them are from conversations with friends or coworkers.
Others come from problems I&#39;m solving in my own code.
Or they come from things I&#39;m reading.
Very rarely, they come from just <em>thinking</em> about things, but those are other sources with the connection hidden by the passage of time.</p>
<p>After an idea comes to me, I try to capture it quickly.
If I don&#39;t, it&#39;s probably gone!
I store these ideas in a note in Obsidian, which currently has 162 ideas in it<sup><a href="#grep">2</a></sup>.
I format this file as a bulleted list, with minimal categorization so that the friction for adding something new is as low as possible.
When I revisit this list to plan things to write (I do this every few weeks), I&#39;ll remove things which are either completed or which I&#39;m confident I am not interested in anymore.</p>
<p>Ideas which are promoted from &#34;want to write&#34; to &#34;definitely going to write&#34; then get moved into my primary task tracking system, <a href="https://lunatask.app/">LunaTask</a>.
When I start typing an article, I move it from &#34;later&#34; or &#34;next&#34; to &#34;in progress&#34;.
But in reality, I start writing an article far before I start typing it.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, I&#39;m almost always thinking about topics I&#39;m going to write about.
Maybe this is an element of having ADHD, or maybe it&#39;s from my obsessive interests and my deep diving into things I&#39;m curious about.
But it started happening more when I started <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/scheduling-visits-from-the-muse/">writing on a schedule</a>.
By writing on a schedule, having to publish weekly, I&#39;ve gotten in the habit of thinking about things so that I can hit the ground running when I sit down to type.</p>
<p>Once I&#39;ve picked out an idea, then it sits in the back of my head and some background processing happens.
Usually I&#39;m not crystal clear on <em>what</em> I want to say on a topic, so that background process churns through it.
After figuring out what I want to say, I move onto a little more active thought on how I want to say it and structure it.
This happens while I&#39;m on a run or a walk, while I&#39;m on coffee breaks, between exercises I&#39;m working on for my music lessons.
There&#39;s a lot of background processing between snatches of active effort.
Piece by piece, it crystallizes in my mind and I figure out what I want to say and how to say it.</p>
<p>Then, finally, I sit at the keyboard.
And this is where it really <em>looks</em> like I just sit down and write posts in one quick sitting.
That&#39;s because by then, the ideas are fully formed and it&#39;s a matter of writing the words out—and after a few years of that, it&#39;s something I got pretty quick at.</p>
<p>Take this blog post for example.
I received the initial email on January 1st, and it sat in my inbox for a few days before I could read it and digest it.
I started to write a reply, but realized it would work as a blog post.
So it ended up in background processing for a week, then I started actively thinking about what I wanted to write.
At that point, I created a blog post file with section headings as an outline.</p>
<p>This post ended up being delayed a bit, since I had to practice <a href="https://www.ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development/">content-driven development</a> for a project that has a self-imposed deadline.
But the core writing (though not the typing) was done in the week after opening the original email.
And then when I finally sat down to write it, it was two 20-minute sessions of typing out the words<sup><a href="#fast-typing">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>After the first draft of a post is <em>written</em>, there&#39;s a lot of <em>detail work</em> remaining.</p>
<p>This draft is usually in the approximate shape of the final post, but it may be missing sections or have too much in some.
I&#39;ll take this time to do a quick read over it by myself.
Here I&#39;m not checking for spelling errors, but checking if the structure is good and if it needs major work, or just copy edits.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m unsure of some aspects of a post, I ask for feedback.
I&#39;ll reach out to one or two friends who I think would have useful feedback and would enjoy reading it early, and ask them if they can read it.
This request comes with specific feedback requests, since those are easier to fulfill then a broad &#34;what do you think?&#34;
These are something along the lines of &#34;was it clear? what parts stuck out to you positively or negatively? is there anything you found unclear or inaccurate?&#34;
Once people get me feedback, I add an acknowledgement for them (with explicit consent for if/how to share their name and where to link).</p>
<p>After I&#39;m more sure of the structure and content of a post, I&#39;ll go through and do copy edits.
I read through it, with a spellchecker enabled<sup><a href="#disabled">4</a></sup>, and fix any misspellings and improve the wording of sentences.</p>
<p>Then it&#39;s just the final details.
I write up the blurb that goes in my newsletter and on social media (Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn, currently).
I make sure the date is correct, the title is a decent one, and the slug mostly matches the title.
And I make sure I did do things like acknowledgements and spellchecking.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the full checklist I use for <em>every</em> post before publishing.</p>
<pre data-lang="text"><code data-lang="text"><span>- [ ] Edited?
</span><span>- [ ] Newsletter blurb written?
</span><span>- [ ] Spellchecked?
</span><span>- [ ] Is the date correct?
</span><span>- [ ] Is the title updated?
</span><span>- [ ] Does the slug match the title?
</span><span>- [ ] Are tags set?
</span><span>- [ ] Draft setting removed?
</span><span>- [ ] Are acknowledgements added?
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once that checklist is complete, it&#39;s ready to go!
That means that on Monday morning, I just have to run <code>make deploy</code> and it&#39;ll build and push out the article.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been writing at least one post a week since September 2022—over two years at this point, and about 200,000 words.
I&#39;ve avoided burning out on it, so far.
That&#39;s an interesting thing, since I&#39;ve burned out on personal projects in the past.
What makes this different?</p>
<p>One aspect is that it&#39;s something that&#39;s very enjoyable for me.
I like writing, and the <em>process</em> of it.
I&#39;ve always liked writing, and having an outlet for it is highly motivating for me.</p>
<p>I thrive in structure, so the self-imposed structure of publishing every week is helpful.
This structure makes me abandon perfection and find smaller pieces that I can publish in a shorter amount of time, instead of clinging to a big idea and shipping all of it at once, or never.
This is where <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development/">content-driven development</a> comes in for me, and the consistent schedule also leads me to <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/scheduling-visits-from-the-muse/"><em>create</em> inspiration</a>.</p>
<p>I also don&#39;t put pressure on myself <em>besides</em> the deadline.
That&#39;s the only immovable thing.
Everything else—length, content, even quality<sup><a href="#quality">5</a></sup>—is flexible.
Some of my earliest posts from 2022 are of the form &#34;here&#39;s what I did this week!&#34; which got me into a consistent rhythm.</p>
<p>The most important thing for me is to keep it fun.
If I&#39;m not finding something fun, I just move on to a different post or a different topic.
I have some posts that would be good but have sat in my backlog for over a year, waiting to be written.
Whenever I sit down to write those, my brain decides to find a bunch of other, better, posts to write instead!</p>
<p>So far, it&#39;s been fun and motivating to write weekly.
If that ever stops, and it becomes a job and something I dread, I&#39;ll change the format to be something that works better for me instead!</p>

<div id="fast-typing"><p><sup>3</sup></p><p>Drafting documents is where I feel like my typing speed is actually a real benefit.
On a typing test this evening, I got 99% accuracy at 120wpm.
This lets me get through a lot of words quickly.
This is a big plus for me both as a writer and as a principal engineer.</p>
</div>
<div id="disabled"><p><sup>4</sup></p><p>I leave my spellchecker disabled the vast majority of the time, since the squiggles are distracting!
It&#39;s not a big deal to misspell things most of the time, and I&#39;d rather be able to focus on getting words out than noticing each mistake as I make it—talk about discouraging!</p>
</div>
<div id="quality"><p><sup>5</sup></p><p>That said, I think it&#39;s hard to judge your own quality in the moment.
As writers, we can be very critical of ourselves.
We think we wrote something boring but others find it interesting.
Or something we think is quite clever, others find uninspiring.
Sometimes, when I push out something I think is lazy and quick and low-quality, I&#39;m surprised to find a very eager reception.</p>
