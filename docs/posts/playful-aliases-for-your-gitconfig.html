    <h1>Playful aliases for your gitconfig</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><date>Tuesday, March 14th 2023</date></p></header><p>Imposter syndrome has many forms. For me, one of its forms comes in feeling like I should have a more custom and clever library of dotfiles at this point in my career. A better &#34;bag of tricks&#34; as it were.</p><p>In particular, I have almost no git aliases. Not even a classic like <code>git co</code>. I guess I&#39;ve never felt like saving keystrokes here and there—particularly in a world with autocompletion—is my biggest barrier to efficiency?</p><p>I actually have exactly one alias:</p><pre><code>cb = &#34;!git branch --show-current | pbcopy; echo &#39;Copied branch to clipboard: $(pbpaste)&#34;
</code></pre><p>We used to have a workflow that required manually entering our branch names into Jenkins. I finally got tired enough of handling that manually and trying to remembe this arcane git command to get me just the part of the branch name I needed that I caved.</p><p>But this post is not about that, or the way I sometimes wield git with all the dexterity and cunning of a caveman using a MacBook as flint to start a fire. This is about a joyfully idle thought I had earlier today to make more playful aliases for git.</p><p>Behold, for your copy/paste convenience straight into <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p><pre><code>[alias]	  
	breakstuff = branch  
	yolo = &#34;!git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m &#39;YOLO!&#39; &amp;&amp; git push --force&#34;  
	gimmedat = pull
	gimmedis = fetch
	blablahblah = commit
	squishes = merge
	thank = blame
	hm = log
	hmm = diff	
	grafitti = tag
	ghosts = commit --allow-empty -m &#34;BOO!&#34;
	yoink = clone
	hidemysnacks = stash	
	gimmesnacks = stash pop
	wheremysnacks = stash list
	doover = reset HEAD --hard	
	ohshit = &#34;!git hidemysnacks &amp;&amp; git doover&#34;
