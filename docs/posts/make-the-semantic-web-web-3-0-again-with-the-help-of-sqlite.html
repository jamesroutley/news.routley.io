      <h3>Make the &#34;semantic web&#34; web 3.0 again -- with the help of SQLite</h3>
      <p>January 11th, 2022</p>

      <p>Before the term was hijacked by crypto-grifters (and, admittedly, a few genuinely neat projects), web 3 (point oh) referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s project</a> to promote a standard way to expose and parse metadata on the web. It never took off. In this piece, I&#39;ll argue that a breakthrough idea <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27016630">introduced last year by HN user phiresky</a> might be the first practical way to implement it.</p>
      <p>An early critique of TBL&#39;s idea came from Cory Doctorow, describing his utopian vision as <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">Metacrap</a> -- a term with a different potential meaning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XWedbTIcV4">in 2022</a>. Doctorow&#39;s point was that you can&#39;t rely on people to provide accurate or comprehensive metadata on their web pages. We&#39;re lazy, and your utopian idea is just more work for us with little short term reward.</p>
      <p>The semantic web will never happen if it requires additional manual labor. This is where the <a href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/">SQLite-over-HTTP</a> idea comes in. In the spring of 2021 we saw a demo of a technique in which backend-less static sites could efficiently query SQLite databases using HTTP range requests. In the process, it demonstrated a new kind of web app whose entire database was exposed and queryable from the outside.</p>
      <p>I <a href="https://ansiwave.net/blog/sqlite-over-http.html">wrote before</a> about how this technique is a powerful way to make software that is more scalable and offline-friendly. What I didn&#39;t mention was how it enables all the utopian &#34;open data&#34; concepts that Berners-Lee has been talking about for 20 years. In his TED talk, he made the audience shout out <a href="https://youtu.be/OM6XIICm_qo?t=630">&#34;raw data now!&#34;</a> What could be more raw than a fully-exposed read-only database, queryable by anyone using standard SQL?</p>
      <p>Some will scoff at the idea of tying TBL&#39;s vision to a single implementation of a database, but exposing this data as XML was never going to work. The data needs to be exposed <i>in its original form</i>; any additional translation step will ensure that most people won&#39;t bother. The beauty of this technique is that you are <i>already</i> using SQLite because it&#39;s such a powerful database; with no additional work, you can throw it on a static file server and others can easily query it over HTTP.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ansiwave.net/">ANSIWAVE BBS</a> is built entirely this way. The board is a SQLite database, and the clients just query it via range requests. In the future, anyone could build a web app or other client without my permission, and even run their own custom SQL queries on the posts. Data on the web will only be &#34;semantic&#34; if that is the default, and with this technique it will be.</p>
