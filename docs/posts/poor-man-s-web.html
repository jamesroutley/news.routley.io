    <h1>Poor Man&#39;s Web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Small Web. “Smol Internet” or even “The Dork Web”. Many names for the modern phenomena of people getting away from the Big Internet of corporate gatekeepers, where data is money and users don’t own any of it anymore.</p><p>The Small Web is a reboot of the Internet as we know it. No, it’s not going to replace the Big Internet, but rather to create a niche for enthusiasts where people can freely express themselves, the tech stack is simple and transparent, where publishers have all the freedoms and consumers have a choice what to read. A place where time goes slowly and the content is created just for fun.</p><p>Isn’t it what we had 20-30 years ago?</p><h2 id="finger-protocol">Finger Protocol</h2><p>The <code>finger</code> program existed back in the 70s, but “Finger-as-a-Service” appeared in 1991, as described in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1288">RFC 1288</a>. What <code>finger</code> does is telling the self-published information about the user. Typically it was some basic metadata (time zone, name, email) as well as the two text files from the user’s home directory: <code>.project</code> and <code>.plan</code>.</p><p>It was designed to be used as an alternative to the modern daily standups, but since people always brought some fun into computing - they put some humorous lines there, or just some personal wisdom (think of the old-school Twitter). Some even used it to <a href="http://www.rajivshah.com/Case_Studies/Finger/Finger.htm#_Toc484593872">query the number of bottles</a> in the local vending machine!</p><p>If we speak about Finger Protocol, there is nothing simpler than that. Just establish a TCP connection to port 79 and send the user name you would like to query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">$ echo | nc typed-hole.org 79

Plan:
28.11.19 trying to setup an OpenNIC tier 2 server
04.01.20 added support for finger in Castor
11.01.20 Castor has an icon and a Makefile for easier installation
22.05.20 Typed-Hole will be unavailable for a few days as I&#39;ll be moving
03.06.20 The move went well, stuff should be back online. Working on an upcoming plan9 tilde server gopher://9til.de
05.06.20 Made a little finger server for plan9 https://git.sr.ht/~julienxx/finge.rc
19.07.20 Still working on 9til.de, so much things to do and learn before I can safely host people but it&#39;s shaping up
26.07.20 Successfully installed 9front under OpenBSD vmm
23.11.20 My laptop is now running 9front, do I really need another OS?

# Project Gemini

## Overview

Gemini is a new internet protocol which:

* Is heavier than gopher
* Is lighter than the web
* Will not replace either
* Strives for maximum power to weight ratio
* Takes user privacy very seriously

</code></pre></div><p>The first reponse line is a status code and a MIME type, followed by the markdown-like document with headers, lists and links. Additionally, preformatted text and quotes are supported.</p><p>If you ever dreamt of the web without bloat - that’s Gemini.</p><p>I tried writing a unified client for Finger, Gopher and Gemini and it took me no more than 2 hours for both, CLI and primitive GUI versions (using Go+<a href="https://github.com/zserge/lorca">Lorca</a>). The protocol is simple enough for beginners to write a decent client. I highly recommend you to give it a try, it is very rewarding to have your own “browser” surfing the Small Web!</p><p>But what’s next?</p><h2 id="history-repeating">History repeating</h2><p>Gopher came into decline when HTTP arrived. Gemini now tries to resurrect it by offering roughly the same set of features, only 20 years later. So far it’s working surprisingly well - at the moment of writing Gemini has 280K pages, and it keeps growing! Most of the pages are plain text, followed by images, followed by audio/video/binary. English dominates as a language, and all the pages are hosted on roughly 1K “capsules” (sites).</p><p>Yet, Gemini receives a fair criticism – one can achieve similar experience of the small web using plain HTML/CSS and running a self-hosted blog with RSS. Maybe the killer feature of Gemini is being niche and geek-friendly, much like web felt in its early days.</p><p>Anyway, The Gopher Renaissance is happening right now, and it’s up to you to decide whether the world needs it or not. I have some irrational warm feeling towards Gemini, I even considered making this blog available on Gemini/Gopher. If only there was a public Gemini capsule that could grab plain semantic HTML or Markdown and serve it via Gemini. Even some API to publish GMI files form the CI/CD pipeline would be good. But that’s probably a topic for another post.</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this article.
