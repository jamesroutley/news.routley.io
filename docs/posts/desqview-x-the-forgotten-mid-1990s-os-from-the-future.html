    <h1>DESQview/X: The forgotten mid-1990s OS from the future</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div><p>Today we&#39;re going to be looking at a system that is, in my opinion, rather special.  But, for many reasons, is mostly forgotten by todays computer users.</p><p>That OS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DESQview#DESQview/X" rel="">DESQview/X</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterdeck_Office_Systems" rel="">Quarterdeck</a>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5f0609f-a4f1-4e55-af62-92f48c8feccf_640x480.jpeg" rel=""><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5f0609f-a4f1-4e55-af62-92f48c8feccf_640x480.jpeg" width="388" height="291" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5f0609f-a4f1-4e55-af62-92f48c8feccf_640x480.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:480,&#34;width&#34;:640,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:388,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Splash&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="Splash" title="Splash"/></a></figure></div><p>So. What <em>is</em> DESQview/X? Many people, in the current day and age, may have never even <em>heard</em> of this system from the mid-1990s.</p><p>Its predecessor, DESQview (without the “/X”) which was first released in 1985, was a multi-tasking, windowing system for DOS. It allowed someone, with very modest PC hardware, to run multiple text-mode DOS applications at the same time. With overlapping, resizable windows.</p><p>Pretty darned cool.</p><p>This multitasking wasn&#39;t the cooperative multi-tasking that we saw in early Windows (through 3.11) and MacOS up through version 9. No sir-ee bob. DESQview had true, preemptive multi-tasking. Fast. Stable. Lightweight. It was downright impressive.</p><p>But it was all text-mode.</p><p>Then DESQview/X came along, in the 1990s, bringing a complete <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" rel="">X11</a> (aka X Windows) graphical interface with it.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45ce9e8f-2465-42e9-8e04-c5e9bc595798_640x480.jpeg" rel=""><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45ce9e8f-2465-42e9-8e04-c5e9bc595798_640x480.jpeg" width="640" height="480" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45ce9e8f-2465-42e9-8e04-c5e9bc595798_640x480.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:480,&#34;width&#34;:640,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Toolbox&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="Toolbox" title="Toolbox"/></a></figure></div><p>To give you an idea of what this system is capable of, here&#39;s a quick run-down of just <em>some</em> of the features of DESQview/X:</p><ul><li><p>Full, preemptive multitasking.</p></li><li><p>A complete X Window system with:</p><ul><li><p>Overlapping, resizable, movable windows.</p></li><li><p>The ability to <strong>act as an X11 client</strong> (run X Windows applications running on another computer, such as a UNIX/Linux box).</p></li><li><p>The ability to <strong>act as an X11 server</strong> (allowing another X Windows client to run applications on the DESQview/X computer).</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>The ability to run DOS applications.</p></li><li><p>The ability to <strong>run a complete instance of Windows 3.1</strong>x as a movable, resizable X11 window.</p></li><li><p>An SDK for building (and porting from other systems) X11 applications.</p><ul><li><p>Including networking applications, like early Web Browsers.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Now.</p><p>Many might make the case that DESQview/X is <em>not</em> actually an Operating System. It does, after all, sit on top of DOS (much like early versions of Windows).</p><p>I would posit, that doesn&#39;t do DESQview/X justice.</p><p>A preemptive multitasking system, capable of running DOS, Windows, local X11, and remote X11 applications? I mean. Wow. That&#39;s more power than many other Operating Systems even of today. So, yes. <strong>DESQview/X is an OS</strong>.</p><p>… Just one that also needs DOS.</p><h3>DESQview/X is so much fun</h3><p>I&#39;ll put this simply: DESQview/X is easy and fun to use.</p><p>Tap the ALT key on the keyboard, and up pops a global system menu. From there you can launch applications, manage the window layout, close applications, and the like.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834e0843-2d1a-45b4-a5f4-f68fe8b31f9f_640x480.jpeg" rel=""><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834e0843-2d1a-45b4-a5f4-f68fe8b31f9f_640x480.jpeg" width="640" height="480" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/834e0843-2d1a-45b4-a5f4-f68fe8b31f9f_640x480.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:480,&#34;width&#34;:640,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Windows&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="Windows" title="Windows"/></a><figcaption>Windows 3.1 running in a small window, plus the global DESQview menu open.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Just about everything (including resizing and moving windows) can be done entirely from a keyboard without ever touching a mouse. The mouse works everywhere, but you don&#39;t <em>need</em> to take your hands off the keyboard if you don&#39;t want to.</p><p>I love that.</p><p>Add to that the ability to run DOS, Windows 3.1, and X Windows applications… it&#39;s just so much goshdarned fun.</p><p>Oh. Check this out:</p><p>DESQview/X works as an X11 server, right?</p><p>And it can run an entire instance of Windows 3.1 as an X11 window, right?</p><p>Think about that for a moment. If you have a DOS + Windows 3.1 + DESQview/X computer somewhere… you can run Windows 3.1 applications on your UNIX-y box, acting as an X11 client.</p><p>Cool, right? I tell ya. This system is fun.</p><p>Here&#39;s something really crazy… DESQview/X is the easiest X11 based system I&#39;ve ever installed. Seamless, fast, almost impossible to mess up installation process.</p><p>It also ranks as the easiest X Windows based system to learn that I&#39;ve ever used. Launching applications. Managing windows. Without the slightest bit of documentation, a user can figure out how to use most aspects of the system (including the keyboard shortcuts) without no more than about 4 or 5 minutes.</p><p>While there are places where I would love to see more customization options… there&#39;s already quite a lot here – including multiple window managers like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twm" rel="">twm</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEN_LOOK" rel="">Open Look</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811162849/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_Window_Manager" rel="">Motif</a>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf238e7a-6f90-4d3a-8f47-01aebc9bc320_640x480.jpeg" rel=""><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf238e7a-6f90-4d3a-8f47-01aebc9bc320_640x480.jpeg" width="640" height="480" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bf238e7a-6f90-4d3a-8f47-01aebc9bc320_640x480.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:480,&#34;width&#34;:640,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:640,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Minimized Applications&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="Minimized Applications" title="Minimized Applications"/></a><figcaption>It&#39;s got xeyes, people!</figcaption></figure></div><p>My biggest complaint with DESQview/X would be a simple (and obvious) one…</p><p>Because DESQview/X was developed by a company that no longer exists – and the software is not open source – the development of support for newer hardware has ended. While this doesn&#39;t present much of an issue when using VMs or older hardware, it would be quite nice to be able to run DESQview using newer graphics cards (read: higher resolution), be able to user larger amounts of RAM, and the like.</p><p>In all honesty… if this system were released as open source (under any of a wide variety of licenses) it would still be useful today.  In fact… I could make an <em>oddly strong</em> case for using DESQview/X as a daily driver system.</p><p>If you have never tried out this oddly beautiful system, I highly recommend it.</p><p>It is so choice.</p><p>The world deserves to know about DESQview/X.
