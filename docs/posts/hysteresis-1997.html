         <p><b>Hysteresis </b>means &#34;lag of effect&#34;, or a delay
         before an action. This term comes from physics, where it
         means &#34;a delay in in effect when forces on a body change&#34; --
         quite appropriate for user interface as well, as you will
         see.
         
         </p><p>Hysteresis is a very important part of menus and
         controls, even though most users are unaware of it.
         
         </p><h3>Menus</h3>
         
         <p>In Menus, hysteresis is a time delay on hierarchical
         menus. When you select the sub-topic, the submenu pops out
         <a href="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/menus_how.html#Heirarchical"><b>[see
         Hierarchical Menus for more]</b></a>.
         
         </p><p>It can be very hard to thread the cursor through the
         &#34;small&#34; area [see diagram]. If, while moving
         horizontally to hit a &#34;choice&#34;, you were to accidentally
         move the mouse upwards, then you would be selecting the
         &#34;Prev Item&#34;, and the submenu would disappear (until you went
         back over &#34;sub-Topic&#34;). If you were to allow the mouse to
         wander down a little while moving to the submenu, then &#34;Next
         Item&#34; would get selected, and the submenu would once again
         go away. Only by threading through the &#34;small&#34; area, can you
         get to the submenu (choices).
         
         </p><center><img src="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/Menu%20Graphics/hysteresis_menu.gif" width="183" height="65"/></center>
         
         <p>This &#34;perfect&#34; accuracy is annoying. So programmers put a
         time-delay (of a fraction of a second) where you can &#34;miss&#34;
         before the submenu goes away. This allows users to travel
         directly from sub-Topic to &#34;choice-3&#34; in a direct line
         [following the path of the arrow on the diagram]
         without the submenu &#34;going away&#34; -- even though the user
         will have selected &#34;Next Item&#34; for a brief amount of time.
         The time delay is quite small, so the move has to be pretty
         quick -- but without it, hierarchical menus would be far
         more annoying.
         
         </p><blockquote>Apple&#39;s submenu Hysteresis is conditional on the
            mouse traveling in a right-down direction, if that is the
            way menus are arranged. If the Menu is large enough to be
            above the current menu item as well, then you will be
            allowed to travel upward without the submenu updating as
            well. In other words, it knows what makes sense, and it
            works.
            
            <p><SPAN color="#AF0000">Early Windows did not support
            menu-hysteresis, and hierarchical menus were a pain in
            the butt to use, but it has been fixed (poorly) in Win95.
            I was using a developers version of Rhapsody, and they
            had not yet implemented the hysteresis, and it was
            driving me nuts (it kept taking me 2 or 3 tries to hit
            any submenu item -- and I&#39;m pretty good with a
            mouse).</SPAN></p></blockquote>
         
         <h3>More Menus</h3>
         
         <p>Another use of hysteresis in menuing can be seen when
         moving down menus that have multiple submenus. As you move
         down a list of sub-topics, the submenus will only be drawn
         (pop-out) if there is sufficient &#34;pause&#34; (or slowness to
         your moves).
         
         </p><center><img src="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/Menu%20Graphics/hysteresis_menu_down.gif" width="100" height="67"/></center>
         
         <p>By having submenus only come out if you are moving slowly
         (or you pause), it prevents an annoying &#34;flickering&#34; down
         the side of menus -- which would otherwise be distracting.
         It also prevents wasted CPU performance (because it doesn&#39;t
         have to draw all those silly menus -- which might otherwise
         drag on the mouse, and how fast you could move down a menu,
         because the screen refresh couldn&#39;t quite keep up). (This
         effect is implemented by a pure time delay, and works in the
         up or down direction). People don&#39;t notice these effects,
         unless it is pointed out to them -- but they would sure
         notice the results if they weren&#39;t there.
         
         </p><blockquote><SPAN color="#AF0000">I have worked with
            machines that didn&#39;t use this type of hysteresis (the
            Amiga comes to mind), and it bugged me. Microsoft didn&#39;t
            do this right in the first versions of Windows, but
            Microsoft has implemented most of them by now. Of course
            implementing it, and implementing it well are two
            different things -- I personally find the pause before a
            submenu &#34;pops out&#34; to be too long in Windows, causing
            missed menus -- and some of the subtleties of hysteresis
            just not quite implemented as well. </SPAN></blockquote>
         
         <h3>Controls</h3>
         
         <p>When &#34;using&#34; various controls (or other parts of a
         Graphical User Interface) there is often a double-click
         action (users double-click the mouse button to do things).
         But mice wander a little, and double-clicking is pressing
         down on the mouse itself -- which is likely to make the
         mouse move.
         
         </p><p>So in controls, Hysteresis is an effect of allowing the
         mouse to &#34;be off&#34; by a little bit between clicks. So the
         mouse can move a couple of pixels, between the time of the
         first mouse click and the second, and if the two clicks were
         done fast enough, the &#34;double-click&#34; command will be
         accepted -- even though the mouse &#34;wandered&#34; a little.
         
         </p><blockquote><SPAN color="#AF0000">The Mac supports a
            control-hysteresis. So double-clicking, with a little
            motion, is still acceptable. Windows does <b>not</b>
            support control-hysteresis well, and it is annoying.
            Theoretically there are parameters in the OS, that apps
            can use, if they want to create hysteresis, but Microsoft
            doesn&#39;t even document many of them, let alone encourage
            others to use them. So most Apps don&#39;t use them. </SPAN>
            
            <p><SPAN color="#AF0000">Watch Windows users double-click
            something and wait -- sometimes nothing happens and users
            don&#39;t know why. By and large, they just let the mouse
            &#34;wander&#34; a little in the explorer. They just double-click
            again, and usually only a few seconds are lost -- but it
            is an annoyance, and a loss of productivity. Sometimes
            they get so used to double-clicking twice, that they
            actually run the program twice. Over time this wasted
            efficiency ads up. Also users become frustrated, and
            usually double-click HARDER, which can help explain much
            higher failure rates on PC-Mice than on Mac mice. </SPAN></p></blockquote>
         
         <h3>Bad Hysteresis</h3>
         
         <p>Just because hysteresis <b>can</b> be implemented well,
         and <b>can</b> be useful, does not mean that it is always
         good. An example of bad hysteresis (time slop or lag) is in
         Microsoft Windows using contextual or popup menus. If you
         right click on a folder, or use the start menu, there can be
         a long pause while Windows creates the menu. Win98 is far
         worse than Win95, to the point at which in some bad cases
         (on fast machines) it can take many seconds (like up to 30)
         for your menu to actually appear. The lag is not just one
         time, it can do it for various stages in a hierarchy -- so
         if you try to get to the next level, it can &#34;hang&#34; for a
         while to create the submenu as well. This whole thing is
         aggravated by things like animated &#34;sliding out&#34; menus that
         assault you in Win98. Most of the time usage isn&#39;t that bad,
         but it can be, and it shouldn&#39;t exist at all. Microsoft gets
         so caught up in that they <b>can</b> creating wizzy features
         (like dynamically created menus, or animated menus), that
         they don&#39;t pay attention to usability and whether they even
         should create those features, or what the tradeoffs will be.
         
         </p><p>Microsoft has a long history, and proud corporate
         philosophy of &#34;slap it together quick, then fix it later&#34;.
         They used to brag about this, and about how they are always
         bolting new features on (instead of designing them right the
         first time). Sadly, this attitude has qualitative costs
         throughout the system, and it shows in their implementations
         of hysteresis. Some Applications support only the pre-Win3
         Hysteresis -- which was none. Most Applications support the
         post Win3 hysteresis -- which was some on menus, but that is
         about it. A few Applications even support the post-Win95
         Hysteresis -- which is far more parameters (including
         controls). But Microsoft has not made most of the Hysteresis
         items standard, they haven&#39;t documented some of it well,
         they haven&#39;t enforced it as a standard, and so Hysteresis is
         only there some of the time and it behaves in dramatically
         different ways. The only thing worse than no hysteresis is
         inconsistent hysteresis. 
         
         </p><p>Fortunately for Microsoft, most Windows users don&#39;t
         understand why things work &#34;funky&#34;, and so they blame
         themselves (instead of Microsoft). Mac users know that
         things &#34;don&#39;t work right&#34; when using a PC, and they
         correctly blame Microsoft, but they usually can&#39;t explain
         why (so they get called bigots). But now we know that at
         least some of it has to do with Microsoft&#39;s poor and
         inconsistent use of hysteresis.
         
         </p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
         
         <p>Hysteresis is basically &#34;time&#34; slop -- or even distance
         slop. It means the computer is actually being &#34;less
         accurate&#34; and allowing the mouse to be slightly off target,
         or a lag in redraw or update. But because humans are not
         perfectly accurate all the time, it is a way for the
         computer to adapt to working with people. Allowing
         hysteresis makes the computer &#34;feel&#34; more natural, by it
         behaving less accurately (and being more human). This &#34;slop&#34;
         is not dissimilar to another concept in computers called
         &#34;fuzzy logic&#34; -- which has helped improve many aspects of
         computing as well. Programmers are slowly learning to adapt
         computers to work better with humans, concepts like
         hysteresis are one step on the path -- but we still have a
         long way to go.
