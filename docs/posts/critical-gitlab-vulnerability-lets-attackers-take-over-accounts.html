<p>GitLab has addressed a critical severity vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to take over user accounts using hardcoded passwords.</p>
<p>The bug (discovered internally and tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1162" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2022-1162</a>) affects both GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).</p>
<p>This flaw results from static passwords accidentally set during OmniAuth-based registration in GitLab CE/EE.</p>
<p>&#34;A hardcoded password was set for accounts registered using an OmniAuth provider (e.g. OAuth, LDAP, SAML) in GitLab CE/EE versions 14.7 prior to 14.7.7, 14.8 prior to 14.8.5, and 14.9 prior to 14.9.2 allowing attackers to potentially take over accounts,&#34; the GitLab team explained in a security advisory published on Thursday.</p>
<p>GitLab urged users to immediately upgrade all GitLab installations to the latest versions (14.9.2, 14.8.5, or 14.7.7) to block potential attacks.</p>
<p>&#34;We strongly recommend that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible,&#34; they <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/03/31/critical-security-release-gitlab-14-9-2-released/#static-passwords-inadvertently-set-during-omniauth-based-registration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/e2fb87ec5d4e235d6b83454980cec9c049849a1c#5c0ba240988a5482dcc1747338da4852f51c668a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">code commit</a> submitted two days shows that GitLab deleted the &#39;lib/gitlab/password.rb&#39; file, which was used to assign a weak hardcoded password to the &#39;TEST_DEFAULT&#39; constant.</p>

<h2>Passwords reset for some GitLab users</h2>
<p>GitLab also added that it reset the passwords of a limited number of GitLab.com users as part of the CVE-2022-1162 mitigation effort.</p>
<p>It also found no evidence that any accounts have been compromised by attackers using this hardcode password security flaw.</p>
<p>&#34;We executed a reset of GitLab.com passwords for a selected set of users as of 15:38 UTC,&#34; the GitLab team said.</p>
<p>&#34;Our investigation shows no indication that users or accounts have been compromised but we&#39;re taking precautionary measures for our users&#39; security.&#34;</p>
<p>When asked to share the number of Gitlab.com users who had their passwords reset, a GitLab spokesperson shared the info already available in the advisory telling BleepingComputer that they only did it for &#34;a selected set of users.&#34;</p>

<h2>Script to identify affected user accounts</h2>
<p>While GitLab says no user accounts have been breached so far, the company has created a script that self-managed instance admins can use to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/03/31/critical-security-release-gitlab-14-9-2-released/#script-to-identify-users-potentially-impacted-by-cve-2022-1162" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">identify user accounts potentially impacted by CVE-2022-1162</a>. </p>
<p>After identifying potentially affected user accounts, admins are advised to reset the users&#39; passwords.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 organizations use its DevOps platform, according to GitLab, and the company estimates it has more than 30 million estimated registered users from 66 countries worldwide.</p>
