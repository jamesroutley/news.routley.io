    <h1>IBM to Acquire Confluent</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>We are excited to announce that Confluent has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by IBM. After the transaction is closed (subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals), together, IBM and Confluent will aim to provide a platform that unifies the world’s largest enterprises, unlocking data for cloud/microservices, accelerating time-to-value, and building the real-time data foundation required to scale AI across every organization. </p><p>The below email was shared earlier today from Jay Kreps, CEO and Co-Founder of Confluent to our Confluent team. </p><p>We want to thank our team members for their continued hard work and dedication that defined a new category of data streaming and paved the way for this next chapter. We look forward to their ongoing contributions as a part of IBM after the transaction closes. For more information, please see the announcement press release (<a href="https://www.confluent.io/press-release/ibm-to-acquire-confluent-to-create-smart-data-platform-for-enterprise/">click to view</a>).</p><hr/><blockquote><p>Confluent Team, </p><p>I’m excited to share that a few moments ago, we announced that Confluent has signed an agreement to be acquired by IBM in an all cash deal for $31.00 per share. Confluent will continue to operate as a distinct brand and business within IBM post-close.</p><p>Later this morning, December 8, at 9 a.m. PT and again in the evening at 7 p.m. PT, we will have a Company All Hands meeting, where I will share details about this announcement and answer your questions, alongside the rest of the executive team. In the meantime, we have a FAQ in the wiki with some more details.  I know this may be surprising so I wanted to take the time to walk you through why this is the best path for Confluent.</p><p>In the letter I wrote at our IPO in 2021, I said that “There is a saying that a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing--Confluent is a company that knows a very big thing” and that rings true for me today. </p><p>Data is at the heart of what companies need to do to harness AI, modernize their operations, and build the next generation of applications; and Confluent is at the heart of what companies need to harness their data. This has been our goal in the team we’ve built, the products we’ve shipped, and the customer relationships we’ve cultivated. That conviction has only grown stronger.</p><p>IBM sees the same future we do: one in which enterprises run on continuous, event-driven intelligence, with data moving freely and reliably across every part of the business. They see that this connective layer will define how companies operate for decades to come, they understand open source and its power, and they work with some of the largest hybrid enterprises in the world. By joining forces, we can bring this architecture to far more organizations, accelerating the shift toward real-time and AI-powered operations globally.</p><p>IBM also has a long history of supporting open source and has demonstrated real leadership in this area with their prior acquisitions of Red Hat and HashiCorp. Our shared values of technical leadership, customer trust, and the belief that data is foundational to the next generation of AI is a big part of why I&#39;m excited.</p><p>Becoming part of IBM won’t change Confluent’s mission; it will amplify it. The idea that sparked Kafka, grew into Confluent, and shaped an entire new category of data infrastructure now enters a phase where it can scale even more broadly and meaningfully.</p><p>Serving as CEO and leading this team over the past eleven years has been and continues to be the great privilege of my career. I’m profoundly proud of what we’ve built—the products, the technology, and equally important, the culture that has defined Confluent from the very beginning. Your passion, your talent, and your unwavering commitment have been a constant source of energy and inspiration. There isn’t a group I’d be happier to be in the trenches with, and I could not be more excited about this next chapter. </p><p>We’re still pretty early in this process, so there are many details that still need to be figured out. Until the deal officially closes (subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, which we expect by the middle of 2026), Confluent will continue to operate as a separate, independent company, and our priorities remain the same. I’m committed to being as transparent as possible throughout the coming months to keep you informed and up-to-date on timelines and integration plans. For now, your role, manager, pay, benefits, and our policies stay the same, and we still need to deliver on our Q4 and future commitments to our customers, partners, and team.</p><p>Now, more than ever, we’re here to set data in motion.</p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Jay </p></blockquote><hr/><p><i><b>Additional Information and Where to Find It</b></i></p><p><i>This communication may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the proposed acquisition of Confluent, Inc.
