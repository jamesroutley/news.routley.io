    <h1>Unix Conspiracy (1991)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a id="Unix-conspiracy"> [ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
   </a><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/ITS.html"><i>ITS</i></a> and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/TOPS-20.html"><i>TOPS-20</i></a> fans, Unix&#39;s
   growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs,
   whose intent was to hobble AT&amp;T&#39;s competitors by making them dependent
   upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T&#39;s control.
   This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is
   apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable
   and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&amp;T).  This
   theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper referenced in
   the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/back-door.html"><i>back door</i></a> entry.</p><p>In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer
   viruses (see <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/V/virus.html"><i>virus</i></a>) — but a virus spread to
   computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this ‘Unix virus’
   theory like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation “<span>Unix is
   snake oil</span>” was uttered by <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/DEC.html"><i>DEC</i></a> president
   Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting its own family of
   Unix workstations.  (Olsen now claims to have been misquoted.)</p><p>If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
   plotters&#39; control after 1990.  AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to Novell
   around the same time <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/L/Linux.html"><i>Linux</i></a> and other free-Unix
   distributions were beginning to make noise.</p></div></div>
