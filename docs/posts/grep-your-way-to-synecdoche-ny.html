<p><em>In writing another blog post about grepping code, I found myself wandering off in a digression that felt like a blog version of the yellow boxes in high school history textbooks that everyone skips over—you know the content that’s meant to add some non-essential extra color to the text (hence the yellow box on otherwise white pages?)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">Grep</a> is <em>the</em> command-line search utility. It is so ubiquitous and has been around for so long that “to grep” for something means using any tool for searching through code (or text) on a computer. I was looking for a word to describe this phenomena and was tipped off about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy">metonymy</a> by Claire, and clicking around got me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>. It’s possible I’m using it in a subtly incorrect way, but my understanding is that it’s “a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole”. For example, Hoover being used to mean vacuum or Band-Aid for adhesive bandage. The tool I use to grep depends on what environment I’m in: <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag</a> in my shell (since it’s faster), the built-in search in an IDE (cmd+shift+f in VSCode), or plain old grep when ssh&#39;ed into a remote machine.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned discussion, I played the pronunciation for synecdoche out loud and remarked how close it sounds to “Schenectady”. This time I was tipped off about a delightfully named Charlie Kaufman movie named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche,_New_York">Synecdoche, New York</a>. The word itself seems quite pretentious, so it’s funny to see that in the response from critics “some called [the movie] pretentious or self-indulgent, but others declared it a masterpiece”.</p>
<p>Happy new year, thank you for joining me for my first new word of the year. May you have meandering conversations and enjoy obscure wordplay in 2022. Back to regular programming next week.</p></div>
