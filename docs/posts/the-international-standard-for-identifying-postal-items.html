    <h1>The international standard for identifying postal items</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever received a parcel from overseas? I did recently, from Switzerland!</p>

<p>Looking at the envelope, I realised the format of the tracking number (<code>UT038926726CH</code>) was in a very similar (if not identical) format to ones I&#39;d used frequently here in the UK.</p>
<p>I&#39;d been receiving emails from Royal Mail about the parcel, so I just presumed that there was some data-sharing agreement in place with Swiss Post and Royal Mail had just given the parcel their own internal reference number.</p>

<p>But seeing the reference number printed on the envelope from the get-go made me want to see what Swiss Post had to say about it...</p>

<p>The same tracking number works across multiple carriers, and it&#39;s the same format as all the UK ones! What gives??</p>
<h2 id="toc_1">Enter: the United Nations Universal Postal Union</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union">Universal Postal Union (UPU)</a> is an agency of the UN that coordinates postal policies to facilitate post flowing across the world. As part of this, it publishes the <a href="https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/files/postalSolutions/programmesAndServices/standards/S10-12.pdf">S10 standard for the identification of postal items</a> in a 13-character format - ie. what we&#39;ve been seeing on our parcels!</p>
<div><p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the UPU&#39;s interesting 150-year history, you might want to check out <a href="https://imiqbal.com/what-is-the-universal-postal-union/">this article</a> written by fellow webring inhabitant Imaan! </p></div>

<p>Each country&#39;s national postal service is assigned as having exclusive reign over S10 codes for that country, and they go about issuing S10 codes from their country.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">Tracking Number Format</h3>
<p>As it turns out, the structure of our tracking number has a strict design, and our tracking number contains four distinct things:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Character number</th>
  <th>Format</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>1 and 2</td>
  <td>2 letters</td>
  <td>Service indicator</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3 to 10</td>
  <td>8 digits</td>
  <td>Serial number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>11</td>
  <td>1 digit</td>
  <td>A check digit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>12 and 13</td>
  <td>2 letters</td>
  <td>ISO 3166–1 country code representing the origin of the item</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="toc_3">The Service Indicator</h4>
<p>The first two characters represent the service that&#39;s been used to post the item. There&#39;s a fairly extensive list in the standard, with specific options for tracked post, letter post, parcel post... the list goes on. The most interesting part of the service indicators are threefold:</p>
<p>First, there are specific carve-outs in the specification for an organisation called <a href="https://www.ems.post/en/about-us/about-us">EMS</a> - they get all <code>E</code> prefixes, so <code>EA</code>, <code>EB</code>, <code>EC</code>, and so on and so forth. EMS is an express international mail service that&#39;s run by the UPU itself, but that delegates operations to the national postal services that control their country&#39;s S10 codes. This is why you&#39;ll not see any way to buy shipping using EMS directly on their website - you buy express international shipping at your local post office and they route it accordingly. It&#39;s also worth noting that this only applies to express shipping - not regular-rate traffic.</p>
<p>Second, countries are allowed to override some of the service indicator assignment rules set out in the S10 standard. This can happen when either a parcel is being sent domestically or when a carrier has an agreement with other countries&#39; carriers to reassign some service indicators for other purposes, hence the inclusion of the origin country code to aid interpretation of tracking numbers where this is the case.</p>
<p>Lastly, some service indicators are explicitly disallowed from being used. These are <code>JA–JZ</code>, <code>KA–KZ</code>, <code>SA–SZ</code>, <code>TA–TZ</code> and <code>WA–WZ</code> since these carry the risk of causing a tracking number to be confused with codes from a different UN data encoding standard.</p>
<p>All in, the possible service indicator space looks like this:</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="toc_4">The Serial Number</h4>
<p>This is just a serial number. It&#39;s exactly 8 digits long and is generated by the originating carrier as they see fit, provided they don&#39;t resue the same number within 12 months. In theory, this means a lost parcel can only be lost for 12 months before it vanishes from the world forever, but in reality, the S10 recommends not reusing a number within a minimum period of 24 months. Even then, you have 100 million parcels per service indicator per country available to be issued, so it&#39;s probably not going to be necessary for a carrier to reuse a number for a much longer period of time anyway.</p>
<h4 id="toc_5">The Check Digit</h4>
<p>The check digit corrects any errors in the serial number preceding it, using the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiply each digit in the sequence with the corresponding number from this sequence: <code>8 6 4 2 3 5 9 7</code></li>
<li>Sum all these values</li>
<li>Divide the sum by 11</li>
<li>Substrac the remainder from 11</li>
<li>If the result is in the range 1-9, use that as the checksum</li>
<li>If the result is 10, use 0 as the checksum</li>
<li>If the result is 11, use 5 as the checksum</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a particularly strong checksum, but it&#39;s good enough to guard against a couple of accidental digit-swaps here and there. You can play with an interactive demo of it <a href="https://s10.avl.la/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="toc_6">Barcode Format</h3>
<p>The S10 standard requires tracking numbers to be printed on an item as a barcode, either being in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128">Code 128</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39">Code 39</a> format.</p>
<p>Additional barcodes on the label are discouraged, particularly for international items, and carriers that must include other barcodes are required to use a different format and not obscure the S10 code. This is why you&#39;ll see Royal Mail, for example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix">data matrices</a> on their labels.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="toc_7">Other Fun Things in the Standard</h3>
<ol>
<li>A plaintext representation of an S10 code must be printed within 1-5mm of the barcode</li>
<li>Such plaintext should be in the format <code>AB 123 456 789 GB</code></li>
<li>Sans-serif fonts are required, with specific requirements as to the sizing of each letter</li>
<li>National carriers are allowed to delegate issuing responsibility to a third party provided they can ensure no number is reissued within the year</li>
<li>The country code at the end of the tracking number isn&#39;t actually a reliable indicator of the country of origin but the nationality of the carrier of origin (eg. in the case of an overseas territory, a national carrier could still use the mainland code)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_8">Update: 2026-06-14</h2>
<p>An earlier version of this post said that there are 10 million serial numbers per service indicator, which is wrong; there are 100 million. Thank you to Jeff for pointing this out via email :)</p>
