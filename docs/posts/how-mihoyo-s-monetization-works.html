    <h1>How Mihoyo&#39;s monetization works</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>








<p>You open your favourite social media site. You see the same discussions come up again.</p>



<p>Imaginarium Theatre. Divergent Universe. Power creep. Player rewards. The monthly gacha revenue PvP leaderboards.</p>



<p>But it feels like something is missing. These issues all feel related. But how? And why can two games made by the same developer still feel so different despite having so many similarities?</p>



<p>That’s what I want to talk about today:</p>



<ul>
<li>How do gacha companies think about revenue?</li>



<li>Why does your core game design matter for monetization?</li>



<li>How does your game vision / content design / value delivery change based on your monetization goals?</li>
</ul>



<p>I will use Genshin and HSR for my examples, but the lessons and concepts are applicable to lots of other live services and gacha games more broadly as well.</p>







<p>At its core, gacha companies make money by making you roll the gacha. Their revenue can therefore be modelled as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenue </strong>= <strong>Player Desire to Consume</strong> (e.g. gacha / Resin refresh / BP / etc.) – <strong>Free Income</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there’s only two ways for gacha companies to make more money from its players. Either:</p>



<ol>
<li>Make you want to consume more; or</li>



<li>Limit your free income</li>
</ol>



<p>It also happens that both of these levers are fully in control of the game studio. Therefore, all players exist in a fully planned and controlled economy the game studio owns.</p>

<h2><span id="2a_generosity_is_calibrated_to_drive_a_specific_baseline_revenue">2a. “Generosity” is calibrated to drive a specific baseline revenue</span></h2>



<p>All free income effectively subsidises the spending of your players. So how do you determine what the optimal subsidisation level is?</p>



<ul>
<li>When you have a large enough player base, you can divide up your players into specific groups and study their spending behaviour.
<ul>
<li>Modelling the player base at an aggregate level works because even though individual players make very personal decisions for their spending (e.g. meta value / character personality / character “personality” / etc.), in large enough groups the behaviour is predictable and normalised.</li>



<li>Because free income directly offsets player spend, free income should not scale linearly with purchasable content. Instead, you should measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)">elasticity</a> for your key player demographics</li>



<li><em>i.e. the change in purchasing behaviour to changes in factors such as price or income</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The more inelastic your player behaviour, the less free income should scale with purchasable content</li>



<li>You can then scenario model different levels of free income subsidisation and determine the revenue maximising level of subsidy</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Calculate-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Calculate-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Calculate-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Calculate.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>For a basic demonstration of subsidisation effects, let’s compare how Mihoyo monetizes Genshin vs HSR. We can create several simple personas to represent different demographics of players:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Super-Whale Seto:</strong> Screw the rules, Seto has money. They instantly C6 every character on release.</li>



<li><strong>Meta Morgan:</strong> Morgan is a Tactician and their parent Robin taught them to have lots of tactical options. As a dolphin they pull for half of the Limited characters that release every region and get C2 / E2 on all of them.</li>



<li><strong>F2P Florian:</strong> Florian spends all their money buying Vitamins, Mints, and Stellar Terra Shards. So they don’t have any money left to spend on gacha games.</li>
</ul>



<p>So what do we find if we do the maths?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Super-Whale Seto</strong></td><td><strong>Genshin</strong></td><td><strong>HSR</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Spend Per Patch (USD)</em></td><td>1,350</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Chars Pulled Per Patch</em></td><td>7.6</td><td>14.0</td></tr><tr><td><em>% Char Ownership</em></td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meta Morgan</strong></td><td><strong>Genshin</strong></td><td><strong>HSR</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Spend Per Patch (USD)</em></td><td>160</td><td>350</td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Chars Pulled Per Patch</em></td><td>1.6</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td><em>% Char Ownership</em></td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>F2P Florian</strong></td><td><strong>Genshin</strong></td><td><strong>HSR</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Spend Per Patch (USD)</em></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><em>Average Chars Pulled Per Patch</em></td><td>0.8</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td><em>% Char Ownership</em></td><td>71%</td><td>57%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So what conclusions can we draw from this analysis?</p>



<ul>
<li>Mihoyo isn’t stupid. The extra free rolls in HSR are <strong>undermined by the faster character release schedule</strong>;</li>



<li>The free income barely subsidises the faster character release schedule. This implies that Mihoyo has determined that <strong>most dolphin / whale players have highly inelastic spending behaviour</strong>;</li>



<li>F2P players in HSR <strong>get to pull for more characters overall </strong>which can be more satisfying;</li>



<li>BUT if an F2P player likes more than 60% of the characters Mihoyo makes, then Genshin lets them <strong>own a greater proportion of the total character pool</strong>;</li>



<li>So in the end <s>it doesn’t even matter</s> <strong>the F2P generosity in HSR pulls is funded by squeezing the dolphins and whales harder</strong> by making them spend approx 2x or more what they spend in Genshin</li>
</ul>



<p>“Generosity” therefore is a meaningless word. When a gacha game developer gives you free income, the most important question is: “What is their plan to make back their money?”</p>



<h2><span id="2b_why_dont_all_games_just_squeeze_their_whales_by_releasing_more_characters">2b. Why don’t all games just squeeze their whales by releasing more characters?</span></h2>



<p>Remember, there are two ways for gacha companies to make more money from its players:</p>



<ol>
<li>Make you want to consume more; or</li>



<li>Limit your free income</li>
</ol>



<p>So how do companies make you want to consume more?</p>



<p>Games are a series of interconnected systems. You cannot just make changes to one system without cascading effects to every other system in your game. For example, your character release pace has significant implications for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game combat and combat mechanics design;</li>



<li>The speed of power creep and the impact of power creep;</li>



<li>Player account development and farming mechanics;</li>



<li>etc.</li>
</ul>



<p>So… let’s talk about all of this then. How does a gacha game’s core game design need to be built around its income structure?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Blocks-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Blocks-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Blocks-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Blocks.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>







<p>There is always tension between design and monetization. However, a cohesive game should ideally have its game design and monetization features work together as much as possible. If the two aspects fight with each other too much, then it ruins the player experience.</p>



<p>An example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">homo-economicus</a> brain thinking too hard about price sensitivity and not enough about how games actually work is John Riccitiello, former CEO of Electronic Arts and Unity:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7cpdrn/ea_ceo_john_riccitiellos_thoughts_on/"><em>When you are six hours into playing Battlefield and you run out of ammo in your clip, and we ask you for a dollar to reload, you’re really not very price sensitive at that point in time.</em></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>John Riccitiello is an example of someone who doesn’t actually understand how game design works. His career started in Consumer Packaged Good (CPG) such as Chlorox, Pepsi, and Häagen-Dazs.</p>



<p>To him, games are just another product sitting on the shelf. A key goal in CPG is seeing how to extract the maximum value from a consumer purchase of a product and trying to shovel as much product into people’s faces as possible. The consumer experience can be optional.</p>



<p>This is the consequence of not understanding game design and how it must support your monetization goals: A nightmare of a game that fundamentally does not respect its players. And in turn, you create bad games that flop.</p>



<h2><span id="3a_lets_talk_about_how_design_works_in_rpg_games_then">3a. Let’s talk about how design works in RPG games then</span></h2>



<p>Design is a massive open topic and varies massively depending on what you’re talking about. For the sake of brevity, I’m just going to focus on role-playing games (both action RPG such as Genshin or turn-based RPG such as HSR).</p>



<p>A large focus in role-playing games is combat. Satisfying combat is about the balance between the combat encounters versus the player and the “power” the player has.</p>



<p>Very broadly speaking, in most games the “power” a player has is determined by what their account owns. This is a combination of:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Power </strong>= <strong>Player Skill</strong> (e.g. game knowledge, reflexes, etc.) + <strong>Characters </strong>(e.g. base numbers, element / path, etc.) + <strong>Gear</strong> (e.g. Artifacts / Relics, weapons, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other games in these genres will follow similar structure although the exact terminology and systems may vary (e.g. Craft Essences such as Kaleidoscope in FGO are an example of Gear, MMORPGs such as FFXIV have Classes instead of Characters, etc.)</p>



<p>Monetization will directly influence how the 3 components of player skill, character kit, and gear are designed and balanced.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Scale-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Scale-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Scale-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Scale.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>The key goal in monetization is for your game’s systems to <strong>create continuous and regular impulses to spend</strong>.</p>



<p>A healthy long-term monetization system should therefore have <strong>repeatable design levers</strong> that can be used to <strong>reliably generate demand</strong> <strong>without compromising the core gameplay experience</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="3b_how_does_power_work_for_genshin_vs_hsr">3b. How does power work for Genshin vs HSR?</span></h2>



<p>Let’s consider the difference between Genshin and HSR and what this means for the power equation.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Factor</strong></td><td><strong>Genshin</strong></td><td><strong>HSR</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Player Skill: Game balance</em></td><td>Even the most whale player still needs to learn how to actually press buttons, play a rotation, etc.</td><td>You can just turn on auto-battle if you’re strong enough. Zero thinking or player skill required.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Player Skill vs Char Kit</em></td><td>Players can use skill to overcome character kit limitations</td><td>No amount of player skill can make a single target attack do AoE damage</td></tr><tr><td><em>Characters: Ease of building</em></td><td>Talent Books can only be farmed with Resin or bought with Genesis Crystals</td><td>Trace materials can be bought with non-paid currency in the store in addition to regular farming</td></tr><tr><td><em>Characters: Ease of building</em></td><td>World Bosses drop 2-3 level up materials (random)</td><td>World Bosses drop a fixed value of 5 materials</td></tr><tr><td><em>Characters: Ease of building</em></td><td>46 Boss Materials for full uncap with 2.55 average drops per run and 40 Resin per run requires 720 Resin on average to fully uncap.</td><td>65 Boss Materials for full uncap with 5 drops per run and 30 Trailblaze Power (TP) per Run requires 390 TP to fully uncap.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Characters: Crowning</em></td><td>Crowns are highly limited and only available from Limited Time Flagship Events or Offering systems (e.g. Sacred Sakura)</td><td>Tracks are sold in the Shop, available in the Battle Pass, and weekly Simulated Universe rewards in addition to Events.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Characters: Power Creep</em></td><td>Slower level of power creep. Many 4-Star chars are meta-defining and have been for years (e.g. Bennett).</td><td>Faster power creep. Almost no reason to use a 4-Star character if a 5-Star character equivalent exists.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Gear: Artifacts / Relics Set Bonuses</em></td><td>Very powerful with clear BIS choices and Resin efficient Domains to farm (e.g. Momiji for EOSF / Shim, Denouement for MH / GT)</td><td>Many 4pc set bonuses are bad and 2pc / 2pc or Rainbow is very viable. There is no clear Momiji level of Resin efficient Domain</td></tr><tr><td><em>Gear: Artifacts / Relics</em></td><td>Difficult to min / max</td><td>The increased number of things your substats can roll into makes it harder to obtain min / max pieces</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I can go on and on (e.g. Strongbox vs Synthesizing). But hopefully you can already start to see the pattern and main conclusion:</p>



<p><strong>HSR has a stronger emphasis on the balance of power for Characters. Devaluing everything else in the power equation means forcing you to roll for more characters to reliably access power.</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Topaz-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Topaz-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Topaz-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Topaz.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>This makes perfect sense. We saw that HSR has a much stronger focus on squeezing its players through faster character release schedules as part of its core monetisation focus.</p>



<p>To make this monetization approach work, the game design of HSR itself must be skewed around characters as well. Players need to be pressured to pull for characters frequently enough, and the game needs to make it as easy to “onboard” characters onto an account:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game that <strong>wants you to constantly pull new characters</strong> has to be a game that <strong>makes levelling and building characters easy</strong>;</li>



<li>The game has to <strong>make it more difficult for you to brute force content by having good gear</strong> (that you didn’t gacha for at least) compared to an equivalent game;</li>



<li>The game has to <strong>design content that requires owning a wider variety of characters.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>So we understand that game developers can tweak the balance of power to influence spending. But players (mostly) don’t accumulate power for the sake of power. Players need content that’s worth accumulating power for.</p>



<p>So we need to look at the other flip side of design in RPGs: Encounters and combat.</p>



<h2><span id="3c_the_live_services_content_pipeline_must_follow_your_monetization_approach">3c. The live services content pipeline must follow your monetization approach</span></h2>



<p>Traditional RPGs and live services gacha RPGs have a significant difference that fundamentally alters how content can be designed.</p>



<p>In traditional RPGs, the variation in power between players will be very narrow because developers have full control of a player’s power. This means that enemy encounter design and difficulty can be highly customised and fine tuned based on the tools the developer knows the player has.</p>



<p>For example, in Fire Emblem the developer can choose when players get access to higher tier weapons or class promotion items. If the developer knows what the maximum damage a player can do, then they know how to balance fight difficulty.</p>



<p>However, this is not possible in gacha games because at any moment, the player can just pull out a credit card. The wide spread in power between players means that traditional encounter design techniques do not work.</p>



<p>Instead, combat design needs to use design approaches that:</p>



<ol>
<li>Rely on restricting / punishing players;</li>



<li>Lean into the variance and encourage spending to brute force content; and</li>



<li>Create methods that are repeatable and reusable.</li>
</ol>



<p>So how is the approach different for Genshin vs HSR?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Look-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Look-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Look-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Look.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<h3><span id="3ci_hsr_focuses_on_restrictive_gameplay_by_dividing_characters_by_kit_features">3ci. HSR focuses on restrictive gameplay by dividing characters by kit features</span></h3>



<p>HSR is a game that emphasises characters within the power equation. So combat design likewise creates a reward / punish approach to matching the right character for the right job.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with HSR, all characters are classified by their ‘Path’. Very loosely speaking, you can think of them as RPG classes. For example:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Path</strong></td><td><strong>Feature</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nihility</strong></td><td>Debuffers including DoT-based characters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Preservation</strong></td><td>Defensive characters / “Tanks” and Shields</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Abundance</strong></td><td>Healers and Healing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hunt</strong></td><td>Single-target DPS characters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Erudition</strong></td><td>AoE-focused DPS characters</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>HSR further subdivides this by also having multiple ways to structure and classify attacks such as Follow-Up Attacks (FUA), damage scaling with shields, etc. The turn-based combat system also allows for other mechanics around manipulating the turn order.</p>



<p>This means that HSR is built from the ground up to have a massive number of levers that Mihoyo can manipulate to design combat encounters. This structure lets Mihoyo create puzzle-style gameplay that uses combat as the vehicle for delivering the puzzle.</p>



<p>The characters you own and the tools available in their kits form the solutions to the “combat puzzles”. As a result, HSR combat can be structured to punish or reward players based on the characters they own and can use.</p>



<h4><span id="3ci-1_simulated_universe">3ci-1. Simulated Universe</span></h4>



<p>A great example is the Simulated Universe (SU) game mode. SU is a rogue-like game mode based around Path themes. For example, playing the Elation path in SU buffs your FUAs.</p>



<p>This means the game mode is explicitly restrictive. Afterall, if you don’t own a character that can create shields, then what is the point of playing the Preservation Path SU mode which completely revolves around shields?</p>



<p>The new Divergent Universe mode is also noteworthy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Destruction Path has been heavily modified to promote gameplay around the Break mechanic rather than raw damage, which earlier iterations of SU focused on;</li>



<li>Break related Blessings and Equations have also been pushed very heavily and are so overtuned that Break is one of the best strategies in this game mode; and</li>



<li>At higher difficulty levels (Protocol 6), enemies have a damage reduction modifier when not in the Break / weakened state.</li>
</ul>



<p>HSR also released the character Firefly (a highly anticipated Break-specific Destruction character) in the same patch Divergent Universe was released. What a coincidence!</p>



<h4><span id="3ci-2_events">3ci-2. Events</span></h4>



<p>The stages within combat events are often focused explicitly on specific features of combat to create the puzzle structure that explicitly encourages or discourages certain playstyles.</p>



<p>For example, in the <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_War/Stages">Tides of War</a> event, each stage has explicit mechanics to reward players for HP consumption / FUAs / DoTs / etc.</p>



<p>The logical extension of this is <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Galactic_Baseballer">The Legend of Galactic Baseballer</a> event. This is a fun rogue-like game mode event that is explicitly built around constructing scenarios that use character kit tools as problem solving answers.</p>



<p>The Galactic Baseballer event then rewards you for using the right character kit tools with massive numbers, game breaking effects such as turn manipulation, and the accompanying big number dopamine hits.</p>



<h4><span id="3ci-3_pure_fiction_memory_of_chaos_apocalyptic_shadow">3ci-3. Pure Fiction / Memory of Chaos / Apocalyptic Shadow</span></h4>



<p>These game modes are “end game” modes similar to the Spiral Abyss in Genshin.</p>



<p>The Pure Fiction game mode is explicitly an AoE-focused wave-based game mode. Because grouping does not exist, then players either own characters who have AoE damage or they don’t own characters with AoE.</p>



<p>Before Pure Fiction, the main end-game mode was Memory of Chaos (MoC). What happened to MOC design before and after Pure Fiction’s release in Patch 1.6?</p>



<div>
<div>




<p>You can see clearly from the graph that there are three “eras” of MoC:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Patch 1.0: </strong>Initial release of MoC with 10 Floors max only</li>



<li><strong>Patch 1.3:</strong> Introduction of Floors 11 and 12 as the hardest floors wth increasing focus on Boss and Elite enemies</li>



<li><strong>Patch 1.6 Part 2:</strong> Futher reduction in enemy volume and almot every fight is focused on Boss and Elite enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>As soon as the AoE game mode launched, Mihoyo got rid of most of the trash mobs in the hardest MoC floors. Instead, they dramatically raised the difficulty with harder enemies and a greater focus on single target damage.</p>



<p>Afterall, <strong>players shouldn’t be rewarded twice for owning AoE characters… right?</strong></p>



<p>Because HSR combat was designed to have multiple levers Mihoyo can manipulate, they can also create Blessings that are hyper-targeted. This means they can heavily influence how they want players to problem solve and avoid brute forcing content.</p>



<p>For example, compare the <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Hall/Stages/2.2">June 2024 HSR MOC</a> versus the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Spiral_Abyss/Floors/2024-06-16">June 2024 Genshin Abyss</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>HSR Blessing:</strong> Provides up to 75% ATK and 150% Break Effect in addition to a 100% Action Advance. Even ignoring the action advance, the raw value of stats is worth <strong>40 substats for every single team member</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Genshin Blessing:</strong> Provides up to 60% Elemental or Physical Damage %. This is worth <strong>approximately 10 substats</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>To come up with a Blessing as extreme as the one in HSR, Genshin would need to offer something equivalent to: <em>When you trigger Dendro reactions 5 times, your entire team gains </em><strong><em>944 EM</em></strong></p>



<p>Likewise, Pure Fiction has also been a game mode that has rotated between a fixed set of 3 buffs rewarding:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimates</strong> (Patches 1.6 and 2.1);</li>



<li><strong>DoT damage </strong>(Patches 1.6 and 2.2);</li>



<li>and <strong>FUA damage</strong> (Patches 2.0, 2.1, and 2.3).</li>
</ul>



<p>It is very clear at this point that Mihoyo explicitly expects players to build teams around these themes and pull for the required supporting characters in the gacha.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Gamba-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Gamba-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Gamba-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Gamba.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<h3><span id="3cii_genshin_has_fewer_levers_for_restrictive_gameplay_so_its_design_looks_different">3cii. Genshin has fewer levers for restrictive gameplay so its design looks different</span></h3>



<p>HSR was built from the ground up to have multiple combat systems that could explicitly reward or punish players. Genshin was not.</p>



<p>Geshin also has a larger focus on other components in the power equation which contributes to variance between players (e.g. player skill, Artifact quality). This in turn lets players brute force content.</p>



<p>For example, do you know someone who basically plays the exact same teams every single Abyss (and completely ignores the Spiral Abyss blessing)?</p>



<p>Since Genshin cannot rely on the same explicit levers as HSR, it requires a different approach to game design to pressure spending.</p>



<h4><span id="3cii-1_combat_shield_breaking">3cii-1. Combat: Shield Breaking</span></h4>



<p>This is one of the classic approaches to Abyss combat design. Elemental shields (generally) cannot be brute forced. This means that players must make sacrifices in team building to handle them.</p>



<p>A classic example is the 3.7 Spiral Abyss which had a combination of Hydro and Cryo Heralds. This is an encounter design that is explicitly hostile to Hydro characters and more specifically Nilou Bloom (which was a very strong and popular team).</p>



<p>As I wrote in my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/13yv88n/lets_talk_about_learning_to_get_good_at_abyss/">3.7 Spiral Abyss Guide</a>, Elemental Shield challenges such as these are designed as a “sink” for key characters. In this case, the 3.7 Spiral Abyss Left Half was designed as a Bennett and (to a lesser extent) Nahida “sink”.</p>



<p><strong>Structuring Abyss layouts to create team building challenges therefore punishes players who lack a deep enough character roster.</strong></p>



<h4><span id="3cii-2_combat_enemy_wave_structures">3cii-2. Combat: Enemy wave structures</span></h4>



<p>Teams in Genshin have specific rotation structures and damage profiles. Encounters can be designed to punish or reward these team structures.</p>



<p>For example, Ayaka Freeze is a team which has:</p>



<ul>
<li>Initial set-up period to cast buffs and pile them onto Ayaka;</li>



<li>Frontloaded spike in damage concentrated in her Burst; and</li>



<li>Period of downtime before the second rotation can begin.</li>
</ul>



<p>This team therefore is good at greeting a pile of AoE mobs and then asking the question: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_It_Blend%3F"><em>“Will it Blend?”</em></a></p>



<p>But it can also be easily punished. During Patch 3.x, Mihoyo wanted to promote its latest new teams and that meant punishing older popular teams from the 2.x era.</p>



<p><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Spiral_Abyss/Floors/2023-02-01">Patch 3.4 Abyss Floor</a> is an excellent example of punishing setup teams from the 2.x era. Abyss Floor 1-1 has 4 waves of single target enemies:</p>



<ul>
<li>If all 4 Ruin Machines spawned at the same time, it’d be a pretty easy clear for Ayaya Freeze;</li>



<li>But when they spawn separately, the threshold to brute force this is so much higher. A 20 sec rotation across 4 waves = 80 sec which is nearly half of your 180 sec limit for a 3★ clear;</li>



<li>If any single enemy requires two rotations, your time allowance basically dies; and</li>



<li>As a front loaded Burst team, if you overkill the first wave then your CDs are down for the next Wave forcing you to run down the clock.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can see similar patterns in other Abyss encounter designs:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most enemies are no longer Venti-able precisely so you cannot solve all your problems with one character;</li>



<li>The developers decide whether enemies are allowed to spawn close enough to be grouped by Kazuha or too far away to be easily grouped
<ul>
<li><em>e.g. The Eremite spawn pattern in Patch 3.4 Abyss Floor 12-3-2 was nerfed specifically to prevent easy grouping</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The Wenut is a boss that has explicit on / off dps phases and extremely predictable attacks to punish setup based teams and reward teams with flexible rotation structures
<ul>
<li><em>e.g. </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMAfw9PWZy0"><em>C0 Ganyu can solo the Wenut</em></a><em> because a constant stream of CAs line up very well against a boss that has low HP and is extremely predictable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Adjusting combat encounter design is another method similar to shield breaking that can indirectly pressure player rosters.</strong></p>



<h4><span id="3cii-3_combat_imaginarium_theater">3cii-3. Combat: Imaginarium Theater</span></h4>



<p>Genshin has also evolved to the point where the variance in even accounts without vertical investment is huge due to factors such as Artifact quality, player skill and game knowledge (do you know how to use i-frames?), etc.</p>



<p>Genshin also can’t create highly restrictive rules such as “the AoE mode” and “the non-AoE mode” in a game where players can just group enemies or manipulate the AI.</p>



<p><strong>Genshin also has a problem where eventually it just cannot convince players to roll for characters with overlapping roles.</strong></p>



<p>For example, HSR can convince you Black Swan vs Blade are Wind DPS characters that are both worth owning because they have different Paths and uses (Nihility DoT vs Destruction Crit Scaling).</p>



<p>But why should someone in Genshin own Hutao vs Yoimiya vs Arlecchino vs Lyney when their team structures are so similar? Do you really need a 4th Pyro on-field DPS character when you can’t own more than one Kazuha / Chevreuse / etc.?</p>



<p>At this point, there are only heavy handed options available to create restrictive gameplay. And so we arrive at the magic world of the Imaginarium Theater, which:</p>



<ul>
<li>Forcibly locks accounts to specific elements; and</li>



<li>Restricting the number of times a character can be used per run</li>
</ul>



<p>This form of ham-fisted restrictions is the natural conclusion if you create a game where:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game systems were not built from the ground up to allow for multiple ways to differentiate between characters that perform the same role;</li>



<li>The power equation is sufficiently skewed to the point where players can brute force combat with highly invested characters; and</li>



<li>The game developers do not want to aggressively power creep characters and instead want characters to retain value over time.</li>
</ul>



<p>It is telling that one of the few things Wuthering Waves did not copy 1-for-1 from Genshin was the Spiral Abyss. Instead, their Tower of Adversity game mode has the same Vigor system that Imaginarium Theater and <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Triumphant_Frenzy">Triumphant Frenzy Event</a> use.</p>



<h4><span id="3cii-4_character_kits_the_bait_constellations">3cii-4. Character Kits: The “Bait Constellations”</span></h4>



<p>Mihoyo needs to create additional avenues of impulse spending to drain free income from players and encourage impulse spending.</p>



<p>This is especially true for long-term highly invested players who have developed accounts and large character rosters.</p>



<ul>
<li>These players don’t experience the same pressures to pull for new characters that a new player with an underdeveloped account does, so may pull on the gacha less; and</li>



<li>These players can stockpile their free income. So when they do finally pull, they can fully subsidize their gacha with free income only.</li>
</ul>



<p>The approach Genshin has taken with modern character design is to push for early “bait Constellations”. For developed accounts looking for a taste of vertical investment, bait Constellations helps drain savings and trigger impulse spending.</p>



<p>How successful has this been?</p>



<p>Consider Neuvillette. His C1 Constellation is generally highly regarded within the community. So how did the community respond?</p>



<ul>
<li>Neuvillette overall ownership rate: 65.5%</li>



<li>Neuvillette C1 rate: 43.3%</li>



<li>Neuvillette overall C1 ownership: 28.4%</li>
</ul>



<p>So about 1 in every 3.5 players in the entire game owns C1 Neuvillette specifically. This ignores all the players who own C2 and up.</p>



<p>To put this into context, there are 8 characters in the game who have an overall ownership rate less than this.</p>



<p>There are 36 Limited characters in the game as of Patch 4.6. So, in a way, <strong>Neuvillette’s C1 Constellation by itself is more popular than 22% of the entire Genshin character roster</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_NeuvSmug-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_NeuvSmug-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_NeuvSmug-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_NeuvSmug.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>That’s a lot of money at stake here. So it’s not surprising that Mihoyo has applied these lessons to HSR and aggressively adopted bait E1 / E2 Constellations designs.</p>



<h2><span id="3d_horniness_is_also_a_form_of_monetization">3d. Horniness is also a form of monetization</span></h2>



<p>The exception is if the motivating factor for pulling characters is horniness. Horniness is evergreen.</p>



<p>If the motivation for spending isn’t gameplay but horniness, then you can get away with a lot. (e.g. NIKKE, Azur Lane, etc.) However, this also requires you to have a clear design vision about building a game focused on eroticism.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Hehe-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Hehe-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Hehe-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_Hehe.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>As such, this can only be adopted by game studios whose vision is to build a niche game and not a mass-market mainstream game.</p>



<h3><span id="3di_what_if_i_do_want_to_make_a_mainstream_game_how_can_i_use_this_knowledge">3di. What if I do want to make a mainstream game? How can I use this knowledge?</span></h3>



<p>The idea behind horniness as a driver for spending is that it is ultimately about appealing to niche individual tastes. So we can apply the same ideas here for Genshin.</p>



<p>One of the problems Mihoyo needs to solve is that it is running a portfolio business now. Its products Genshin, HSR, and ZZZ are all competing with each other and your monthly entertainment budget.</p>



<p>This means Mihoyo needs to deconflict the marquee character releases across its games.</p>



<ul>
<li>For example, you know that Acheron is releasing in March 2024 and will be your blockbuster release that absorbs all the marketing hype;</li>



<li>You need Genshin to not detract from HSR’s success and overshadow Acheron’s release;</li>



<li>But you also don’t want to sacrifice Genshin’s revenue for free.</li>
</ul>



<p>Your goal here is to try and <strong>segment your customers</strong> as much as possible:</p>



<ul>
<li>Allow your blockbuster release in one game to <strong>capture the majority of spending from the broad audience</strong>;</li>



<li><strong>Extract marginal revenue</strong> with niche designs in your second game that won’t compete for broad attention but <strong>drive impulse spending</strong>;</li>
</ul>



<p>What does this look like in practice? Well, consider Chiori. Chiori released in the same month as Acheron, a highly anticipated HSR character.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chiori is a character that is in the bottom 5 for overall ownership. However, Chiori’s fanbase is incredibly intense and is top 3 for C6 Rate;</li>



<li>Chiori has a comparable number of people who went all-out to C6 her compared to other generically popular character such as Navia, Ayato, and Alhaitham;</li>
</ul>



<p>Expect this trend to continue with future character releases and designs as Mihoyo experiments with ways to deconflict its character release schedules across multiple games (e.g. the split player reactions with Emilie).</p>







<p>Enshittification may be a new word for you. So let’s first define what it is. Because I am lazy, I am going to <s>steal</s> borrow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">Wikipedia definition</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Enshittification is the pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and products such as Amazon, Facebook, Google Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber, and Unity.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>How does this occur? The creator of the word enshittification, Cory Doctorow, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">offered an explanation</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.</em></p>



<p><em>I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a “two sided market”, where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, taking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a pretty good observation by a non-business person about how basic Marketing 101 principles work.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_ThumbsUp-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_ThumbsUp-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_ThumbsUp-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_ThumbsUp.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>To explain how enshittification (decreasing quality) affects live service games, I think it is helpful to: </p>



<ul>
<li>First cover the formal Marketing theory about how enshittification occurs;</li>



<li>Secondly, I will propose an alternative reason about why products and services get worse over time;</li>



<li>Then I will explain how Mihoyo avoids enshittification; and</li>



<li>Why enshittification can help explain why Mihoyo seems so resistant to releasing skins in Genshin and HSR</li>
</ul>



<h2><span id="4a_marketing_101_how_does_pricing_work">4a. Marketing 101: How does pricing work?</span></h2>



<p>The fundamental principle in Pricing 101 is: <strong>You can only charge as much as the value you create.</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="500" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_WTP.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_WTP.png 800w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_WTP-300x188.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_WTP-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></figure>



<p>This makes intuitive sense. If you create a product or service worth $10, why would anyone pay more than $10 for it?</p>



<p>However, companies do not typically charge the full amount of the value they create. This is because:</p>



<p><strong>Willingness to Pay:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>People value things differently (e.g. due to brand loyalty, social impact, weather, etc.);</li>



<li>Competition from other companies might result in price competition. This might lead to consumers forming expectations about what they are willing to pay;</li>



<li>A great example is the $60 default price for AAA games that people expect. There’s no fundamental law of physics that says games should cost $60. But consumer expectations set a limit to what companies can charge.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Consumer Surplus:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Companies typically charge lower than the maximum possible Willingness to Pay that Consumers have;</li>



<li>Sharing some of the total value created with consumers encourages them to buy more because the customer is getting more value than what they paid for;</li>



<li>While consumer surplus is measured in monetary terms, it can capture intangible aspects such as the customer experience. It’s just a question of whether you paid the amount of money that the experience was worth.</li>
</ul>



<h3></h3>



<p>Enshittification is essentially the Darth Vader approach to pricing: <em>“I Am Altering the Deal, Pray I Don’t Alter It Any Further.”</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="I Am Altering The Deal" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsW9MlYu31g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you are unhappy with how much profit you are making as a company, you have three choices:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Expand:</strong> Sell to more people at the same profit margin;</li>



<li><strong>Improve:</strong> Make a better and more valuable product that consumer have a higher willingness to pay;</li>



<li><strong>Reallocate:</strong> Make a power grab and go take away consumer surplus.</li>
</ul>



<p>Option 3 is what the core idea behind what Cory Doctorow calls “ease of changing how a platform allocates value”.</p>



<p>An example of this is the attempt by Unity to change its pricing model to charge for installations. This is basically an unashamed power grab to steal consumer surplus leading to enshittification.</p>



<h2><span id="4b_enshittification_sometimes_isnt_deliberate">4b. Enshittification sometimes isn’t deliberate</span></h2>



<p>Okay so if we don’t want products and services to be enshittified, then companies should focus on Options 1 and 2.</p>



<p>In fact, Option 2 about improving the product sounds pretty good! Afterall, the company invests in the product and makes it better, increasing total value, and gets paid for doing it. Isn’t that a win-win approach?</p>



<p>No.</p>



<h3><span id="4bi_what_gets_measured_gets_managed">4bi. What gets measured gets managed</span></h3>



<p>Let’s say you’re a Product Manager at a tech company. You’re tasked with coming up with a new feature for a product and making people pay for it. Maybe you’re coming up with changes to the YouTube algorithm. How do you do this?</p>



<p>Well, first you need data. And then you measure changes in the data over time. And that creates performance metrics. And then you manage the performance metrics.</p>



<p>If the new feature you make means the metrics go up, then you’ve done a great job improving the product. And when it also helps the company make money, then you’ve achieved the win-win!</p>



<p>… right?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_OhNo-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_OhNo-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_OhNo-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_OhNo.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>But here’s the problem… What metrics are you actually measuring and managing?</p>



<p>In the tech world for example, companies track metric such as Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Average Users (MAU), number of times a link is clicked (click-through rate), usage time, etc.</p>



<p>But do you notice something?</p>



<ul>
<li>All of these metrics are used because they’re easy and convenient to measure;</li>



<li>None of these metrics directly actually measure if the product is delivering a good experience for the customer and therefore consumer surplus</li>



<li>These metrics can go up for reasons unrelated to delivering consumer surplus.</li>
</ul>



<p>So even if you are truly well-meaning, it’s possible to keep pushing for changes that look like product improvements but instead undermine your product and make it worse over time.</p>



<p>And when revenue is involved, there is the pressure to release changes not because it’s good for the customer. But it makes the revenue line go up and doesn’t appear to be harming consumer surplus…</p>



<p>So ship the change! And ship the next change! And ship the next change! And ship the…</p>



<p>And then one day you wake up and for some reason your product just seems… really terrible. And yet you can’t actually explain when you actually broke your product. The metrics didn’t show anything wrong!</p>



<p>But clearly this is a problem that big and intelligent companies should be able to solve. There’s no way <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/">a company like Google could ever break their core product with incredibly stupid decisions and measuring the wrong metrics</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="4bii_revenue_is_addicting_like_a_drug">4bii. Revenue is addicting like a drug</span></h3>



<p>Watching your revenue line go up is like a drug. It feels good, you constantly want another hit, and it becomes harder over time to achieve the same high you felt the first time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_FallenQiqi-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_FallenQiqi-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_FallenQiqi-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_FallenQiqi.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>This is a problem because once you turn on the revenue tap, it is extremely hard as a business to justify turning it back off. Scope creep and financial pressure will also keep pushing you to just do that little bit more. And you will naturally enshittify your product over time because erosion of consumer surplus in the name of revenue is a one-way road.</p>



<p>For gaming, a simple example to point to would be the trend of microtransactions within MMOs despite also having paid member subscriptions. Afterall, the players themselves claim they’re willing to pay for these features.</p>



<p>But once you can justify to yourself that players should pay for incredibly basic game functionality like name changing, well… the sky’s the limit isn’t it?</p>



<p>This is how you end up in a hellhole of game design such as MMOs with pay to skip or constantly pushing the cash shop in the face of players through the UI. Afterall, DAU didn’t go down… right?</p>



<p>An alternative non-gaming example would be Amazon. Once Amazon discovered the advertising drug, it was all downhill for the search function and the spam of sketchy third-party sellers.</p>



<p>If customers are buying more and clicking more, then surely the user experience must be getting better! It’s best not to ask too many deep questions about what’s really lurking behind those sweet sweet advertising dollars…</p>



<h2><span id="4c_how_does_mihoyo_avoid_enshittification">4c. How does Mihoyo avoid enshittification?</span></h2>



<p>Avoiding enshittification requires having a very clear design vision and strong company leadership that lets you say “No” to things.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_VoteNo-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_VoteNo-300x300.png 300w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_VoteNo-150x150.png 150w, https://moonbearmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sticker_Akira_VoteNo.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></figure>



<p>Because commonly used metrics cannot properly measure and monitor consumer surplus, you need to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create principles about what your product will and will not do;</li>



<li>And then avoid temptation to deviate from those principles;</li>



<li>Even if they would make you lots of money or some customers say they want it.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can see this reflected in Mihoyo’s behaviour as a company. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li>They are cautious to adopt radical changes to the product just because their customers ask for it and say No to a lot of things;</li>



<li>They try to minimize potential for player regret when making system-level changes;</li>



<li>They adamantly refuse to add complexity to the transaction and monetization systems within the game;</li>



<li>They try to understand whether players are satisfied by just directly asking the players through frequent in-game surveys rather than trying to guess based on wishy-washy alternative metrics.</li>
</ul>



<h2><span id="4d_what_does_this_have_to_do_with_skins">4d. What does this have to do with skins?</span></h2>



<p>Mihoyo seems incredibly resistant to using skins as a source of monetization in their most recent games Genshin and HSR. What might drive this?</p>



<p>Until they release an official statement, we can at least think about the design factors that would influence this decision.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Design Factor</strong></td><td><strong>Impact</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Consumer spending behaviours</em></td><td>Does player spending on skins actually result in net new revenue</td></tr><tr><td><em>Resource allocation</em></td><td>Skins require labour hours to produce. Mihoyo is already a world leader for speed of the content releases and their design ambition.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Character access: Skin target market</em></td><td>Genshin’s primary monetization is through restricting access to characters. This isn’t compatible with a skins based approach. <strong>Restricting character access deliberately shrinks your skin audience</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Character access: Free Income</em></td><td>Games with a heavier focus on skin monetization either have complete access to all characters (e.g. DotA), make it possible to grind out enough currency to unlock characters (e.g. LoL, Valorant), or have extremely generous free income (e.g. Azur Lane, GBF) precisely to solve the target market problem.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Social play</em></td><td>Skins are more common in games with cooperative / social play because the skins provide social utility</td></tr><tr><td><em>Client modification</em></td><td>You can mod your game files locally to just reskin entire characters or replace them with new models such as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kudaranai4/video/7371106355815517473">Chiori Ori</a> (KR Duck pun).</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>These factors imply that Mihoyo has a very clear design vision about what they want their product to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>core product is the open world and combat</strong>, and <strong>the vast majority of development resources go towards this</strong>;</li>



<li>Mihoyo has a <strong>single primary monetization vehicle</strong> (<em>Characters and Weapons / Light Cones</em>);</li>



<li>This single vehicle is sufficient for extracting money <strong>without requiring multiple channels to upsell players;</strong></li>



<li>Mihoyo is willing to say no to making more money if it means <strong>maintaining quality of everything else it produces</strong> (<em>e.g. not splitting development resources</em>)</li>
</ul>



<p>So this is how we end up where we are here today in Genshin. A low volume pipeline of skins that are only ever released when paired with events, and with nearly half of them given away for free anyway.</p>



<p>And Mihoyo is absolutely okay if you don’t agree with this approach.</p>



<p>This is a consequence of having a very clear design vision and strong company leadership that says “No” to things.</p>



<h2><span id="4e_the_skins_monetization_trap">4e. The skins monetization trap</span></h2>



<p>Skins and cosmetics also contain an insidious trap when it comes to monetization.</p>



<p>The traditional thinking behind skins and cosmetics is that they are an easy to develop form of monetization that can exist outside of the core gameplay loop. This is only true up to a limit.</p>



<p>Remember from Section 3 that game developers need to create reasons for people to pull for characters through game design. And in Section 3di I mentioned how players will eventually reach character saturation and no longer need to pull for as many characters on their account.</p>



<p>In many ways, the same is true for cosmetics. You might buy a skin for your favourite character or weapon. Maybe a second skin. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentieth?</p>



<p>Remember the original revenue equation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenue </strong>= <strong>Player Desire to Consume</strong> – <strong>Free Income</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Characters are at least tied to gameplay. Therefore gameplay content can influence character sales. Pure cosmetics on the other hand cannot use this lever without becoming “pay to win”. The levers for manipulating the player’s desire to consume are more limited.</p>



<p>Skins also need to be distinct to draw spending and create the desire to consume. This in turn places pressure on your design vision. You start with benign changes, maybe breaking the colour palette for a character. But eventually you need to explore more options and start breaking things such as the character silhouette and readability. You introduce fancy effects like new animations or particles.</p>



<p>These new features also set sticky consumer expectations. Players will expect your new features such as particle effects, higher quality meshes and textures, etc. as the new standard of quality. This means that your cosmetics over time can only ever be monotonically increasing in quality. This in turn also drives up the cost of cosmetic development and erodes profits.</p>

<p>Eventually, as a developer you run out of options to get people to buy cosmetics. At this point, the customer base starts to segment:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Collectors and whales:</strong> Much higher satiety limits (e.g. the player that buys every Lux skin no matter what) and willing to pay higher price points as well;</li>



<li><strong>Lower spenders: </strong>Players who are more sensitive to “value” and become satiated over time.</li>
</ul>



<p>A company therefore needs to both cultivate a population of collectors as well as offer them products to collect. And this is how you end up with League of Legends announcing a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d2luzd/the_signature_immortalized_legend_collection_is/">430 USD commemorative in-game skin</a>.</p>



<p>This also means that your product is now pivoting toward catering to an explicitly smaller and narrower audience. And this has consequences for your priorities when it comes to what you choose to prioritize in product and feature development.</p>



<p>This is the trap when it comes to cosmetic monetization: Player satiation shrinks your customer base the same way that character releases can as well. And without the core gameplay loop offering levers to drive demand, satiety is much harder to break.</p>







<p>So what are the key lessons we have learned during this journey together?</p>



<h2><span id="section_2_how_does_revenue_even_work_for_gacha_companies">Section 2. How does revenue even work for gacha companies?</span></h2>



<ol>
<li>Revenue for gacha games is determined by
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue </strong>= <strong>Player Desire to Consume</strong> (e.g. gacha / Resin refresh / BP / etc.) – <strong>Free Income</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Free income acts as a subsidy for players</strong> and should be <strong>calibrated based on expected player elasticity of demand</strong>;</li>
</ol>



<h2><span id="section_3_game_design_meets_monetization">Section 3. Game Design meets Monetization</span></h2>



<ol start="3">
<li>The key goal in monetization is for your game’s systems to <strong>create continuous and regular impulses to spend</strong>;</li>



<li>A healthy long-term monetization system should therefore have <strong>repeatable design levers</strong> that can be used to <strong>reliably generate demand</strong> <strong>without compromising the core gameplay experience</strong>;</li>



<li>RPG gacha games cannot rely on traditional design tools because <strong>the variation in power between players in a gacha game is too wide</strong>; </li>



<li>Game design must <strong>rely on imposing restrictions</strong> and these restrictions should synergize with the monetization approach of the game;</li>



<li>For character driven games, <strong>the rate of acceptable character releases is governed by how well your game supports excuses to pull for characters</strong>;</li>



<li><strong>Horniness is a unique factor to encourage player spending</strong> but can only be utilised by niche games at scale;</li>
</ol>



<h2><span id="section_4_enshittification_when_monetization_goes_wrong">Section 4. Enshittification: When monetization goes wrong</span></h2>



<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Enshittification occurs when companies try to claim too much value</strong> and don’t leave enough value for players;</li>



<li><strong>Enshittification can occur when companies track the wrong metrics</strong> and erode consumer surplus by not properly understanding what they are doing;</li>



<li><strong>Even well meaning monetization systems</strong> that players themselves ask for <strong>can lead to enshittification</strong> due to erosion of value;</li>
</ol>
