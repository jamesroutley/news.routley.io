However, once ART is stopped, detectable HIV re-emerges with new cells getting infected. This is called “rebound” virus, and the cells that release the virus to re-ignite the infection come from a small population of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells that had remained dormant in blood and lymph tissue while individuals were on ART.</p><p>It’s a problem called latency, and overcoming it remains a major goal for researchers trying to create curative therapies for HIV—the special focus of the UNC HIV Cure Center.</p><p>Now, scientists led by virologist <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/directory/swanstrom/">Ron Swanstrom,</a> director of the UNC Center for AIDS Research and the Charles P. Postelle, Jr. Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics at the UNC School of Medicine, describe another layer to the challenge of HIV latency and published their work in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01309-3">“Nature Microbiology.”</a></p><p>Swanstrom and colleagues, with collaborators at UCSF, Yale, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, and others, provide indirect evidence for the existence of a distinct latent reservoir of CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system. They accomplished this by analyzing rebound virus in the cerebral spinal fluid during the period when people had just stopped taking ART.</p><p>“Our analysis of rebound virus suggests latently infected T cells in the CNS are separate from the latent reservoir in the blood,” said Swanstrom, senior author of the study. “Our analysis allows us to infer the presence of a distinct pool of latently infected cells in the CNS waiting to reinitiate infection once ART is interrupted.”</p><p>The researchers compared the genetic sequences of rebound virus particles when ART was discontinued in 11 human participants. This approach allowed the scientists to assess the similarities between viral populations in the blood and CSF to determine whether they were part of a common latent reservoir. In many cases, the viral populations were not the same, which suggested they can represent different populations of latently infected cells.</p><p>The researchers also studied details of viral replication to determine if rebound virus had been selected for replication in CD4+ T cells – the primary home of the virus – or had evolved to replicate in central nervous system myeloid cells, such as macrophages and microglia. All rebound viruses tested were adapted to growth in T cells. For several participants, the researchers also compared viral populations in blood and CSF before ART initiation and after ART was stopped.</p><p>These experiments provide further evidence that HIV-infected CD4+ T cells can cross over from blood into the CNS, but also that some latently infected cells may be resident in the CNS during therapy. Any curative therapy would need to activate this dormant reservoir, as well as the latent reservoir in the blood and lymph tissue.</p></div></div></div></article></section><section><div><header><h2>You May Also Like...</h2></header><ul><li><div><ul id="swiper_news_1"><li><p><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/08/scientists-document-two-separate-reservoirs-of-latent-hiv-in-patients/" tabindex="-1"><img src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV.jpg" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV.jpg 1200w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-550x310.jpg 550w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-350x196.jpg 350w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-250x141.jpg 250w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero_HIV-200x112.jpg 200w" alt="Imaging of DNA sequences."/></a></p><div><header><h3><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/08/scientists-document-two-separate-reservoirs-of-latent-hiv-in-patients/">	Scientists document two separate reservoirs of latent HIV in patients</a></h3></header><p>This research, led by UNC School of Medicine scientists Laura Kincer, Sarah Joseph,and Ron Swanstrom with international collaborators, shows that in addition to HIV’s ability to lay dormant in the blood/lymphoid system, the virus may also lay dormant in the central nervous system, delineating another challenge in creating a cure.</p></div></li><li><p><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/06/unc-field-sites/" tabindex="-1"><img src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/460A9325_edited-web.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/460A9325_edited-web.jpg 1500w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/460A9325_edited-web-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/460A9325_edited-web-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/460A9325_edited-web-768x512.jpg 768w" alt="A student and professor wearing head lamps examine a mouse"/></a></p><div><header><h3><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/06/unc-field-sites/">	Tar Heels gain real-world experience at research field sites</a></h3></header><p>At the UNC Institute for the Environment&#39;s field sites, Tar Heels are examining real-world issues through coursework, field trips, group research projects and internships with local organizations to gain first-hand experience and serve our state.</p></div></li><li><p><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/03/a-message-from-the-chancellor-the-impact-of-our-graduate-students/" tabindex="-1"><img src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374.png" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374.png 1200w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-300x169.png 300w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-768x432.png 768w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-800x450.png 800w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-600x338.png 600w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-550x310.png 550w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-450x253.png 450w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-350x196.png 350w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-250x141.png 250w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/003322_campus_scenes374-200x112.png 200w" alt="The Old Well during winter with a dark sky."/></a></p><div><header><h3><a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/02/03/a-message-from-the-chancellor-the-impact-of-our-graduate-students/">	A message from the Chancellor: The impact of our graduate students</a></h3></header><p>Our role as a leading global public research university wouldn’t be possible without the graduate students who teach, serve in our communities, and create new knowledge through their original scholarship.</p></div></li></ul></div><ul aria-label="Carousel Buttons"><li></li><li></li></ul></li><li><ul aria-label="Carousel Buttons"><li></li><li></li></ul></li><li><ul aria-label="Carousel Buttons"><li></li><li></li></ul></li></ul></div></section></div></div>
