    <h1>US court upholds Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes&#39;s conviction</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>A US court upheld the conviction of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/theranos" data-link-name="in body link">Theranos</a> founder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-holmes" data-link-name="in body link">Elizabeth Holmes</a> for defrauding investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars while operating her failed blood-testing startup, once valued at $9bn, rejecting her multi-year appeal.

The two were tried separately and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-sentencing" data-link-name="in body link">sentenced in 2022</a> to 11 years and three months, and 12 years and 11 months, respectively.

Holmes claimed that the Edison could perform a wide swath of medical tests with a single drop of a patient’s blood, which would have represented a significant advance in biotechnology. Her invention never lived up to her promises.</p><p>In advance of the ruling on her appeal, Holmes appeared on the cover of <a href="https://people.com/elizabeth-holmes-breaks-her-silence-in-first-interview-from-prison-it-s-been-hell-and-torture-exclusive-8789737" data-link-name="in body link">People</a> magazine earlier this month for her first interview since being locked up. She described federal prison as “hell and torture” and said she was “not the same person I was back then”.</p><p>“The people I love the most have to walk away as I stand here, a prisoner, and my reality sinks in,” she said of her two young children and her husband.</p></div></div></div>
