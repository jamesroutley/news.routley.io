Like many amputees, Karin went on to develop phantom limb pain, which required her to take high doses of medication to manage. She also benefited little from conventional prosthetics, finding them too unwieldy to use for daily life.

It’s outfitted with state-of-art technology, including AI. And to further improve its functionality, her surgeons performed osseointegration during the attachment procedure, a process that directly fuses bone to the implant, ideally creating a stronger mechanical connection. They also implanted electrodes in her arm muscles and nerves, as well as rewired some of her nerves in the remaining part of the arm. The<!-- --> result is a robotic limb that’s directly connected to Karin’s neuromusculoskeletal system. </p><p>Much like a real flesh-and-blood hand, it’s controlled by Karin’s nervous system and provides sensory feedback. Her new hand can purportedly perform around 80% of the typical daily tasks that a regular limb would be able to do. And it’s substantially reduced her phantom limb pain and the need for medication. <!-- -->The team’s findings on Mia Hand’s initial success are<!-- --> <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adf7360&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adf7360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a></span> in <!-- -->the journal Science Robotics.</p><p>“Karin was the first person with below-elbow amputation who received this new concept of a highly integrated bionic hand that can be used independently and reliably in daily life,” said lead study author Max Ortiz-Catalan, head of neural prosthetics research at the Bionics Institute in Australia, in a <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1003939?&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1003939?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a></span> from the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, one of the many other universities involved in the project.</p><p>He added: ”The fact that she has been able to use her prosthesis comfortably and effectively in daily activities for years is a promising testament to the potential life-changing capabilities of this novel technology for individuals facing limb loss.”</p><p>Karin is one of three patients enrolled in the DeTOP project.
