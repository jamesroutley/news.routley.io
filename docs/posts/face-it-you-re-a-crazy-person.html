What about for scheduling shifts?</p></li><li><p>What do you do when your assistant manager calls you at 6am and says they can’t come into work because they have diarrhea?</p></li></ul><p><span>The point of the Coffee Beans Procedure is this: if you can’t answer those questions, if you don’t even find them </span><em>interesting</em><span>, then you should not open a coffee shop, because this is how you will spend your days as a cafe owner. You will not be sitting droopy-lidded in an easy chair, sipping a latte and greeting your regulars as you page through </span><em>Anna Karenina</em><span>. You will be running a small business that sells hot bean water.</span></p><p><span>The Coffee Beans Procedure is a way of doing what psychologists call </span><em><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=9df57019166c494657242f90a24bcd7165aeb061" rel="">unpacking</a></em><span>. Our imaginations are inherently limited; they can’t include all details at once. (Otherwise you run into </span><a href="https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Borges.pdf" rel="">Borges’ map problem</a><span>—if you want a map that contains all the details of the territory that it’s supposed to represent, then the map has to be the size of the territory itself.) Unpacking is a way of re-inflating all the little particulars that had to be flattened so your imagination could produce a quick preview of the future, like turning a napkin sketch into a blueprint.</span></p><p><span>When people have a hard time figuring out what to do with their lives, it’s often because they haven’t unpacked. For example, in grad school I worked with lots of undergrads who thought they wanted to be professors. Then I’d send ‘em to my advisor Dan, and he would unpack them in 10 seconds flat. “I do </span><em>this,</em><span>” he would say, miming typing on a keyboard, “And I do </span><em>this,</em><span>” he would add, gesturing to the student and himself. “I write research papers and I talk to students. Would you like to do those things?”</span></p><p><span>Most of those students would go, “Oh, no I would not like to do those things.” The actual content of a professor’s life had never occurred to them. If you could pop the tops of their skulls and see what they </span><em>thought </em><span>being a professor was like, you’d probably find some low-res cartoon version of themselves walking around campus in a tweed jacket going, “I’m a professor, that’s me! Professor here!” and everyone waving back to them going, “Hi professor!”</span></p><p>Or, even more likely, they weren’t picturing anything at all. They were just thinking the same thing over and over again: “Do I want to be a professor? Hmm, I’m not sure. Do I want to be a professor? Hmm, I’m not sure.”</p><p><span>Why is it so hard to unpack, even a little bit? Well, you know how when you move to a new place and all of your unpacked boxes confront you every time you come home? And you know how, if you just leave them there for a few weeks, the boxes stop being boxes and start being </span><em>furniture</em><span>, just part of the layout of your apartment, almost impossible to perceive? That’s what it’s like in the mind. The assumptions, the nuances, the background research all get taped up and tucked away. That’s a good thing—if you didn’t keep most of your thoughts packed, trying to answer a question like “Do I want to be a professor?” would be like dumping everything you own into a giant pile and then trying to find your one lucky sock.</span></p><p>When you fully unpack any job, you’ll discover something astounding: only a crazy person should do it.</p><ul><li><p>Do you want to be a surgeon? = Do you want to do the same procedure 15 times a week for the next 35 years?</p></li><li><p>Do you want to be an actor? = Do you want your career to depend on having the right cheekbones?</p></li><li><p>Do you want to be a wedding photographer? = Do you want to spend every Saturday night as the only sober person in a hotel ballroom?</p></li></ul><p><span>If you think no one would answer “yes” to those questions, you’ve missed the point: </span><em>almost </em><span>no one would answer “yes” to those questions, and those proud few are the ones who should be surgeons, actors, and wedding photographers.</span></p><p><span>High-status professions are the hardest ones to unpack because the upsides are obvious and appealing, while the downsides are often deliberately hidden and tolerable only to a tiny minority. For instance, shortly after college, I thought I would post a few funny videos on YouTube and, you know, become instantly famous</span><span>. I gave up basically right away. I didn’t have the madness necessary to post something every week, let alone every day, nor did it ever occur to me that I might have to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp5sSqyZ5Go" rel="">fill an entire house with slime</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhE6PYnRMc" rel="">drive a train into a giant pit</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM66GDRyIVY" rel="">buy prosthetic legs for 2,000 people</a><span>. If you read the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaG9xpu-WQKBPUi8yQ4HaDYQLUSa7Y3J/view" rel="">“leaked” production guide</a><span> written by Mr. Beast, the world’s most successful YouTuber, you’ll quickly discover how nutso he is:</span></p><blockquote><p>I’m willing to count to one hundred thousand, bury myself alive, or walk a marathon in the world’s largest pairs of shoes if I must. I just want to do what makes me happy and ultimately the viewers happy. This channel is my baby and I’ve given up my life for it. I’m so emotionally connected to it that it’s sad lol.</p></blockquote><p>(Those aren’t hypothetical examples, by the way; Mr. Beast really did all those things.)</p><p><span>Apparently </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/14/more-than-half-of-gen-z-want-to-be-influencers-but-its-constant.html" rel="">57%</a><span> of Gen Z would like to be social media stars, and that’s almost certainly because they haven’t unpacked what it would actually take to make it. How many of them have Mr. Beast-level insanity? How many are willing to become indentured servants to the algorithm, to organize their lives around feeding it whatever content it demands that day? One in a million?</span></p><p><span>Another example: lots of people would like to be novelists, but when you unpack what novelists actually do, you realize that basically </span><em>no one</em><span> should be a novelist. For instance, how did Tracy Wolff, author of the </span><em>Crave </em><span>“romantasy” series, become one of the most successful writers alive? Well, </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/did-a-best-selling-romantasy-novelist-steal-another-writers-story" rel="">this </a><em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/did-a-best-selling-romantasy-novelist-steal-another-writers-story" rel="">New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/did-a-best-selling-romantasy-novelist-steal-another-writers-story" rel=""> piece</a><span> casually mentions that Wolff wrote “more than sixty” books between 2007 and 2018. That’s 5.5 novels per year, every year, for 11 years, </span><em>before </em><span>she hit it big. And she’s still going! She has so many books now that </span><a href="https://tracywolffauthor.com/bookshelf/#guide" rel="">her website has a search bar</a><span>. Or you can browse through categories like “Contemporary Romance (Rock Stars/Bad Boys)”, “Contemporary Erotic Billionaire Romance”, “Contemporary Romance (Harlequin Desire)”, and “Contemporary New Adult Romance (Snowboarders!)”.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png" width="400" height="600" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:600,&#34;width&#34;:400,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:273801,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.experimental-history.com/i/166676460?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNvy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188d204c-6507-4bf2-ace7-1a8308c183a1_400x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption><span>You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. (</span><a href="https://tracywolffauthor.com/bookshelf/extreme-risk/" rel="">source</a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Wolff and Beast might seem extreme, but they’re only extreme in terms of output, not in terms of time on task. This is the obvious-but-overlooked insight that you find when you unpack: people spend </span><em>so </em><span>much time doing their jobs. Hours! Every day! It’s 2pm on a Tuesday and you’re doing your job, and now it’s 3:47pm and you’re </span><em>still </em><span>doing it. There’s no amount of willpower that can carry you through a lifetime of Tuesday afternoons. Whatever you’re supposed to be doing in those hours, you’d better </span><em>want </em><span>to do it.</span></p><p>For some reason, this never seems to occur to people. I was the tallest kid in my class growing up, and older men would often clap me on the back and say, “You’re gonna be a great basketball player one day!” When I’d balk, they’d be like, “Don’t you want to be on a team? Don’t you want represent your school? Don’t you want to wear a varsity jacket and go to regionals?” But those are the wrong questions. The right questions, the unpacked questions, are: “Do you want to spend three hours practicing basketball every day? Do you want to dribble and shoot over and over again? On Thursday nights, do you want to ride the bus and sit on the bench while your more talented friends compete, secretly hoping that Brent sprains his ankle so you could have a chance to play?” And honestly, no! I don’t! I’d rather be at home playing Runescape.</p><p><span>When you come down from the 30,000-foot view that your imagination offers you by default, when you lay out all the minutiae of a possible future, when you think of your life not as an impressionistic blur, but as a series of discrete Tuesday afternoons full of individual moments that you will live in chronological order and without exception, only then do you realize that most futures make sense exclusively for a very specific kind of person. Dare I say, a </span><em>crazy </em><span>person.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, I have good news: </span><em>you are a crazy person</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>I don’t mean you’re crazy in the sense that you have a mental illness, although maybe you do. I mean crazy in the sense that you are far outside the norm in at least one way, and </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/theres-a-place-for-everyone?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">perhaps in many ways</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Some of you guys wake up at 5am to make almond croissants, some of you watch golf on TV, and some of you are willing to drive an 80,000-pound semi truck full of fidget spinners across the country. There are people out there who </span><em>like </em><span>the sound of rubbing sheets of Styrofoam together, people who watch 94-part YouTube series about the Byzantine Empire, people who can spend an entire long-haul flight </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y83kj3wg2o" rel="">just staring straight ahead</a><span>. Do you not realize that, to me, and to almost everyone else, you are all completely nuts?</span></p><p><span>No, you probably don’t realize that, because none of us do. We </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022103185900204" rel="">tend to overestimate the prevalence of our preferences</a><span>, a phenomenon that psychologists call the “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect" rel="">false consensus effect</a><span>”</span><span>. This is probably because it’s </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1995-05338-001" rel="">really</a><span> </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.38?casa_token=9n7EGB9Cv2sAAAAA:iEc_DY--evTfisYPwag5k7-16CsDYNHy3sGQwSm0HGUOHM4XFTXVrXsM56rzWjfSVuDSazDhbIL4yQ" rel="">really</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/303855973?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true" rel="">hard</a><span> to take other people’s perspectives, so unless we run directly into disconfirming evidence, we assume that all of our mental settings are, in fact, the defaults. Our idiosyncrasies may never even occur to us. You can, for instance, spend your whole life seeing three moons in the sky, without realizing that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10g9cjg/comment/j53vcku/" rel="">everybody else sees only one</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>the first time i looked up into the night sky after i got glasses, [I] realized that you can, in fact, see the moon clearly. i assumed people who depicted it in art were taking creative license bc they knew it should look like that for some reason, and that the human eye was incapable of seeing the moon without also seeing two other, blurrier moons, sort of overlapping it</p></blockquote><p><span>In my experience, whenever you unpack somebody, you inevitably discover something extremely weird about them. Sometimes you don’t have to dig that far, like when your friend tells you that she likes “found” photographs—the abandoned snapshots that turn up at yard sales and charity shops—and then adds that </span><a href="https://dawnparsonage.substack.com/p/everything-is-fine-and-nothing-is" rel="">she has collected 20,000 of them</a><span>. But sometimes the craziness is buried deep, often because people don’t think it’s crazy at all, like when a friend I knew for years casually disclosed that she had dumped all of her previous boyfriends because they had been insufficiently “menacing”.</span></p><p><span>This is why people get so brain-constipated when they try to choose a career, and why they often pick the wrong one: they don’t understand the craziness that they have to offer, nor the craziness that will be demanded of them, and so they spend their lives jamming their square-peg selves into round-hole jobs. For example, when I was in academia, there was this bizarre contingent of administrators who found college students vaguely vexing and exasperating. When the sophomores would, say, make a snowman in the courtyard with bodacious boobs, these dour admins would shake their heads and be like, “College kids are a real pain in the ass, huh!” They didn’t seem to realize that their colleagues actually </span><em>liked </em><span>hanging out with 18-22 year-olds, and that the occasional busty snowman was actually what made the job interesting. I don’t think these curmudgeonly managers even thought such a preference was </span><em>possible</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another example: when I was a pimply-faced teenager, I went to this dermatologist who always seemed annoyed to see patients. Like, how dare we bother him by seeking the services that he provides? Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrPimplePopper" rel="">Dr. Pimple Popper</a><span>—a YouTube account that does exactly what it says on the tin—has nearly 9 million subscribers. Clearly, there are people out there who find acne fascinating, and dermatology is the one of the </span><a href="https://medschoolinsiders.com/medical-student/most-competitive-specialties/" rel="">most competitive medical specialties</a><span>, but apparently you can, through sheer force of will, lack of self-knowledge, and refusal to unpack the details, earn the right to do a job you hate for the rest of your life.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, when people match their crazy to the right outlet, they become terrifyingly powerful. A friend from college recently reminded me of this guy I’ll call Danny, who was crazy in a way that was particularly useful for politics, namely, he was incapable of feeling humiliated. When Danny got to campus freshman year, he announced his candidacy for student body president by printing out like a thousand copies of his CV—including his SAT score!—and plastering them all over campus. He was, of course, widely mocked. And then the next year, he won. It turns out that people vote for the name that they recognize, and it doesn’t really matter </span><em>why </em><span>they recognize it. By the time Danny ran for reelection and won in a landslide, he was no longer the goofy freshman who taped a picture of his own face to every lamp post. At that point, he was the </span><em>president</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Unpacking is easy and free, but almost no one ever does it because it feels weird and unnatural. It’s uncomfortable to confront your own </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/on-the-importance-of-staring-directly" rel="">illusion of explanatory depth</a><span>, to admit that you really have no idea what’s going on, and to keep asking stupid questions until that changes.</span></p><p><span>Making matters worse, people are happy to talk about themselves and their jobs, but they do it at this unhelpful, abstract level where they say things like, “oh, I’m the liaison between development and sales”. So when you’re unpacking someone’s job, you really gotta push: what did you do this morning? What will you do after talking to me? Is that what you usually do? If you’re sitting at your computer all day, what’s on your computer? What programs are you using? Wow, that sounds really boring, do you </span><em>like </em><span>doing that, or do you </span><em>endure </em><span>it?</span></p><p><span>You’ll discover all sorts of unexpected things when unpacking, like how firefighters </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/03/americas-firefighters-mostly-do-not-fight-fires" rel="">mostly don’t fight fires</a><span>, or how Twitch streamers don’t just “play video games”; they play video games for </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/24/17274636/ninja-fortnite-twitch-h3h3-podcast" rel="">12 hours a day</a></em><span>. But you’re not just unpacking the job; you’re also unpacking yourself. Do any aspects of this job resemble things you’ve done before, and did you like doing those things? Not “Did you like being </span><em>known </em><span>as</span><em> </em><span>a person who does those things?” or “Do you like </span><em>having done </em><span>those things?” but when you were actually doing them, did you want to stop, or did you want to continue? These questions sound so stupid that it’s no wonder no one asks them, and yet, somehow, the answers often surprise us.</span></p><p><span>That’s certainly true for me, anyway. I never unpacked any job I ever had before I had it. I would just show up on the first day and discover what I had gotten myself into, as if the content of a job was simply unknowable before I started doing it, a sort of “</span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pelosi-healthcare-pass-the-bill-to-see-what-is-in-it/" rel="">we have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it</a><span>” kind of situation. That’s how I spent the summer of 2014 as a counselor at a camp for 17-year-olds, even though I could have easily known that job would require activities that I hated, like being around 17-year-olds. Could I have known specifically that my job would include such tasks as “escorting kids across campus because otherwise they’ll flee into the woods” or “trying to figure out whether anyone brought booze to the dance by surreptitiously sniffing kids’ breath?” No. But had I unpacked even a little bit, I would have picked a different way to spend my summer, like selling booze to kids outside the dance.</span></p><p><span>It’s no wonder that everyone struggles to figure what to do with their lives: we have not developed the cultural technology to deal with this problem because we never had to. We didn’t exactly evolve in an ancestral environment with a lot of career opportunities. And then, once we invented agriculture, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture" rel="">almost everyone</a><span> was a farmer the next 10,000 years. “What should I do with my life?” is really a post-1850 problem, which means, in the big scheme of things, we haven’t had any time to work on it.</span></p><p><span>The beginning of that work is, I believe, unpacking. As you slice open the boxes and dump out the components of your possible futures, I hope you find the job that’s crazy in the same way that </span><em>you</em><span> are crazy. And then I hope you go for it! Shoot for the stars! Even if you miss, you’ll still land on one of the three moons.</span></p></div></div></div>
