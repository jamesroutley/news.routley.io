I&#39;m attending the Fall 2 batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=4b09801ab494151291278015fdbdd197">Recurse Center</a>! Posts in this series cover things I&#39;m working on or find interesting during my time here. This is the first post in this series.
</p>
<p>Recurse has been something I‚Äôve been wanting to do for a number of years now and I‚Äôm really glad to finally have an opportunity to attend. One of my goals at Recurse is to spend time exploring topics in CS that I haven‚Äôt had the chance to check out. Right now, I‚Äôm curious about computer networks and Rust, amongst (too many) other things and a concrete goal I‚Äôve set for myself while here is to explore TCP through Rust by implementing my own TCP/IP stack. I‚Äôm also hoping to get into Haskell type classes and monads in later half of the batch if I‚Äôve the time.</p>
<h2>First week of school</h2>
<p>So far the experience has been exciting and a little overwhelming, like how one might feel during their first week of school. It‚Äôs only the first week but it‚Äôs been really cool meeting like-minded people working on projects both familiar and foreign. And also learning from other Recursers about known unknowns (like how a neural net works), and unknown unknowns (like how there‚Äôs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus%27_flower_basket">deep sea sponge</a> that makes fibre optics better than any present man-made process (truth being stranger than fiction üëÄ)). The community has been open and generous.</p>
<h2>What I ended up doing this week</h2>
<p>I didn‚Äôt quite have a set list of goals for this week except to just settle in and see how things go along the way. Mainly, apart from attending the welcome talks and orientation workshop, I tried to give myself daily goals for my project to make sure that I stay focused and at least spend some time each day moving the project forward. A random set of things that I ended up doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attended the AI Safety study group session.</li>
<li>Refreshed my memory on what packets are involved in a TCP connection, from initiation to closing, and how TCP and IP relate to each other.</li>
<li>Found out about the Zig programming language while talking to another Recurser working on <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> (which seems to be really popular around here).</li>
<li>Got stuck on my program not being able to receive packets when using <a href="https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet"><code>libpnet</code></a> to open raw sockets.</li>
<li>Figured out how to use a series of networking tools and tricks as I tried to manually create and send my own TCP SYN packet: how to capture and filter packets using <code>tcpdump</code>, how to view and analyse said packets using Wireshark, making quick test connections using <code>netcat</code>, how to find all open ports on localhost using <code>netstat</code>.</li>
<li>Still WIP, but learnt about TUN/TAP and Unix network sockets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plans for next week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better understand how Unix network sockets work and how to use them, enough for me to at least start sending my own packets through raw sockets and get unstuck.</li>
<li>Read up more about TUN/TAP and figure out how I might need to use them for my project (do I need to if I‚Äôm just sending packets locally?).</li>
<li>Have my Rust program be able to open a TCP connection with a simple server and send packets to the server, at least over localhost first.</li>
<li>Go through Week 0 of this AI Safety Fundamentals‚Äô <a href="https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment">AI alignment course</a>.</li>
<li>Pair with at least one other person on something related to Rust.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs it! Hopefully more progress on my project next week.</p></section><hr/><div><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=""><p><img aria-hidden="true" data-placeholder-image="" decoding="async" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,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" alt=""/></p><picture><source type="image/webp" data-srcset="/static/ff7ac4e749b0b2b9c3a4ee4a4ef14508/541c0/profile-pic.webp 64w,/static/ff7ac4e749b0b2b9c3a4ee4a4ef14508/57ec1/profile-pic.webp 128w" sizes="64px"/><img data-gatsby-image-ssr="" layout="fixed" data-main-image="" sizes="64px" decoding="async" loading="lazy" data-src="/static/ff7ac4e749b0b2b9c3a4ee4a4ef14508/df4a6/profile-pic.jpg" data-srcset="/static/ff7ac4e749b0b2b9c3a4ee4a4ef14508/df4a6/profile-pic.jpg 64w,/static/ff7ac4e749b0b2b9c3a4ee4a4ef14508/c7570/profile-pic.jpg 128w" alt="Stacey Tay"/></picture></div><p>Hi!
