      <span>Abstract:</span>  We present a formal model of Checked C, a dialect of C that aims to enforce
spatial memory safety. Our model pays particular attention to the semantics of
dynamically sized, potentially null-terminated arrays. We formalize this model
in Coq, and prove that any spatial memory safety errors can be blamed on
portions of the program labeled unchecked; this is a Checked C feature that
supports incremental porting and backward compatibility. While our model&#39;s
operational semantics uses annotated (&#34;fat&#34;) pointers to enforce spatial
safety, we show that such annotations can be safely erased: Using PLT Redex we
formalize an executable version of our model and a compilation procedure from
it to an untyped C-like language, and use randomized testing to validate that
generated code faithfully simulates the original. Finally, we develop a custom
random generator for well-typed and almost-well-typed terms in our Redex model,
and use it to search for inconsistencies between our model and the Clang
Checked C implementation. We find these steps to be a useful way to co-develop
a language (Checked C is still in development) and a core model of it.
