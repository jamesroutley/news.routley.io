<p>What keeps a mouse contained in a box?</p>
<p>It is the way a box prevents motion in all directions. Each board bars escape in a certain direction. The left side keeps the mouse from going left, the right from going right, the top keeps it from leaping out, and so on.</p>
<p>The secret of a box is simply in how the boards are arranged to prevent motion in <em>all</em> directions. That’s what <em>containing</em> means.</p>
<p>It’s silly to expect any separate board by itself to contain any <em>containment</em>, even though each contributes to the containing. It is like the cards of a straight flush in poker; only the full hand has any value at all.</p>
<p>The same applies to words like <em>life</em> and <em>mind</em>. It is foolish to use these words for describing the smallest components of living things because these words were invented to describe how larger assemblies interact. Like <em>boxing-in</em>, words like <em>living</em> and <em>thinking</em> are useful for describing phenomena that result from certain combinations of relationships.</p>
<p>None of the 15 FAIR principles<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <em>contain</em> FAIR. A digital resource will not become “more FAIR” when it adheres to one rather than none of the principles.</p>
<p>However, just like <em>life</em> has gradually lost much of its mystery – at least for modern biologists, because they understand so many of the important interactions among the chemicals in cells – FAIR can be demystified by understanding how the components of a well-made FAIR resource interact to facilitate reuse and repurposing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
