          <p>A hackable, programmable badge with E Ink¬Æ display, powered by Raspberry Pi RP2040.</p>
<p>In honour of Raspberry Pi&#39;s 10th birthday, we&#39;ve fused a RP2040 microcontroller with an EPD display to make a <strong>stylishly monochrome, maker friendly, e-paper badge(r)</strong> to attach to your person, your office door or to prop up on your desk. With the support of the fun guys (and gals and non-binary pals) at Ineltek and Raspberry Pi we&#39;ve been able to keep this first run as low cost as possible, hoorah!</p>
<p>We&#39;ve equipped Badger 2040 with plenty of <strong>buttons</strong> so you can easily change what&#39;s displayed on the screen, a slot so you can clip it onto a lanyard and a <strong>battery connector</strong> so you can keep things portable and refresh the screen whilst on the go. On the back, you&#39;ll find some funky badgerpunk stylings plus our RP2040 accoutrements of choice: boot and reset buttons and a Qw/ST connector so it&#39;s super easy to plug in <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/qwiic" target="_blank">Qwiic</a> or <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/stemma-qt" target="_blank">STEMMA QT</a> breakouts</p>
<p>Here are some things you could do with it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch between images, pronouns or secret identities at the push of a button</li>
<li>Make yourself into a mobile weather station or air quality monitor (by adding a sensor breakout)</li>
<li>Store important QR codes for getting into places (or to Rickroll people)</li>
<li>Make a tiny to-do list and tick stuff off</li>
<li>Display inspirational badger quotes or educational badger facts of the day</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to show your Badger the world? We&#39;ve put together a convenient <strong>Badger + Accessory Kit</strong> which contains batteries, a lanyard and everything else that&#39;s needed to get portabello.</p>

<h2>RP2040 x e Ink¬Æ</h2>
<p>We&#39;re <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/?q=inky" target="_blank">big fans of electronic paper</a> at Pirate HQ - it makes for a lovely, crisp, high contrast display that&#39;s readable even in bright sunlight and it doesn&#39;t squirt unnecessary blue light into your environs like LCDs do. It&#39;s also ultra low power (EPD displays only consume power while they&#39;re refreshing), and the images on the display stick around for a really long time whilst the display is unpowered.</p>
<p>Using a RP2040 chip means we can drive the hardware in fun, experimental, low level ways. We&#39;ve written custom drivers for the EPD display that prioritise low power consumption whilst enabling lightning fast refresh rates.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>2.9&#34; black and white E Ink¬Æ display (296 x 128 pixels)</li>
<ul>
<li>Ultra wide viewing angles</li>
<li>Ultra low power consumption</li>
<li>Dot pitch - 0.227 x 0.226 mm</li>
</ul>
<li>Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM)</li>
<li>2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP</li>
<li>Five front user buttons</li>
<li>Reset and boot buttons (the boot button can also be used as a user button)</li>
<li>White LED</li>
<li>USB-C connector for power and programming</li>
<li>JST-PH connector for attaching a battery (input range 2.7V - 6V)</li>
<li>High-precision voltage reference for battery level monitoring</li>
<li>Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector</li>
<li>Fully-assembled (no soldering required)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Badger + Accessory Kit includes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Badger 2040</li>
<li>2 x AAA battery holder</li>
<li>2 x AAA batteries</li>
<li>Velcro square*</li>
<li>Black lanyard (made from recycled plastic bottles!)</li>
<li>USB-C to USB-A cable (1m)</li>
</ul>
<p>* Once you&#39;ve stuck the Velcro onto the battery pack/board,¬†wait for 10 mins to let the glue set. You can either¬†stick the whole square in the middle of the battery pack or cut it in half and put one at each end.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Because it&#39;s a RP2040 board, Badger 2040 is firmware agnostic! You can program it with C/C++, MicroPython or CircuitPython.</p>
<p>Our <strong>C++/MicroPython</strong> libraries contain some nifty software tweaks to let you get the most out of your Badger. You&#39;ll get best performance using C++, but if you&#39;re a beginner we&#39;d recommend using our batteries included MicroPython build for ease of getting started.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>You can also use <strong>CircuitPython</strong> on your Badger 2040. CircuitPython drivers are designed to work on a bunch of different microcontrollers so you won&#39;t get the fancy RP2040-architecture specific tweaks that you&#39;ll find in our library, but you will get access to all the nice conveniences of Adafruit&#39;s ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Connecting Breakouts</h2>
<p>If your breakout has a QW/ST connector on board, you can plug it straight in with a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jst-sh-cable-qwiic-stemma-qt-compatible" target="_blank">JST-SH to JST-SH cable</a>, or you can easily connect any of our I2C Breakout Garden breakouts with a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jst-sh-cable-qwiic-stemma-qt-compatible" target="_blank">JST-SH to JST-SH cable</a> coupled with a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/stemma-qt-qwiic-to-breakout-garden-adapter" target="_blank">Qw/ST to Breakout Garden adaptor</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Measurements: 85.6mm x 48.7mm x 10mm (L x W x H, including connectors). The mounting holes are M2 and 2.9mm in from each edge. The corner radius is 3mm.</li>
<li>Badger 2040 is fairly accommodating about input voltage (2.7V - 6V), so it&#39;s possible to use a variety of different batteries and battery packs. Our recommendation is that you use a <strong>2x AAA battery pack</strong> as they fit behind Badger nicely (double/triple AA and AAA battery packs will also work though).</li>
<li>2x AAA<strong> rechargeable (NiMH) batteries</strong> only puts out 2.4V which is, strictly speaking, not enough for Badger. However, in our tests it keeps on truckin&#39; down to an input voltage of 2.05V (without the LED), so if you want to use rechargeable batteries that should be fine.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can plug a <strong>LiPo/LiIon battery</strong> into the battery connector, with the following caveats. Please only consider this if the person wearing the badge is an adult and knows what they&#39;re doing with LiPos!</li>
<ul>
<li>A solid enclosure or backplate to protect the battery from damage whilst being worn is a very good idea.</li>
<li>There&#39;s no battery protection included on Badger 2040, so you should only use it with LiPo batteries that include internal protection (<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-battery-pack" target="_blank">all ours do</a>).</li>
<li>Unlike some of our other boards, Badger 2040 doesn&#39;t have battery charging circuitry onboard. You&#39;ll need an external LiPo charger to charge the battery (like a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/?q=powerboost" target="_blank">PowerBoost</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>Never set your password as &#34;mushroom&#34;. It is not stroganoff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About RP2040</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi&#39;s RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.</p>
<p>One very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.</p>
