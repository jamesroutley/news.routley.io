    <h1>Lace: A New Kind of Cellular Automata Where Links Matter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>This article is about a new kind of simple computational rule (“LACE rules” running on LACE, the Link Automata Computing Engine platform) which, when applied locally on a grid of cells, demonstrates fascinating emergent “artificial life” behavior. </p>



<h2>Preamble</h2>



<p>I have been thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">cellular automata</a> ever since I read a fascinating and important book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Scientists-Their-Gods-Information/dp/0060972572" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Three Scientists and Their Gods</a>, during the summer of my sophomore year of college. This book changed my life. </p>



<p>And so I decided I had to find a way to get into Ed Fredkin’s lab at MIT. This became my mission in life</p>



<p>Finally, after many attempts, I did managed to finagle a summer internship in his lab at MIT, thanks to the kindness of Professors <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/nhm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Norman Margolus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Toffoli" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Tommaso Toffolli</a>, two of the great minds in the field. They had authored an MIT Press book that I had found and read countless times, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262200608/cellular-automata-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Cellular Automata Machines</a>, which at the time was the bible in the field.</p>



<p>In their lab they had built a specialized supercomputer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">CAM-6</a>, for digital physics simulations. I spent every minute of that summer in their lab on CAM-6, exploring the computational universe. </p>



<p>I needed a new kind of model, one where the shape of space could evolve, one where the shape of space could affect matter, and where matter could affect the shape of space, because after all, according to Einstein, they are really the same thing.</p>



<p>And from this insight I then undertook decades of exploration into the idea of a new kind of cellular automata — one in which the cells had links to each other, which could also figure into their states. Both the cell states and link states could interact, forming complex topologies and geometries. </p>



<h2>Introducing LACE: The Link Automata Computing Engine</h2>



<p>LACE is a new experimental platform written in python, for exploring a class of cellular automata in which both the states of cells and their connections (links) to each other are subject to the rules.</p>



<p>This enables rules in which virtual neighborhood topology (the links) affects neighborhood states — rules in which topology can both evolve and shape the behavior of the system, and in which the behavior of the system can shape topology.</p>



<p>LACE rules range from link-aware variants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Conway’s famous Game of Life</a>, but where edges have varying degrees of influence, to completely new kinds of “Realm of LACE” rules that use topological metrics in their computations. In theory, these rules could even be utilized to simulate neural networks.</p>



<p>What is fascinating about these new link-aware “Realm of LACE rules” is that they exhibit amazing new forms of stability and periodic structure. They produce new kinds of periodic gliders, oscillators, puffers, and other kinds of phenomena. Some of them even have behaviors that resemble forms of “artificial life.”</p>



<h2>The Code</h2>



<p><strong>You can read more about LACE </strong><a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>You can get the LACE python code repo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/tree/master/LACE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>



<h2>The Gallery</h2>



<p><em><strong>(NOTE – click on the videos and use the settings icon to set quality to 1080p for best visuals)</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>First, let’s take a look at Conway’s Game of Life, but with links visible.</strong> This demonstration simply shows the links and their states, but in this example, the links do not affect the states of cells. This shows that LACE can run traditional 2D cellular automata rules, with the links visible, but without the links changing rule behavior.</p>

<p>And here are some Life gliders, doing their thing, with links visible…</p>

<p>And here is a stable pattern in Life… with links….</p>

<p>Now, here is a version of Life, where edges influence rule behavior…</p>

<p>Here’s a variant of Life where edges play even more of a role. </p>

<p>Above, we looked at some traditional Life rule cellular automata. These examples illustrated varying levels of link-awareness in rules. But they are still not showing the full capabilities of the LACE platform.</p>



<h2>The Realm of LACE: LACE Rules </h2>



<p><strong>Now, take a look at the “Amazing Dragons” rule in the Realm of LACE (ROL), one of the more interesting rules in this universe. </strong></p>



<p><strong>This is not a life rule – it’s a LACE rule – a fully topological rule. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Here links and neighborhood topology play a major role in the behavior of cell states and cell states modify the states of links as well.</strong></p>



<p><strong>…and look what happens!</strong></p>

<p>LACE also supports an optional high-performance, GPU-accelerated mode using Taichi, for large-scale simulations…</p>

<p>And here’s another interesting LACE rule…</p>
