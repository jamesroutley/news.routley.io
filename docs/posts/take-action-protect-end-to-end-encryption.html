    <h1>Take action, Protect end-to-end encryption</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>In our <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/we-have-nothing-to-hide-only-everything-to-protect">introduction</a> to this series of articles on privacy, we
highlighted how, although we may have nothing to hide, we do have
everything to protect. We asked you to help strengthen end-to-end
encryption by using it, and we listed various free software tools that
you can use and share. This article is the second part of this series,
and it targets the question of how to counter the dangers resulting
from the ongoing, worldwide legislation that threatens end-to-end
encryption, and privacy in general. The list is long: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/10/eu-lawmakers-must-reject-proposal-scan-private-chats">Chat
control</a> in the EU, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/eff-letter-congress-oppose-earn-it-act-and-stop-csam-act"><em>EARN IT Act</em></a> in the US, and the
so-called &#34;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/wrong_time_to_weaken_encryption/"><em>Online Safety Bill</em></a>&#34; in the UK all require a backdoor
that would allow companies and governments to monitor end-to-end
encrypted communication. The <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2023/04/stop-csam-act-anti-encryption-stalking-horse"><em>STOP CSAM Act</em></a>, introduced in the
US Congress in April, tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers
liable for the hosting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and opens
the door for civil lawsuits against platforms for facilitating the
distribution of CSAM if they refuse to give law enforcement the keys
to decrypt user communications.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/appeal2023/spring/encryption.png" width="40%"/></p>

<p>Meanwhile, India&#39;s new cybersecurity order <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/india-requires-internet-services-collect-and-store-vast-amount-customer-data"><em>CERT-In</em></a> is driving
VPN services and other privacy-concerned internet service providers
out of the country because it requires the providers to keep logs of
users. In Australia, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-tangle-of-electronic-surveillance-laws-needs-unravelling/"><em>Telecommunications and Other Legislation
Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act</em> (TOLA)</a> from 2018 already
allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to request or demand
assistance from communications providers to access encrypted
communications. The fact that the <em>TOLA Act</em> provides the legal
standing to decrypt messages led to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-encryption-laws-used-by-afp-in-countrys-most-significant-operation-in-policing-history/">collaboration between the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police</a>
and thereby granted the FBI power it has long desired to have in its
domestic territory. In 2021, the <a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/surveillance-legislation-amendment-identify-and-disrupt-act-2021"><em>Surveillance Legislation Amendment
(Identify and Disrupt) Act</em></a> added even broader powers to this
which allow the Australian Federal Police to <a href="https://theconversation.com/facebook-or-twitter-posts-can-now-be-quietly-modified-by-the-government-under-new-surveillance-laws-167263">modify data</a> on
accounts or devices of suspects, no matter if they are encrypted or
not. But departmental representatives still <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/home-affairs-says-end-to-end-encryption-is-detrimental-to-public-safety-575431">claim</a> end-to-end
encryption is detrimental to public safety. The example of Australia
shows that giving way to the claims of those who prioritize illusory
safety over privacy is no option. They won&#39;t stop after passing one
bill. On the contrary, they will demand you to surrender your
fundamental right to privacy bit by bit, more and more.</p>
<h2>Take action</h2>
<p>It is important to let the representatives of your government know
that end-to-end encryption is vital even if there is no ongoing
legislation threatening end-to-end encryption in your area or even if
your country has already passed a bill that weakens it. Write a letter
to the appropriate agencies to let them know that you value your
privacy and the privacy of the people around you, and remind them of
their duty to protect it. Below are sample letters that you can adapt to 
your needs.<br/>
</p>
<p>Post your letter on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/share">social media</a> to inspire others to do the
same. Others might especially benefit from letters that are adapted to
the specific legislation of your country and/or translated into your
mother tongue. If you email such letters to <a href="mailto:campaigns@fsf.org">campaigns@fsf.org</a>, we may
attach them to the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/take-action-protect-end-to-end-encryption">blog article</a> as a template for others citing your
name, if you give us permission to do that.</p>
<h4>Sample letter to members of the European Parliament</h4>
<p>Chat control <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:209:FIN">(2022/0155(COD))</a> just passed the council of the
European Union and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/HIS/?uri=COM:2022:209:FIN">will soon be read in the European Parliament</a>.
Essentially, this proposal aims to introduce an &#34;obligation for
providers to detect, report, block and remove child sexual abuse
material from their services.&#34; The problem is that this would make
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">chat control mandatory for all messenger and e-mail providers
including end-to-end encrypted services</a>. Now is the perfect time
to appeal to members of the European Parliament to amend the proposed
regulations. Here is a sample letter that you can adapt to your needs:</p>
<blockquote> 
Dear [Name of Member of the European Parliament],
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

Thank you for all the work you do representing people like myself in
the European Parliament. Today, I am appealing to you to uphold the
right to privacy and to safeguard end-to-end encryption. Only with
encryption can we guarantee rights as fundamental as privacy, freedom
of the press, and freedom of opinion and expression. Free societies
like the countries of the European Union need end-to-end encryption!

At their current state, the proposed regulations to prevent and combat
child sexual abuse in the European Union (2022/0155(COD)) would force
encrypted services to insert a backdoor in their services because
there is no other technical solution to comply with the detection
obligations that the proposal would impose on providers of encrypted
services. Inserting a backdoor would destroy end-to-end encryption!
The text of the regulations even recognizes this risk when it warns:
&#34;When executing the detection order, providers should take all
available safeguard measures to ensure that the technologies employed
by them cannot be used by them or their employees for purposes other
than compliance with this Regulation, nor by third parties, and thus
to avoid undermining the security and confidentiality of the
communications of users.&#34; This is not possible. Once a backdoor is
installed, it will be abused by criminals and state actors. And this
means the encryption can no longer protect the users&#39; privacy. As
Matthias Pfau, entrepreneur and privacy advocate, rightfully said:
&#34;Encryption is either securing everyone or it is broken for everyone.&#34;

In addition, backdoors do nothing to serve the stated goal of
preventing and combating child sexual abuse. One reason is because
criminals are simply able to use cryptographic tools that don&#39;t comply 
with the law

Please urge the European Commission to either drop the European Union
(2022/0155(COD)) or radically amend the proposed regulations to keep
unmediated end-to-end encryption legal. Please also prevent any future
law that try to insert a backdoor in end-to-end encryption.

<h4>Sample letter for the United Kingdom</h4>
<p>The so-called <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137">&#34;Online Safety Bill&#34;</a> threatens to destroy
end-to-end encryption. Sections 8, 9, and 16 of the Bill would mandate
providers of user-to-user services that have links with the United
Kingdom to detect, report, and assess the risk of illegal text,
images, or videos on their platforms.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directory-of-uk-safety-tech-providers">homepage</a>, the government lists software and platforms
that are supposed to help providers of user-to-user services to
&#34;identify and remove known illegal content [...] which features child
sexual exploitation or terrorist activity&#34; and to &#34;detect potentially
harmful content.&#34; Most of this software is proprietary and a serious
concern to privacy. This shows how the government intends to implement
the &#34;Online Safety Bill&#34; if it passes: Proprietary software or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html">SaaSS</a> providers scan chats and thereby eventually <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1049811/DCMS_Directory_of_Safety_Tech_Providers_v8__3_.pdf">&#34;detects,
categorizes and evaluates child abuse content with no human
interaction.&#34;</a> Because it&#39;s proprietary software, the user has no
control over the process and can&#39;t look into the workings of the
algorithm. This makes it effectively impossible to detect false
flagging, not to mention the privacy implications of feeding all
communication of a platform to a centralized instance.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the duties set out in the &#34;Online Safety
Bill,&#34; providers of encrypted services would have to insert a backdoor
in their services. But installing a backdoor would abolish the
benefits of end-to-end encryption and dismantle digital privacy.</p>
<p>The &#34;Online Safety Bill&#34; started in the House of Commons and is now in
the House of Lords. This is your chance to contact members of the
House of Lords and let them know that you value end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Here is a sample letter that you can adapt to your needs: </p>
<blockquote> 
Dear [Title of a member of the House of Lords],

The Online Safety Bill threatens to destroy end-to-end encryption. In

set out in section 8, the duties about illegal content set out in
section 9, and the duty about content reporting set out in section 16,

<h4>Sample letter for the United States</h4>
<p>This April, Senator Lindsey Graham re-introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2732?q"><em>EARN IT
Act</em></a> for the third time, after the bill had been successfully
defeated twice in 2020 and 2022. The bill is now with the House and
the Senate for consideration. Fight for the Future sponsored a
petition which can unfortunately only be signed using nonfree
JavaScript. But you can write your senators urging them to reject the
<em>EARN IT</em> Act.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1199"><em>STOP CSAM Act</em></a>, introduced in the Congress in
April, tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers liable for the
distribution of child sexual abuse material although it is not clear
how providers should detect child exploitation conduct in encrypted
text.</p>
<p>There was also the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4051"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> that
aimed at requiring &#34;certain technology companies to ensure that they
can decode encrypted information on their services and products in
order to provide such information to law enforcement.&#34; Luckily, this
bill died 2021 in Congress but it could be re-introduced or included
in another bill any time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/kids-online-safety-act-still-huge-danger-our-rights-online">there is reason to fear</a> that the <a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/D89FC49B-0714-4124-B8B1-4F35A85F5E02"><em>Kids Online
Safety Act</em></a>, which was reintroduced in the US Congress at the
beginning of May, will prompt platforms to require all users to upload
identity verification documentation or biometric information to
validate their age because the bill lacks guidance on how else
platforms shall predict if the videos, pictures, or text on the
platform might have a negative impact on minors. This is not related
to encryption, but it is definitely a bill we should watch, as it
would impact our privacy if it passes.</p>
<p>Let the representatives of your government know that end-to-end
encryption and privacy are vital. Here is a sample letter that you can
adapt to your needs:</p>
<blockquote> 
Dear Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nadler, and members of the Committee,
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

Thank you for all the work you do as senators. Today, I am appealing to
you to uphold the right to privacy and to safeguard end-to-end
encryption. Only with encryption can we guarantee fundamental rights
as privacy, freedom of the press, and freedom of opinion and
expression. End-to-end encryption is vital for a free society like the
US.

I am deeply concerned about the re-introduced *EARN IT Act* and the
*STOP CSAM Act*. Section 5(7)(A) and (B) of the *EARN IT Act*
encourage courts to deem providers of encryption services guilty of
acting recklessly or negligently and not preventing CSAM crimes only
because they offer end-to-end encrypted services. Similarly, the *STOP
CSAM Act* tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers liable for the
distribution of child sexual abuse material. In order to prevent this
accusation, providers would have to insert a backdoor in their
encryption service to screen messages en masse. Once a backdoor is
installed however, it *will* be abused by criminals and state actors,
and the encryption will no longer protect user privacy. As Matthias
Pfau, entrepreneur and privacy advocate, rightfully said: &#34;Encryption
is either securing everyone or it is broken for everyone.&#34;

Neither the *EARN IT Act* nor the *STOP CSAM Act* will serve the goal
to prevent and combat child sexual abuse because criminals are simply 
able to use cryptographic tools that don&#39;t comply with the law

I urge you to oppose both the *EARN IT Act* and the *STOP CSAM Act*
and to prevent any law that will try to insert a backdoor in
end-to-end encryption.
