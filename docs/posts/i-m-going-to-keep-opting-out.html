    <h1>I&#39;m going to keep opting out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Marketing, solicitations, advertising, political contact, direct mailers, email campaigns, cookies, ads — it&#39;s all opt out. It puts the burden on you to opt out of each communication each message, each outreach from a loyalty program. It can feel like weeding a garden, but that garden is your attention. The weeds keep returning, insisting upon their removal. One after another.</p><div><p>Marketing, solicitations, advertising, political contact, direct mailers, email campaigns, cookies, ads — it&#39;s all opt out. It puts the burden on you to opt out of each communication each message, each outreach from a loyalty program. It can feel like weeding a garden, but that garden is your attention. The weeds keep returning, insisting upon their removal. One after another.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be sent weekly emails because I bought something from you <em>once</em>. I may have installed your app, but I don&#39;t want to navigate multiple screens, provide you with my email (which you&#39;ve already abused) and deal with myriad toggles to get you to leave me alone.</p><p>Yes, I&#39;m a registered voter, yes I know when to vote, yes I&#39;m going to — leave me alone. Each contact is another number blocked. If you&#39;re going to call me and you can&#39;t leave me a voicemail (because, really — who&#39;s going to answer an unknown number?) that&#39;s another number to block. I&#39;ve got a no soliciting sign on my door so no, no I don&#39;t want to talk to your canvasser.</p><p>GDPR was well intentioned, but the cookie banners and compliance cottage industry that grew out of it are a blight on the web. I&#39;ll opt out of all but your essential cookies, but I&#39;d rather it be opt in (nobody&#39;s going to opt in). Couldn&#39;t we do this at the browser level? Set that preference once and leave me alone henceforth. I&#39;m going to have the same opinion for every site seeking to so graciously bequeath my browser with cookies.</p><p>I don&#39;t want your direct mailers and I shouldn&#39;t have to opt out via DMA Choice. If I wanted them, I&#39;d sign up for them (I don&#39;t want them).</p><p>Want my number for 2FA? Please, please, God do not use it to market to me.</p><p>Don&#39;t throw up a banner because I blocked your ads. I blocked your ads because, at this point, they&#39;re intrusive and they&#39;re a security risk. I&#39;ll root around and filter out the DOM node for your nag banner though. At this point, the only ads I see are on the jerseys of NBA players, but I seem to have developed banner blindness for those.</p><p>Let these things be opt in. You&#39;re a company, you&#39;re a political campaign and you want money or a vote. Outreach isn&#39;t about maintaining a relationship, it&#39;s about insisting on future transactions. It&#39;s insisting that someone engage with you when they would do so if they <em>cared to</em>.</p><p>So, while it&#39;s burdensome, I&#39;m going to keep opting out. I&#39;ll screen out emails, I&#39;ll block them, I&#39;ll unsubscribe, I&#39;ll report them as spam. I&#39;ll reply with <code>STOP</code> to unsubscribe (again and again and again). I&#39;ll refuse direct mailers, I&#39;ll block ads, I&#39;ll block the banners that spring up in their place.</p><p>If I <em>need</em> something I&#39;ll buy it — I&#39;ll seek it out but if you insist upon my attention, if you make a pitch or a hard sale I&#39;m going to walk away. It&#39;s reflexive.</p><p>I devote time to things I care deeply about. I&#39;ll chase them, I&#39;ll seek them out and I&#39;ll invest in them. Everyone does that to some degree or another. There is so much insistence and intrusion that opting out becomes both laborious and necessary.</p><p>An economy built on demanding attention is, frankly, hellish.</p><p>I&#39;ll keep weeding that garden and, I&#39;ll probably never be done, but hopefully it&#39;ll get better eventually.</p></div></div>
