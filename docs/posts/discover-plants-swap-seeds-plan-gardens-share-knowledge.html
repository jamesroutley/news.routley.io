<h3>Contribute</h3>
<p>We like to think of Permapeople as a well-balanced ecosystem, where all input provides value for all other members of the system, whether directly or indirectly. More data means people growing plants successfully. More plants means happier earth. Happy earth = happy people. Provide edits, share images and plant info, or create profiles for missing plants.</p>

<h3>Donate funds</h3>
<p>Running services is our most consistent cost, but we&#39;re working hard to grow the project, and we need your help. Any donations go towards server costs, organization services - like email and project management - and ideally towards paying one of our core members to take some time off their day job to contribute more directly to the project.</p>
