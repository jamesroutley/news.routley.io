Go and subscribe then download every single episode. </strong></p><p><strong>One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. </strong></p><hr/><p>Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it&#39;s accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming.</p><p>And I am <em>alarmed.</em></p><p>Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it&#39;s convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money.</p><p>I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as &#34;optimists,&#34; which typically means &#34;people that agree with what the market wishes were true.&#34; Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there&#39;s something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics &#34;do this for clicks&#34; or &#34;to be a contrarian.&#34;</p><p>I don&#39;t do anything for clicks. I don&#39;t have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because &#34;AI is big,&#34; but I&#39;ve been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-upcoming-remote-work-company/"> <u>anti-remote work push</u></a> (<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-big-media-anti-remote-op-ed-complex/"><u>and the people behind it</u></a>),<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/clubhouse-is-the-big-stinker-that/"> <u>the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble</u></a>,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-nihilism-and-exploitation-of/"> <u>the NFT bubble</u></a>,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/quiet-quitting-and-the-death-of-office/"> <u>the made-up quiet quitting panic</u></a>, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-bankrun-fraud/"> <u>called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded</u></a>. </p><p>This isn&#39;t &#34;contrarianism.&#34;  It&#39;s the kind of skepticism of power and capital that&#39;s necessary to meet these moments, and if it&#39;s necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest.</p><p>Nevertheless, I am <em>alarmed</em>, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it&#39;s necessary to say why. </p><p>In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say &#34;the AI bubble,&#34; I mean the entirety of the AI trade.</p><p>And it&#39;s alarmingly simple, too.</p><p>But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply <em>worrisome.</em> I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s<em> been</em> so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure.</p><p>I may not be a contrarian, but I am a<em> hater</em>. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer <em>excitement</em> that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — <strong>and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so.</strong></p><p>And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it.  </p><p>No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t <em>fucking work</em> and <em>will never fucking work. </em>I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat.</p><p>Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something.</p><h3 id="the-magnificent-7s-weakpoint-nvidia"><strong>The Magnificent 7&#39;s Weakpoint: NVIDIA</strong></h3><p>As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/"> <u>the DeepSeek situation</u></a> in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. </p><p>The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA&#39;s market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested.</p><p>Back in May, Yahoo Finance&#39;s<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-spending-drove-nvidias-rise-154027146.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Laura Bratton reported</u></a> that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) <strong>alone</strong> make up <strong><em>42.4% of NVIDIA&#39;s revenue. </em></strong>The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA&#39;s revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA&#39;s revenue.</p><p>NVIDIA&#39;s climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2026?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>in the last quarter</u></a>, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA <em>missed</em>, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (.<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025052776/nvidia-reports-earnings-tomorrow-heres-the-main-issue-on-investors-minds?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion</u></a> from this category, and<a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2026?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion</u></a>.

In any case, it was a miss!</p><p>NVIDIA&#39;s quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn&#39;t <em>bad</em> (it&#39;s pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, <em>it&#39;s a pretty big concern, at least for me. </em>Look, I&#39;m not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA relies not only on selling <strong>lots of GPUs each quarter,</strong> but <strong>it must always, <em>always</em> sell more GPUs the next quarter.</strong></li><li>42% of NVIDIA&#39;s revenue comes from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla continuing to buy <strong>more GPUs.</strong></li><li>NVIDIA&#39;s value and continued growth is heavily reliant on <strong>hyperscaler purchases </strong>and <strong>continued interest in generative AI.</strong></li><li>The US stock market&#39;s continued health relies, on some level, on five or six companies (it&#39;s unclear how much Apple buys GPU-wise) spending billions of dollars on GPUs from NVIDIA.<ul><li><a href="https://www.paceretfs.com/resources/resource-library/is-the-market-being-hijacked-by-the-magnificent-seven?utm_source=openai"><u>An analysis from portfolio manager Danke Wang</u></a> from January found that the Magnificent 7 stocks accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index&#39;s returns in 2024 (an index fund of the 1000 highest-ranked stocks on FTSE Russell’s index).</li></ul></li></ul><p>In simpler terms, <strong>35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. </strong>If NVIDIA&#39;s growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories.</p><p>And, as you will shortly find out, <strong><em>there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money.</em></strong></p><h2 id="the-hollow-ai-trade"><strong>The Hollow &#34;AI Trade&#34;</strong></h2><p>I&#39;m so tired of people telling me that companies are &#34;making tons of money on AI.&#34; Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. </p><h2 id="the-magnificent-7s-ai-story-is-flawed-with-560-billion-of-capex-between-2024-and-2025-leading-to-35-billion-of-revenue-and-no-profit"><strong>The Magnificent 7&#39;s AI Story Is Flawed, With $560 Billion of Capex between 2024 and 2025 Leading to $35 billion of Revenue, And <u>No Profit</u></strong></h2><p>If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion.</p><p>This is egregiously fucking stupid.</p><h3 id="microsoft-ai-revenue-in-2025-13-billion-with-10-billion-from-openai-sold-at-a-heavily-discounted-rate-that-essentially-only-covers-costs-for-operating-the-servers"><strong>Microsoft AI Revenue In 2025: $13 billion, with $10 billion from OpenAI, sold &#34;at a heavily discounted rate that essentially only covers costs for operating the servers.&#34;</strong></h3><h3 id="capital-expenditures-in-2025-80-billion"><strong>Capital Expenditures in 2025: $80 billion</strong></h3><p>As of January 2025,<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/microsoft-earnings-2/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Microsoft&#39;s &#34;annualized&#34; — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion</u></a>, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it&#39;s either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings.

At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&amp;P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies&#39; spend makes up 42% of its revenue. <strong>In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market.</strong></p><p>NVIDIA&#39;s earnings are, effectively, the US stock market&#39;s confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we&#39;re honest, really <em>four</em> companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, <strong><em>don&#39;t produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth.</em></strong></p><h3 id="but-ed-they-said-something-about-points-of-growth"><strong><em>But Ed, They Said Something About Points of Growth-</em></strong></h3><p>Silence!</p><p>Any of these companies talking about &#34;growth from AI&#34; or &#34;the jobs that AI will replace&#34; or &#34;how AI has changed their organization&#34; are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them.

People Said Amazon Would Fail!</strong></h2><p>So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” </p><p>The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it<em> sounds rational.</em> Amazon<em> did</em> lose money, and Amazon Web Services <em>was</em> expensive, that’s obvious, right? </p><p>The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that.</p><p>This isn&#39;t Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur!</p><p>I will address both the argument itself and the &#34;they&#34; part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future.</p><p><strong><em>Right?</em></strong></p><p>So, I&#39;m honestly not <em>sure</em> where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon.</p><p>But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called &#34;<a href="https://archive.is/5DLzp?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Amazon.bomb</u></a>,&#34; and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for &#34;being wrong&#34; about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable.</p><p>I also want to be clear <strong>that Amazon Web Services didn&#39;t launch until 2006, and</strong><a href="https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_AMZN_2003.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><strong> <u>Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003</u></strong></a><strong>. </strong>Technically Amazon had opened up<a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2002/7/amazon-com-launches-web-services-developers-can-now-incorporate-amazon-com-content-and-features-into-their-own-web-sites-extends-welcome-mat-for-developers?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Amazon.com&#39;s web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications</u></a> in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006.</p><p>But okay, what did she actually say?</p><blockquote>Unfortunately for Bezos, Amazon is now entering a stage in which investors will be less willing to rely on his charisma and more demanding of answers to tough questions like, when will this company actually turn a profit? And how will Amazon triumph over a slew of new competitors who have deep pockets and new technologies?</blockquote><p>Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up:</p><blockquote>&#34;The first mover does not always win. The importance of being first is a mantra in the Internet world, but it&#39;s wrong. The ones that are the most efficient will be successful,&#34; says one retail analyst. &#34;In retailing, anyone can build a great-looking store. The hard part is building a great-looking store that makes money.&#34;</blockquote><p>Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn&#39;t that <em>what Amazon was building</em> was a bad idea, <em>but that Amazon wouldn&#39;t be the ones to build it,</em> with one saying:</p><blockquote>&#34;Once Wal-Mart decides to go after Amazon, there&#39;s no contest,&#34; declares Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard&#39;s Retail Trend Report. &#34;Wal-Mart has resources Amazon can&#39;t even dream about.&#34;</blockquote><p>In simpler terms: <strong>Amazon&#39;s business model wasn&#39;t in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point.</strong> Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked.</p><h2 id="but-lets-talk-about-amazon-web-services"><strong>But Let&#39;s Talk About Amazon Web Services</strong></h2><p>Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon&#39;s own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world&#39;s most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing.</p><p>It&#39;s actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.<a href="https://archive.ph/20210824035659/https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/happy-15th-birthday-amazon-ec2/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>It invented the modern concept of compute</u></a>!</p><p>But we&#39;re here to talk about Amazon Web Services being <em>dangerous for Amazon</em> and people <em>hating on it.</em></p><p>A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-11-12/jeff-bezos-risky-bet?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Jeff Bezos&#39; Risky Bet</u></a> to &#34;run your business with the technology behind his web site,&#34; saying that &#34;Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store.&#34; Bezos, referred to as a &#34;one-time internet poster boy&#34; that became &#34;a post-dot-com piñata.&#34; Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave:</p><blockquote>But if techies are wowed by Bezos&#39; grand plan, it&#39;s not likely to win many converts on Wall Street. To many observers, it conjures up the ghost of Amazon past. During the dot-com boom, Bezos spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build distribution centers and computer systems in the promise that they eventually would pay off with outsize returns. That helped set the stage for the world&#39;s biggest Web retail operation, with expected sales of $10.5 billion this year.</blockquote><p>Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad!</p><p>Except it&#39;s not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! </p><p>Emphasis mine:</p><blockquote>By all accounts, Amazon&#39;s new businesses bring in a minuscule amount of revenue. <strong>Although its direct cost of providing them appears relatively low because the hardware and software are in place</strong>, Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. (SF ) analyst Scott W. Devitt notes: &#34;There&#39;s not going to be any economic return from any of these projects for the foreseeable future.&#34; Bezos himself admits as much. But with several years of heavy spending already, he&#39;s making this a priority for the long haul. &#34;We think it&#39;s going to be a very meaningful business for us one day,&#34; he says. &#34;What we&#39;ve historically seen is that the seeds we plant can take anywhere from three, five, seven years.&#34;</blockquote><p>That&#39;s right — the ongoing costs aren&#39;t the problem.</p><p>Hey wait a second, that&#39;s a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god,<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/palantir-snowflake-salesforce-gain-next-162817595.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>just read this</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The second stage is &#34;the application phase of the cycle, which should benefit software companies as well as the cloud providers. And then, phase three of this will ultimately be the consumer-facing companies figuring out how to use the technology in ways that actually can drive increased interactions with consumers.&#34;</blockquote><p>The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves.</p><p>Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would &#34;gain.&#34; In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-giving-salesforce-boost?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year</u></a>.

And they can be wrong at scale!</em> There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth!</p><p>Yet even in this Hater&#39;s Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case<em> for </em>Amazon Web Services:</p><blockquote>Sooner than that, those initiatives may provide a boost for Amazon&#39;s retail side. For one, they potentially make a profit center out of idle computing capacity needed for that retail operation. Like most computer networks, Amazon&#39;s uses as little as 10% of its capacity at any one time just to leave room for occasional spikes. It&#39;s the same story in the company&#39;s distribution centers. Keeping them humming at higher capacity means they operate more efficiently, besides giving customers a much broader selection of products. And the more stuff Amazon ships, both its own inventory or others&#39;, the better deals it can cut with shippers.</blockquote><h3 id="but-amazon-web-services-cost-money-ed-now-you-shall-meet-your-end"><strong>But Amazon Web Services Cost Money Ed, Now You Shall Meet Your End!</strong></h3><p>Nice try, chuckles!</p><p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/cloud/amazon-com-breaks-out-aws-cloud-revenues-for-first-time-in-q1-report?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable</u></a>,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2015/04/22/amazon-detailing-aws-performance-may-not-be-good-for-the-stock/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed</u></a> that it was running at a &#34;material loss,&#34; suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon&#39;s &#34;technology and content expenses&#34; was actually AWS expenses, with a &#34;negative contribution of $1.3 billion.&#34;</p><p>Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that &#34;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/katy-huberty-6930694_we-expect-2025-to-be-a-year-of-agentic-ai-activity-7283538383807627264-3rN0/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners</u></a>.&#34;</p><p>So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services <em>absolutely</em> created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2015/04/22/amazon-detailing-aws-performance-may-not-be-good-for-the-stock/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>From Forbes’s Chuck Jones</u></a>:</p><blockquote>In 2014 Amazon had $4.9 billion in capital expenditures, up 42% from 2013’s $3.4 billion. The company has a wide range of items that it buys to support and grow its business ranging from warehouses, robots and computer systems for its core retail business and AWS. While I don’t expect Amazon to detail how much goes to AWS I suspect it is a decent percentage, which means AWS needs to generate appropriate returns on the capital deployed.</blockquote><p>In today&#39;s money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn&#39;t, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/amazons-quarterly-profits-soar-to-a-record-20-billion-but-cloud-growth-comes-up-short/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Although%20AWS%20sales%20($28.8,$21.2%20billion%20for%20the%20quarter."> <u>a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit</u></a>.</p><p>That&#39;s $15.4 billion <strong>less than Amazon&#39;s capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. </strong>And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that <em>even when factoring in inflation,</em> Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost <em>of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025.</em></p><blockquote><strong>A fun aside: </strong>On March 30 2015,<a href="https://archive.is/ObpQl?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Kevin Roose wrote a piece for New York Magazine</u></a> about the cloud compute wars, in which he claimed that, and I quote, &#34;there&#39;s no reason to suspect that Amazon would ever need to raise prices on AWS, or turn the fabled &#34;profit switch&#34; that pundits have been speculating about for years.&#34;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201108100958/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32442268"> <u>Less than a month later Amazon revealed Amazon Web Services was profitable</u></a>. <em>They don&#39;t call him &#34;the most right man in tech journalism&#34; for nothing!</em></blockquote><h2 id="generative-ai-and-large-language-models-do-not-resemble-amazon-web-services-or-the-greater-cloud-compute-boom-as-generative-ai-is-not-infrastructure"><strong>Generative AI and Large Language Models Do Not Resemble Amazon Web Services or The Greater Cloud Compute Boom, As Generative AI Is <em>Not Infrastructure</em></strong></h2><p>Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so.</p><p>Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I&#39;m diluting this) Amazon&#39;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon&#39;s servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed <em>and</em> the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). </p><p>This is a huge industry.<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024</u></a>, and while Microsoft and Google don&#39;t break out their cloud revenues, they&#39;re similarly large parts of their revenue, and<a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/01/29/azure-cant-make-up-for-on-premise-profit-decline-at-microsoft/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth</u></a>.</p><p>These services are also <em>selling infrastructure.</em> You aren&#39;t just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point.<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business/trust/security/architecture?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Dropbox%20corporate%20and%20production%20systems%20are%20housed,our%20infrastructure%20housed%20at%20third%2Dparty%20data%20centers."> <u>Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled</u></a>. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware <em>and </em>make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don&#39;t have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand.</p><p>There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because <strong>ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you.</strong></p><p>Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs?</p><p>Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon&#39;s infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn&#39;t need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. </p><p>And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it&#39;s largely impossible for others to even enter the market.</p><p>Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a <em>feature </em>of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that&#39;s about it.</p><p>You can <em>run</em> lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed &#34;next big thing&#34;?</p><p>Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. </p><p>So, okay, let&#39;s humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they&#39;re the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure.</p><p>One small problem.</p><h2 id="companies-built-on-top-of-large-language-models-dont-make-much-money-in-fact-theyre-likely-all-deeply-unprofitable"><strong>Companies Built On Top Of Large Language Models Don&#39;t Make Much Money (In Fact, They&#39;re Likely All Deeply Unprofitable)</strong></h2><p>Let&#39;s start by establishing a few facts:</p><ul><li>Outside of one exception — <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/01/david_holz_midjourney/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Midjourney, which  claimed it was profitable in 2022</u></a>, which may not still be the case, I’ve reached out to ask— every single Large Language Model company is unprofitable, often wildly so. </li><li>Outside of OpenAI, Anthropic and Anysphere (which makes AI coding app Cursor), there are no Large Language Model companies — either building models or services on top of others&#39; models — that make more than $500 million in annualized revenue (meaning month x 12), and outside of Midjourney ($200m ARR) and Ironclad ($150m ARR),<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/projects/generative-ai?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>according to The Information&#39;s Generative AI database</u></a>, and Perplexity (which just announced it’s at $150m ARR), there are <strong>only twelve generative AI-powered companies making $100 million annualized (or $8.3 million a month) in revenue. </strong>Though the database doesn&#39;t have Replit (which recently announced it hit $100 million in annualized revenue), I&#39;ve included it in my calculations for the sake of fairness.<ul><li>Of these companies, two have been acquired —<a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-to-acquire-moveworks.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Moveworks</u></a> (acquired by ServiceNow in March 2025) and Windsurf (<a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>acquired by Cognition in July 2025</u></a>).</li><li>For the sake of simplicity, I&#39;ve left out companies like Surge, Scale, Turing and Together, all of whom run consultancies selling services for training models.</li></ul></li><li>Otherwise, there are seven companies that make $50 million or more ARR ($4.16 million a month).</li></ul><p>None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn&#39;t a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, <em>this is chump change. </em>Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year.</p><p>We&#39;re three years in, and generative AI&#39;s highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/openai-hits-10-billion-in-annualized-revenue-fueled-by-chatgpt-growth.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>($10 billion annualized as of early June</u></a>) and Anthropic (<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-revenue-hits-4-billion-annual-pace-competition-cursor-intensifies?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>$4 billion annualized as of July</u></a>), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems:</p><ul><li>Businesses powered by generative AI do not seem to be popular.</li><li>Those businesses that are remotely popular are deeply unprofitable...</li><li>...and even the less-popular generative AI-powered businesses are deeply unprofitable.</li></ul><p>But let&#39;s start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue.

ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework.</p><p><strong>Sidebar: </strong>Google cheated by<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2638233/so-long-google-assistant-its-geminis-world-now.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant</u></a> to claim that it has 350 million users. Don&#39;t care, sorry.</p><p>This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said &#34;AI&#34; in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can&#39;t scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry.</p><p>I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT&#39;s users, and I<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/"> <u>quote myself here</u></a>:</p><p>It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers.

It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI.

Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they&#39;d be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/alphabet-earnings-ai-monetization-continues-improve-ad-spending-remains-strong?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that&#39;s the case</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/"><u>OpenAI is a terrible business</u></a>, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it.

Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around &#34;being an AI company,&#34; which means absolutely jack shit when you don&#39;t have the users, finances, or products to back them up.</p><p>So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA&#39;s ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we&#39;re really honest, at this point only exists to do so.

Generative AI does not do the things that it&#39;s being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren&#39;t the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn&#39;t there, the users aren&#39;t there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it&#39;s impossible to tell how they&#39;ll survive.</p><p>Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans.</p><p>There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, <em>the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs.</em> There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, <em>at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI.</em></p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lmkahymkec2t?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer"><u>Before you ask</u>-</a></p><h3 id="but-isn%E2%80%99t-the-cost-of-inference-going-down"><strong>But, Isn’t The Cost Of Inference Going Down?</strong></h3><p>You do not have proof for this statement!

Do they have contracts with companies that can actually produce high-performance silicon, of which there are only three (Samsung, TSMC, and arguably SMIC, which is currently sanctioned), and these companies typically have their capacity booked well in advance. Even starting a production run of a semiconductor product can take weeks. Do they have the server architecture prepared? Have they tested it? Does it work?

Can they build enough?</li><li>If this actually happens, <em>it still fucks up the AI trade. NVIDIA STILL NEEDS TO SELL GPUs!</em></li></ul><hr/><p>I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/magazine/using-ai-hard-fork.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>claims everybody is using AI for everything</u></a> — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere.</p><p>Other than the frog thing, I&#39;m not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus.</p><p>Worse still, despite NVIDIA&#39;s strength, <em>NVIDIA is the market&#39;s weakness</em>, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they&#39;re buying start making them a profit.</p><p>And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to say I&#39;m wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don&#39;t want me to be right? Is it because you think &#34;these companies will work it out&#34;? This isn&#39;t anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/rotcombubble/"> <u>a tech industry that&#39;s run out of ideas</u></a>, built on top of <em>one company</em>.</p><p>You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You&#39;ve probably read the &#34;<a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</u></a>&#34; blog, and if you&#39;re gonna send it to me,<a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/contra-ptaceks-terrible-article-on-ai/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>read the response from Nik Suresh first</u></a>.

I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and <em>still, to this day</em>, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I&#39;m missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case.</p><p>The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making &#34;powerful AI.&#34; And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology.</p><h2 id="i-dont-like-whats-happening"><strong>I Don&#39;t Like What&#39;s Happening</strong></h2><p>I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot.</p><p>I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not <em>outright lie</em> about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets <em>and the media </em>for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of &#34;agents&#34; that will never exist.</p><p>Everything I’m discussing is the result of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/"><u>the Rot Economy thesis</u></a> I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, <strong><em>both.</em></strong></p><p>Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically<em> GPUs</em>. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to <em>do the thing that worked before</em> — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed.</p><p>I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn&#39;t believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who &#34;don&#39;t understand AI,&#34; you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn&#39;t that good or you&#39;re not good at explaining why it&#39;s good. Perhaps it&#39;s both.</p><p>If you want to know my true agenda, it&#39;s that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others.</p><p>There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don&#39;t, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it&#39;s part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what&#39;s going on.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-168513007?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>To quote my editor Matt Hughes</u></a>: &#34;...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst.&#34;</p><p>I haven&#39;t quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things<a href="https://futurism.com/former-ceo-uber-ai?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics</u></a>. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-era-of-the-business-idiot/"> <u>Business Idiots</u></a> that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of<a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/silicon-valley-runs-on-futurity?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>futurity</u></a>, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what&#39;s happening in the tech industry.</p><p>And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth.</p><p>I love writing, but I don&#39;t love writing this. I think I&#39;m right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ll explain how I&#39;m wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m so alarmed.</p><p>What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company&#39;s ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars.</p><p>At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won&#39;t even be sales slowing — maybe it&#39;ll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won&#39;t be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. </p><p>I don&#39;t know when, I don&#39;t know how, but I really, really don&#39;t know how I&#39;m wrong.</p><p>I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that <a href="https://futurism.com/microsoft-boss-ai-advice?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>so many people have lost their jobs</u></a> because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. </p><p>But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there <em>are</em> people responsible. </p><p>Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable.</p><p>And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart.</p><p>I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers, and I now have 67,000 and a growing premium subscriber base. I am grateful for the time you’ve given me, and really hope that I continue to help you see the tech industry for what it currently is — captured almost entirely by people that have no interest in building the future.<br/></p>
