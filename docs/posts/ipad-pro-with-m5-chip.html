</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple silicon continues to set iPad apart with industry-leading performance, advanced technologies, power efficiency, and AI capabilities. With the M5 chip powering iPad Pro, AI on iPad takes its next big leap, with a more advanced GPU and CPU, and a faster Neural Engine. The 10-core GPU introduces a new architecture with a Neural Accelerator in each core, resulting in a massive boost in GPU performance for AI workloads. M5 delivers AI performance that’s up to 3.5x faster compared to M4,<sup>1</sup> and up to 5.6x faster than iPad Pro with M1.<sup>2</sup> The new iPad Pro is designed for AI and accelerates a wide variety of workloads, such as on-device diffusion-based image generation in apps like Draw Things, and AI video masking in apps like DaVinci Resolve. And the faster 16-core Neural Engine delivers the most energy-efficient performance for on-device AI, perfect for apps that use the Foundation Models framework and for Apple Intelligence features like creating in Image Playground.<sup>3</sup>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. The new iPad Pro is made with 30 percent recycled content by weight, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. It is manufactured with 55 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. iPad Pro is also designed to last and offers industry-leading software support while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled.
