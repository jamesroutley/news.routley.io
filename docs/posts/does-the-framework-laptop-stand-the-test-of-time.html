    <h1>Ask HN: Does the Framework laptop stand the test of time?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>3-4 years ago, several HN submissions of the Framework laptop got 1k-2k+ upvotes. I&#39;d like to ask those of you who got the laptop: does it live up to the hype? Will it last you longer than any other laptop? Did any paint points emerge? If you had no laptop today, would you buy the Framework laptop again?</p><p>I would like to know how long you have used it, and which model you have.</p></div></div></div>
