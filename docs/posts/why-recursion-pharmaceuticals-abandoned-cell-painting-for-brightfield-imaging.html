This shouldn’t be too surprising; biology is complex, and dissolving things down to a single target is hard. The Recursion bet is not just on the phenotype-based approach, but also in scaling it up to an insane degree: </span><strong>&gt;19 petabytes of cellular images + perturbation pairs at last count (2024).</strong></p><p>Has this paid off?</p><p><span>Realistically, I think it’s still a work in progress.

What is cell painting? Why did Recursion focus on the latter first, and then switch to the former recently? And how did the transition process go internally? This essay will discuss all that.</p><p>Brightfield imaging is, as mentioned, an old technique. Its origins can be traced back to the 15th century, when Dutch pioneers in optics — Hans and Zacharias Janssen — first invented the compound microscope. In the 17th century, Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek used improved versions of the microscope, capable of far greater magnifications, to observe microscopic life. Now, in the modern era, it is routinely used by scientists to study intricate cellular behavior.</p><p><span>At its start, brightfield imaging wasn’t even called so; it was simply the </span><strong>only</strong><span> way to observe things through a microscope. Only later was it named ‘brightfield’ to distinguish it from alternative, newer techniques (e.g.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark-field_microscopy" rel=""> darkfield imaging</a><span>). The principles of it are simple: you shine visible light through [something] and observe what comes out the other side. In the case of cells, you place them between glass slides, shine light from underneath them, and observe what&#39;s visible from the top using a microscope.</span></p><p>Different parts of a cell interact with light differently. The cell membrane, nucleus, and various organelles all have their own differences in light absorption, creating contrast in the final image. The result is a grayscale picture — as cells are generally colorless or transparent — where darker areas represent denser or more light-absorbing parts of the cell, while lighter areas show where light passes through more easily.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s fundamentally equivalent to holding up a leaf to the sun — from the shadows arise structure.</strong><span> It’s incredibly cheap, simple, and easy to perform. As a further benefit, cells generally don’t care if light is being shone on them, so brightfield imaging doesn’t alter cell behavior either. For centuries, brightfield imaging was a way — again, the </span><strong>only</strong><span> way — for humans to deeply study the behavior of microscopic life, and it did that job splendidly.</span></p><p><span>There’s really only one real issue with brightfield imaging: </span><strong>it’s really, really hard to observe anything interesting</strong><span>. Here is a single cell, imaged using brightfield.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg" width="328" height="338.90304709141276" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:746,&#34;width&#34;:722,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:328,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f4879b-f515-4992-bb88-4a96a0c8287c_722x746.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>You can vaguely see some details about the state of the cell.

At the start, people quantized their cell painting images into thousands of hand-crafted features — size of cells, shape of cells, number of nuclei, and so on, using tools like</span><a href="https://cellprofiler.org/" rel=""> CellProfiler</a><span> (also created by Anne Carpenter’s lab) — and training models to predict the genetic or chemical perturbations applied to the cells. Of course, as the ML field slowly abandoned dataset priors and moved over to unstructured representations, so did the biology field. Circa 2019,</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00670" rel=""> using raw cell painting images as model input were confirmed as superior over hand-crafted features.</a><span> </span><strong>This is an important point, and we’ll come back to it later.</strong></p><p><strong>And two, far more salient to this essay,</strong><span> </span><strong>you can start a company</strong><span>. Fairly, Recursion as a company was more closely aligned to general phenotypic methods for drug discovery than any one phenotyping technique. Yet, they nevertheless became closely associated with cell painting, with nearly every mention of the methodology in news articles mentioning Recursion&#39;s name and their associated grand ambitions</span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069261/a-technique-called-cell-painting-could-speed-drug-discovery/" rel=""> (like so)</a><span>. It also doesn’t hurt that</span><a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/painting-the-picture-of-recursion-anne-carpenter-scientific-advisory-board-member" rel=""> Anne Carpenter has served on their scientific advisory board since the startup was founded.</a><span> From the piece, which describes Anne’s initial interactions with Recursion’s founders in 2013:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Over burgers at the nearby “Miracle of Science” pub that evening, I peppered them with questions over the course of two hours, more intensely than any PhD thesis defense I’ve witnessed. Normally, I would be a bit gentler on two grad students with a dream, but I am quite skeptical about startups by nature, and these two were planning to launch a company in the field I had pioneered: image-based profiling. I’m a bit chagrined to think how I treated them, but I certainly didn’t want a company so close to my lab’s research to hype big and fizzle out. In fact, my inherent skepticism is a large part of why I have never served on the Scientific Advisory Board of another start up company - before nor since Recursion. Survey a few MIT professors and find out how unusual that is!</em></p><p><em>But there was something special about this situation. First, I knew the science very deeply: the plan was to make use of the software my lab had created and open-sourced, called CellProfiler, to extract features from images. They would also use the image-based profiling assay my lab co-invented with Stuart Schreiber’s team, called Cell Painting, which uses cells’ morphology features extracted from images as a readout of the impact of a disease, drug, or genetic anomaly. To be fair, in 2013 I wasn’t convinced that image-based profiling would work as well as it has turned out to, and across so many applications.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>And the theoretical utility of cell painting quickly bore over the years.</p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/12/giw014/2865213" rel="">Models trained on raw cell painting images could predict the chemical perturbations applied to the cell</a><span>s. Even more interestingly,</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667318523000041#bib0018" rel=""> such models could even predict the mechanism of action of the perturbation</a><span> — far better than models trained on purely structural chemical data alone. Their utility popped up in a variety of areas beyond that, from</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041008X23001527" rel=""> toxicological analysis</a><span> to</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c01183" rel=""> predicting cell stress response</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Again, this essay isn’t about whether improved phenotyping approaches (e.g. cell painting) in early R&amp;D strongly translates to more/better actual drugs released.</strong><span> This hasn’t practically turned out to be the case, at least for now,</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/biological-imaging/article/cell-painting-transfer-increases-screening-hit-rate/BC735C32216171EFE0D8B57D1E16B69E" rel=""> though some early results suggests a reversal in that trend</a><span>. As I mentioned previously, time will tell what the utility of scaling up phenotyping screens will bring.</span></p><p><span>What this essay is about is why cell painting — despite being such a seemingly promising assay — was abandoned and replaced with its century-old predecessor. To those in the ML community, the answer may be obvious: </span><strong>it was never needed in the first place.</strong></p><p><span>The trend of ML in general over the past 15~ years has been to strip away more and more of the biases you’ve encoded about your dataset as you feed it into a model. Computer vision went from hand-crafted interpretable features (e.g. number of circles, number of black pixels when thresholded, etc), to hand-crafted uninterpretable features (e.g. s</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform" rel="">cale invariant feature transform</a><span>), to automatically extracted uninterpretable features (e.g. hidden dimensions of a convolutional neural network).

detrimental to a machine.</span></p><p><strong>Cell painting is a casualty of this truth.</strong><span> The method simply highlights what is already present in brightfield images, which may be useful for hand-crafted features that benefit from strong contrast, </span><strong>but neutral at best for deep learning methods.</strong></p><p><span>As I mentioned earlier, the superiority of using raw, unaltered cell painting images as input over hand-crafted features</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00670" rel=""> was established by 2019</a><span>, but, as time went

Perhaps there are extremely subtle, but important, differences between the ‘predicted’ and ground cell painting images that a naive eye-balling wouldn’t tell us anything about. We’d need a study that took a model trained on brightfield-only images and a model trained on cell painting-only images, and compared the two on tasks of interest.</p><p><span>Luckily, circa 2023,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011323" rel=""> we have one of those</a><span>, which compares the two modalities on predictions of chemical perturbation across ten mechanisms of action. And the results are quite clear. If you rely on CellProfiler-extracted features, cell painting wins. </span><strong>But, if you use raw cellular images, there is relatively little predictive difference between brightfield and cell painting images.</strong><span> There’s still a lot of follow-up work to do here to ensure that this trend continues across many different cells and perturbations, which is something we’ll discuss a bit more later, but it feels unlikely that this is all a coincidence.</span></p><p>We’ve established equivalency, at least roughly. But is there a chance that brightfield could yield something beyond cell painting alone?</p><p><span>On face value, the value of brightfield has a lot to do with its simplicity. Cell painting is also simple, relatively, but there is a whole protocol that goes along with it.</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-023-00840-9" rel=""> Entire consortiums have been spun up to optimize the process further</a><span>, dyes cost money, and artifacts in the process may still arise. Brightfield solves all these problems. So the first-order impact of Recursion switching away from cell painting is making their dataset higher-quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper to create.</span></p><p><span>But there is another side benefit of going the brightfield route: the ability to do</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_microscopy" rel=""> time-lapse microscopy</a><span>. </span><strong>The ability to observe, in real time, how a cell behaves from second-to-second, hour-to-hour, and day-to-day.</strong></p><p><span>At least some of the dyes in cell painting </span><strong>can</strong><span> be done to live cells, a few of them used in the process aren’t technically cytotoxic and were specifically chosen to minimize their effect on cell behavior. Unfortunately, behavior deviations still arise.</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1039/c0pp00234h" rel=""> A study from 2010 showed that the Hoechst stains</a><span> — the same ones we discussed earlier that bind to DNA — can cause cell apoptosis if the dyes are repeatedly excited with light. And, in fact, the</span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/VIW.20240013" rel=""> whole concept of fluorescent stains likely invariably causes levels of phototoxic effects on the cell over time.</a></p><p><span>Because of this, the cell painting assay isn’t applied to live cells! In practice, the Recursion cell painting process looks like this (</span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.13.499171v1.full.pdf" rel="">following the protocol outlined here</a><span>):</span></p><ol><li><p>Grow cells.</p></li><li><p>Apply chemical compound or genetic therapy (overexpression or knockdown) or both to the cells.</p></li><li><p><span>Somewhere between 24-48 hours later, fix, permeabilize (allow things to pass through the cell membrane), and stain the cells with the cell painting dyes.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)#:~:text=In%20the%20fields%20of%20histology,tissues&#39;%20mechanical%20strength%20or%20stability." rel=""> Cell fixation</a><span> refers to the process of ‘freezing’ the cells in places; preventing further cell decay by terminating ongoing biochemical reactions. The fixation chemical that Recursion relies on is paraformaldehyde, a crosslinking fixative, which forcibly creates covalent chemical bonds between the proteins in a cell and [everything] around it. At least for several weeks, this will (</span><a href="https://focalplane.biologists.com/2020/07/07/fixation-artifacts-and-how-to-minimize-them/" rel="">mostly</a><span>) perfectly preserve the cell&#39;s appearance.</span></p></li><li><p>Within 28 days of cell dyeing + fixation, image the cells and use the resulting images for whatever you want.</p></li></ol><p><span>There’s a reasonably strong assumption we’re making here: </span><strong>most of the useful information about how a perturbation affects a cell is observable at the exact moment of freezing, 24-48 hours after the perturbation first occurred.</strong><span> This doesn’t feel immediately obvious: there is potentially really useful data in understanding how a compound is worming its way into a cell immediately after application, whether long term changes remain on the cell morphology weeks after application, and so on. With cell painting, all that information is tossed away.</span></p><p><strong>But if you use brightfield, you can image as much as you want, seeing the full temporal scope of cellular responses to perturbations.</strong></p><p><span>Is there precedent to believe that viewing the temporal state of cells actually helps to understand their behavior? We certainly know that many phenotypic aspects of cells are time-bound; cell motility, the movement of membrane proteins, and so on. But do we gain anything from actually </span><strong>watching</strong><span> those time-bound events as they occur? Naively, we’d expect that to be the case. After all,</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o57arcKLgU4" rel=""> look at this video of brightfield pre-adipocytes!</a><span> Look how much is going on! Surely at least </span><strong>some</strong><span> of this is useful information!</span></p><p><span>(Note, I have since learned via the comments that the below video is not actually brightfield, but </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotomography" rel="">holotomography</a><span>. The point still stands though!)</span></p><p>It’s…unfortunately not super clear cut from the literature.</p><p>If you try to find papers about the utility of time-lapse imaging in cells, you’ll find dozens of results, claiming that the temporal aspect is deeply important. But they are all somewhat suspect.</p><p><span>One paper published in Science is very outright with this, titled ‘</span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba9319" rel="">Live-cell imaging and analysis reveal cell phenotypic transition dynamics inherently missing in snapshot data</a><strong>’. </strong><span>But all that’s actually revealed is that there is a ‘fork’ in cell state transition dynamics — not that the fork is actually meaningful in using the data for anything.</span></p><p><span>Closer to the topic of understanding the impact of chemical perturbations on cells, there is another paper titled ‘</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6101178/" rel="">Long-term Live-cell Imaging to Assess Cell Fate in Response to Paclitaxel</a><strong>’. </strong><span>The results are a bit mixed; cell responses to chemotherapeutics do display a fair bit of heterogeneity that temporal approaches help tease out. But again, the heterogeneity is observable from the end-state, and it’s unclear how important knowing the ‘path to heterogeneity’ is.</span></p><p><span>The most relevant paper of the lot is an article titled ‘</span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/8/1/73/5115468" rel="">Time series modeling of live-cell shape dynamics for image-based phenotypic profiling</a><strong>’. Here, they more directly show that the inclusion of temporal dynamics do improve a model’s ability to separate out the phenotypes of cells treated with one drug and cells treated with another</strong><span> </span><strong>drug.</strong><span> But…the actual result here is </span><strong>incredibly</strong><span> weak: the ‘improvement’ in accuracy is going from correctly predicting 5 out of the 6 drugs applied to a set of cells using fixed-cell methods, to 6 out of 6 drugs. Past that, with such a small sample size of drugs/conditions, it&#39;s difficult to conclude anything from here.</span></p><p><span>Yet, despite limited evidence supporting the value of cellular dynamics, I&#39;m going to take an unusually optimistic stance here: </span><strong>I strongly believe there is an immense amount of signal hidden in cell dynamics</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Most of the existing papers on the subject are extremely low sample in size, use human-interpretable features for dynamics (cell movement rates, contact time, etc), or don’t even use ML. Scaling up time-lapse microscopy and throwing sufficient-enough ML literally has never been done before</span><strong>. </strong><span>Cell dynamics is </span><strong>incredibly</strong><span> understudied, it’s very much </span><strong>one of those things in biology that everyone admits is probably really important, but there just was never a scalable way to study it</strong><span>. Until now!</span></p><p>There’s a really fun confluence of things going on here:</p><ol><li><p>ML has gotten really, really good over the last decade, making it so extracting manual features from cell videos isn’t necessary.</p></li><li><p>Live-cell brightfield imaging can be relied upon over fixed cell painting methods.</p></li><li><p>There is a 600 person, multi-billion dollar biopharmaceutical startup that is currently collecting petabytes of time-lapse cell-perturbation brightfield videos: Recursion Pharmaceuticals. </p></li></ol><p><span>Again, it’s an open question how useful time-lapse microscopy will be for the ultimate end goal of actually developing new drugs. Drug discovery is a graveyard of tools that sound really interesting, teach the field very cool things about biology, and ultimately end up doing nothing at all for the hard problem of making better drugs. Paying attention to the temporal dynamics of cells may very well be another entry to this graveyard: tells us a bit about some niche set of diseases, but nothing beyond that. </span><strong>But, regardless of what happens, I think the future here is enormously interesting.</strong></p><p><span>Let’s move on. Cell painting is equivalent to brightfield </span><strong>and</strong><span> brightfield may be even better because of the potential for time-lapse microscopy. What’s Recursion to do with all this information?</span></p><p><span>One of the immediate questions I had about the cell-painting to brightfield process wasn’t the science, but how </span><strong>logistically</strong><span> it even happened. Recursion is a platform company amongst platform companies — the cell painting assay is deeply tied to their science, their marketing, and everything about how they position themselves. Even if the science pointed towards brightfield being a good move, it would’ve been a massive undertaking for the behemoth of a startup to switch to it a decade into the game.</span></p><p><span>I talked to</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesjbaker/" rel=""> Charles Baker</a><span> about this! He&#39;s an automation-scientist-turned-VP at Recursion Pharmaceuticals who has worked there for six years and, crucially, was deeply involved in moving the company from cell painting to brightfield imaging.</span></p><p><span>He told me that the initial inklings that brightfield was sufficient actually came from an internal 2021 hackathon project,</span><a href="https://www.recursion.com/news/hack-week" rel=""> a yearly event at Recursion dubbed ‘Hack Week’.</a><span> There, a team demonstrated that brightfield images, when used as training data, gave similar results to cell painting. But what I found particularly interesting was that </span><strong>cell painting was still showing stronger signal than brightfield . </strong><span>The physical preprocessing that cell painting was doing still seemed meaningful, even if you relied on raw images as input. But there was something here, and Charles worked on exploring it further.</span></p><p><span>Biotechs often operate in a ‘</span><em>don’t fix it if it isn’t broken</em><span>’ mindset with regards to their primary assay (given how expensive any mistakes can be), so any attempt to modify that assay must be </span><strong>very</strong><span> de-risked. One of Charles&#39; concerns was that brightfield may be equivalent to cell painting in some settings, but not in others. </span><strong>In some permutation of cell lines, perturbation, and genetic knockout, chemical dyes may suddenly become important.</strong><span> Because of this, papers on the subject that came from outside of the company couldn’t be outright trusted, as Recursion operated on a scale of biology that very, very few other institutions did. More testing was necessary.</span></p><p><span>And they did exactly that, across thousands of experiments. They re-adapted their software to rely on brightfield, altered sections of their lab to accommodate it, tested out many different cell lines and perturbations. Eventually, they came across a conclusion first suggested by the hackathon: </span><strong>it didn’t seem like there are any areas where cell painting is uniquely superior</strong><span>. By early 2023, Recursion had started to use brightfield imaging in their normal workflows. And, by summer 2024, brightfield imaging was Recursion’s dominant imaging modality.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png" width="1456" height="563" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:563,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505e9695-cf9b-448a-8846-6da0389e8351_1456x563.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption><span>From</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brightfield-back-17th-century-cell-imaging-technique-92duc/" rel=""> here</a><span>, internal results produced by Recursion</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Why didn’t brightfield immediately match cell painting results in the original hackathon project?</strong><span> Charles had this to say: </span><em>“Hackathon projects aren’t a perfect thing. We needed more time spent training the model. We also benefited from capturing data in additional cell types to increase the diversity of the training data and allow the model to generalize. That data collection happened after Hack Week.&#34;.</em></p><p><strong>How hard was this?</strong><span> Surprisingly, pretty simple in Charles&#39; eyes. People were generally excited once the (very high) bar for equivalency had been met — it helps that brightfield is way nicer to run at scale than cell painting — so the whole transition process was a fair bit less painful than I had initially assumed it’d be.</span></p><p><strong>What happened to the millions of images and petabytes of cell painting data that Recursion had collected over the last decade?</strong><span> I asked Charles about this, and he said there are no plans to deprecate any of it. After all, it’s all really the same data, represented with a visually different modality, but information-wise the same. He did suggest the possibility that cell painting may still be relied upon in some cases. The two years of brightfield-testing that Recursion did couldn’t possibly cover every edge case, and there’s always the chance that there are some cell lines or perturbations that are insufficiently captured via brightfield. So their models will be taught with both modalities for now.</span></p><p><strong>Finally, I asked about something I’ve been harping on in this essay: is there much utility in the time-lapse microscopy unlocked via brightfield? </strong><span>Unfortunately, the answer is still hazy. Charles agreed that dynamics is understudied, that there’s a lot of new biology there, and that he’s excited about exploring it. But how it impacts drug discovery is still something to be determined. After all, the lag time for the value-add of these sorts of things are always incredibly long. For now, Recursion is imaging on a day-by-day level, which is more relevant for genetic perturbations than for chemical ones (where second-by-second imaging is more useful), and testing out how useful those coarse-grained videos are. He also said that even if dynamics turns out to not be useful, the move to brightfield imaging is still saving an enormous amount of money, time, and man-hours, so it’s still worth it.</span></p><p><strong>And…that wraps up this essay!</strong><span> It ended up being much longer than expected, but happy that I covered the subject in the detail I wanted.
