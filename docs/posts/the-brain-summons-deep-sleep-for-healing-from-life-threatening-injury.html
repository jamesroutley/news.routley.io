People who sleep poorly are at a higher risk of developing high blood pressure, for example, than are sound sleepers. But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02343-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02343-9" data-track-category="body text link">how cardiovascular disease affects sleep</a> has been less explored.</p><p>To learn more, the authors induced heart attacks in mice and investigated the animals’ brainwaves. The researchers found that these mice spent much more time in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02307-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02307-z" data-track-category="body text link">slow-wave sleep</a> — a stage of deep sleep that has been associated with healing — than did mice that hadn’t had a heart attack.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-03491-2/d41586-024-03491-2_24096670.jpg"/><p>Your brain could be controlling how sick you get — and how you recover</p></a></article><p>Next, the authors sought to understand what was causing that effect. One obvious place to look was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03936-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03936-0" data-track-category="body text link">the brain, which controls sleep</a>, notes McAlpine. After a heart attack, immune cells trigger a massive burst of inflammation in the heart, he says, and the researchers wondered whether these immune changes also occurred in the brain.</p><p>The team found that, after a mouse’s heart attack, immune cells called monocytes flooded its brain. These cells produced large amounts of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02657-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02657-2" data-track-category="body text link">a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which is an important regulator of inflammation</a> and also promotes sleep.</p><p>To confirm that these cells were linked to the increased sleep, researchers prevented monocytes from accumulating in the rodents’ brains. As a result, “the mice no longer had this increase in slow-wave sleep after their heart attack,” McAlpine says, supporting the theory that the influx of monocytes to the brain contributes to the post-heart-attack sleep boost. Similar experiments confirmed TNF’s role as a messenger to sleep-inducing brain cells.</p><h2>Slumbering towards recovery</h2><p>To understand the purpose of the extra sleep, the researchers repeatedly interrupted slow-wave sleep in mice that had had a heart attack. The team found that these mice had more inflammation in both the brain and the heart, and had a much worse prognosis than mice that were allowed to sleep undisturbed after a heart attack.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00675-0" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-03491-2/d41586-024-03491-2_24608560.jpg"/><p>How the brain senses a flu infection — and orders the body to rest</p></a></article><p>The authors also studied humans who had experienced <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/acute-coronary-syndromes#research-and-reviews" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/subjects/acute-coronary-syndromes#research-and-reviews" data-track-category="body text link">acute coronary syndrome</a>, a term for conditions, including heart attack, that are caused by a sudden reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle. Those who reported poor sleep in the weeks following such an episode had a higher risk of developing heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular problems over the next two years than did those who were good sleepers.</p><p>Given the findings, “clinicians need to inform patients of the importance of a good night’s sleep” after a heart attack, says Rowe. This should also be considered at the hospital, where tests and procedures would ideally be conducted during the daytime to minimize sleep interruptions.</p><p>She adds that the findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between sleep and the immune system. “When your grandma says, ‘if you don’t get enough sleep, you’ll get sick’, there’s a lot of truth to that.”</p>
