    <h1>Your air in my lungs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-astro-cid-5grsw2hi=""><span data-astro-cid-5grsw2hi="">Jan 23, 2024</span><p>It’s about 1%.</p>
<p>About 1/100th of all the air that I’m breathing in was recently in someone else’s lungs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-know">How I know</h2>
<p>I’ve recently been measuring the CO₂ levels in the Recurse Center’s space.
There are monitors on both floors I am able to read over Bluetooth, and I made <a href="https://github.com/nibrivia/RC-CO2-bot">a little bot</a> that messages out when the levels go above 1,000ppm.</p>
<p>There are broadly two reasons why you might be interested in doing this: COVID/airborne disease precautions, and trying to minimize <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.1104789">the cognitive effects of high CO₂ levels</a>.
Both are important to me, so this has been a fun project!</p>
<p>Anyways, this all got me wondering: <em>how much of the air that I’m breathing was recently in someone else’s lungs?</em></p>
<p>I really wanted a simple formula, so I looked up a few facts.
As of writing, the outside air is right around 420ppm of CO₂.
According to Wikipedia, human exhaust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing">around 40,000ppm CO₂</a>.</p>
<p>So, at 420ppm I’m breathing 0% of recently-in-your-lung air, at 40,000ppm I’m not breathing any other air.
That’s our formula:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" lang="python"><code><span><span>fraction_from_your_lungs </span><span>=</span><span> (co2_level </span><span>-</span><span> 420</span><span>) </span><span>/</span><span> 40000</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The levels in the space are usually between 700-1,200ppm, so my inhalation contains about 0.7%-2% of air from your lungs.</p>
<p>Alright, we’re done. You can take a deep breath now. In… and out…</p>
<p>Feel that? That’s air that was in someone else’s lung. You’re welcome.</p>
<h4 id="higher-order-effects">Higher-order effects</h4>
<p>There are some issues with this formula (what about re-breathing air? how do we really know about 40,000ppm for exhausted air?) but I don’t think that matters for relatively low CO₂ concentrations.
Higher CO₂ levels also run into “this will hurt you”, so I didn’t really focus on that…</p>
<p>If you want to do a more complex analysis of the matter, tell me about it! I’d love to read it :)</p></article></div>
