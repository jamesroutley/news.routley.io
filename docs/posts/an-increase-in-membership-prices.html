    <h1>An Increase in Membership Prices</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/07/commoncog_increase_membership_price.jpg" alt="An Increase in Membership Prices"><p>I&apos;ll be increasing membership prices from $150 a year to $250 a year on the 1st of August, about a month from now. This rounds to about $20 a month.</p><ul><li><strong>Old members will not be affected:</strong> you&apos;ll continue to pay whatever you were paying before.</li><li>If you&apos;d like to buy a membership at the old price, you should sign up before 1st August 2023!</li></ul><p>Commoncog is doubling down on the two topics that has been its mainstay for the past eight months or so: a) business expertise, and b) methods to accelerate the acquisition of that expertise.</p><p>I&apos;m increasing the prices to reflect the value of these two topics. From interviews I&apos;ve conducted over the past year, I know this publication is most valued by consultants, (certain types of!) investors, and executives. If I do things right, Commoncog should be able to help you accomplish more in your businesses and in your lives.</p><p>Increasing Commoncog&apos;s prices will select for people who are serious about getting good at business, whilst giving me more resources to invest in projects to accomplish just that.</p><p>I hope to talk about some of these projects in a bit.</p><p>Thank you for reading, and if you&apos;re a member: thank you for subscribing!</p>
