    <h1>Cloudflare have made it impossible for me to unsubscribe from marketing emails</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>This morning, I received a marketing email from Cloudflare (through one of our mailing groups), being militant about these kinds of emails, I immediately go to unsubscribe.<p>Dark pattern one: You must login to manage your marketing preferences. There&#39;s no security related emails here, so this is completely unnecessary.</p><p>Dark pattern two: &#34;...confirm your email address to save your communication preferences.&#34;. I&#39;ve no idea how we have a several-year old account without a confirmed email, but it should not have to confirm an email to remove old marketing preferences - or if cloudflare is so careful about this, why did it end up opted-in ion the first place?</p><p>Dark pattern two-point-five is that the email somehow became unverified - something it seems is only necessary to adjust marketing emails.</p><p>Okay, so I hit the &#34;Resend verification email&#34; link and check my inbox, nothing just yet. I wait a little longer. It&#39;s odd that I immediately got a security email about the login from a new IP, but I&#39;ve not received this verification email yet.</p><p>10 minutes later, and I&#39;ve still not got anything. I know these things <i>can</i> take longer, but I don&#39;t have the patience, especially since Cloudflare are clearly trying to make this hard.</p><p>Going to the preferences page, I hit that verify link again - still nothing. Okay, F12, I switch to the network inspector and click the link <i>again</i>.</p><p>To my surprise: Absolutely nothing. There&#39;s no network requests being initiated by this link. Maybe it&#39;s websockets, or maybe there&#39;s a script that failed to load? The UI does respond when I hit the link, but nothing else. I opened up the element inspector to find a click handler:</p><pre><code>  function () {
      return a.setState({
          toast: &#39;verificationResent&#39;
      })
  }

</code></pre>
That is certainly less than I was expecting. If that&#39;s just a react setState... this link is literally doing nothing other changing the UI when I press it. Perhaps some silly frontend developer reads that `toast` state elsewhere to trigger the real behaviour? Nope the only other reference to verificationResent is a ternary statement in the render function.<p>Dark pattern three: Just break unsubscribe. The cynic in me says this was intentional. Hanlon&#39;s razor tells me perhaps it is just a mistake, in which case dark pattern three is the overengineering of the unsubscribe function so you can get as much dropoff as possible and it&#39;s most convenient if it just breaks.</p><p>So wtf Cloudflare?</p><p>Oh, and to supplement dark pattern two: The verification check is only on the frontend. In the end, I was able to use the debugger to skip the verified check and edit &amp; submit my email preferences anyway.</p></div></div>
