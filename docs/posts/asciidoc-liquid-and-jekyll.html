    <h1>AsciiDoc, Liquid and Jekyll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>

<p>Feb 22, 2023</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I was giving a little update to my website and I needed a way
to create and inject custom HTML into some of my posts.</p>
<div title="Professor">

<p>Hehe, something tells me that you are talking about me and this cool chat!</p>
 </div>
<div title="Matt">

<p>Yeah... now let me talk a bit more about the website</p>
</div>
<p>My website is entirely statically generated, I’m specifically using Jekyll which
is a very well known static site generator. It is served through GitHub Pages
and I use Cloudflare to cache and route traffic to the GitHub page.</p>
<p>At the time I decided to go for Jeyll because I wanted to learn its internals
and because it seemed that it offered a lot of flexibility for technical blogs
like mine. Jekyll has a huge community and there are a lot of useful plugins to
integrate in the framework, one of my favorite is the AsciiDoc plugin.</p>
<p>For those of you that don’t know what <a href="https://asciidoc.org">AsciiDoc</a>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>AsciiDoc is a plain text markup language for writing technical content. It’s
packed with semantic elements and equipped with features to modularize and reuse
content. AsciiDoc content can be composed using a text editor, managed in a
version control system, and published to multiple output formats.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As you might guess, I am writing all my articles using AsciiDoc because it gives
me even more flexibility on top of what Jekyll already offers. If you want to
use AsciiDoc too you need to declare the plugin in the <code>_config.yml</code> of your
root directory</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>plugins</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>jekyll-asciidoc</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s see if Jekyll really is as flexible as I initially thought.</p>
<p>To create the chat section above I need to find a way to make Jekyll generate
HTML code from a specific syntax, there is really no other way around it in this
scenario because exploiting generated HTML classes and CSS is not really
feasible here, at least for me. Since I’m going to use these chat-like sections
a lot in the future, I would like to end up with a construct that is very
similar to common AsciiDoc syntax, to write the professor’s chat above I would
need to write something like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="asciidoc">[chat, professor]
--
Hehe, something tells me that you are talking about me and this cool chat!
--</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>For those of you that are familiar with AsciiDoc, this snippet might be
familiar. It’s an <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/">AsciiDoc
Block</a>. The above snippet would be the ideal final result, but let’s go ahead
and see what Jekyll offers out-of-the-box first.</p>
<p>Jekyll has a special feature that enables you to create custom components called
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">includes</a> which could be written in HTML and
you call/include them directly in your posts. To use this feature you just need
to</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Declare your HTML component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include the component in your post with a special syntax</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Every custom component that you whish to include in your post must live under
the <code>_includes</code> directory in your root Jekyll folder. I’m going to call mine
<code>chat.html</code> and it contains this HTML snippet</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;dialog {{ include.character }}&#34;</span> <span>title=</span><span>&#34;{{ include.character }}&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;dialog-head&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
        {% include character.svg %}
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;dialog-text&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
        {{ include.text | markdownify }}
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Matt">

<p>Before we continue, see those <code>{{ include ... }}</code> and <code>{% include ... %}</code>? That&#39;s <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid templating</a> syntax. With Jekyll you can make use of that pretty much everywhere in the project. For the moment, just consider each element in those bracket as a variable.</p>
</div>
<p>These components are HTML files that can contain whatever you’d like them to
contain.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;dialog {{ include.character }}&#34;</span> <span>title=</span><span>&#34;{{ include.character | capitalize }}&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This snippet is creating a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and also injecting <code>{{ include.character }}</code>
as its class, along with the title <code>{{ include.character }}</code></p>
<div title="Professor">

<p>That looks intuitive, are those variable that you can pass to the component? If so, how?</p>
</div>
<p>Remember that each element enclosed in <code>{% %}</code> and <code>{{ }}</code> is a variable? You
can pass those vars from the post in which you’d like to insert this custom
component, this is how it would look like in the post</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="markdown">{% include chat.html character=&#34;matt&#34; text=&#34;Hey there, here is some text in a chat!&#34; %}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is pretty straightforward, Jekyll is going to insert the HTML snippet in
the statically generated page and it will also populate the snippet with the
variables that you declared in the <code>include</code> construct.</p>
<p>This is the basic approach that you would go through to customize your Jekyll
website, what I did not tell you is that this is only going to work if you are
using the default Jekyll document language, which is Markdown. That’s unfortunate,
because I’ve transitioned every single post of my website to AsciiDoc just a
couple of months ago and I don’t plan to move back to Markdown just for this.</p>
<div title="Professor">

<p>What happens if we use the <code>include</code> syntax in AsciiDoc? Maybe we&#39;re lucky and it&#39;s going to work</p>
</div>
<p>AsciiDoc does not support Liquid syntax by default, so what’s going to happen is
that you’re going to find <code>{% include chat.html …​ %}</code> verbatim in your post,
just like this</p>
<p>{% include chat.html character=&#34;matt&#34; text=&#34;Hey there! We got a probelm here :(&#34; %}</p>
<p>Not a great start, especially because there are not a lot of similar scenarios
out there surprisingly, at least I couldn’t find that much by first googling the
problem. My
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75482246/how-can-i-render-html-using-liquid-in-asciidoc-in-jekyll">StackOverflow</a>
question didn’t receive any answers too, speak volumes since Jekyll and
AsciiDoc have a very big community.</p>
<p>I’m alone in this, let’s see if I can find something on GitHub.</p>
<p>The plugin that I’m using to generate HTML from AsciiDoc is
<a href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc">jekyll-asciidoc</a>, maybe we can
find something interesting in there. By making a project-wide search of the word
<code>liquid</code> I immediately get to this
<a href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc/blob/89b8f55f5312e4a0f1bca496bd9217d53d5b21dd/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/liquid.adoc">documentation
page</a> which is just what I am looking for, lucky me.</p>
<p>After reading the docs, it seems like all I need to do is enable Liquid
preprocessing by appending <code>:page-liquid:</code> at the top of my post. That is going
to parse and generate Liquid code before sending the result to the AsciiDoc
generator. Indeed, if we now add that tag at the top and reload the
page, we’re going to be presented with this</p>
<p>&lt;div class=&#34;dialog matt&#34; title=&#34;matt&#34;&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;dialog-head&#34;&gt;
&lt;svg&gt;…​…​&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;dialog-text&#34;&gt;Hey there! Finally we made
it! This chat that you’re reading is the generated and injected component!
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Almost there, now Liquid preprocessing correctly generates my custom HTML
component, but it’s not really injected in the page source. That is because the
Liquid preprocessor only generates the content, but when everything is passed to
the AsciiDoc generator it is interpreted as content text. If we really want to
inject that HTML code in the static page, we need a way to tell the AsciiDoc
generator that. This is a common feature of the language luckily, AsciiDoc lets
you inject raw HTML code in the page, you just need to wrap it in a <code>++++</code>
block. The final syntax we reached is this</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="asciidoc">++++
{% include chat.html character=&#34;matt&#34; text=&#34;Hey there! Finally we made it! This chat that you&#39;re reading is the generated and injected component!&#34; %}
++++</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s go through the entire generation process:</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="asciidoc">++++
&lt;div class=&#34;dialog matt&#34; title=&#34;matt&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;dialog-head&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg&gt;......&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;dialog-text&#34;&gt;
        Hey there! Finally we made it! This chat that you&#39;re reading is the generated and injected component!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
++++</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AsciiDoc generation (and HTML injection)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div title="Matt">

<p>Hey there! Finally we made it! This chat that you&#39;re reading is the generated and injected component!</p>
</div>
<p>Ok, we made some progress, we are now able to use the include feature Jekyll
offers to render custom HTML. But we’re far from the initial AsciiDoc-like
syntax that I wanted to achieve. Can we do better?</p>
<p>The greates feature of AsciiDoc probably is its Extension API, which makes the
language extremely powerful and extensible.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>An extension is a library that enriches the AsciiDoc content either by
introducing new syntax or weaving additional features into the output.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is what we need! It’s also a feature supported by the <code>jekyll-asciidoc</code>
plugin. What we could do is create a new extension that recognizes the <code>[chat]</code>
block by directly declaring a custom block <code>Asciidoctor::Extension</code>.</p>
<div title="Professor">

<p>But wait, AsciiDoc is written in Ruby, and you don&#39;t know Ruby!</p>
</div>
 <div title="Matt">

<p>I don&#39;t, but let&#39;s see if I can write something good enough for the job</p>
</div>
<p><code>jekyll-asciidoc</code>
<a href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc#enabling-asciidoctor-extensions">plugins
docs</a> will look for potential extensions by looking in the <code>_plugins</code> directory
of the Jekyll project, so that’s where our extension is going to be saved.
This is my <code>chat-extension.rb</code> file</p>

</div>
<p>That is looking really good and a lot less verbose than the initial Jekyll way,
if you inspect the page source you’re going to see that AsciiDoc now generates
the custom HTML code, as expected. The only issue that I have right now is that
the content of the block is not getting parsed since I’m just putting it into a
string variable and spitting it out in the HTML variable as-is, but that’s good enough
for what I need at the moment.</p>
<p>Hopefully you learned a little bit more about this topic which is not really a
big thing out there for some reason, it took me quite a lot of research to get
to this result. I guess that Ruby is the only thing blocking me from writing
more complex logic for this extension and others yet to come, but I am super
satisfied with the AsciiDoc switch, you can do literally everything you want
with the language if you start digging into the parsers and extensions.</p>
