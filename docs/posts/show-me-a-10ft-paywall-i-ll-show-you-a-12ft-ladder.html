    <h1>Show me a 10ft paywall, Iâ€™ll show you a 12ft ladder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What?</h3><p>Prepend <strong>12ft.io/</strong> to the URL of any paywalled page, and we&#39;ll try our best to remove the paywall and get you access to the article.</p><h3>Why?</h3><p>I believe Google Adwords killed the web. Google Adwords incentivized sites to peddle SEO optimized garbage. Sites who aren&#39;t are forced to optimize for email capture so they can market directly to you. Search results now show &#34;news&#34;, ads, and SEO spam instead of surfacing information.</p><p>You ought to be able to search something on Google and get an answer to your question without signing up for some newsletter. This is why I created <a href="https://12ft.io/">12ft.io</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>The idea is pretty simple, news sites want Google to index their content so it shows up in search results. So they don&#39;t show a paywall to the Google crawler. We benefit from this because the Google crawler will cache a copy of the site every time it crawls it.</p><p>All we do is show you that cached, unpaywalled version of the page.</p></div></div>
