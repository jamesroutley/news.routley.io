    <h1>Visualizing American inflation across eight categories</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> This interactive visualization explores how the value of the American dollar has changed from December 1999 to July 2023 across different categories. This visualization was developed using Chained Consumer Price Index data for U.S. City Averages from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/tools.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS). </p><p> The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is like a yardstick that helps us understand how much the cost of everyday things, like groceries or rent, has gone up or down over time. However, it doesn&#39;t tell us everything about how prices change because it doesn&#39;t include things like the prices of stocks or homes, which are also important parts of the economy. </p><p> The Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) is a more advanced version of CPI that takes into account how people might switch to different items when prices change, giving us a accurate picture of how inflation affects our spending. </p><p>For more technical definitions, here&#39;s are some relevant sections from the BLS&#39;s documentation:</p><div><div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 975.036 975.036"><path d="M925.036 57.197h-304c-27.6 0-50 22.4-50 50v304c0 27.601 22.4 50 50 50h145.5c-1.9 79.601-20.4 143.3-55.4 191.2-27.6 37.8-69.399 69.1-125.3 93.8-25.7 11.3-36.8 41.7-24.8 67.101l36 76c11.6 24.399 40.3 35.1 65.1 24.399 66.2-28.6 122.101-64.8 167.7-108.8 55.601-53.7 93.7-114.3 114.3-181.9 20.601-67.6 30.9-159.8 30.9-276.8v-239c0-27.599-22.401-50-50-50zM106.036 913.497c65.4-28.5 121-64.699 166.9-108.6 56.1-53.7 94.4-114.1 115-181.2 20.6-67.1 30.899-159.6 30.899-277.5v-239c0-27.6-22.399-50-50-50h-304c-27.6 0-50 22.4-50 50v304c0 27.601 22.4 50 50 50h145.5c-1.9 79.601-20.4 143.3-55.4 191.2-27.6 37.8-69.4 69.1-125.3 93.8-25.7 11.3-36.8 41.7-24.8 67.101l35.9 75.8c11.601 24.399 40.501 35.2 65.301 24.399z"></path></svg><div><!--[--><p> The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. </p><p> BLS has classified all expenditure items into more than 200 categories, arranged into eight major groups (food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services). </p><p> The C-CPI-U employs a formula that reflects the effect of substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices. </p><!--]--></div></div></div><p> We hope you found this visualization interesting and appreciate all of your support for PerThirtySix!
