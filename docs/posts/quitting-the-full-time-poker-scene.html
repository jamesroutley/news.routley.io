These days whenever I recount my past with new people, everyone inevitably asks me why I stopped playing the game (full time) if it was profitable to do so. Its understandably hard to comprehend why anybody would stop pursuing a money making endeavour. So, I want to write this post to summarily answer most questions around this topic and mostly because I am tired of repeating myself again and again.</p></div>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img src="https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/images/bhpsilverrounded/statusicon/user_offline.gif" alt="crazy_coyote166 is offline"/>

The hustle portion of getting good games where the odds of a higher pot win is better can be straining on oneself as well as their immediate family. Its hard to convince your wife that you are a professional poker player as the mindset is its gambling and you will loose all this in a couple of bad decisions.</p></div>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img src="https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/images/bhpsilverrounded/statusicon/user_offline.gif" alt="maddy42 is offline"/>

Along with other factors my primary factor was the toll it was taking on my mental and physical health. Been a decade I left it and now just occasionally play it with friends for small stakes just for fun. Won&#39;t say I don&#39;t miss those days but there is no way I am going back to them.
