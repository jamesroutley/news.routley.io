            <p><img src="https://collidingscopes.github.io/liquid-shape-distortions/assets/siteOGImage2.png"/></p><p>Create psychedelic art using liquid motion, distortion, shadows and light. This tool is free, and works in real-time in the browser.</p>
            <p>This project was inspired by drum &amp; bass / acid techno music, and 90s rave posters.</p>
            <p>Use this to create art for a music video, concert posters, stylized animations in creative projects, or simply to enjoy alongside some fine music.</p>

            <p>Controls / hotkeys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>üé≤: randomize all inputs [r]</li>
                <li>‚èØÔ∏è: pause/play the animation [space]</li>
                <li>üì∑: save a screenshot image [s]</li>
                <li>üé•: start and stop video export [v]</li>
                <li>üîä: start/stop music [m]</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Use the full control menu (top-right) to set a custom canvas size, adjust animation speed, control pattern and colours, etc...</p>
            <p>You can export your creation as an image or video afterwards.</p>
            <p>The animation is created with WebGL shaders, starting from a random seed position and mixing in elements of random noise (fractal brownian motion, 3D simplex noise), so each time you re-run it you&#39;re creating a unique piece of art.</p>
            <p>This tool is completely free, open source (MIT license), without any paywalls or premium options. You are welcome to use it for personal or commercial purposes.</p>
            <p>If you found this tool useful, feel free to buy me a coffee. My name is Alan, and I enjoy building open source software for art, animation, games, and more. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!</p>

            <p>If the video export feature does not work for you, please try a free screen-recording tool such as OBS Studio.</p>
  
            <p>This project is coded using webgl shaders, vanilla Javascript, HTML5 canvas, and CSS (<a href="https://github.com/collidingScopes/liquid-shape-distortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see github repo</a>). Video creation and encoding is done using mp4 muxer.</p>
            <p>The song used is Fahrenheit Fair Enough by Telefon Tel Aviv.</p>
