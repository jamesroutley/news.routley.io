    <h1>CSS Is Logical</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
									<div>
<ul>
<li>Documents flow in the direction of the writing mode.</li>



<li>Elements flow in block and inline directions.</li>



<li>The block and inline directions are based on the writing mode.</li>



<li>Relatively positioned elements have a reserved space in the document flow while absolutely positioned elements are pulled out of it.</li>



<li>Screens are measured in viewport units. </li>



<li>Parent elements are measured in container units.</li>



<li>Em and rem units evaluate relative to their elemental and root contexts.</li>



<li>Setting <code>z-index</code> creates a new stacking context for managing the way elements visually overlap one another.</li>



<li>The Cascade <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-c-in-css-the-cascade/" rel="noopener">organizes selectors</a> in prioritized layers that can be re-organized into customized Cascade Layers.</li>



<li>Selectors are evaluated by a specificity score.</li>



<li>The applied style when two selectors match is the one that appears lowest in the Cascade when they share the same origin.</li>



<li>If one property is invalid, the next matched property in a matching selector is used.</li>



<li><a href="https://geoffgraham.me/width-looks-outward-height-looks-inward/"><code>width</code> looks up the tree while <code>height</code> looks down the tree.</a></li>



<li>Specific properties can be declared based on whether or not a browser <code>@supports</code> it.</li>



<li>An element can be selected if it <code>:is()</code> a certain selector, is <code>:not()</code> a certain selector, <code>:has()</code> another element, or <code>:where()</code> it meets a certain condition.</li>
</ul>



<p>CSS be weird, but it not be illogical.</p>
