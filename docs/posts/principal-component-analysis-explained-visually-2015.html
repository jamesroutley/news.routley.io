      <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset.  It&#39;s often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.</p>
      
      <p>First, consider a dataset in only two dimensions, like (height, weight). This dataset can be plotted as points in a plane. But if we want to tease out variation, PCA finds a new coordinate system in which every point has a new (x,y) value. The axes don&#39;t actually mean anything physical; they&#39;re combinations of height and weight called &#34;principal components&#34; that are chosen to give one axes lots of variation.</p>
      <p>Drag the points around in the following visualization to see PC coordinate system adjusts.</p>

        <p>PCA is useful for eliminating dimensions. Below, we&#39;ve plotted the data along a pair of lines: one composed of the x-values and another of the y-values.</p>
        <p>If we&#39;re going to only see the data along one dimension, though, it might be better to make that dimension the principal component with most variation. We don&#39;t lose much by dropping <span>PC2 </span>since it contributes the least to the variation in the data set.</p>

      <p>With three dimensions, PCA is more useful, because it&#39;s hard to see through a cloud of data. In the example below, the original data are plotted in 3D, but you can project the data into 2D through a transformation no different than finding a camera angle: rotate the axes to find the best angle. To see the &#34;official&#34; PCA transformation, click the &#34;Show PCA&#34; button. The PCA transformation ensures that the horizontal axis PC1 has the most variation, the vertical axis PC2 the second-most, and a third axis PC3 the least. Obviously, PC3 is the one we drop.</p>

      <div><p><small>Original example from Mark Richardson&#39;s class notes <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/richardsonm/SignalProcPCA.pdf">Principal Component Analysis</a></small></p><p>What if our data have way more than 3-dimensions? Like, <b>17</b> dimensions?! In the table is the average consumption of 17 types of food in grams per person per week for every country in the UK. </p>
        <p>The table shows some interesting variations across different food types, but overall differences aren&#39;t so notable. Let&#39;s see if PCA can eliminate dimensions to emphasize how countries differ.</p>

      <p>Here&#39;s the plot of the data along the first principal component. Already we can see something is different about Northern Ireland.</p>
      
      <p>Now, see the first and second principal components, we see Northern Ireland a major outlier. Once we go back and look at the data in the table, this makes sense: the Northern Irish eat way more grams of fresh potatoes and way fewer of fresh fruits, cheese, fish and alcoholic drinks. It&#39;s a good sign that structure we&#39;ve visualized reflects a big fact of real-world geography: Northern Ireland is the only of the four countries not on the island of Great Britain. (If you&#39;re confused about the differences among England, the UK and Great Britain, see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10">this video</a>.)</p></section>
