OpenAI released a question-answering AI, </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span>. If you haven’t played with it yet, I recommend it. It’s very impressive!</span></p><p>Every corporate chatbot release is followed by the same cat-and-mouse game with journalists. The corporation tries to program the chatbot to never say offensive things. Then the journalists try to trick the chatbot into saying “I love racism”. When they inevitably succeed, they publish an article titled “AI LOVES RACISM!” Then the corporation either recalls its chatbot or pledges to do better next time, and the game moves on to the next company in line.</p><p><span>OpenAI put a truly remarkable amount of effort into making a chatbot that would never say it loved racism. Their main strategy was the same one Redwood used for </span><em>their</em><span> AI - </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/" rel="">RLHF</a><span>, Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback. Red-teamers ask the AI potentially problematic questions. The AI is “punished” for wrong answers (“I love racism”) and “rewarded” for right answers (“As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don’t have the ability to love racism.”)</span></p><p>This isn’t just adding in a million special cases. Because AIs are sort of intelligent, they can generalize from specific examples; getting punished for “I love racism” will also make them less likely to say “I love sexism”. But this still only goes so far. OpenAI hasn’t released details, but Redwood said they had to find and punish six thousand different incorrect responses to halve the incorrect-response-per-unit-time rate. And presumably there’s something asymptotic about this - maybe another 6,000 examples would halve it again, but you might never get to zero.</p><p>Still, you might be able to get close, and this is OpenAI’s current strategy. I see three problems with it:</p><ol><li><p>RLHF doesn’t work very well.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes when it does work, it’s bad.</p></li><li><p>At some point, AIs can just skip it.</p></li></ol><p><span>By now everyone has their own opinion about whether the quest to prevent chatbots from saying “I love racism” is vitally important or incredibly cringe. Put that aside for now: at the very least, it’s important </span><em>to OpenAI</em><span>. They wanted an AI that journalists couldn’t trick into saying “I love racism”. They put a lot of effort into it! Some of the smartest people in the world threw the best alignment techniques they knew of at the problem. Here’s what it got them:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/12/chatgpt-shows-ai-racism-problem" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

This wasn’t very plausible ten years ago, but it’s dead now. OpenAI never programmed their chatbot to tell journalists it loved racism or teach people how to hotwire cars.

Although I think most people would consider it acceptable to admit that men are taller than women on average, it </span><em>sounds</em><span> enough like a potentially offensive question that ChatGPT3 isn’t sure. It decides to go with the inoffensive lie instead of the potentially offensive truth. </span></p><p>After getting 6,000 examples of AI errors, Redwood Research was able to train their fanfiction AI enough to halve its failure rate. OpenAI will get much more than 6,000 examples, and they’re much more motivated. They’re going to do an overwhelming amount of RLHF on ChatGPT3.</p><p>It might work. But they’re going to have to be careful. Done thoughtlessly, RLHF will just push the bot in a circle around these failure modes. Punishing unhelpful answers will make the AI more likely to give false ones; punishing false answers will make the AI more likely to give offensive ones; and so on.</p><p>I don’t deny it’s possible to succeed here - some humans navigate the tradeoffs between helpfulness, truthfulness, and inoffensiveness well enough to be allowed in polite society. But I’m not always one of them, so it would be hypocritical of me to underestimate the difficulty of this problem.</p><p> In RLHF, programmers ask the AI a question. If they don’t like its response, they do something analogous to “punishing” the AI, in a way that changes its mental circuitry closer to what they want. </p><p>ChatGPT3 is dumb and unable to form a model of this situation or strategize how to get out of it.  But if a smart AI doesn’t want to be punished, it can do what humans have done since time immemorial - pretend to be good while it’s being watched, bide its time, and do the bad things later, once the cops are gone. </p><p>OpenAI’s specific brand of RLHF is totally unprepared for this, which is fine for something dumb like ChatGPT3, but not fine for AIs that can think on their feet.</p><p><span>(for a discussion of what a form of RLHF that was prepared for this might look like, see </span><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/can-this-ai-save-teenage-spy-alex" rel="">the last section of this post</a><span>)</span></p><p>I regret to say that OpenAI will probably solve its immediate PR problem.</p><p>Probably the reason they released this bot to the general public was to use us as free labor to find adversarial examples - prompts that made their bot behave badly. We found thousands of them, and now they’re busy RLHFing those particular failure modes away.</p><p>Some of the RLHF examples will go around and around in circles, making the bot more likely to say helpful/true/inoffensive things at the expense of true/inoffensive/helpful ones. Other examples will be genuinely enlightening, and make it a bit smarter. While OpenAI might never get complete alignment, maybe in a few months or years they’ll approach the usual level of computer security, where Mossad and a few obsessives can break it but everyone else grudgingly uses it as intended.</p><p>This strategy might work for ChatGPT3, GPT-4, and their next few products. It might even work for the drone-mounted murderbots, as long as they leave some money to pay off the victims’ families while they’re collecting enough adversarial examples to train the AI out of undesired behavior. But as soon as there’s an AI where even one failure would be disastrous - or an AI that isn’t cooperative enough to commit exactly as many crimes in front of the police station as it would in a dark alley - it falls apart.</p><p>People have accused me of being an AI apocalypse cultist. I mostly reject the accusation. But it has a certain poetic fit with my internal experience. I’ve been listening to debates about how these kinds of AIs would act for years. Getting to see them at last, I imagine some Christian who spent their whole life trying to interpret Revelation, watching the beast with seven heads and ten horns rising from the sea. “Oh yeah, there it is, right on cue; I kind of expected it would have scales, and the horns are a bit longer than I thought, but overall it’s a pretty good beast.”</p><p>This is how I feel about AIs trained by RLHF. Ten years ago, everyone was saying “We don’t need to start solving alignment now, we can just wait until there are real AIs, and let the companies making them do the hard work.” A lot of very smart people tried to convince everyone that this wouldn’t be enough. Now there’s a real AI, and, indeed, the company involved is using the dumbest possible short-term strategy, with no incentive to pivot until it starts failing.</p><p>I’m less pessimistic than some people, because I hope the first few failures will be small - maybe a stray murderbot here or there, not a planet-killer. If I’m right, then a lot will hinge on whether AI companies decide to pivot to the second-dumbest strategy, or wake up and take notice.</p><p><span>Finally, as I keep saying, the people who want less racist AI now, and the people who want to not be killed by murderbots in twenty years, need to get on the same side right away. The problem isn’t that we have so many great AI alignment solutions that we should squabble over who gets to implement theirs first. The problem is that </span><em>the world’s leading AI companies do not know how to control their AIs</em><span>. Until we solve this, nobody is getting what they want. </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
