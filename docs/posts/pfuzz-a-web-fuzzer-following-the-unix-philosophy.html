  <section><p>I use my phone a lot. Its the best for consuming media on the go sort of things, like reading, watching videos etc. Always on, always connected, ready to whip out in a moments notice!</p>
<p>I also hate using my phone for anything else: for a long time the reasons have eluded me, but this time I have a lead – I <strong>hate</strong> typing on my phone.</p>
<p>Obviously there are more fundamental problems here than those solved by <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/">strapping on a keyboard</a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, explained so well by this quote from <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/of-mice-and-men/">99% Percent invisible episode</a> about Douglas Englebart -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consumer market prioritizes simple and “user-friendly” devices over more complex and “learnable” devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They elaborate further</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Englebart used to compare the sleek, simplified Apple products to a tricycle. You don’t need any special training to operate a tricycle, and that’s fine if you’re just going to go around the block. If you’re trying to go up a hill or go a long distance, you want a real bike. The kind with gears and brakes– the kind that takes time to learn how to steer and balance on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, I got to try a <a href="https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/2022-06-20-introducing-mnt-pocket-reform.html">pocket reform</a>. For the uninitiated, its a 7” pocket sized (arguably, depending on what kind of pockets you have) computer. It is a nifty little device with a lot of cool factor, including a compact mechanical keyboard and more or less running blob free software stack!</p>
<p>This got me thinking: <em>Is it worthwhile to compromise extreme portability to gain learnability and configuration?</em></p>
<p>A device like pocket reform is not going to be as good as my phone for quickly reading through my reading list, at least not out of the box. Would I still prefer to stick with my phone? Obviously the answer is going to personal and subjective, but I believe its worthwhile to try!</p>
<p>Pocket reforms are currently only sold through the crown supply store in US, so I decided to wait until MNT starts selling them from their EU store, and spent the waiting time maybe hacking alternatives a bit – Can I strap a <a href="https://www.solder.party/docs/bbq20kbd/">Blackberry Keyboard</a> to my phone? <a href="https://postmarketos.org/">Running mainline linux</a> with the stack you are used to seems fun etc etc. Honestly, I needed some deliberation before dropping a cool grand on an experiment.</p>
<p>Also, after going through bit of internet searching, the options are not as limited as I thought; there are bunch of manufactures trying to make devices in this form factor: GPD seems to be the most popular, there are <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-pocket-laptop.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.search.0">also no-name products</a> with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39013008">at least one very happy HN reader</a>.</p>
<p>This nerdary also led me discover <strong>“Cyberdecks”</strong>. I have not read Neuromancer so I don’t know what makes something a cyberdeck; but the community seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year">building some of the coolest portable computing</a> out there. Definitely check it out if you were living under a rock like me!</p>
