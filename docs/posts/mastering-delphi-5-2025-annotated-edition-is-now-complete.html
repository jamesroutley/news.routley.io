    <h1>Mastering Delphi 5 2025 Annotated Edition Is Now Complete</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I&#39;ve now completed the review of the 2025 Annotated Edition of Mastering Delphi 5.</p><div>
<p xmlns:gxi="http://geode.it/gxi/2.0/">As I <a href="https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2025-february-mastering-delphi5-annotated.html">announced on February 14</a>, I&#39;ve been creating a free to download edition of my classic &#34;Mastering Delphi 5&#34; with footnotes indicating what is different today. The new edition is now <strong>complete</strong>. You can find it for download at <a href="https://www.marcocantu.com/md52025/">www.marcocantu.com/md52025/</a>.</p>
<p xmlns:gxi="http://geode.it/gxi/2.0/">The final annotated edition is <strong>1,139 pages</strong> and it has<strong> 475 footnotes</strong>, plus dozen of new screen snapshots comparing the old the the new UI of the IDE, and in some cases of the running applications. Not everything in the original source code compiles, but most of the programs run untouched, which is almost incredible given the 25 years since that edition.</p>
<p xmlns:gxi="http://geode.it/gxi/2.0/">I hope you like it, it&#39;s nice a read and you can probably read something on today&#39;s Delphi, but even if you know everything it&#39;s an interesting way to go down the memory lane, for those who&#39;ve been using Delphi since that time.</p>
<p xmlns:gxi="http://geode.it/gxi/2.0/">As mentioned, this is my present to the community for Delphi&#39;s 30th anniversary, we celebrated recently.</p>
