<p>Matt Bahner, the proud creator of the cube is open to sell his creation. The previous record, <a href="https://ruwix.com/blog/33x33x33-rubiks-cube/">the 33x33 cube</a> by Greg&#39;s Puzzles was also available for sale in 2017 for $15.200. To put this intor perspective, the mass-produced 17x17x17 by Yuxin costs roughly $750.</p>

The cube was fairly large and made out of wood, with corners that were cut down due to the size of the object. It was here where Rubik realised he couldn’t actually solve what he had created, and spent a month figuring out how to do so.</p>

<h3>The 2x2, 4x4 And 5x5 Are Invented</h3>
<p>One year after the original 3x3x3 Rubik&#39;s Cube was released in 1980, the <a href="https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/2x2x2-rubiks-cube-pocket/">2x2x2 Rubik&#39;s Cube</a>, also known as the Pocket Cube, was invented by Ernő Rubik. It was designed as a simpler and more accessible version of the classic puzzle cube, featuring fewer layers and a smaller size,  retaining the <strong>same principles of twisting and turning</strong> to align colors on each face but with a reduced complexity compared to its larger counterpart.</p>
<img src="https://ruwix.com/pics/puzzles/5x5/2x2-4x4-5x5-rubiks-cube.JPG" alt="2x2x2 cube"/>
<p>The same year, Péter Sebestény invented the <a href="https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/4x4x4-rubiks-cube-rubiks-revenge/">4x4 Rubik&#39;s Revenge</a>, which was on the verge of being named &#34;Sebestény&#34; after its creator. However, a last-minute decision altered the name to appeal to fans of the original cube.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/5x5x5-rubiks-cube-professors-cube/">5x5 Professor&#39;s Cube</a> variant was invented by Udo Krell in the same year, <strong>reaching the limit for conventional mechanisms</strong></p>

<h3>V-Cube 6</h3>
<p><img src="https://ruwix.com/pics/nxnxn/v-cube-6-pillowed.jpg" alt="V-Cube 6"/><span>Developed by Panagiotis Verdes, the <a href="https://www.v-cubes.com/products/v-classics/v-cube-6-layered-cube-6x6x6">V-Cube 6</a> was the first mass-produced <a href="https://cube-solver.com/#id=6">6x6x6 big cube</a>, introducing a new level of complexity and challenge to cubing enthusiasts. Produced by the Greek company V-Cube, this innovative puzzle expanded upon the success of its predecessors, offering cubers an even larger grid to solve. With its smooth mechanism and high-quality construction, the V-Cube 6 quickly gained popularity among puzzle solvers worldwide, further enriching the diverse landscape of twisty puzzles. The puzzle is currently available in both pillowed and flat face designs.</span></p>
