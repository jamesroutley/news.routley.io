    <h1>Our $100M Series B</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="content"><p>We don’t want to bury the lede:  we have raised a $100M Series B, led by a new
strategic partner in <a href="https://usitfund.com/">USIT</a> with participation from all
existing Oxide investors.  To put that number in perspective: over the nearly
six year lifetime of the company, we have raised $89M; our $100M Series B more
than doubles our total capital raised to date — and positions us to make
Oxide the generational company that we have always aspired it to be.</p><p>If this aspiration seems heady now, it seemed absolutely outlandish when we
were first raising venture capital in 2019.  Our thesis was that cloud
computing was the future of all computing; that running on-premises would
remain (or become!) strategically important for many; that the entire stack — hardware <em>and</em> software — needed to be rethought from first principles to
serve this market; and that a large, durable, public company could be built by
whomever pulled it off.</p><p>This scope wasn’t immediately clear to all potential investors, some of whom
seemed to latch on to one aspect or another without understanding the whole.
Their objections were revealing: &#34;We know you can build this,&#34; began more than
one venture capitalist (at which we bit our tongue; were we not properly
explaining what we intended to build?!), &#34;but we don’t think that there is a
market.&#34;</p><p>Entrepreneurs must become accustomed to rejection, but this flavor was
particularly frustrating because it was exactly backwards: we felt that there
was in fact substantial technical risk in the enormity of the task we put
before ourselves — but we also knew that if we <strong>could</strong> build it (a huge if!)
there was a huge market, desperate for cloud computing on-premises.</p><p>Fortunately, in <a href="https://eclipse.capital/">Eclipse Ventures</a> we found investors
who <a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/deep-tech-investing">saw
what we saw</a>:  that the most important products come when we co-design
hardware and software together, and that the on-premises market was sick of
being told that they either don’t exist or that they don’t deserve modernity.
These bold investors — like the customers we sought to serve — had been
waiting for this company to come along; we raised seed capital, and started
building.</p><div><ul><li><p>We did
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/the-power-of-proto-boards">our
own board designs</a>, allowing for essential system foundation like a true
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/lpc55s69-tzpreset">hardware root-of-trust</a> and
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/how-oxide-cuts-data-center-power-consumption-in-half">end-to-end
power observability</a>.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/hubris-and-humility">our own microcontroller
operating system</a>, and used it to
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oxidecomputer_is-the-oxide-service-processor-a-bmc-faq-activity-7346915711233007617-s9Az">replace the traditional BMC</a>.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0241">our own platform enablement
software</a>, eliminating the traditional UEFI BIOS and its accompanying
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/new-uefi-vulnerabilities-send-firmware-devs-across-an-entire-ecosystem-scrambling/">flotilla
of vulnerabilities</a>.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0026">our own host hypervisor</a>, assuring
an integrated and seamless user experience — and eliminating the need for a
third-party hypervisor and its concomitant
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/moores-scofflaws">rapacious software licensing</a>.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0058">our own switch</a> — and
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dendrite">our own switch runtime</a> — eliminating entire universes of integration complexity and operational
nightmares.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0177">our own integrated storage
service</a>, allowing the rack-scale system to have reliable, available, durable,
elastic instance storage without necessitating a dependency on a third party.</p></li><li><p>We did
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/docs/control-plane-architecture.adoc">our
own control plane</a>, a sophisticated distributed system building on the
foundation of our hardware and software components to deliver the API-driven
services that modernity demands: elastic compute, virtual networking, and
virtual storage.</p></li></ul></div><p>While these technological components are each very important (and each
is in service to specific customer problems when deploying infrastructure
on-premises), the objective
is the product, not its parts.  The journey to a product was long, but we ticked
off the milestones.
We got the boards brought up.
We got the switch transiting packets.
We got the control plane working.
We got the rack manufactured.
We passed FCC compliance.</p><p>And finally, two years ago, we shipped our first system!</p><p>Shortly thereafter, more milestones of the variety you can only get after
shipping:  our first update of the software in the field; our first
update-delivered performance improvements; our first customer-requested
features added as part of an update.</p><p>Customers started landing faster now: enterprise sales cycles are infamously
long, but we were finding that we were going from first conversations to a
delivered product surprisingly quickly.  The quickening pace always seemed to
be due in some way to our transparency:  new customers were listeners to
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm">our podcast</a>, or they had read
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/">our RFDs</a>, or they had perused
<a href="https://docs.oxide.computer/">our documentation</a>, or they had looked at
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer">the source code itself</a>.</p><p>With growing customer enthusiasm, we were increasingly getting questions
about what it would look like to buy a large number of Oxide racks.  Could we
manufacture them?  Could we support them?  Could we make them easy to
operate together?</p><p>Into this excitement, a new potential investor, USIT, got to know us.  They
asked terrific questions, and we found a shared disposition towards building
lasting value and doing it the right way.  We learned more about them, too,
and especially USIT’s founder,
<a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/thomas-tull/">Thomas Tull</a>.  The more
we each learned about the other, the more there was to like.  And importantly,
USIT had the vision for us that we had for ourselves:  that there was a big,
important market here — and that it was uniquely served by Oxide.</p><p>We are elated to announce this new, exciting phase of the company.  It’s not
necessarily in our nature to celebrate fundraising, but this is a big
milestone, because it will allow us to address our customers&#39; most pressing
questions around scale (manufacturing scale, system scale, operations scale)
and roadmap scope.  We have always believed in
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0002">our mission</a>, but this raise gives
us a new sense of confidence when we say it: we’re going to kick butt, have
fun, not cheat (of course!), love our customers — and <strong>change computing
forever</strong>.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
