<p>Looks fake, doesn’t it?  This implausible Medieval forest of towers, as dense as Manhattan skyscrapers, is our best reconstruction of the town of Bologna at its height, toward the end of the Medieval Guelph-Ghibelline wars. We don’t see many such towers today… or think we don’t, but actually their remnants are all over Italy.</p>
<p>Often when in Florence one sees buildings like this, where one section is rough stone standing out amid stucco neighbors.</p>

Many tourists walk along and the buildings are all shops and eateries. In the center, conspicuous between buildings of yellow or beige stucco, is one building made of crude-looking yellowish stone, very rough and undecorated, with few windows and all small compared to its neighbors. A couple doors down, a second conspicuous stone section like this sticks up, also strangely blank and rough amid its yellow neighbors. Both stop about half a story above the roofs of the three-story buildings on either side of them." width="1100" height="1467" srcset="https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-1100x1467.jpg 1100w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-1200x1600.jpg 1200w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-220x293.jpg 220w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-400x533.jpg 400w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-660x880.jpg 660w, https://www.exurbe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6075-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"/></p>
<p>These are actually the bottom nubs of Medieval stone towers. The town of San Gimigniano (below) is famous for having several still intact. Wealthy families built these as mini-fortresses within the city, where they could defend against riots, enemy families (think Montagues and Capulets) and invasion:</p>

<p>Signs of wealth and prestige, these all-stone buildings were also fireproof, leading to a terrible but effective tactic: take your family, treasures &amp; goods up into your tower then set fire to enemies’ homes and let the city burn around you while you sit safe above. This was VERY BAD for cities.</p>

<p>After many disasters, Florence’s solution was to BAN private buildings over a certain height, forcing everyone who had a tower to knock the top off down to regulation height, leaving these recognizable stone nubs all around the city. This round one below is the oldest (now a restaurant).</p>

<p>My favorite tower stub is this one, in Via dei Cerchi. I lived on the top floor for a year as a grad student, up 111 steps! I had calves of steel by spring, but the views from the top looked like someone had put a poster of Florence on the wall except it was a window!</p>

<p>Only city buildings were allowed to exceed the mandated height, which is why Florence’s skyline is now all special buildings: monastery bell towers, the cathedral &amp; baptistery, Orsanmichele the city’s granary (tall to keep grain away from water &amp; mice), the seat of government, and one special guy…</p>

<p>The tower on the right here is part of Bargello, the prison &amp; police fortress, but it didn’t start that way. It was built by a private family, who sold it to the city when the law banning towers was passed, and the city incorporated it into their prison fort.</p>

<p>What did Florence look like back when it had all its towers? Its long-time ally across the mountains Bologna is famous for still having two intact towers, but in the Middle Ages Bologna was known as the City of 100 Towers because so many families built them. The reconstructions look absolutely incredible. Florence didn’t have so many but did have dozens, so the richest part of the city center would have looked much like this.  Much to the despair of the city fire brigade!</p>

<p>So, whether in a film or on the street, if you ever see a historic Italian city and walk along a block where for some reason one chunk of wall is stone and all the others smooth, you’re probably looking at a relic of the faction feuds that Guido Ruggiero aptly calls “The Italian 300 Years’ War.”</p>
