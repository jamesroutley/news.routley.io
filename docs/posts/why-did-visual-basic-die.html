    <h1>Ask HN: Why did Visual Basic die?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been a software developer for almost 30 years. 
 I remember using VB back in the 90&#39;s and I was thinking about it the other day and it dawned on me; despite all the advances in technology since then, nothing I have found compares to that development experience today.  I would go so far as to say we&#39;ve gone backwards in a big way.</p><p>Now, I&#39;m no fan of Microsoft products but, I have yet to find a tool that can allow me to be as productive in so short a time as Visual Basic.  Yet I can&#39;t help wondering what problems it had that caused them to abandon it?  Moreover, why hasn&#39;t someone come out with a solid replacement?</p></div></div></div>
