    <h1>Google removed my Yubikeys from a Google account &#39;just to be safe&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>It&#39;s boxing day and I&#39;m at home trying to look at some old youtube videos on an old google account. I accidentally stumble into the world&#39;s worst security flow instead.</p>
<p>Opening youtube&#39;s creator studio caused the account to be logged out and I got stuck on an error page.
That&#39;s a bit odd, but I guess I can log back in.</p>
<p>I logged back in, used my security key, and was then forced to reset my password and greeted with this message:</p>
<p><img src="https://lunnova.dev/articles/google-just-to-be-safe/./lockout-1.png" alt="&#34;Just to be safe, we&#39;ve done the following: Reverted Gmail settings changed recently&#34;"/></p>
<p>I visited my gmail settings and discovered a forwarding rule I&#39;d had setup for a few years had been removed.</p>
<p>I visited the youtube creator studio and then got logged out again, and forced to reset my password again.</p>
<p>This time it got worse.</p>
<p><img src="https://lunnova.dev/articles/google-just-to-be-safe/./lockout-2.png" alt="&#34;Just to be safe, we&#39;ve done the following: Removed 2-step verification, Removed Security Keys, Reverted Gmail settings changed recently&#34;"/></p>
<p>Removing physical U2F keys from an account without request seems to be the worst possible reaction to suspicious activity.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t be visiting youtube creator studio for a third time. I anticipate the result will be something like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just to be safe, we&#39;ve done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dispatched a kill team to your home address</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As google has no support channels I can use, my only recourse is to write this blog post and hope someone sees it.</p>
