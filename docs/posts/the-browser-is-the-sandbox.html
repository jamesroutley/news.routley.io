    <h1>The browser is the sandbox</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong><a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/">the browser is the sandbox</a></strong>. Paul Kinlan is a web platform developer advocate at Google and recently turned his attention to coding agents. He quickly identified the importance of a robust sandbox for agents to operate in and put together these detailed notes on how the web browser can help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about the browser. Over the last 30 years, we have built a sandbox specifically designed to run incredibly hostile, untrusted code from anywhere on the web, the instant a user taps a URL. [...]</p>
<p>Could you build something like Cowork in the browser? Maybe. To find out, I built a demo called <a href="http://co-do.xyz">Co-do</a> that tests this hypothesis. In this post I want to discuss the research I&#39;ve done to see how far we can get, and determine if the browser&#39;s ability to run untrusted code is useful (and good enough) for enabling software to do more for us directly on our computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul then describes how the three key aspects of a sandbox - filesystem, network access and safe code execution - can be handled by browser technologies: the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access">File System Access API</a> (still Chrome-only as far as I can tell), CSP headers with <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> and WebAssembly in Web Workers.</p>
<p>Co-do is a very interesting demo that illustrates all of these ideas in a single application:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Co-do application interface with robot logo. Left sidebar shows WORKSPACE section with &#34;Select Folder&#34; button, &#34;Selected folder: blog-drafts (Live updates enabled)&#34; in green text, and FILES list including gtr-t5-large.md, chatgpt.md, llm-digest-october-2..., weeknotes-2024-04-23..., lmarena-april-2025.md, weeknotes-chatgpt-fo..., tests-not-optional-c..., weeknotes-13-mar-202..., issue-for-notes.md, workshop-git-scrapin.... Main chat area shows user message &#34;Three most recently edited files?&#34; in orange bubble, &#34;Using 26 tools...&#34; dropdown, and AI response: &#34;Now I need to get the metadata for these files to find the most recently edited ones. Since there are many files, let me get metadata for a sample of them to find the recent ones:Based on the metadata I&#39;ve gathered, the three most recently edited files are:&#34; followed by table with columns File and Last Modified showing predictions-2026.md (Jan 8, 2026), december-2025.md (Jan 2, 2026), gemini-3-flash.md (Dec 17, 2025). Green &#34;Response complete&#34; banner at bottom with input field placeholder &#34;Ask me to help with your files...&#34; and notice &#34;File contents are sent to your selected AI provider&#34;." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codo.jpg"/></p>
<p>You select a folder full of files and configure an LLM provider and set an API key, Co-do then uses CSP-approved API calls to interact with that provider and provides a chat interface with tools for interacting with those files. It does indeed feel similar to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/">Claude Cowork</a> but without running a multi-GB local container to provide the sandbox.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint about <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> remains how thinly documented it is, especially across different browsers. Paul&#39;s post has all sorts of useful details on that which I&#39;ve not encountered elsewhere, including a complex <a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/#the-double-iframe-technique">double-iframe technique</a> to help apply network rules to the inner of the two frames.</p>
<p>Thanks to this post I also learned about the <code>&lt;input type=&#34;file&#34; webkitdirectory&gt;</code> tag which turns out to work on Firefox, Safari <em>and</em> Chrome and allows a browser read-only access to a full directory of files at once. I had Claude knock up a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/webkitdirectory">webkitdirectory demo</a> to try it out and I&#39;ll certainly be using it for projects in the future.</p>
