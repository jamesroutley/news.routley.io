      <p>The developers of Servo are starting 2024 by going all in. </p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://mstdn.io/@codewiz/111868362077005163?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Bernie Innocenti</a> when he was visiting <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">FOSDEM 2024</a>, the Servo Project team were there showing off the work done so far.</p><figure><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/02/Servo_a-1.jpg" alt="a photo showing a servo project member presenting servo&#39;s journey so far" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1278" srcset="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Servo_a-1.jpg 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Servo_a-1.jpg 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Servo_a-1.jpg 1600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/02/Servo_a-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Pic Credits: </span><a href="https://mstdn.io/@codewiz/111868362077005163?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer"><span>Bernie Innocenti</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>That got me wondering; <strong>What&#39;s the progress with Servo nowadays?</strong> ðŸ¤”</p><p>If you were not familiar, <a href="https://servo.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Servo</a> is <strong>an experimental browser engine</strong> that leverages the power of Rust to provide a memory-safe and modular experience that is highly adaptable.</p><p>After Mozilla created Servo back in 2012 as a research project, it saw its share of ups and downs over the years, with it <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/mozilla-servo-web-engine/" rel="noreferrer">making a comeback</a> in 2023; thanks to a fresh approach by the developers on how Servo should move forward.</p><p>Even though there are plenty of <a href="https://itsfoss.com/open-source-browsers-linux/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">open source Chrome alternatives</a>; With this, there&#39;s a chance that we will get some really cool options based on Servo that just might give Blink and Gecko a run for the money! ðŸ˜ƒ</p><p>Let&#39;s see how The Servo Project has fared so far, and what&#39;s in store for it in 2024.</p><div><p>ðŸ“‹</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Blink</a> is used by Chromium, and other browsers based on it, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Gecko</a> is used by Firefox and a few others.</p></div><h2 id="servo-what-to-expect">Servo: What to Expect?</h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lkIX5ryZZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Servo Web Rendering Engine Reboot - Manuel Rego, Igalia"></iframe></figure><p>Just a few months back, in September 2023, after The Servo Project <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2023/09/07/The-Servo-project-is-joining-Linux-Foundation-Europe.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">officially joined</a> Linux Foundation Europe, the existing contributors from <a href="https://www.igalia.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Igalia</a> stepped up their game by taking over the project maintenance.</p><p>To complement that, at Open Source Summit Europe last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/regocas?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Manuel Rego</a> from Igalia shared some really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lkIX5ryZZ4&amp;ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">useful insights</a> when he presented.</p><p>He showcased stuff like the <strong>WebGL support</strong>, <strong>cross-platform support</strong> including <strong>mobile support</strong> for Android and Linux, among other things. </p><p>They have experimented with Servo for embedded applications use-cases (like running it on Raspberry Pi), and have plans to make advances on it. As far as I can see, it looks like, Servo is faster for Raspberry Pi compared to Chromium ðŸ¤©</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDqDrvxLxyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Servo On Raspberry Pi"></iframe></figure><p>You can explore more such demos on <a href="https://demo.servo.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Servo&#39;s demo webpage</a>.</p><p>Not to forget, a new layout engine is also in the works, where new features and compatibility arrangements are being made within its development.</p><p><strong>Did you know that even though Mozilla dropped the experimental project, Firefox still utilizes some servo components in the browser? </strong>ðŸ˜‰</p><p>Naturally, that makes us wonder if the newer Servo layout engine (or any other component) might make it into the Firefox (<em>never say never!</em>).</p><p>Back then, Servo was still considered experimental, and in 2024, I hope that progresses a bit further.</p><p>Seeing this is an independent project, <strong>the progress so far looks very promising</strong>, the official website <a href="https://servo.org/about/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">now lists</a> an updated roadmap for 2024 that pretty much has the same things for all of 2024.</p><figure><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/02/Servo_b.png" alt="a screenshot of the 2024 roadmap for servo" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="449" srcset="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Servo_b.png 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Servo_b.png 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Servo_b.png 1600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/02/Servo_b.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>There&#39;s <strong>project maintenance and outreach</strong> that will include the usual project maintenance tasks alongside community management, then there&#39;s the <strong>implementation of CSS support</strong> which will see work being done on providing basic CSS features for the Servo layout engine.</p><p>With <strong>embedding API definition</strong>, the Servo team will finish work on defining the Servo webview API in collaboration with <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Tauri</a> while also implementing new features and requirements for the API.</p><p>And, finally, we have <strong>Initial Android support</strong>, that will see Servo being made to build on modern Android versions, with the developers publishing nightly APKs on the official website some time in the future.</p><p>For staying in sync with the Servo roadmap, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">official roadmap</a>, and for more details regarding this project, you may head over to its <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">GitHub repo</a> or its official <a href="https://servo.zulipchat.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Zulip chat</a>.</p><p><em>ðŸ’¬ What do you think of Servo?
