<p>It&#39;s been five years since the end of <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, 
 the longest time I can remember in which I haven&#39;t drawn cartoons. 
 <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> was a wonderful experience, but it was an 
 all-consuming career. When I quit the strip, I put my cartoons in 
 boxes, and jumped into other interests. I haven&#39;t really considered 
 the strip since, so at the invitation to do this show, I thought 
 it might be time to look back at some of my work. 

</p><p>My first reaction in going through my old cartoons was some 
 amazement at the size and weight of the pile. For most successful 
 comic strips, ten years is just a drop in the bucket, but even that 
 amount of time yields a huge amount of material. It&#39;s no wonder 
 that decade seems like a blur. 

</p><p>Going through my old strips is sort of like looking at old 
 photographs of myself: they&#39;re personal and familiar, yet somewhat 
 bizarre at the same time. There are cartoons I&#39;ve drawn that are 
 the equivalent of pictures of my younger self wearing yellow 
 pants: I know I&#39;m responsible for that, but what on earth was I 
 thinking? As my tastes have changed, and as I&#39;ve learned more, I 
 imagine that I would do many strips quite differently today. Not 
 better necessarily, but certainly differently. I was twenty-eight 
 when <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> was first published, and, of course, I would 
 make other choices now at age forty-three. 

</p><p>It&#39;s also sort of strange to see a record of my own learning 
 curve. Pick up a given strip, and I see how I struggled with 
 various writing and drawing problems, or how I finally surmounted 
 one. I remember sometimes feeling that the strip was better written 
 than I could actually write, and better drawn than I could actually 
 draw. I learned a great deal over the years by trying to push the 
 strip beyond my own abilities, and I&#39;m very proud that <i>Calvin and 
 Hobbes</i> explored and developed all the way to the end. By the final 
 years, I see naturalness or a sense of inevitability to the drawing 
 and writing that is very satisfying. 


</p><p>I&#39;m more appreciative of this kind of grace since returning to 
 the awkward stages of new learning curves. Of course, I&#39;d also say 
 the times have caught up with some of my strips. It&#39;s frankly a 
 little discouraging to see how ordinary some of them look now. When 
 <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> first appeared, it was somewhat surprising to 
 treat reality as subjective, and to draw a strip with multiple 
 viewpoints, juxtaposing Calvin&#39;s vision with what others saw. I did  
 this simply as a way to put the reader in Calvin&#39;s head and to 
 reveal his imaginative personality. Now these juxtapositions are a 
 visual game for many comic strips, and after all these years, I 
 suspect readers know where this sort of joke is headed as soon as 
 they see it. The novelty cannot be recaptured. 

</p><p>Novelty, however, is probably overrated anyway. The <i>Calvin and 
 Hobbes</i> strips that hold up best, to my eye anyway, are the ones 
 where the characters seem big, vivid, and full of life, and where 
 the strip&#39;s world seems genuine and inviting. Punchlines come and 
 go, but something in the friendship between Calvin and Hobbes seems  
 to hold a small piece of truth. Expressing something real and 
 honest is, for me, the joy and the importance of cartooning. 

</p><p>The Sunday strips were usually the cartoons I had the most fun 
 with, and for this show I&#39;ve chosen a few Sunday strips from each 
 year that I think show off the strip&#39;s strengths. 

</p><p>I have fond memories of reading the Sunday comics when I was a 
 kid. As far as I was concerned, the Sunday comics were the whole 
 reason for newspapers to exist. On weekdays, I read only the strips 
 I liked; but on Sundays, I read them all, and often several times. 
 The Sunday comics were always the most fun to look at, so when I 
 finally got the chance to draw my own comic strip, I knew I wanted 
 to make the Sunday Calvin and Hobbes something special. It took me 
 a little while to learn to use the larger Sunday space effectively. 
 It requires a somewhat different pace for the humor, and, of 
 course, a big color panel is no place to find out that you don&#39;t 
 know how to draw the back of your character&#39;s head. The Sunday 
 strip shows off both strengths and weaknesses. 

</p><p>Occasionally I would see that an idea I&#39;d written for a Sunday 
 strip was not as substantial as I&#39;d hoped it would be, and I&#39;d 
 realize that some of the panels and dialogue weren&#39;t adding 
 anything significant to the story. If that were the case, I&#39;d 
 remove everything extraneous and use the trimmed idea for a daily 
 strip instead. I held the Sundays to a different standard: any idea 
 for the Sunday strip had to need the extra space. I felt a Sunday 
 strip should do something that was impossible the rest of the week. 

</p><p>Over the years, I learned that daily strips are better suited for 
 certain kinds of ideas, while Sunday strips are better for others. 
 The daily strip is quick and to the point, perfect for a simple 
 observation, or a short exchange between characters. Daily strips 
 are also better for long stories, where a certain suspense can be 
 fostered by continuing the story day after day, and the reader can 
 remember what happened previously. 

</p><p>Extended conversations with real back and forth dialogue, however, 
 don&#39;t work very well in four tiny panels - the dialogue balloons 
 crowd out the drawings and the strip loses its grace. In a Sunday 
 strip, you can spread out, and let the characters yap a bit. This 
 is often funny in itself, and it&#39;s a wonderful way to let the 
 characters&#39; personalities emerge. It also lets you explore a topic 
 a bit more fully. 

</p><p>You can talk about things without reducing them to one-liners 
 right away. And, of course, in today&#39;s minuscule comics, if an idea 
 requires any real drawing, the Sunday strip is the only possible 
 place for it. Likewise, any complex storytelling problem-a strip 
 illustrating a long expanse of time, for example, or an event 
 depicted in a succession of very tiny moments-is futile in the 
 daily format. Calvin&#39;s fantasies generally migrated to the Sunday 
 page for this reason. 

</p><p>In short, the Sunday page offered unique opportunities, and I 
 deliberately tried to come up with ideas that could take advantage 
 of them. 

</p><p>I usually wrote the Sunday strips separately from the dailies. 
 For the daily strips, I tried to write an entire month&#39;s worth of 
 ideas before inking any of them. This allowed a long period for 
 editing and rewriting. I was less able to do this for the Sunday 
 strips because the Sundays need to be drawn weeks further in 
 advance and because the strips took so much longer to draw. If at 
 all possible, however, I would try to keep two or three Sunday 
 ideas ahead of the deadlines. I always wanted to reserve the option 
 of abandoning an idea that didn&#39;t stand up to a few weeks of 
 scrutiny. 

</p><p>For those who are interested in technical matters, the early 
 strips were drawn on any cheap pad of Bristol board the local art 
 supply store happened to stock. The paper was usually rather thin 
 and sometimes the sheet wouldn&#39;t accept the ink consistently (bad 
 sizing or something), which would make drawing aggravating and time 
 consuming. Eventually I switched to heavier Strathmore Bristol 
 board, which was much nicer. I used a 2H pencil to rough in the 
 drawing, and then inked with a small sable brush and India ink. I 
 did as little pencil work as possible in order to keep the inking 
 more spontaneous, although the more elaborate panels required more 
 preliminary drawing. For lettering, I used a Rapidograph cartridge 
 pen. I drew the dialogue balloons and a few odds and ends with a 
 crow quill pen. To cover up unwanted marks, I used various brands 
 of Wite-Out, and in the early days, typewriter correction fluid. 
 (Remember typewriters?) No doubt this stuff will eat through the 
 paper or turn green in a few years, but as the original cartoons 
 were intended for reproduction, not picture frames and gallery 
 walls, I did not overly concern myself with archival issues or, for 
 that matter, neatness. At some point along the way, however, I did 
 ask the syndicate to send the printers a quality reproduction of 
 the Sunday cartoon, rather than the original drawing, in order to 
 reduce the amount of tape, registration marks, and general 
 crunchings and manglings to which the drawings had previously been 
 subjected. 

</p><p>Coloring the strips was a slow and tedious process. My 
 syndicate gave me a printed sheet showing numbered squares of color, 
 each a mixture of various percentages of red, yellow, and blue. 
 Using this sheet as a guide, I taped some tracing paper over the 
 finished cartoon, and painted watercolor approximations of the 
 available colors in the areas I wanted. This would give me a very 
 rough idea of what the newspaper version might look like. Then I 
 numbered each little spot of color. As the Sunday strips became 
 more visually complex, and as I started to use color more 
 deliberately for effects, this process became a real chore. These 
 days, I believe much of it can be done with a few clicks of a mouse. 

</p><p>Colors take on different characteristics when placed next to 
 other colors (a neutral-seeming gray might look greenish and dark 
 next to one color, but brownish and pale in relation to another). 
 Because of this, I came up with one little trick for coloring the 
 strip. I cut out each of the color squares provided by the printer, 
 so I had a stack of colors (like paint chips), rather than a sheet. 
 By laying out the cut squares and physically placing one color next 
 to the others I expected to use, I could see exactly how each color 
 behaved in that particular context. As I got better at this, I was 
 able to choose approprial &#34;palettes&#34; for each strip, and create 
 moods with color. One strip might call for contrasting, bright 
 colors; another strip might be done with a limited group of soft, 
 warm colors; another idea might call for a close range of grays and 
 darks, and so on. If I made Calvin&#39;s skin a dull pink-gray to 
 suggest dim lighting at night, I would have to find a dull 
 yellow-gray that would suggest his hair in the same light. These 
 challenges took an inordinate amount of time for work on deadline, 
 but I was often quite proud of the results. A comic strip should 
 always be fun to look at, and good use of color can contribute to 
 that appeal More than that, color creates its own emotional impact, 
 which can make the drawing more expressive. 

</p><p>The half-page Sunday format required certain guaranteed panel 
 divisions. The strip had to be drawn in three rows of equal height, 
 and there was one unmovable panel division within each row. This 
 allowed editors to reduce and reconfigure the strip to suit their 
 particular space needs. The same strip could run in several shapes 
 by restacking the panels. 

</p><p>Editors commonly removed the entire top row altogether, so in 
 essence, a third of the strip had to be wasted on &#34;throwaway 
 panels&#34; that many readers would never see. The fixed panel divisions 
 were also annoying because they limited my ability to compose the 
 strip to best suit the idea. For example, they often forced a small 
 panel where I needed more space for words. 

</p><p>Of course, a big part of cartooning is learning to work 
 effectively within tight space constraints. Much of cartooning&#39;s 
 power comes from its ability to do more with less: when the 
 drawings and ideas are distilled to their essences, the result can 
 be more beautiful and powerful for having eliminated the clutter. 
 That said, there is a point at which simplification thwarts good 
 storytelling. You can&#39;t condense Moby Dick into a paragraph and get 
 the same effect. Over the years, my frustration increased and I 
 became convinced that I could draw a better comic strip than the 
 current newspaper format was permitting. Looking at examples of 
 comics from the 1930s, when a Sunday strip could fill an entire 
 page, I was amazed by the long-forgotten possibilities out there. 

</p><p>I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally 
 draining fight to prevent <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> from being 
 merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the 
 duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday 
 format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and 
 delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as 
 an unbreakable half page (more space than I&#39;d dared to ask for), 
 despite the expected resistance of editors. 

</p><p>To this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the 
 new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the 
 larger strip, but I think it&#39;s fair to say that this was not the 
 most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for 
 numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks 
 of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate 
 suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid 
 newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. Another strip 
 could then run vertically down the side. Consequently, while some 
 papers, primarily in larger markets, ran the strip as a half page, 
 other papers reduced it. In some of the latter papers (including 
 the one I read at the time), I actually lost ground: the new Sunday 
 strip was printed even smaller than before. I was in no mood to 
 take on new fights, so I focused on the bright side: I had complete 
 freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations. 

</p><p>For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors, I remain 
 convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better 
 product and made the comics section more fun for readers. Comics 
 are a visual medium. A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting 
 and add some variety. Proud as I am that I was able to draw a 
 larger strip, I don&#39;t expect to see it happen again any time soon. 
 In the newspaper business, space is money, and I suspect most 
 editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost. 
 Sadly, the situation is a vicious circle: because there&#39;s no room 
 for better artwork, the comics are simply drawn; because they&#39;re 
 simply drawn, why should they have more room? 

</p><p>Business controversies aside, the new format opened up new ways 
 to tell stories, and I drew different kinds of strips as a result. 
 I could write and draw the strip exactly as I imagined it, so it 
 truly challenged my abilities. Whereas Sunday strips had previously 
 taken me a full day to draw and color, a complex strip would now 
 take me well into a second day to finish. Deadlines discourage this 
 kind of indulgence, and I had to steal that extra time from what 
 would have been some semblance of an ordinary life, but I was 
 thrilled to expand the strip&#39;s world. 

</p><p>Laying out the panels became a job in itself, now that I was no 
 longer confined to horizontal rows. could place boxes anywhere and 
 any size, but the reader&#39;s eye needs to flow naturally to the 
 proper panels without confusion, and big panels need to be designed 
 in such a way that they don&#39;t divert attention and spoil surprises. 
 The graphic needs of each panel must be accommodated and the panels 
 themselves should form a pleasing arrangement so the entire page is 
 attractive, balanced, and unified as well. Here again I looked for 
 guidance in the gorgeous Sunday pages of George Herriman&#39;s <i>Krazy Kat.</i>
 
</p><p>The new Sunday format necessitated a change in the format of my 
 book collections as well. Having won a bigger strip in newspapers, 
 I wanted the book reproductions to reflect the strip&#39;s new impact 
 as much as possible by printing the Sunday strips large. This 
 resulted in the rather awkward horizontal format of my later books. 
 They stick out of bookshelves, but the strips look nice. From this 
 point on, the Sunday strips were reproduced in color with each 
 collection, not just in the &#34;treasury&#34; collections, as before. 
 (Here&#39;s a piece of trivia: because of the timing of the book format 
 change, the cartoons from the <i>Snow Goons</i> collection were 
 never put in a treasury book, so those Sunday strips have been 
 reprinted only in black-and-white.)
 
</p><p>Ten years after starting <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I ended the 
 strip. As much as I knew I&#39;d miss the characters, the decision was 
 long anticipated on my part. Professionally, I had accomplished far 
 more than I&#39;d ever set out to do and there were no more mountains I 
 wanted to climb. Creatively, my interests were shifting away from 
 cartooning toward painting, where I could develop my drawing skills 
 further. And personally, I wanted to restore some balance to my 
 life. I had given the strip all my time and energy for a decade 
 (and was happy to do so), but now I was that much older and I 
 wanted to work at a more thoughtful pace, out of the limelight, and 
 without the pressures and restrictions of newspapers. 

</p><p>The final Calvin and Hobbes strip was a Sunday strip. The 
 deadline for Sunday strips being early, I drew it well before 
 writing the daily strips that would eventually precede it in the 
 newspaper. I very much wanted to hit the right note for this final 
 strip. I think it worked, but it was a bittersweet strip to draw. 

</p><p>Since <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I&#39;ve been teaching myself how to 
 paint, and trying to learn something about music. I have no 
 background in either subject, and there are certainly days when I 
 wonder what made me trade proficiency and understanding in one 
 field for clumsiness and ignorance in these others. On better 
 days, I enjoy having so many new challenges and surprises. Even so, 
 these new endeavors have only deepened my appreciation for comics. 
 I no longer take quite so much for granted the versatility of 
 comics and their ability to depict complex ideas in a beautiful, 
 accessible, and entertaining form. For all their seeming simplicity, 
 the expressive possibilities of comics rival those of any other art 
 form. Five years after <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, I love the comics 
 as much as ever.
