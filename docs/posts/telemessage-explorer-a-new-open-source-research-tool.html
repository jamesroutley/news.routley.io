                <section>
                    <p>I&#39;ve spent the last week or two writing code to make sense of the <a href="https://micahflee.com/ddosecrets-publishes-410-gb-of-heap-dumps-hacked-from-telemessages-archive-server/" rel="noreferrer">massive hack</a> of data from TeleMessage, the <a href="https://micahflee.com/how-the-knock-off-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials-got-hacked-in-20-minutes/" rel="noreferrer">comically insecure</a> company that makes a modified Signal app that Trump&#39;s former national security advisor Mike Waltz was caught using. I&#39;ve decided to <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/telemessage-explorer" rel="noreferrer">publish my code</a> as open source in the hopes that other journalists will use it to find revelations in this dataset.</p><p>While the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/telemessage-explorer" rel="noreferrer">source code</a> for TeleMessage Explorer is public, it requires the <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/article/telemessage" rel="noreferrer">TeleMessage dataset</a> to use it. DDoSecrets is distributing this dataset to journalists and researchers with a history of reporting who agree to publish their findings. Contact DDoSecrets (not me) to request access.</p><p>In this post, I explain how journalists who have access to the dataset can crunch the TeleMessage data and then explore it using TeleMessage Explorer. I also show a bunch of screenshots from the tool showing TeleMessage data, and I describe some details I found out about one 24-year-old (today is his birthday!) White House staffer bro who has Signal messages in this dataset.</p><p>I used this tool myself to publish my recent post, <a href="https://micahflee.com/telemessage-customers-include-dc-police-andreesen-horowitz-jp-morgan-and-hundreds-more/" rel="noreferrer">TeleMessage customers include DC Police, Andreessen Horowitz, JP Morgan, and hundreds more</a>. Reuters has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hacker-who-breached-communications-app-used-by-trump-aide-stole-data-across-us-2025-05-21/" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> on this dataset too, and I know plenty of other journalists and newsrooms currently have access to it.</p>

<div><p>ðŸ’¡</p><p>TeleMessage Explorer is unpolished software. I built it initially just for my own use. I don&#39;t promise to maintain it, fix bugs, or anything else. If your newsroom wants help working with it, or wants specific features implemented or anything like that, <a href="https://micahflee.com/contact/" rel="noreferrer">contact me</a> and I might be interested in consulting.</p></div><h2 id="like-blueleaks-explorer-before-it">Like BlueLeaks Explorer before it</h2><p>Back in 2020, in the middle of the Black Lives Matter uprising, someone hacked hundreds of law enforcement websites and exfiltrated about 270 GB of data. That dataset, called <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/article/blueleaks" rel="noreferrer">BlueLeaks</a> (it&#39;s completely public for everyone to download from DDoSecrets), is full of evidence of police misconduct. I wrote a tool called <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/blueleaks-explorer" rel="noreferrer">BlueLeaks Explorer</a> to help me dig into it and write articles.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until 2024, when I published my book <a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/" rel="noreferrer">Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data</a>, that I decided to release BlueLeaks Explorer as open source, basically as an education tool. At this point, the BlueLeaks data was years old.</p><p>I still think there are tons of revelations in BlueLeaks that even today no one has found, because no one has looked, but at this point it&#39;s all old news. If you want to dig into secret 2020-era docs from your local police intelligence agency yourself, I recommend reading my book (which is available for free <a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/contents.html" rel="noreferrer">online</a>, though I&#39;d appreciate if you <a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/buy.html" rel="noreferrer">buy</a> a copy), and particularly these chapters:</p><ul><li><a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/chapter-9.html">Chapter 9: BlueLeaks, Black Lives Matter, and the CSV File Format</a></li><li><a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/chapter-10.html" rel="noreferrer">Chapter 10: BlueLeaks Explorer</a></li></ul><p>I&#39;m hoping that by releasing TeleMessage Explorer right now, a lot of good journalists will use it to find a lot of good stories while the data is still fresh.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Since most journalists I know are Mac users, I&#39;ll show you how to get started using macOS.</p><p>Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need:</p><ul><li>Access to the <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/article/telemessage" rel="noreferrer">TeleMesage dataset</a> from DDoSecrets, with <code>telemessage.7z</code> downloaded.</li><li>About 530 GB of free space. You can do this on your internal disk or on a USB disk. If you use a USB disk, I highly recommend using an SSD.</li><li>Comfort with <a href="https://hacksandleaks.com/chapter-3.html" rel="noreferrer">running commands</a> in the the terminal.</li></ul><p>Here&#39;s the software that you&#39;ll need to install:</p><ul><li>You need Docker. You can <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" rel="noreferrer">download Docker Desktop here</a>. (Because Docker the company is kind of annoying, it will try to get you to login to an account, but you can skip this, you don&#39;t actually need an account to use it.)</li><li>You&#39;ll also need Python and Poetry installed. If you use <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="noreferrer">Homebrew</a>, you can install these with: <code>brew install python3 poetry</code></li></ul><p>You&#39;ll also need a copy of the TeleMessage Explorer code itself. You can either run <code>git clone https://github.com/micahflee/telemessage-explorer.git</code> or download the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/telemessage-explorer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" rel="noreferrer">zip file</a> of the code from GitHub.</p><p>Download <code>telemessage.7z</code> from DDoSecrets. This is 54 GB. Then, extract it. If you&#39;re not familiar with 7-zip files, one way to extract it is to install 7-zip (<code>brew install 7zip</code>), and then you can extract it like <code>7zz e telemessage.7z</code>.</p><p>After extracting, you&#39;ll get a folder with 2,729 heap dump files, taking up 384 GB of space. These files will be called <code>heapdump</code>, <code>heapdump.1</code>, <code>heapdump.2</code>, ..., <code>heapdump.2728</code>.</p><p>My code expects all files to have a number at the end, so in your terminal, change to the folder with the heap dump files and rename <code>heapdump</code> to <code>heapdump.0</code>:</p><pre><code>mv heapdump heapdump.0</code></pre><p>Most of the data in these heap dump files isn&#39;t relevant. All TeleMessage Explorer cares about are the JSON objects in the heap dumps, and the easiest way to cut out the useless parts is by using <code>strings</code>. Run the following command to loop through all heap dump files and for each file, run <code>strings</code> on it and output it to the same filename but with the <code>.strings</code> extension:</p><pre><code>for F in $(ls); do echo $F; strings $F &gt; ${F}.strings; done</code></pre><p>This takes awhile to run. But at the end, you&#39;ll have an additional 83 GB of just text data.</p><h2 id="how-the-code-is-organized">How the code is organized</h2><p>There are four components to TeleMessage explorer:</p><ul><li>The backend is programmed in Python and Flask. It&#39;s a simple API, used by the frontend, to access data from the database.</li><li>The frontend is programmed in TypeScript and uses Vue.js. It&#39;s pulls data from the backend using its API.</li><li>The database is PostgreSQL, and you run it in Docker.</li><li>Finally, the &#34;cruncher&#34; part of the code will read all of the heap dump strings files, search for relevant JSON objects, and insert them into the database. I call this &#34;crunching the data.&#34;</li></ul><p>You&#39;ll start the backend, frontend, and database as containers using Docker Compose. Go ahead and build the containers right now by running:</p><pre><code>docker compose build</code></pre><p>You&#39;ll crunch the data by running the cruncher Python script. You&#39;ll need the database Docker container up to do that though.</p><h2 id="crunch-the-data">Crunch the data</h2><p>Make sure Docker is running on your computer. Change to the <code>telemessage-explorer</code> folder with the source code and run this command to start the database container:</p><pre><code>docker compose up db</code></pre><p>This should start the <code>db</code> container. Note that it stores its data in the <code>volumes/db-data</code> folder.</p><p>Once that database is running, open a new terminal window. Switch to the cruncher folder:</p><pre><code>cd cruncher</code></pre><p>Install the Poetry dependencies:</p><pre><code>poetry install</code></pre><p>Now you can use the <code>crunch</code> script like this:</p><pre><code>$ poetry run crunch --help
Usage: crunch [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --path DIRECTORY       Path to folder with heap dump .strings files
                         [required]
  --num-threads INTEGER  Number of threads to run
  --num-skip INTEGER     Skip the first N heap dumps
  --help                 Show this message and exit.</code></pre><p>When you crunch the data, you must include <code>--path</code> with the path to the folder with the <code>.strings</code> files you created.</p><p>If you want, you can pass in <code>--num-threads</code> to choose how many threads you want the cruncher to use (by default, it uses one the number of CPU cores you have available).</p><p>Before crunching data, you need to set some environment variables to tell the cruncher how to connect to the database:</p><pre><code>export DB_NAME=db
export DB_USER=db
export DB_PASSWORD=db
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=54320</code></pre><p>Finally, crunch the data like this, replacing the path with the location of the strings files you created above:</p><pre><code>poetry run crunch --path ~/datasets/2025-TeleMessage/strings</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s what it should look like:</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/05/crunching_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><p>As you can see in the video, on my Mac the cruncher is using 8 threads, meaning that it&#39;s crunching 8 heap dump files at a time. When it&#39;s done with each file, it shows some output explaining how many of which different types of JSON objects it&#39;s looking for that it found, as well as the overall progress.</p><p>It will probably take your computer a few hours to finish crunching the data. But at the end, you&#39;ll have a PostgreSQL database full of data from the heap dump files.</p><h2 id="the-database">The database</h2><p>After crunching the data, you&#39;ll have a PostgreSQL database full of messages, groups, users, attachments, validations, and various join tables. As long as the database container is running, you can connect to it using <code>psql</code> or any other PostgreSQL client.</p><p>In the following screenshot, I ran a query (using TablePlus) that selected everything from all groups, joined them with the number of messages and users in each group, and sorted them by the groups with the most messages.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-2.25.03-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1276" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-2.25.03-PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-2.25.03-PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-2.25.03-PM.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-2.25.03-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>The crunched data in a PostgreSQL database</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I started coding this, at fist I only planned on inserting relevant data into a database.

So, I made one.</p><h2 id="telemessage-explorer">TeleMessage Explorer</h2><p>In your terminal window that&#39;s running Docker Compose, press Ctrl-C to quit the database container.

}</code></pre><p>Just like I searched groups for &#34;signal&#34;, you can also use TeleMessage Explorer to search and filter users and message. </p><p>For example, here&#39;s a screenshot of me simply searching the messages for the word &#34;trump&#34;:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.46.56-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1392" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.46.56-PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.46.56-PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.46.56-PM.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.46.56-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>Searching messages for &#34;trump&#34;.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, there are some duplicates in here. And also as you can see, at least for some customers, TeleMessage collects SMS messages. The bottom two messages says:</p><blockquote>Unbelievable: MAGA calls for boycott of Costco for taking a stand against Trump Do you have a Costco membership? Y/N: go.demturnout.io/l/uq1Dxy DT Stop2End</blockquote><p>This is Democratic Party SMS spam, getting collected by TeleMessage.</p><p>Some of the messages include attachments that can be downloaded. Here&#39;s a WhatsApp message that includes an attachment:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.54.58-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1392" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.54.58-PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.54.58-PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.54.58-PM.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-25-at-3.54.58-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>Message with an attachment.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the JSON object part, the attachment is Base64-encoded, and included directly in the JSON object that was extracted from the heap dump. For messages that have this sort of attachment, TeleMessage Explorer has a download button, which Base64-decodes the attachment and then saves it for you.</p><p>This attachment is a screenshot from a Bloomberg article about Saudi Arabia and OPEC+, taken on an iPhone, which also happens to be connected to a 5G network and is tethering internet.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/untitled.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="738" height="1600" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/untitled.jpeg 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/untitled.jpeg 738w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Attachment extracted from a message.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, at the bottom of my <a href="https://micahflee.com/telemessage-customers-include-dc-police-andreesen-horowitz-jp-morgan-and-hundreds-more/" rel="noreferrer">recent post</a> that describes hundreds of TeleMessage customers, I explained that I found OAuth2 validation objects in the data, and I used those to make a list of customers.</p><p>You can explore these validation objects in TeleMessage Explorer at the Validations nav link at the top.

The <code>who</code> part is &#34;White House Office,&#34; and the <code>eop</code> part is &#34;Executive Office of the President.&#34;</p><p>I spent some time digging into this particular person based on his work phone number, work email address, and his name, all of which I found in this dataset.</p><p>I haven&#39;t yet found anything egregious, but here are some of the interesting highlights:</p><ul><li>He&#39;s a member of the &#34;POTUS | ROME-VATICAN | PRESS GC&#34; Signal group.</li><li>He&#39;s a young white conservative man.</li><li>Last August, before Trump&#39;s inauguration, he posted on LinkedIn that he was starting a position at Donald J. Trump For President 2024, Inc.</li><li>Also according to LinkedIn, he got his bachelor degree from the University of Alabama in 2024.</li><li>I found him on Tinder, and it included his birthday. He was born in 2001, and today is his birthday! He just turned 24.</li><li>Someone with his same username has logged 680 hours of Fortnite.</li><li>His Venmo transactions are open, lol.</li></ul><p><em>If you found this interesting, </em><a href="https://micahflee.com/telemessage-customers-include-dc-police-andreesen-horowitz-jp-morgan-and-hundreds-more/#/portal/signup" rel="noreferrer"><em>subscribe</em></a><em> to get these posts emailed directly to your inbox.
