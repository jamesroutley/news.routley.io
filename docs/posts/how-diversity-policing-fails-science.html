Still another was praised for having made a “land acknowledgment” during the interview process. A land acknowledgment is a statement noting that Native Americans once lived in what is now the United States.</p><p data-type="paragraph">Amidst the explosion of university diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Texas Tech’s biology department adopted its own DEI motion promising to “require and strongly weight a diversity statement from all candidates.” These short, written declarations are meant to summarize an academic job seeker’s past and potential contributions to DEI efforts on campus. </p></section></div></article></div></main><div><div><p>Copyright ©<!-- -->2023<!-- --> Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
