                      </ul><p>The wave of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-layoffs-how-to-help-employees-laid-off-2022-6" data-analytics-module="body_link">tech layoffs</a> has reached even the pandemic darlings of the productivity sector. Email startup Superhuman has laid off 23 employees, representing about 22% of its workforce, <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulvohra/status/1532822631497338881?s=21&amp;t=YYNjIlRF-cP-E12xHS_8UQ" data-analytics-module="body_link">CEO Rahul Vohra announced on Twitter on Friday.</a></p><p>&#34;We are doing all we can to support them, including generous severance, mental health support, health insurance throughout the year, and job search assistance,&#34; Vohra <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulvohra/status/1532822632956956672" data-analytics-module="body_link">added in a follow-up tweet</a>. Vohra also offered to help those laid off to find a new job.</p><p>Superhuman amassed a cult-like following among tech founders and investors for pledging to make email <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/superhuman-email-startup-expanding-microsoft-users-calendar-zoom-2021-5" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8d693adfd9d036d201ef1043c7a34ff6">faster</a>. The app uses keyboard shortcuts and pre-written messages to help users churn through their inbox in less time. Backed by Tiger Global, the startup has raised $126 million in funding, most recently at a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-startup-superhuman-raised-75-million-from-tiger-global-ivp-2021-8" data-analytics-module="body_link">$825 million valuation.</a></p><p>It had its share of <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1422927849560805384" data-analytics-module="body_link">critics</a>, to be sure. A Superhuman subscription costs $30 a month, which led some people to mock the app as <a href="https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1153378934563770368" data-analytics-module="body_link">luxury software</a> for the tech elite. And until recently, people needed an invite from an existing user to join.</p><p>For years, Superhuman elicited gripes from tech-savvy professionals that the app wasn&#39;t compatible with Microsoft Outlook, one of the world&#39;s largest email services with nearly <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY22Q3.docx?version=52d815b6-1a9f-0c49-d0ab-5cd077ae469d" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="eb711e659dd6cfecc389a4a8cfffb688">345 million</a> paid users. People needed a Gmail email address to use the app. Superhuman <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/email-app-superhuman-has-finally-arrived-on-microsoft-outlook-2022-5" data-analytics-module="body_link">finally arrived</a> on Outlook in May, a major milestone for the five-year-old startup that had the potential to unleash hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. The integration came about a year after Superhuman fired up enterprise sales, where businesses pay for licenses directly or through reimbursement.</p><p>The layoffs raise questions about the success of the launch, which had the potential to turbocharge business.</p><p>The layoffs are part of cutbacks sweeping the tech industry as venture capitalists <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ben-horowitz-andreessen-horowitz-startup-slowed-down-investing-venture-capital-2022-5" data-analytics-module="body_link">slow down</a> their pace of investing and startups slash their burn. More than 21,000 tech workers have been laid off so far this year, with 16,800 people dismissed in May alone, according to the online layoffs-tracker <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-layoffs-how-to-help-employees-laid-off-2022-6" data-analytics-module="body_link">Layoffs.fyi.</a></p><p><strong><em>Have a tip?
