Last year, more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros per month while in Lisbon alone, rents jumped 37% in 2022.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Low salaries, a red-hot property market, policies encouraging wealthy foreigners to invest and a tourism-dependent economy have for years made it hard for locals to rent or buy, housing groups have said. Portugal&#39;s 8.3% inflation rate has exacerbated the problem.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Prime Minister Antonio Costa said the crisis was now affecting all families, not just the most vulnerable.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">It is not clear when the measures, worth at least 900 million euros ($962.19 million), will come into effect. Costa said some would be approved next month and others will be voted on by lawmakers.</p><div data-testid="Latest Updates" data-variant-id="article-latest-updates"><div><h3 data-testid="Heading">Latest Updates</h3><p data-testid="Body">View 2 more stories<!-- --> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11 7" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10.413.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0L5.5 4.474 1.613.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0 .709.709 0 0 0 0 1.027l4.4 4.4c.147.147.367.22.513.22a.79.79 0 0 0 .513-.22l4.4-4.4a.71.71 0 0 0 0-1.027h.001Z"></path></svg></p></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-5">A mechanism would be introduced to regulate rent increases, he added, and the government will offer tax incentives to landlords who convert tourism properties into houses for locals to rent.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Left Bloc party MP Mariana Mortagua criticised the measures, saying the government was giving tax breaks to landlords who have already &#34;benefited from (housing) speculation&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">New licenses for tourism accommodations, such as Airbnbs, will be prohibited - except in less populated rural areas.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The Social Democrats said the measures were an &#34;attack&#34; on the rights of property owners and businesses.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">To address the housing shortage, Costa said the state would rent vacant houses direct from landlords for a period of five years and put them on the rental market.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Portugal will end its golden visa programme, which offers EU passports to non-EU nationals in return for investments including in real estate and has been criticised for boosting house prices and rents.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The scheme attracted 6.8 billion euros in investment since its launch in 2012, with the bulk of the money going into real estate.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Housing groups said the measures would mean little if the government continued to promote other policies to attract wealthy foreigners to Portugal, such as the &#34;Digital Nomads Visa&#34; introduced in October, which gives foreigners with high monthly income from remote work to live and work from Portugal without paying local taxes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">At a small housing protest in Lisbon, 23-year-old activist Andreia Galvao accused the government of failing to live up to promises it made to address the housing crisis in the past.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">&#34;The goal was that by 2024 all Portuguese would have access to quality housing - it doesn&#39;t look like that will happen,&#34; she said. &#34;The situation is dramatic.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">The &#34;Housing is a right&#34; group said the measures do not change the &#34;system in place&#34; in which large real estate investment funds control a significant chunk of the market.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">&#34;For the vast majority of people, rents will remain unaffordable and buying a house will continue to be a dream,&#34; it said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">($1 = 0.9354 euros)</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Patricia Rua, Catarina Demony and Sergio Goncalves; Editing by Aislinn Laing, Sandra Maler and David Gregorio</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><div><address><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/authors/catarina-demony/"></a><div><p><a data-testid="Heading" rel="author" href="https://reserialised.routley.io/authors/catarina-demony/">Catarina Demony</a></p><p data-testid="Heading">Thomson Reuters</p><p data-testid="Body">Portugal-based multimedia correspondent reporting on politics, economics, the environment and daily news.
