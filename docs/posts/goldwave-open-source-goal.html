	<p>GoldWave Inc. has provided high quality, affordable audio
	editing software for over 25 years.  April 2023 will mark 30
	years of GoldWave!  We are very grateful for all of the support from
	our users and customers over these many years.

	</p><p>Keeping GoldWave relevant and useful in the future is our
	biggest challenge.  Some work in that direction is ongoing with
	<a href="https://goldwave.com/editor">GoldWave Infinity</a>, but
	we believe it is time for a more radical change.  We want
	to take <i>GoldWave Infinity</i> to the next level by shifting to
	an Open Source development model.  We are very excited about
	all the possibilities an opened sourced GoldWave will bring!
	By contributing to our open source goal, you will help to ensure
	that GoldWave continues to thrive and evolve well into the future.

	
	</p><div id="more"><p>
		Shifting to an open source development model allows many
		talented developers from around the world to expand,
		improve, and enhance GoldWave.	There are so many
		potential advantages, such as:

		</p><ul>
			<li>More reliable code
			</li><li>More complex features and effects
			</li><li>Integration of other open source projects
			not possible in a closed source model
			</li><li>Privacy with zero data collection and no
			App Store or OS monitoring or telemetry
			</li><li>No need for license authentication checks!
			</li><li>Free! GoldWave Infinity would be free for everyone!
		</li></ul><p>
		We believe that open source development will expand
		GoldWave in ways we cannot even imagine right now.

		</p><p>We would provide all of the source code for GoldWave
		Infinity under an open source license (GPL or MIT).  To do
		that, we would need to raise two million dollars.  These funds
		will be used to:

		</p><ul>
			<li>Acquire the source code and intellectual
			property from the Windows version of GoldWave.
			</li><li>Bring the functionality from the Windows
			version into GoldWave Infinity.
			</li><li>Provide dedicated development of GoldWave
			Infinity for at least 5 years.
			</li><li>Provide continued hosting and networking
			infrastructure.
			</li><li>Provide developer and customer support.
			</li><li>Further develop HUI, a new cross-platform
			HTML based C++ graphical user interface library.
		</li></ul>

	‚≠ê Primary goal: Open Source GoldWave Infinity under GPL
	</p></div>

<div>

	<p>* If we are unable to reach our primary funding goal or if
	we receive a substantially larger private acquisition offer,
	refundable contributions will be returned if possible (less
	transactions fees of about 4%).  Non-refundable contributions will
	be used for continued GoldWave development.  The final decision
	will be made on or before the 30th anniversary (April 28th, 2023).

	</p><p><sup>#</sup> Native versions for Linux, and Android
	<em>may</em> allow more recording features, better access to
	files/storage, faster processing, etc. and is intended to be
	superior to the current native versions. Unfortunately native
	MacOS and iOS versions are not planned due to the complexity
	related to Apple&#39;s policies and certificates.
	The open source community is free
	to take up that challenge.
