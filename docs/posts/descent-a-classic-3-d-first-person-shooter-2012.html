    <h1>Descent: A classic 3-D first-person shooter (2012)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="rdescm">
<div>
<p>DESCENT is a classic 3-D first-person shooter for DOS that was 
released in 1995, developed by Parallax Software and published by Interplay 
Productions.  DESCENT is a contemporary of the other very popular FPS of 
the time, DOOM by id Software, released just over a year before.  However, 
it is <em>not</em> based on DOOM; the DESCENT engine works quite differently, 
using 3-D models (rather than sprites) to render enemy robots, and has 
&#34;six degrees of freedom&#34;.  DESCENT also has very little of the 
blood or gore of DOOM.</p>

<p>There were two games made for the DOS platform, <b>DESCENT</b> (1995) and 
<b>DESCENT II</b> (1996, which was also made for Windows 95), as well a sequel 
for Windows 9x, <b>DESCENT<sup>3</sup></b> (1999).  There have been many 
expansions for and re-releases of each; the Game Info pages detail as many of 
those that I know about.</p>

<p>For the moment, the rest of the pages will be concentrating on the first 
mission, <span>DESCENT: First Strike</span>.  In the future I 
may make <span>DESCENT II</span> pages; but that remains to be 
seen.</p>

in general may be directed to <b>insectoid</b> <i>(at)</i> <b>budwin</b>

appreciate the feedback, folks, both good and bad.  However, <em>any spam 
mail will be subject to immediate de-resolution!</em>  Requests for copies 
of the full-version games are firmly discouraged and will be treated in like 
manner.</p>
