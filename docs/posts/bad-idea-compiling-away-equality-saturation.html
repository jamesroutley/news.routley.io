    <h1>Bad idea: Compiling away equality saturation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>X is currently banned in Brazil following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231286/x-brazil-ban-elon-musk-legal-representative">an order</a> from a Supreme Court justice, and Brazilian users seem to be turning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/29/23701500/bluesky-twitter-replacement">Bluesky</a>, an alternate social network, in droves.</p><p>“Brazil, you’re setting new all-time-highs for activity on Bluesky!” the official Bluesky account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3l2xndrs3oh2t">said in a post</a>.</p><p>“There will almost certainly be some outages and performance issues,” Bluesky developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3l2xneypciw22">Paul Frazee said</a>. “We’ve never seen traffic like this. Hang with us!” </p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23708385/bluesky-weather-report-moderation-app-store">Bluesky app</a> looks and functions a lot like X, but it’s a decentralized social media platform that’s built on the AT Protocol (which is also developed by Bluesky). In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3l2xo7kl27f2w">a 5:12PM ET post</a>, Frazee said that Bluesky is seeing 1,000 events per second — a “new milestone” — on its “<a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">relay</a>,” which essentially functions as the firehose of data for the platform. On Friday night, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3l2ye7wjt662c">Bluesky said</a> it had 500,000 new users “in the last two days.”</p><p>Mastodon.social has been seeing “an uptick in sign-ups and overall traffic” from Brazil over the last 48 hours, Mastodon CEO and founder Eugen Rochko tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We used to get nearly 0 sign-ups from Brazil and now it’s up to 3.55k” on Saturday, Rochko says. He also notes that there could be additional growth on third-party servers, but because Mastodon is a decentralized social network, Mastodon (the company) doesn’t have visibility into that.</p><p>Meta, the corporation that runs Threads, which has links to the fediverse, hasn’t replied to a request for comment.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 31st</strong>: Added comment from Mastodon and an additional post from Bluesky.</em></p></div></div></div>
