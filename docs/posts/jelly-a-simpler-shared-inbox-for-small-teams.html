    <p>Small teams with shared email addresses (i.e. hello@ or support@) have been stuck between a rock and a hard place for far too long.</p>

    <p>Sharing a login to an inbox requires a delicate dance to avoid stepping on toes and missing important replies. When that inevitably breaks down, the search for tools leads you through a swamp of overpriced help-desk tools with overcomplicated features built for much, much larger teams.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re doing customer support, dealing with clients, managing your community, or something else entirely, we believe your team deserves better. That’s why we built <strong>Jelly</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> is our take on a shared inbox. It’s just email, with a few handy features built for <em>teams</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone on your team has their own login and can take point on an email. It’s as simple as saying “I’ve got this.” Always see who-has-what at a glance and say goodbye to stepping on each other’s toes!</li>
      
      <li>Everyone can easily keep track of all communications across the team with a robust notification system and activity log. No more losing conversations in someone else’s inbox!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><mark><strong>Jelly</strong> has been a real game-changer for our team, and we’re confident it will be for yours too.</mark></p>

    <p>Oh, and did we mention it’s <em>affordable</em>? There are plenty of shared inboxes out there, but they’re incredibly expensive and bloated with features that small teams don’t need. How expensive? Try $20+ per user per month. That’s over $240 a year just for one user—in this economy!?</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> charges a reasonable flat fee per account, so you can bring your whole team without having to worry about seat limits. Even our plan table is simple and straight-forward:</p>

    <p>It might sound cliche, but we’re being honest when we say that <strong>Jelly</strong> is built for small teams by a small team. We are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodenough.us?utm_source=jelly&amp;utm_medium=jelly_homepage">Good Enough</a>, a team of six decent people who just wanted a decent way to do email together.</p>

      We’ve made some other decent apps we think are good enough too, like
