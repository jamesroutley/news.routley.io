      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hello HN<p>I&#39;ve been working at this company for some time in an administrative role. As part of my job, we – and many others – work with data which gets aggregated and refined by a centralized team of specialists. This process is only partially automated and therefore still quite heavy-handed. As I understand it, significant time is spent on the manual part of it all.</p><p>Out of curiosity I started building this small project in my free time just to see if I could automate it myself, since most of the data required is available open source. There are still many rough edges but what I have now is already superior to what we have at work.</p><p>Now I&#39;m wondering about where to go from here - so far I haven&#39;t told anyone. Strictly speaking, this is not part of my job and I am &#34;poaching&#34; in someone else&#39;s area of expertise. I like my job and don&#39;t want to make enemies. On the other hand, I would love to see my solution put to use and maybe even enhance and/or expand it jointly with IT. However, this is code I wrote in my free time and I am rather unwilling to give it away without any benefit.</p><p>Any ideas?</p></td></tr>
