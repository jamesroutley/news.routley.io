    <h1>&#39;The Genius of Their Age&#39; Review: Central Asia&#39;s Big Thinkers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><section><p data-type="paragraph">I never realized quite how idle and inadequate I was until reading S. Frederick Starr’s “The Genius of Their Age: Ibn Sina, Biruni, and the Lost Enlightenment.” The 11th-century scholar Ibn Sina—known in the West as Avicenna—was practicing medicine and law in his teens and sought, through hundreds of works, to create, as Mr. Starr writes, an “intellectual framework that encompassed philosophy, science, medicine, and religion. His contemporary Biruni has meanwhile been celebrated as “an eleventh-century da Vinci,” “a universal genius” and “The Master.” To the extent that we can begin to comprehend their lives and the range of their accomplishments, “The Genius of Their Age” is an ideal guide.</p><p data-type="paragraph">Modeling his paired biographical structure on Plutarch’s “Parallel Lives,” Mr. Starr, an expert on Central Asian politics and history and the former president of Oberlin College, tends to define his subjects in opposition to each other. Both were “products of the same culture”—an Arabic-literate society influenced by Persia and fought over by ascendant Turkic powers—who belonged to its “small elite of highly educated persons who had the means and inclination to pursue knowledge for its own sake.” They differed in personality and perspective. Ibn Sina (b. ca. 980) was gregarious and desired to “create a single umbrella under which all knowledge could be organized.” Biruni (b. 973) was an inward-looking man who “spent much of his life toiling alone” and “reveled in every discrete phenomenon, and proceeded to generalize only on the basis of what he had observed at the level of specifics.”</p></section><p>Copyright ©<!-- -->2023<!-- --> Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
