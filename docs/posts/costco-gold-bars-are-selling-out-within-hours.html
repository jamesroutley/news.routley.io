    <h1>Costco gold bars are selling out within hours</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-6-2"><div><p>Costco is well-known as a place to get bargain prices on any variety of items, from food to luggage to appliances to gold bars.</p><p>Wait, gold bars?</p><p>Yes, the retail warehousing giant is your one-stop shop for <a href="https://www.costco.com/1-oz-gold-bar-pamp-suisse-lady-fortuna-veriscan-new-in-assay.product.4000186760.html" target="_blank">1 ounce gold PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bars</a>, handsomely detailed and ready for purchase.</p><p>They&#39;re available for the bargain price of … well, you have to be a member to know that, but apparently they were selling for a little shy of $1,900 recently, according to chatter on Reddit. <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-2"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XAU=/">Spot gold</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> most recently was going for $1,876.56 an ounce as of Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Regardless of the price, gold is selling like hotcakes, judging by comments Tuesday from <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COST/">Costco</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti. Speaking on the company&#39;s quarterly earnings call, Galanti said the bars are in hot demand and don&#39;t last long when in stock.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we&#39;ve been selling 1 ounce gold bars,&#34; he said. &#34;Yes, but when we load them on the site, they&#39;re typically gone within a few hours, and we limit two per member.&#34;</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107307293" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>Costco is selling 1 ounce gold bars.</p><p>Costco</p></div></div></div><div><p>A couple of important points from that thought: The bars indeed are only available online, and only if you&#39;re a Costco member, which costs either $120 or $60 a year, depending on which program you pick. The retailer also is limiting the purchases to two to a customer, meaning it would be pretty hard to build a position that would lead to financial security.</p><p>At the very least, though, it&#39;s an effective promotion and one that could appeal to a certain sector of Costco&#39;s shopping clientele, said Jonathan Rose, co-founder of Genesis Gold Group.</p><p>Rose noted that the company seems to have accelerated its offerings of dried foods and other survivalist goods at a time when worries about the future are running high. For example, the company markets <a href="https://www.costco.com/readywise-150-serving-emergency-food-bucket-150-total-servings.product.100837131.html" target="_blank">a 150-serving emergency food preparedness kit</a> that could come in handy, you know, just in case. Gold meshes with that type of product.</p><p>&#34;They&#39;ve done their market research. I think it&#39;s a very clever way to get their name in the news and have some great publicity,&#34; he said. &#34;There is definitely a crossover of people living off the land, being self-sufficient, believing in your own currency. That&#39;s the appeal to gold as a safe haven as people lose faith in the U.S. dollar.&#34;</p></div><div><div role="button" tabindex="0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256" aria-labelledby="title desc" role="img" focusable="false" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><title>Stock Chart Icon</title><desc>Stock chart icon</desc><g transform="translate(1.4065934065934016 1.4065934065934016) scale(2.81 2.81)"><path d="M 87.994 0 H 69.342 c -1.787 0 -2.682 2.16 -1.418 3.424 l 5.795 5.795 l -33.82 33.82 L 28.056 31.196 l -3.174 -3.174 c -1.074 -1.074 -2.815 -1.074 -3.889 0 L 0.805 48.209 c -1.074 1.074 -1.074 2.815 0 3.889 l 3.174 3.174 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 15.069 -15.069 l 14.994 14.994 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 1.614 -1.614 c 0.083 -0.066 0.17 -0.125 0.247 -0.202 l 37.1 -37.1 l 5.795 5.795 C 87.84 23.34 90 22.445 90 20.658 V 2.006 C 90 0.898 89.102 0 87.994 0 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 65.626 37.8 v 49.45 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 23.518 L 65.626 37.8 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 47.115 56.312 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 42.03 L 47.115 56.312 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 39.876 60.503 c -1.937 0 -3.757 -0.754 -5.127 -2.124 l -6.146 -6.145 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 59.844 C 41.952 60.271 40.933 60.503 39.876 60.503 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 22.937 46.567 L 11.051 58.453 c -0.298 0.298 -0.621 0.562 -0.959 0.8 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 48.004 L 22.937 46.567 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path></g></svg><p><img src="https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg" alt="hide content"/></p></div><p>Gold futures, last 5 years</p></div><div><p>Precious metals have been on a run over the past several years. Gold has risen more than 15% over the past year and more than 55% over the past five years.</p><p>With inflation still elevated, banks under the gun from a regulatory standpoint and looming issues in the commercial real estate market, the safe-haven aspect of gold and silver should be strong, Rose said.</p><p>&#34;We know what the road map looks like: Bank failures, commercial loans defaulting at an alarming rate … they don&#39;t seem to have a handle on inflation, and that&#39;s why they keep raising interest rates,&#34; he said. &#34;The outlook for stability in the market isn&#39;t good and people want a [tangible] asset that&#39;s going to be a safe haven. That&#39;s what gold and silver provide.&#34;</p><p>The hoarding of gold bars is a hot topic lately after U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/sen-bob-menendez-of-new-jersey-wife-charged-with-bribery.html">was indicted on federal bribery charges</a> and 81.5 ounces in bullion were seized from his home.</p></div></div></div>
