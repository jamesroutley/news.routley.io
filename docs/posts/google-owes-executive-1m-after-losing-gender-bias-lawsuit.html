    <h1>Google owes executive $1M after losing gender bias lawsuit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A jury found Google guilty of sexual discrimination and awarded female Google Cloud executive Ulku Rowe, who filed the complaint, $1.1 million. Rowe’s lawsuit alleged that the company gave higher pay to less-experienced male cohorts and that it later denied her promotions in retaliation for her complaints, both internal and later in court. </p><p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/google-must-pay-female-executive-1-million-for-gender-bias"><em>Bloomberg Law</em> reports</a> the jury ruled that Google owes Rowe for both punitive damages and pain and suffering. <a href="https://www.outtengolden.com/insights/media/news/google-cloud-executive-begins-gender-discrimination-trial-against-technology-giant/">Rowe said</a> before the trial started that her time at Google was “overshadowed by what I believe are unfair compensation and treatment due to my gender.” She alleged that, after the company passed her over for a promotion to vice president that was given to a man who had neither applied nor was qualified and she filed her lawsuit, the company again denied her another similar promotion.</p><p>In an email sent to <em>The Verge</em>, Attorney Cara Green of Outten &amp; Golden said that the “unanimous verdict not only validates Ms. Rowe’s allegations of mistreatment by Google,” but that it sends a message that “discrimination and retaliation will not be tolerated in the workplace.” </p><div><p>Green credited “the efforts of thousands of Googlers who walked out in 2018 and demanded reforms.” Over 20,000 Google employees and contractors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting">staged a walk-out protest</a> that year after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"><em>New York Times </em>investigation</a> revealed that the company had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023364/google-andy-rubin-payoff-90-million-sexual-misconduct-harassment">given Android co-founder $90 million</a> as he left the company over sexual assault allegations.</p></div></div></div></div>
