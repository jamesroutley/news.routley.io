    <p>I previously discussed how double-entry accounting works — including how to create the balance sheet — in my article <a href="https://www.winstoncooke.com/blog/a-basic-introduction-to-accounting">A Basic Introduction to Accounting</a>.
Now let&#39;s explore some more basic accounting concepts: revenue, expenses, and depreciation.
Fixed assets provide a great way to explore these concepts, so let&#39;s not waste anytime and get right into it!</p>
<h2 id="i-ve-always-wanted-to-buy-an-airplane">I&#39;ve always wanted to buy an airplane</h2>
<p>Imagine we run an airline company.
Lucky us.
Somebody just bought a plane ticket to escape Seattle&#39;s dreary winter weather and soak up the sun in Palm Springs, so let&#39;s book the journal entry.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Cash                $100
</span><span>    Unearned Revenue    $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>How come the revenue is unearned?
In US GAAP accounting, revenue recognition principles dictate when revenue is allowed to be recognized.
For physical goods, this is normally at the point of delivery.
In our case, we&#39;re providing a service, so we can&#39;t book revenue until the customer has taken their plane flight.
This means that while we have received cash, we have to book the revenue in a liability account titled <code>Unearned Revenue</code>.</p>
<p>Once our customer takes their flight to Palm Springs, the revenue has been earned, so we can now recognize it on our books with the following entry.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Unearned Revenue    $100
</span><span>    Sales Revenue       $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>Great, now our company has some cash!
Now imagine we need to buy a new plane for our fleet.
A certain large airplane manufacturer in Washington is in dire straits and is having a major sale on airplanes.
We can buy a new airplane for only $100!
Let&#39;s book our new purchase.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Airplane    $100
</span><span>    Cash        $100
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="straight-line-depreciation">Straight-line Depreciation</h2>
<p>Now we have a fixed asset (our new airplane) on the books.
Fixed assets are subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation">depreciation</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation#Straight-line_depreciation">Straight-line depreciation</a> is the most commonly used method for depreciating an asset, which we&#39;ll use here.
Under straight-line deprecation, the annual depreciation expense is calculated by subtracting the residual value of the asset from its cost and dividing the result by the asset&#39;s useful life (normally measured in years).
Let&#39;s say our airplane will have no residual value left over when it&#39;s fully depreciated and has a useful life of 2 years.
To calculate our annual deprecation expense we take the cost of $100 and remove the residual value.
Since our residual value is 0, our dividend in the equation is 100.
Our divisor is the 2 years.
The result is our depreciation expense, which is the quotient of $100 / 2, or $50.</p>
<pre><code><span>(100 - 0) / 2 = 50
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to book our depreciation expense for the year.
Depreciation expense is offset by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_account">contra asset account</a> called accumulated depreciation, which carries a negative balance to offset the fixed asset.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Depreciation Expense        $50
</span><span>    Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now calculate our book value.
The equation is the cost of the fixed asset less accumulated depreciation.
At the end of the first year, our book value is $50, which is the result of $100 - 50.</p>
<pre><code><span>cost - accumulated depreciation = book value
</span><span>100 - 50 = 50
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the next year, we book a similar entry to before.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Depreciation Expense        $50
</span><span>    Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our accumulated depreciation for the airplane is now $100, which means our book value is now $0.
When the book value reaches the residual value of the asset ($0 in our case), the asset has reached the end of its useful life and can be scrapped.
To scrap the asset, we must remove the cost of the asset from our books by crediting its original cost.
The offsetting entry is to also reduce the accumulated depreciation balance.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Accumulated Deprecation $100
</span><span>    Airplane                $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now the airplane has been removed from our books.
If you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed, don&#39;t worry.
That was a lot!</p>
<h2 id="the-income-statement">The Income Statement</h2>
<p>Now that the year is over, let&#39;s make the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement">income statement</a>.
The income statement is a financial statement that captures a company&#39;s revenues and expenses over a period of time.
Compare that to the balance sheet that we previously discussed, which reflects the current balances of the general ledger at a specific moment in time.</p>
<pre data-lang="income-statement"><code data-lang="income-statement"><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>        Income Statement
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Revenues
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Sales Revenue               $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Gross Revenues              $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Expenses
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Depreciation Expense    $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Total Expenses          $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Net Income                    $0
</span><span>================================
</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, not a great year for us.
We earned $0 because our expenses canceled out our income.
But at least we learned how to keep track of them and can now do better planning in the future!</p>
<h2 id="disposing-of-a-fixed-asset-early">Disposing of a fixed asset early</h2>
<p>We&#39;re almost done, but what would happen if we got rid of our airplane before it was fully depreciated?
There are multiple ways this could happen.
One is if the asset becomes damaged and has to be written off, and another scenario is if we sell the asset early.</p>
<p>Imagine we have recorded a single year of depreciation expense for the airplane.
Recall that it has two yeas of useful life, so it&#39;s halfway through.
Let&#39;s show the depreciation entry again.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Depreciation Expense        $50
</span><span>    Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span></code></pre>
<p>The airplane currently has a book value of $50.</p>
<h3 id="writing-off-a-damaged-fixed-asset">Writing off a damaged fixed asset</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s see what writing off a damaged fixed asset early looks like first.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Loss on asset disposal      $50
</span><span>Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span><span>    Airplane                    $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see above, we have to book a loss on the asset disposal of $50 to balance the entry.
Loss on asset disposal is an expense.
Let&#39;s see how this change affects our income statement.</p>
<pre data-lang="income-statement"><code data-lang="income-statement"><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>        Income Statement
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Revenues
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Sales Revenue               $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Gross Revenues              $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Expenses
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Depreciation Expense     $50
</span><span>Loss on asset disposal   $50
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Total Expenses          $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Net Income                    $0
</span><span>================================
</span></code></pre>
<p>Due to the natural balancing characteristic of double-entry accounting, our numbers remain the same since we added a new expense account, and the expenses still sum to $100.</p>
<h3 id="selling-a-fixed-asset-early-for-a-gain">Selling a fixed asset early for a gain</h3>
<p>Now let&#39;s consider the second scenario from above where we sell the asset early.
Imagine we&#39;re ready to get rid our airplane and have found a potential buyer that wants to pay $75, which is more than the plane&#39;s current book value of $50.
We happily decide to sell the airplane and book our entry as soon as the cash clears.</p>
<pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Cash                        $75
</span><span>Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span><span>    Gain on asset disposal      $25
</span><span>    Airplane                    $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we still reduce the balance of the airplane and its accumulated depreciation account from our books.
We also book the cash we received.
This leads to a $25 difference, which is the amount in excess of our airplane&#39;s book value.
The excess is booked as a gain on asset disposal, which we can see reflected in our alternate version of the income statement below.</p>
<pre data-lang="income-statement"><code data-lang="income-statement"><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>        Income Statement
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Revenues
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Sales Revenue               $100
</span><span>Gain on asset disposal       $25
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Gross Revenues              $125
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Expenses
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Depreciation Expense     $50
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Total Expenses           $50
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Net Income                   $75
</span><span>================================
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thanks to our savvy decision to sell the airplane for a profit, we now have positive net income!
Unlike our previous scenario, this transaction added an entry for a revenue account rather than an expense account.</p>
<h3 id="selling-a-fixed-asset-early-for-a-loss">Selling a fixed asset early for a loss</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s consider one final scenario.
Suppose we don&#39;t like our airplane very much.
Its bathrooms are always out of order, the tray tables don&#39;t stay latched, and occasionally the door plug blows out mid-flight.
We want to sell this plane and move on from out.
However, we&#39;re forced to sell it for less than its book value given its undesirable condition.
Our buyer offers us $25, which is less than our $50 book value.
Tough break for us, but we have to book the journal entry regardless.</p>
<p>
Take a moment to stop and think about what the journal entry should look like before reading below.
</p><pre data-lang="journal-entry"><code data-lang="journal-entry"><span>Cash                        $25
</span><span>Accumulated Depreciation    $50
</span><span>Loss on asset disposal      $25
</span><span>    Airplane                    $100
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, we have to book a loss on our asset disposal, which is debited as an expense and naturally balances each side.
Let&#39;s take a look at our alternate income statement after this scenario.</p>
<pre data-lang="income-statement"><code data-lang="income-statement"><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>        Income Statement
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Revenues
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Sales Revenue               $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Gross Revenues              $100
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>
</span><span>Expenses
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Depreciation Expense     $50
</span><span>Loss on asset disposal   $25
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Total Expenses           $75
</span><span>--------------------------------
</span><span>Net Income                  $25
</span><span>================================
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our journal entry above, as well as our income statement, both look similar to the first scenario where we wrote off the airplane entirely.
The key difference is that we sold the airplane for $25 in cash.
This means we didn&#39;t book the remaining $50 of book value as a complete loss.
Accordingly, we actually end the period with a net income of $25.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>In the real world there would be more ramifications to these types of scenarios.
For example, selling the plane for a $25 loss might appear better on the surface than letting the airplane depreciate over its full useful life of two years.
What I didn&#39;t capture above is the revenue that could have been earned from using the airplane, which might have continued in the airplane&#39;s second year.</p>
<p>This lesson was conducted in a vacuum because the amount of journal entries can add up quickly, and I wanted to focus on the core concepts around fixed assets.
Now that you&#39;ve read up to this point, you&#39;ve learned the basics of accounting for fixed assets.
It can get incredibly more complex, so you should probably save that for a CPA to handle!</p>
