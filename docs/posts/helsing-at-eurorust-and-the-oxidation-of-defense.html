companies.</p></blockquote><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>At NixCon 2023 Europe and NixCon 2024 North America, the inclusion of American
defense contractor Anduril Industries on the sponsorship roster caused excessive
damage to the project. This included the several open letters, including the one
against the founder of the project Eelco Dolstra’s leadership[6], the open
letter of NixOS users against the Military Industrial Complex sponsorships[7],
and the mass exodus of many crucial, load bearing maintainers of nixpkgs.
Ultimately, Eelco stepped down from the board, and the Constitutional
Assembly[8] was created to find a new governance structure, and ended up
resulting in the NixOS steering committee election<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-steering-committee-election-2024/52232/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9</a>. It also led to the
creation of the impressive Lix[10] fork, which is a real contender to the old
Nix implementation, and the alternative NixOS project Aux[11], with a much more
inclusive governance structure.</p><p>Unlike the Nix Community, the Rust community has had a comparatively tame
response to the inclusion of European defense software company Helsing and its
employees at Rust events. And that’s interesting. How come that the Rust
community doesn’t have such a strong reaction? Is this because Helsing isn’t
like other defense contractors? Is this just the result of different
organizational priorities? Is it something different about how the community
interacts with the company?</p><p>For NixOS, it is important to understand situations like this, as we consider
where to draw the line for a potential sponsorship policy. Should there simply
be a blanket ban on any defense company? Or was Anduril different in some way
to Helsing, and is that why they Rust community seems more tolerant of their
presence at events, both as main sponsors, and with booths and workshops
primarily aimed at hiring?</p><p>I think it’s clear to most people in the Nix community already that Anduril
Industries should never be allowed to participate again in our community, at
least not as sponsors, nor should they be given space to hire at official Nix
events. Not just because of any moral reservations, but because their inclusion
has on both occasions been against the collective community’s interests, and it
has torn the project apart at the seams. But what about a company like Helsing?</p><p>As a nominee for the 2024 Nix Steering Committee election, and as someone that
has been involved in the discussion’s surrounding the Anduril inclusion in 2023
and 2024 NixCon events, I find the issue of understanding fully these new
defense companies that have been slowly encroaching onto our software projects
crucial.</p><p>This year, I was blessed with the opportunity to attend Eurorust 2024 in Vienna,
and event where the main sponsor was Helsing. I couldn’t resist such a great
opportunity to get a closer look at a “startup defense company”. Further, I had
the opportunity to participate in a Helsing hackathon in the pre-conference days
— “competitive control systems” — and I had several opportunities to talk
with the Helsing employees present at Eurorust, and get their often nuanced and
thoughtful answers to some of the hard questions I posed.</p><p>In this post I’ll outline all the things I’ve learned on my trip, as well as
further found when researching the company, the employees, and the larger
software industry landscape. I’ll draw parallels to Anduril, but also show
differences, and while I may come to conclusions that some may find leaning
slightly biased, I’ve sought to remain neutral, but on the side of the software
projects I love, over the billion dollar defense industries’ interests.</p><p>So here it is, my Helsing infodump, enjoy! :)</p><h2 id="about-helsing">About Helsing</h2><p>Helsing is a company of some ~220 employees, spread around London, Paris,
Berlin, and Munich offices. It has a total funding of €761.5M, gained through 3
funding rounds[2], and boasts an €1.7 billion post-money valuation[3]. That is
to say, it is by no means a small company.</p><h3 id="products">Products</h3><p>One way in which Helsing stands apart from Anduril is that it doesn’t seem to
have a product lineup.</p><p>Getting concrete details out of employees on products was a challenge, and not
because they were trying to hide things. It’s clear that as a company with
offices in many parts of Europe, including the UK, Germany, and France,
Helsing’s activities are scattered, not just across different localities and
geographies, but also withing the various divisions of the company.</p><p>Further, Helsing seems to compartmentalize their work, which may not just be an
organizational model suited for concentrating expertise, but may also be both a
way to minimize mental health issues and retain employees that could have their
morale reduced significantly from seeing the horrors their products cause to
real people in warzones.</p><p>For instance, I asked if there was any mental health counseling provided for the
employees, in case they had to interact with something as part of their work
that disturbed them. This isn’t abnormal in the defense sector in general, as
PTSD is a common issue amongst those involved in any sort of warfare (although
more pronounced on the frontlines).</p><p>It was quite clear from the responses I got, that while such provisions where in
place, they weren’t exactly used equally by all sub-departments, as those who -
for instance - had more direct contact with the actual brutality of war
(specially Ukraine), had a much more pronounced need for counselling, than those
who work on algorithms for categorizing data streams.</p><p>It was mentioned that some people at Helsing have to actually review or work on
footage gotten from the war in Ukraine, likely for image recognition from
drones.</p><p>Regardless of the challenge of figuring out their exact product lineup, here is
an overview of some of the most relevant areas I could find.</p><ul><li><p>Helsing has a contract making German Eurofighters able to detect radar lock-on
(which indicates the aircraft may be being targeted by AAW, Anti Aircraft
Warfare). This could help make German Eurofighters more “survivable”, which
includes the ones that carry Nuclear Weapons for deterrence. They argue this
helps ensure German nuclear deterrence isn’t nullified by AAW, ensuring peace.</p></li><li><p>Autonomous drone flight control systems for Ukraine, including “GPS Denied”
option (navigating while GPS is being jammed). It was impossible to confirm
IRL whether or not this is purely reconnaissance or navigating and dropping
payloads on targets. However, it is likely part of a kill chain, as even
SIGINT will likely be used for e.g. artillery fire.</p></li><li><p>Helsing has indicated a clear interest in Anti-Submarine-Warfare via AI and
radar technologies. That is, identifying submarines. This also makes a lot of
sense, considering the presence of Russian submarines around Scandinavia
waters, and the Baltic Pipeline Attacks still being recent in the public
consciousness.</p></li><li><p>“Generic” AI command and control software, similar in some ways to what
Anduril is offering, that can locate targets and display them on some
graphical UI.[1] They’re apparently unique in their ability to map the
electromagnetic spectrum of a battlefield.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://liquidbrain.net/p/eurorust-2024-helsing/helsing-anduril.jpg" width="4080" height="3072" srcset="/p/eurorust-2024-helsing/helsing-anduril_hu1896051391107878784.jpg 480w, /p/eurorust-2024-helsing/helsing-anduril_hu15890002904761111653.jpg 1024w" loading="lazy" alt="Suggestions board at EuroRust, asking similar questions to this post." data-flex-grow="132" data-flex-basis="318px"/></p><h3 id="only-software">Only Software</h3><p>One difference between Helsing and Anduril seems to be that Helsing is a SIGINT
company, where Anduril is also a hardware company. While they both seem to do
software, and both operate more as software startup than legacy defense
companies, Helsing seems to be working on the platforms already available in
Europe, while Anduril is developing a lot of new physical products as well.</p><p>I think this is partially a tactical choice, as a product owner at Helsing
explains, “bending metal is hard”, and military hardware, specially vehicles,
tanks, jet fighters and such have long ~15 years development processes, and ~15
years active service according to said product manager.</p><p>Another interesting thing is that parts of its sales strategy is lobbying,
something that companies like Palantir, that sued the U.S. Army for not
considering it for large intelligence contracts has done in the past (Palantir
won and got an $800 Million contract). As an aside, it should be noted that
Palantir and Anduril has a large overlap of people, and both have names based on
lord of the rings, palantiri being “seeing-stones”, and Anduril the sword of
Aragon, translated from the con-lang Quenya meaning “flame of the west”.</p><p>In fact, according to defense-aerospace.com, Helsing views lobbying as an important
strategy for making rapid breakthroughs.</p><blockquote><p>Thanks to an intense multi-azimuth lobbying effort in the various countries
where it is established (Germany, the core-country, Great Britain and
France), Helsing expects to make a rapid breakthrough in the field of
military Al.</p></blockquote><p>Considering their market and lobbying efforts seems to be targeted at Europe and
European interests primarily, it makes a lot of sense that they’d try to work on
the more varied platforms available in the nations present in the EU, rather
than the Anduril approach of becoming a new hardware vendor for the US military.
Even Anduril isn’t ready to actually take on the “defense primes” (Boeing,
Lockheed, RTX) when it comes to big ticket items like fighter jets — despite what
they may say — and it makes more sense for Anduril to work on auxiliary products
instead of directly competing.</p><p>In the same sense, Helsing seems to seek augmenting the defense primes&#39;
products, rather than replacing them… at least, for the time being.</p><h3 id="torsten-reil">Torsten Reil</h3><p>Torsten Reil, co-founder and CEO of Helsing was a Biology PhD, that dropped out
to create the video game company Natural Motion, which was sold in 2014.</p><p>After selling he seems to have turned to investing, and found that “liberal
democracies” were falling behind in “key technologies”. He criticizes the big
primes (legacy defense companies) for being hardware companies first, and not
software companies. He also says the primes struggle with attracting and keeping
talent, and being slow moving and not agile enough to support modern military
needs.</p><p>This parallels how Palmer Lucky, the founder of Anduril, will often argue how
he too finds the defense primes operate in slow and clumsy ways, and that they
should essentially instead run as a venture capital startup, a shared vision
with Torsten it seems.</p><p>To me, this reads as an European Palmer Lucky on all accounts except the
undisclosed political affiliations, which I think is mainly a tactical choice,
considering the more nuanced and diverse political landscape of the European
Union.</p><p>It’s also a fun coincidence that while Torsten created a purely software
videogame company, Palmer Lucky, founder of Anduril created Occulus, video game
VR glasses, which was a hardware heavy effort.</p><h3 id="hiring">Hiring</h3><p>Their presence at Eurorust is obviously primarily in a hiring capacity. They’re
not trying to sell a bunch of Rust Nerds advanced weapons software. As Torsten
says, the problem defense primes struggle with is recruiting and retaining
hires, and likely for a company like Helsing that is very well funded, with a
Series A of €102.5M, Series B of €209M, and series C of €450M, they’re looking
to recruit as much talent, as fast as possible.</p><p>It’s been interesting to see this effort play out in practice. It seems that
most of the attendees are skeptical of Helsing and their business. Some have
even directly confronted employees how they “feel about killing people”. I’ve
yet to meet someone that was explicitly excited about their presence that
weren’t an organizer… aside from myself I suppose. Personally, I’ve been
curious to understand the difference between them and Anduril, so I hate to
admit it’s been great having such direct access to the Helsing employees.</p><p>The employees themselves present at the event do seem like they have nuanced
moral standpoints, and none of them seem like some <em>cynical war profiteers</em> just
working there to get rich quick with no regards to the consequences. And that’s
supported by the fact that they likely would find riches easier elsewhere,
considering the strength of their profiles, the comparatively average Helsing
salaries as gathered from <a href="https://levels.fyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">levels.fyi</a>, which seem in line
with other European software companies compensation for similar talent.</p><hr/><p>In fact, on the first conference day of Eurorust, I was racing Jon Gjengset to
get into the venue, and after we got our badges, and as we got to the sticker
booth, we interacted a bit. I jokingly pointed out that he should put one of the
“we’re hiring” stickers on his badge, to which he responded “how do you know
we’re hiring?”.</p><p>I personally assumed it was obvious to everyone.</p><h2 id="the-competitive-control-systems-hackathon">The Competitive Control Systems Hackathon</h2><p>Eurorust 2024 had a pre-conference day of workshops. The workshops were held at
a separate event in the heart of Vienna, at an event center. Unlike the other
workshops, the hackathon by Helsing was a free to attend event, and was
announced much later than the other workshops.</p><p>In the lobby, I heard people talk about how if only they had known in advance,
they’d have signed up for that instead. I didn’t tell them that I myself found
the workshop about a week before the actual event, and managed to somehow get
the last ticket for it.</p><p>The event was organized by a handful of Helsing employees, including Jon
Gjengset, a charismatic Helsing principal engineer, and a Rust micro-celebrity,
known for his YouTube videos on Rust, and his book Rust for Rustaceans. We will
get back to him later.</p><p>A lady came up to me in the lobby and scanned my ticket, and then informed me of
where the event would be held. As I came into the room, I heard the sound of a
high spirited conversation between the Helsing employees and the other
attendees. I placed myself at the first free spot I could find, and it wasn’t
long before I myself was sucked up in infodumping with the people around me
about anything from NixOS governance to eza “war stories” (pun not originally
intended).</p><p>After chatting and introductions, the doors were closed, and the hackathon’s
goals were explain by one of the employees, after which we split into teams. By
luck, I had managed to sit down besides two skilled hackers, one with a knack
for quickly prototyping algorithms and another who’d taught others on the
Proportional Integral Derivative control systems. And best of all, both were Nix
users.</p><p>My Nix sticker also quickly revealed me to the employees, who mentioned that
having Nix skills would be an advantage. The project itself was packaged as a
flake using flake-parts and some module wrapping the Nix library crane, for
building Rust programs.</p><p>As it turns out (as I’ve myself found in my professional work), release
engineering is no longer a skill that’s looked over as simple ops work anymore,
and it’s no coincidence that Anduril has had such an interest in NixOS, or that
this interest is shared by Helsing and its employees. After all, the many
advantages NixOS and Nix provides seem obviously useful for anything with high
stakes. Reproducible and resilient systems that are easy to bring back and
distribute have caught the eye of an industry under tight constraints, not from
market competition, but from militant adversaries.</p><p>Back to the hackathon. Our team name? “Droning On”. The objective? Create a PID
control system for navigating a simulated drone into a bounding box, and staying
stable in the box, with adversarial inputs such as chaotic wind and gravity. The
movement of the drone, we soon realized, wasn’t able to destabilize the drone.
We didn’t have to balance the rotors, and while the simulation had a concept of
fuel consumption bounding the amount of points possible to the time before the
drone ran out, this was linearly consumed from the start of the program, so any
approach should naively be to aggressively navigate to the target, and stay
there for as long as possible, regardless of how much thrust it would require.</p><p>As I discovered first and foremost, the Helsing engineers were right to point
out Nix expertise being an advantage… because the flake wasn’t building, and
the rust project underlying it wasn’t either, even in the devShell created to
run it.</p><p>The code to build the Rust project in Nix looked like the following (part of the
<code>flake.nix</code> using flake-parts). At this point, feel free to pause and attempt to
figure out why none of the Linux users could build it.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre tabindex="0"><code><span> 1

still didn’t have <code>nix build</code> yet. Also, in case you’re wondering, the crate

to fix the build (the <code>devShell</code> was entered through direnv, and since both of

a bearer token, identifying us and our team on the scoreboard, and then receive
and send commands to the server until we ran out of fuel. Only a full run would
be counted, if you exited early you wouldn’t get any points. This also meant
that <code>panic!</code> was a great way to waste a run, which could take up to a minute,
and new connections being rate limited made this incredibly wasteful.</p><p>Of course, one of our first discoveries were that, since we could just provide
any bearer token, we could simply make it something random, like an UUIDv4,
and avoid the rate limiting. This is why you’ll see screenshots full of UUIDv4’s,
leftovers from us learning this little hack.</p><p>In fact, we made so many UUIDv4 users that they had to clean the scoreboard
periodically, but as they themselves said, there “is no rules”, so we were fine
with exploiting this for a faster iteration speed.</p><p>The message we received from the server came to us over a mspc channel as an

teams in the hackathon to score points at all, and eclipsing our runner up
competitors.</p><p>Our approach ended up as constructing PIDs for the pitch, roll, and throttle,
and then through trial and error tuning, we were able to get results, that
seemed to reach approximately the total possible score given the simulation
settings. About at the end of the event, the adversarial inputs were relaxed to
give us the ability to improve, and until the end of the event we kept gaining
points.</p><p>For our efforts, a shared gift-card prize of 200 EUR to spend on a website that
sells Raspberry Pi components and other microelectronics.</p><h3 id="reflections-on-the-hackathon">Reflections on the hackathon</h3><p>One of my biggest concerns from joining this event was that I might accidentally
contribute to technology that I may have moral reservations against. At the time,
I had not done enough work to ensure that disclosure of our method was responsible,
and so I did my best to mitigate a potential leak of the source by taking reasonable
measure for confidentiality.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised that both of my team members were fine with these
provisions, which included private repositories for instance.</p><p>Of course, while it may seem a bit cocky to assume that our amateurish solution
could be useful for a large company like Helsing, we did manage to beat the
control software written by the employees for testing, and as I later learned
when asking one of the employees at the conference, the simulation software
couldn’t be open sourced, since it was actually proprietary internal software
that was in fact used in some capacity by Helsing for product development.</p><p>If anything, not only was it fun to win, and be on such an amount of home-turf,
what with NixOS, Rust, and a bunch of math, and my teammates became people who I’d
hang out with throughout the conference days.</p><p>But what was really the most interesting was getting some insight into the kinds
of software problems that a defense company like Helsing is working on.
Packaging and developing control system software like this has a clear usage in,
for instance, Ukrainian drone warfare, and a control system like the one we
made could easily be considered a simple prototype for a GPS jamming survival
tool for reaching a certain destination, only we’d not have absolute position,
but have to infer it from various other inputs.</p><p>Given that these military projects have little if any transparency, and usually
a small if non-existant open-source portfolio, getting a little feel on the pulse
of what is happening behind the scenes is pretty informative. Understanding, and
ultimately finding out whether or not defense belongs at technical events, and
what roles it can exist in, depends on how it’s used in warzones.</p><h2 id="further-on-helsings-technology">Further on Helsing’s technology</h2><p>One particularly interesting part of my conversations with Helsing employees,
and also what I’ve gathered both from videos, talks, and Jon’s Q&amp;As on Helsing,
is that the most fundamental problem that Helsing is positioning themselves to
solve, is the ability to deal with a so-called “firehose” of information.</p><p>The problem they seem to feel uniquely capable of tackling is that when you have
vast amounts of information, be that sensors on a vehicle, sonar or radar
information, command and control statistics, really anything, their usage of AI
exists to filter and select for what is important and relevant, for
classification and prioritization.</p><p>Here I should emphasize that this is the particular way Helsing prefers to
phrase this. To me, this sounds partially like an anachronistic appeal to big
data, an unsurprising marketing spin for an industry still far behind the
bleeding edge of software engineering.</p><p>The view is compelling, and as they will emphasize, the goal here isn’t to take
“a conscious operator” out of the loop, or to move the responsibility of
life-death decisions to an algorithm, but rather to inform some operator with
better, more relevant data, to be able to enhance snap moment decisions, and
make large complicated problems less challenging to analyze.</p><p>Whether or not this is what will happen in practice is less easy to discern. As
Helsing and it’s employers will attest, the company only works with governments
they consider moral, and they often bring up the example of domestic surveillance
as something they’d never work on. However, it’s worth noting that after handing
off a product to a nation-state, Helsing don’t hold any corrective measures for
ensuring the technology isn’t misused, and they will also acknowledge this,
saying that ultimately, things they make will end up killing people, or having
other harms they can’t predict.</p><p>Aside from the parallels between the no-GPS feature of Ukrainian drones, and
those of the recently announced Anduril drones that can navigate to a target
and eliminate it, it’s not hard to imagine that given Helsing’s presence in
Ukraine and now Estonia, their portfolio will soon include border surveillance
software like the Anduril sentry towers, if it doesn’t already as part of its
battlefield overview software. Anduril promotes border control towers as methods
of protecting military base deployments, but in reality has also seen much usage
at the US-Mexico border, to detect illegal immigration, a front Anduril shares
with Palantir, who also cooperates with ICE.</p><p>I’ve brought up these problems to people at Helsing, comparing the US-Mexico
border to the Mediterranean, and it wouldn’t seem far fetched to me that
technology used for protecting borders, and detecting “adversaries” at the
Russian fronts would be used at other European border regions, for the purpose
of stopping immigration into an Europe slowly sliding into right wing
nationalism.</p><p>Of course, the Helsing employees seem to find that such an usage would be
problematic, and in fact, often Helsing employees like Jon will say that
they’re okay with the companies direction “for the time being”, meaning they are
aware that it’s possible that when Helsing gains stronger footing and stronger
hire base, it will participate in more controversial projects.</p><p>Of course the problem is that even if you leave when the product you helped
create starts being misused for unethical causes, you’re not able to undo what
you’ve created, or stop it from being used elsewhere, in situations you’d find
morally questionable. If there is one hole in the general Helsing employees
coping strategy, it is this part: that they’re merely able to change course, and
not that they’re ultimately unable to control the direction of a large defense
contractor like Helsing.</p><p>AI technology used for autonomous weapons systems have also already seen
deployments in areas of the world not considered as clear cut, one of particular
note being the Palestinian genocide. Here, autonomous systems, such as those
developed by Anduril and Palantir, and such as those Helsing will likely soon
find in its portfolio, are regularly used to pick, often arbitrarily, random
targets for drone strikes. These attacks have high causalities, doesn’t care
much for civilian harm, and have little oversight and no responsibility for the
collateral damage they cause to the Palestinians.</p><p>When Helsing decides to work with Europe and its allies, it also means it may
find itself used in such a situation, which can only be described as a genocide,
and while it may not have gotten to the point yet, simple because it’s a
relatively new player on the market, or because it keeps information much closer
isn’t easy to say. But without adequate transparency, it’s not like it can be
considered impossible, and with no algorithmic transparency, we’re not as
outsiders able to consider whether any of the product of Helsing are truly
living up to the ideals their PR material outlines.</p><h2 id="jon-gjengset">Jon Gjengset</h2><p>When Jon joined Helsing as a principle engineer in August 2023, it quickly sent
ripples through the community. It can be hard to state for someone not involved
in rust how influential he is, but suffice to say that many people encounter at
least some of his videos on “the crust of rust” as their first real introduction
to some of the most fundamental intermediate parts of learning rust.</p><p>This also includes me. I remember watching his videos on <code>std::collections</code> and
having several “aha” moments.</p><p>Of course, he made the wise decision to address concerns about his new employers in
his <a href="https://youtu.be/r1lc2fmU_Rg?t=750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2023 Q&amp;A livestream</a>.</p><p><img src="https://liquidbrain.net/p/eurorust-2024-helsing/jon-sells-out.png" width="599" height="257" srcset="/p/eurorust-2024-helsing/jon-sells-out_hu6246669644211714766.png 480w, /p/eurorust-2024-helsing/jon-sells-out_hu2626776806729335627.png 1024w" loading="lazy" alt="John announces his new role at Helsing. See source 4 for link." data-flex-grow="233" data-flex-basis="559px"/></p><p>Also, unlike other Rust giants like David Tolnay (dtolnay), who hides his
Palantir past as much as possible, Jon isn’t shy about working for Helsing,
and doesn’t seem to be ashamed of the affiliation. Meeting Jon at the event
really did cement that he is a well liked character in the Rust community. At
the same time, most of the people I spoke too about him said that they were
surprised that he had take a role at Helsing, but many were still willing to
give him a benefit of the doubt, or assumption of good faith — surely he
wasn’t aware how big of a mistake he had made?</p><p>Considering that Helsing, and the defense primes and startups in general are
having massive issues with recruiting, it’s likely that his real role is gonna
be one equivalent to the one held by other developer advocates, and not just as
a principal engineer. That Helsing would want a “Kelsey Hightower”[5] of rust is
nothing suprising, it’s the same tech playbook as always, now just employed in
the normally more reserved defense sector.</p><p>This also does mean that whatever relationship you’ve had to him before should
likely change. He still seems like a warm and friendly, charismatic and funny
guy, but he’s obviously employed in a role that’s there to sell you a product
as a developer, but the product is a job, not some SaaS solution that’s gonna
capture you when it moves to Business Source License.</p><h3 id="when-did-defense-work-stop-being-taboo">When did defense work stop being taboo</h3><p>If you watch interviews with Torsten, or Palmer Lucky, you’ll hear them
mention how the political climate in Europe and amongst wealthy tech workers
have been changing. The war in Ukraine has made the defense industry much more
palatable, as anyone that remembers how strong of a backlash Palantir and its
employees faced before the war.</p><p>Because the war in Ukraine has scared many tech workers, these companies have
felt comfortable crawling out of the woodworks, and are currently running a
massive PR campaign to normalize their place in our spaces.</p><p>It’s important to realize that we shouldn’t let them capitalize on the current
political landscape to cement themselves in our projects. While they may seem
more noble now that there is a more pressing military conflict that most people
seem to find a clear cut example of somewhere where there is no question about
the morality of supplying advanced weapons to help defeat the “enemies”, this
state wont last, and these companies have said that if approval should fall
again, they’ll go back into hiding.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p>Consider for a moment the value of these companies contribution to our projects.</p><p>They’re never gonna create much in terms of innovation. This is something we’ve
seen in NixOS, if anything, the clumsy Anduril engineers have caused more harm
than good, and their inexperience in the open source space is uncharacteristic
of most of the other corporations contributing to the codebase.</p><p>Likewise, while they do provide some sponsorship money, their comparative
contributions considering not only their multi billion size, but also the
damage to the reputation of these projects should make it obvious that they’re
getting a great bargain.</p><p>One of the ways in which they seem to have found of providing real value is in
the Rust community, in two ways. One is to provide access to their bought out
experts, like Jon. The other is providing fun events and other social
activities. While that isn’t obviously a net negative at first glance, consider
that what they’re really doing is just buying up the already present experts in
the community, essentially paying them to wear their logo to events. They don’t
add anything, aside from their name to the people already present in the
community.</p><p>Here it is obvious to me, that with a bit of insight, there is barely any
substantive difference between Anduril and Helsing — not in term of their
products or what political affiliations are most profitable to either, who cares
— but rather in the value proposition of inclusion into our community.</p><p>Consider that what both Anduril and Helsing brings isn’t technical
contributions, or barely, looking at the amount of commits by email signatures
from either companies domain to nixpkgs, it’s something below 50 in total.</p><p>What we do get is money, but then I ask, are we really for sale for a few
thousands of dollars, in exchange for providing a hiring platform for billion
dollar valuation companies. Should we really platform these companies for so
little? Even if you have no moral reservations, it’s undeniable that the damage
they cause to community cohesion, and by extension the projects progress and
harmony aren’t in the slightest outweighted by the few dollars they bring in,
and knowing organizations like NLNet, I’m not sure the more interesting sponsors
are gonna stay interested in association with a community that lets its
credibility be tainted for a few dirty war dollars.</p><p>Further, it’s obvious that any military contractor added as a sponsor to an
official NixOS event will tear apart the community at this point, providing a
last fatal punch to the project. There will not be any trust left to salvage,
and the efforts spend on a declarative and functional OS will move to another
project that doesn’t repeat these mistakes.</p><p>We should institute a blanket ban on any sponsorships by the defense sector, the
nuance can come much later, for now we should focus on surviving, not being
“fair” to billionaire’s pet investment projects. They give us nothing, they suck
out our soul, and cast the husk of our project aside at the slightest sign of
trouble.</p><p>Unlike the Nix community, the Rust community might find itself thinking that
it’s somehow in a better position than Nix, considering all the drama NixOS has
been through these past years, but you’re mistaken. Most of the “drama” is
really the side effects of legacy governance that’s been ironed out by
passionate contributors, and Rust users will likely find, with a bit of
introspection that you’re far behind against the new adversary of the modern
defense tech startup.</p><p>The Rust community’s financial base is made up of a much stronger coalition of
corporations, which hold a much tighter grip on governance, and by extension
culture, whether it be through tactical employments like that of Jon, or
through control of important technical projects or conferences with money and
talent.</p><p>Yet… the presence of Helsing is sadly a net negative on our community, and one
that is sowing the seeds for larger discord, just as we saw it in Nix, and one
day the ground is gonna fall out underneath, and the already fragile hiring pool
that these companies rely on, may move or fork out of the project. Whether or
not a project wide sponsorship policy is even possible is… hard, because the
Rust project is more fragmented, and larger events are also held by enterprise
actors, not just the foundation.</p><p>There is not gonna be an unified response, and it’s too far from the start of
the project at this point to make it a shared value to keep out military
involvement from the project. So what do you do?</p><p>You protest! You make your voice heard, in public. You make it uncool to be a
military contractors. You don’t give them the room to grow and fester, heck,
<strong>metastasize</strong> in the Rust project. Make it unattractive for conferences to
have military industrial ties. Make it embarrassing to work for a military
contractor, like in the past. There will not be as clean of a victory as is
potentially possible in Nix, but there can be something equally effective. But
there’s a long way to go until we get there…</p><p>[1]: This article is an example where the company is more open about its activities <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/helsing-ai-military-defense-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.wired.com/story/helsing-ai-military-defense-tech/</a></p><p>[2]: Crunchbase link <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/helsing/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/helsing/company_financials</a></p><p>[3]: Tech Crunch article on valuation and funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/defence-ai-startup-helsing-breaks-the-record-for-european-ai-raising-a-223m-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/defence-ai-startup-helsing-breaks-the-record-for-european-ai-raising-a-223m-series-b/</a></p><p>[4]: Mastodon Post <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jonhoo/110690175053904667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fosstodon.org/@jonhoo/110690175053904667</a></p><p>[5]: Kelsey Hightower wiki-article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Hightower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Hightower</a></p><p>[6]: Eelco Dolstra’s leadership is corrosive to the Nix project: <a href="https://save-nix-together.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://save-nix-together.org/</a></p><p>[7]: The open letter: <a href="https://github.com/IreneKnapp/NixOS-Users-Against-MIC-Sponsorship.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/IreneKnapp/NixOS-Users-Against-MIC-Sponsorship.github.io</a></p><p>[8]: NixOS board response <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552</a></p><p>[10]: Lix website <a href="https://lix.systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://lix.systems/</a></p><p>[11]: Aux website <a href="https://auxolotl.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://auxolotl.org/en/</a></p></section></article></div>
