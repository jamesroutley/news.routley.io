To be clear, Zuru could wipe </span><em>Webworm</em><span> off the face of the planet.</span></p><p><span>This move was covered by </span><em>Stuff </em><span>back in February: ‘</span><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300520880/kiwi-toy-giant-zuru-wants-to-identify-and-sue-former-workers" rel="">Kiwi toy giant Zuru wants to identify and sue former workers</a><span>’:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>New Zealand toy giant Zuru wants to sue former employees who posted serious allegations online about its company culture.</em></p><p><em>But there’s a problem — it doesn’t know who they are.</em></p><p><em>Documents filed in a United States District Court in California show Zuru intends to file a defamation lawsuit – in New Zealand – against one or more ex-workers who posted anonymous, critical reviews of the company.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>I’d assumed Zuru would be unsuccessful. Glassdoor is a giant website, acquired by a Japanese firm for </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/new-chapter/" rel="">$1.2 billion</a><span> four years ago. The secret to their success is that they bank on anonymity. </span></p><p><span>You’re hardly going to get former employees rattling off criticisms if their full name is there for everyone (</span><em>specifically their former or current employer</em><span>) to see. When you go to write a review on Glassdoor, the website is </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/mz-survey/start_input.htm?showSurvey=REVIEWS&amp;c=PAGE_HEADER_NAV" rel="">very clear</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong><span>What do you mean by anonymous?</span></strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span>This skips over the fact this perhaps </span><em>isn’t</em><span> the case when a company wants your head on a stick.</span></p><p><span>Glassdoor’s FAQ goes into a little more detail about how they will </span><a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/How-does-Glassdoor-respond-to-legal-requests-or-legal-action-to-find-out-who-posted-a-review?language=en_US" rel="">defend user anonymity</a><span>. They know this is vital their success:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“If you or your lawyers ask us to disclose a user’s identity, you should assume that we&#39;ll tell you that we don&#39;t provide this information upon request. We know that there can be serious consequences to a user whose identity is revealed, including retaliation or legal action by a current or former employer. </em></p><p><em><span>If you send us properly served legal documents seeking user information, we will </span><a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/article/employer/What-else-does-Glassdoor-do-to-protect-and-defend-the-anonymous-free-speech-of-its-users/en_US" rel="">respond as appropriate</a><span> to defend our users&#39; right to anonymous free speech. We will object to and resist subpoenas we receive. And, if necessary and as appropriate, we will appear in court to oppose and defeat your request.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p>This time, Glassdoor has failed.</p><p>While Glassdoor filed a motion to quash the whole thing, a judge has ruled in favour of Zuru.</p><p><span>Now, Glassdoor is legally required to release the contact details of the posters directly to Zuru, via Zuru’s attorneys. As the judge notes, “</span><em>Zuru intends to sue the reviewers in New Zealand</em><span>.”</span></p><p>Eek.</p><p>I reached out to Global Gateway Advisors, the PR reps for Glassdoor — who got me this statement back in exactly 32 minutes.</p><p>I imagine they knew this was coming.</p><blockquote><p><em>“We are deeply disappointed in the Court’s decision, which was effectively decided under New Zealand law.”</em></p><p><em>“We note that, contrary to Zuru’s contentions, the unflattering workplace experience reviews describing working at Zuru were authored by multiple former Zuru employees. </em></p><p><em>In this and many other cases worldwide, Glassdoor fights vigorously to protect and defend the rights of our users to share their opinions and speak freely and authentically about their workplace experiences, without fear of intimidation or retaliation.”</em></p></blockquote><p>“Without fear of intimidation or retaliation.” Not this time, I guess. </p><p>Glassdoor goes on:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our aim is to empower job seekers in New Zealand and around the world to have access to information from those who know companies best, the employees themselves, in support of our mission to help people everywhere find jobs and companies they will love.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This time, it appears Glassdoor has failed in this empowering mission. Certain members who wrote reviews — seemingly under the idea they were anonymous — now have their details heading to the worst possible place: The employer they slagged off.</p><p>An employer who has an excess of a billion or so dollars up their sleeves, and a lot of lawyers.</p><p><span>Why did this happen? Well, this sentence from Glassdoor is telling: </span><em>“We are deeply disappointed in the Court’s decision, which was effectively decided under New Zealand law.”</em></p><p>Reading through judge Alex Tse’s ruling, the fact those posting reviews were based in New Zealand was of real detriment to them.</p><p>Glassdoor argued that Zuru’s defamation claim lacked merit, for two main reasons: That the reviews didn’t contain defamatory statements because the reviews “constitute opinion,” and that Zuru failed to prove that it suffered a monetary loss.</p><p>On the latter — the judge pointed out this would be down for a kiwi court to decide, and also mentioned Zuru had already kinda proven this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Zuru hasn&#39;t simply alleged that it suffered a loss; Zuru’s cofounders declared, under penalty of perjury, that because of the negative reviews, Zuru had to spend more money to recruit job candidates for a particular position.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>As for their first point, statements of “pure opinion” are protected by the First Amendment in America. But New Zealand doesn’t have this. </span><em>Statements of opinion are not categorically protected. </em></p><p>Instead, it all comes down to “the honest-opinion defense”. </p><blockquote><p><em>“Here, then, the question under New Zealand law isn’t whether the reviews on Glassdoor.com were opinions, but whether, if they were opinions, they reflected the reviewers’ honest opinions. That question can’t be answered now. The reviewers haven’t even been identified, much less appeared in court and offered evidence on the genuineness of their opinions. Zuru, at this point, just wants discovery—to learn who wrote the reviews.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Which the judge has now granted.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png" width="567" height="352.9575" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/73b8864d-ccbb-49e1-8804-04aea3fa0806_800x498.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:498,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:567,&#34;bytes&#34;:138748,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;\&#34;Glassdoor&#39;s motion to quash, with two exceptions, is denied.
