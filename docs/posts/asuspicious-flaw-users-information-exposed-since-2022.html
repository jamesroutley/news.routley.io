    <h1>ASUSpicious Flaw – Users&#39; Information Exposed Since 2022</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
<p><small>Please note that it’s not particularly suspicious, it just made for a good play-on-words title.</small></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>What do most people do when they’re mistreated by a multi-billion dollar company after reporting a zero-day RCE to them? Certainly not find another zero-day exploit, but that’s exactly what I ended up doing. Read part one of <a href="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/">this series on ASUS here</a>.</em></p>
<p>I had recently spent a lot of hours trawling through decompiled C/C++ code in part one so I wanted something a little easier to read. This meant looking for executables made using C# since its decompilation creates a near perfect replica of the original code including file, function and variable names.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asus_p2/ilspy.png" alt="ilspy.png"/></p>
<p>After running a bash script to search for .net executables using the <code>file</code> command, I made a shortlist of about 10 files that piqued my interest. After examining the source code of them I found two that looked interesting, AsusSSO.dll and AsusAPI.dll used in their MyAsus software.</p>

<h2 id="finding-hard-coded-credentials">Finding hard-coded credentials</h2>
<p>When examining these I noticed they both contained encrypted hard coded values that were decrypted on the fly, and after isolating the decryption functions I asked ChatGPT to port it to Python so I could decrypt values independently of the DLL which ChatGPT managed to successfully replicate on its second attempt.</p>
<p>AsusAPI.dll encryption algorithm:

AsusSSO.dll encryption algorithm:
<img src="https://mrbruh.com/asus_p2/AsusSSO.png" alt="AsusSSO.png"/></p>
<p>After decrypting some of these values and reading over some of the functions using them I came to the conclusion that these were authorisation credentials and tokens for use with their API.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asus_p2/GetUserInfo.png" alt="GetUserInfo.png"/></p>
<p>My main concern was that these encrypted credentials may have unnecessarily permissive scopes that could facilitate malicious use if put in the wrong hands. This turned out to be true as <strong>the hard coded credentials had administrator level / unrestricted permissions that could be abused to access the information of any ASUS account.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-exploitable-endpoints">The Exploitable Endpoints</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the different endpoints I found and what could be done with them if you had the hard coded credentials.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/QuestionForm/GetCaseListByEmail</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This could list the ticket ID, Name and Date of any support issues filed by email</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/QuestionForm/UploadFile</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This would let you upload a text or image attachment to any support ticket if you had the ticket ID.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/QuestionForm/CreateCase</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This would let you create a new support ticket, which did not seem to do any server side validation on the content of it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/QuestionForm/GetCaseDetailByTopMail</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This retrieved the full details and conversation history of a support ticket via its ticket ID.</p>
<p><strong>PoC:</strong>

</video></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/repair-rest/rma/item/list/detail/customer-view/v1</strong> (unconfirmed)</li>
</ul>
<p>This would presumably return a list of RMA tickets for a specified customer, I was unable to test this due to not having my own RMA ticket to check.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/repair-rest/rma/item/repair/report/v1</strong> (unconfirmed)</li>
</ul>
<p>This would presumably return the full details of a RMA ticket similar to the support ticket API above.</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/v1/Openid/Login</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This would return the internal ID of any user if you sent the endpoint their email.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/api/v1/Member/GetUserData</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This would return the full information of any user if you provided their user ID. This information includes peoples <strong>Full Names, Date of Birth, Phone Numbers and Full Addresses.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After further research I concluded that this vulnerability has <strong>existed since August 2022</strong> when MyAsus first released and there is a chance that it was being actively exploited due to this vulnerabilities simplicity. This likely <strong>affects millions of accounts</strong> including those who made ASUS accounts for other products such as the ROG forums.</p>
<p>As seen above, the data that can be compromised includes peoples names, <strong>phone numbers</strong>, date of birth, <strong>addresses</strong>, the contents of any support tickets and potentially peoples RMA requests.</p>
<p>At this point I finished writing up the PoC’s and sent it off to ASUS with a detailed report on the matter.</p>
<h3 id="reporting-timeline-ddmmyyyy">Reporting Timeline (DD/MM/YYYY)</h3>
<ul>
<li>20/04/2025 - Stumbled upon AsusSSO.dll and AsusAPI.dll and started investigating.</li>
<li>23/04/2025 - Finished my investigation, wrote up PoC and sent vulnerability disclosure to ASUS. Had to remove PoC code since the form would block it (see part one)</li>
<li>24/04/2025 - Sent them the Python PoC’s manually via email.</li>
<li>29/04/2025 - Had to resend the PoC’s hosted externally because their mail system had silently blocked the email.</li>
<li>20/05/2025 - Vulnerability patched. (MyAsus 4.2.35.0 -  Security update: ASUS account log-in/sign-up change to Webview design)</li>
<li>11/06/2025 - ASUS acknowledges my plans to publish my writeup within the next two weeks.</li>
<li>20/06/2025 - Blog published.</li>
<li>31/07/2025 - Estimated release of CVE for this exploit according to ASUS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>
<p>As seen in part one of this blog, ASUS states that they do not offer bug bounties or even merch to security researchers.</p>
<p>I feel like I should point out that this behaviour is incredibly dangerous and may lead or has already lead to exploits not being reported or sold to threat actors due to there being next to no actual incentives for security researchers.</p>
<p>Almost everyone has their price, and for a lot of people 100-250k (Estimated black market price of the RCE in part 1) would make it hard to resist.</p>
<h2 id="fun-notes">Fun Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASUS asked me to test their patched builds- for free with no offer of compensation. When I stated I could not test their software for free, especially given the lack of bug bounty and my lack of free time as a university student, they never replied (to that email). They did however ask to “review” this blog before I publish it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions you can contact me on Signal (preferred) <code>@paul19.84</code> or via email <code>contact [at] mrbruh.com</code>. Emails are less likely to get a response unless you are a journalist.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>If you want to buy me a coffee I welcome donations to my Monero wallet: <code>86kC5fcDybnGSUdYgDfWXm83XRBTtqRrGN26Pofrxq9nNM7EAw237yzX1se7fF7kQeKMxrEEDb1gQbZWvR3Sht1J1dZAhYu</code></p>
