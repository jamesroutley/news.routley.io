    <h1>Digital Gardening in Obsidian</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, December 26, 2022</em></p><p>I have been using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for all my notes for something like 6 months now. That&#39;s really <em>everything</em>, from temporary measurements to journaling to serious documentation work. I&#39;ve tried Obsidian a couple of times before and bounced off of it, so I decided to try to do things differently this time. Instead of starting out by figuring out a system for where everything lives in advance, I&#39;ve just thrown almost everything in the default folder and sorted it out with linking and search.</p><p>Some structure has emerged over time, which I&#39;m fairly happy with, but it&#39;s more to do with practices than things that would make it easier for someone else to read my vault. These practices basically boil down to &#34;digital gardening&#34;—they allow me to keep things neat and tidy and observe growth without being overwhelmed by it. Here&#39;s some of what I do!</p><h2 id="rollup-journaling">Rollup Journaling</h2><p>I&#39;ve been keeping a log in my daily notes. These logs can contain answers to journal prompts like &#34;what have I been avoiding?&#34; but most of the time it&#39;s just a roughly accurate timestamped log of what I&#39;ve been up to in a given day.</p><p>Every Monday I summarize these daily notes into a weekly digest. These have more of a journaling flavor to them, since one of the goals is to help me discover patterns, but the template is still pretty basic: a header for highlights, one for lowlights, and one for things I want to change in the next week.</p><p>If the particular Monday I&#39;m doing this on also starts a new month, I&#39;ll also do a summary of the weeks in the previous month following the same basic pattern. Same for the last 3 months of monthly notes, if it happens to be the first Monday of April, July, October, or January. I haven&#39;t been doing this long enough to do a yearly rollup yet, but I may do a 2022 yearly rollup note in January.</p><p>I&#39;ve been really happy with this! The big benefit so far I&#39;ve seen is being able to see back in time with more clarity. There have been times this year where I&#39;ve felt stuck—like I&#39;m not making progress and haven&#39;t for a long time—but looking back in my notes I can see that I actually have done some pretty major things in the past year. This has had a nice side benefit that my end-of-year review at work was really easy to write: I just looked back at my quarterly reviews, as well as a few monthly ones, and pulled out some good stuff. It doesn&#39;t completely get rid of recency bias, but it does mean that I&#39;m not <em>only</em> focusing on stuff that happened in the last month or two.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if &#34;rollup journaling&#34; is the best name for this, but it&#39;s one that&#39;s stuck with me for some reason. I got the idea for doing this a couple years (and tries at Obsidian) ago based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzrEDnIye14">Britney Braxton&#39;s talk at JuneteenthConf 2020, <em>Journaling as a Dev</em></a>.</p><h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2><p>I&#39;ve been using the <a href="https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition">community spaced repetition plugin</a> to periodically review notes. It&#39;s a bit of a hack—this plugin is clearly not meant to be used like this—but it works.</p><p>I add a <code>#review</code> tag to every note that I want to periodically come back to and improve or tweak (this is actually most of my notes.) I then ask the spaced repetition plugin if there&#39;s anything for me to look at. If I make any changes, I&#39;ll mark the review as &#34;hard&#34; so the plugin will show it to me earlier. If I don&#39;t think it needs any changes, I&#39;ll mark it as &#34;easy&#34; to send it further into the future.</p><p>I&#39;m not terribly disciplined about doing this every day, but it has a nice benefit of improving notes that need to improve while sending ones that don&#39;t into the far future for me to get reminded of periodically.</p><p>I think I originally got the idea for this from an <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z36iMKLe4CDAXdtLSJD4Z6qPPFUS8ZXymUk3i">Andy Matuschak note</a>.</p><h2 id="pages-that-don-t-exist-but-should">Pages that Don&#39;t Exist, but Should</h2><p>When writing notes, I link freely, even if the page I&#39;m linking to doesn&#39;t exist yet. Then, every couple of days, I&#39;ll have a look at my &#34;pages that don&#39;t exist but should&#34; note, which has a <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">dataview</a> query that shows me all those nonexistent pages, ranked by how many incoming links they would have if they did exist.</p><p>For example, if I look at that page right now, I can see that I haven&#39;t made a note for Phoenix Liveview—I&#39;ve been looking into it for a side project and have made notes on a couple of conference talks where I&#39;ve linked to it. There&#39;s also a missing note for some features of the product I work on, since I&#39;ve mentioned them in daily notes.</p><p>I&#39;m fairly happy with this approach. It&#39;s a bit easier than looking for greyed-out nodes in the graph view, and over time it&#39;s lead to some interesting practices. For example, I started linking the names of my coworkers when I paired or collaborated with them on something, which eventually lead to keeping notes on what other teams around the company are responsible for. I&#39;m not sure I would have started that (quite useful) practice if I hadn&#39;t been paying attention to what &#34;<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Desire_path">desire paths</a>&#34; I was creating in my vault.</p><p>In case it&#39;s useful to someone else, here&#39;s the dataview script I embed for this. There&#39;s probably a better way to get this information, but it&#39;s been working well as-is. This version filters out daily notes and doesn&#39;t consider media files, but you may want to remove those lines if being prompted to create daily notes far in the past or future sounds useful to you:</p><pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>let </span><span>phantoms </span><span>=

</span></code></pre><h2 id="other-dataview-shenanigans">Other Dataview Shenanigans</h2><p>Other than the stuff mentioned above, I have a handful of useful dataview pages. For example, I&#39;m looking into replacing an older car we own right now. The page for that project has a dataview query summing up research I&#39;ve done into cars I might want to buy to replace it. I also have a view of everything tagged <code>#possible-blog-post</code> sorted by when I think I might want to publish it. None of these are huge, but they do a good job of gathering information from around my vault that I probably want to see all at once.</p><h2 id="anyway">Anyway</h2><p>That&#39;s how I organize my Obsidian vault. I have a few more plugins I use (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin">a calendar widget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes">improved daily notes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater">templater</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-map-view">a map view</a> for when I was looking at stuff to do on vacation) but that&#39;s the core of it. I hope you can take some of this and get use out of it for yourself!</p></article></div>
