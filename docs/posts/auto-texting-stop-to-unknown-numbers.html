    <h1>Auto-texting STOP to unknown numbers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’m sick of political spam texts. Here is a stupid solution.</p>

<p>I’m not telling you that you should do this. But this morning I made my phone auto-respond “STOP” to any unknown number:</p>



<p>Sharing iOS automations is weirdly annoying, so here is the logic written out:
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Make an automation that runs whenever a message contains &#34; &#34;
Have it do the following:

* Get phone numbers from shortcut input; call that P
* Find all contacts where ALL of the following are true:
    * Phone Number is P
    * Company is not &#34;ignore&#34; (this is mostly for testing)
* Assign those contacts to C

* If C does not have any value
* Send STOP to P
* Otherwise do nothing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could imagine extending this to look for keywords (like politician names) before responding, or to send a follow-up message explaining that the STOP was automated. But I do think it’s kinda funny to need to explain this behavior when I give someone my number.</p>

<p>Anyway the video above uses fake phone numbers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but the logic totally works. Here’s a vid of me scrolling through the automation if that’s helpful.</p>



<p>Anyway, uh, enjoy.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if there was a real way to opt out of texts like this!</p>
