Frank Herbert’s </span><em>Dune</em><span> imagined the Fremen attempting to terraform Arrakis. They succeeded technically but discovered too late (though Paul Atreides and the God Emperor Leto knew exactly what they were doing) they’d destroyed the desert ecology their entire civilization depended on. The sandworms died. The spice disappeared. Their power evaporated. Half a century after Herbert, </span><em>The Expanse</em><span> imagined the Protomolecule, alien biotechnology designed to hijack existing “self replicating systems” and reorganize it into building the Ring Gates. Both stories grasped the same insight: life is technology. Self-replicating, self-maintaining, infinitely adaptable. Deploy living systems at planetary scale and you’ll discover reciprocal dependencies you can’t escape.</span></p><p>In 1965, James Lovelock proposed this same idea as scientific hypothesis while working for NASA’s Viking missions. Earth’s atmosphere appeared too far from chemical equilibrium to be explained by geology alone. Life wasn’t simply adapting to planetary conditions. It was actively regulating them as much as it was responding to them. The Gaia hypothesis suggested that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings to maintain conditions suitable for life, effectively operating as a self-regulating system at planetary scale (though shocks like giant meteors and system disruptions can still collapse it).</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.governance.fyi/p/all-natural-geoengineering-with-frank?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/all-natural-geoengineering-with-frank?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>We see this with other creatures besides ourselves. </span><a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1494" rel="">Beavers are recognized as quintessential ecosystem engineers</a><span>, with remarkable abilities to modify ecosystems profoundly through dam construction, altering river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. </span><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/climate-science/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own-rainy-season/" rel="">The southern Amazon rainforest triggers its own rainy season</a><span> using water vapor from plant leaves, providing observational evidence that forests actively create their own weather systems.</span></p><p><span>On the practical sense?

High voltage direct current transmission could move gigawatts across continents; failure to deploy transmission infrastructure is purely policy failure.</span></p><p><a href="https://mattparlmer.substack.com/p/blitzrobotik" rel="">China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined</a><span>. Between 2017 and 2023, China increased robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers from 97 to ~470—a 5x increase. Over the same period, America’s robot density grew &lt;0.5x for a shrinking workforce. Chinese manufacturers can tool up production lines with 6-axis robot arms at $8,250 per unit (Borunte, 10kg payload, 0.05mm repeatability). No comparable Western alternative exists at this price point.</span></p><p>Financial capital flows to high-return financial engineering while physical capital accumulation stagnates. Biological geoengineering provides diffuse public benefits (flood protection, carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge) over decades, not concentrated private returns over quarters. Private capital won’t fund these systems at necessary scale. Public capital flows through procurement processes designed for conventional infrastructure, not living systems that mature over 5-20 years.</p><p><strong>Productive Overcapacity: The Marshall Plan Framework</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a2f3b927-d909-4eaa-9bac-c69675e41cd0" rel="">Martin Sandbu’s analysis of China’s surplus</a><span> provides the solution framework. Post-WWII America ran external surpluses exceeding 2% of GDP, yet industrial production grew strongly in both surplus America and deficit Europe simultaneously. US surplus earnings funded productive investments in European infrastructure through Marshall Plan structures that directed capital toward growth-enhancing uses.</span></p><p>The world faces massive infrastructure deficits while China manufactures restoration infrastructure components (solar panels, battery systems, precision sensors) at 30-50% of Western costs. This surplus production could be productively absorbed by biological geoengineering deployment—if financing mechanisms existed to direct it there. What’s needed: Infrastructure financing institutions specifically capitalized for biological geoengineering procurement, technology transfer frameworks allowing joint ventures, long-term purchase agreements giving manufacturers certainty to invest in automated production lines, and performance-based financing that pays for outcomes over time.</p><p><strong>Political Fragility: The Fate of Successful Programs</strong></p><p>Even if industrial capacity could be built, sustaining it requires political will that historically evaporates once systems succeed. Successful infrastructure becomes invisible, and invisible infrastructure becomes vulnerable. When systems work, citizens don’t see the research apparatus, maintenance programs, or policy coordination that made success possible. Politicians see “expensive programs” consuming budget without visible output. Budget cuts deliver immediate fiscal savings. The costs (system degradation, lost competitiveness, technological stagnation) materialize slowly over years.</p><p>This pattern repeats across successful public goods. American interstate highways, built in the 1950s-60s, enabled trillions in economic activity yet crumble from deferred maintenance because functional infrastructure generates no political urgency. NASA’s Apollo program put humans on the moon; its current budget is one-third of 1960s levels as percentage of federal spending. The Internet emerged from DARPA and NSF funding; once successful, both faced budget cuts as politicians questioned why government should fund “established” technology.</p><p>Biological geoengineering faces this same trap. If oyster reefs successfully protect coastlines, will politicians maintain funding for reef restoration research and deployment 20 years later? Or will successful coastal protection be taken for granted, making restoration programs easy targets during the next fiscal crisis?</p><p>Relying solely on institutional models creates political vulnerability. Successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures. </p><p><a href="https://www.wur.nl/en.htm" rel="">Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR)</a><span> demonstrates how to scale biological interventions, but only for agricultural and agritech applications, representing perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering’s total scope. </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming" rel="">Widely regarded as the world’s top agricultural research institution</a><span>, WUR is the nodal point of Food Valley, an expansive cluster of agricultural technology start-ups and experimental farms.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/netherlands-agriculture-technology/" rel="">The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter</a><span>, with </span><a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/strong-growth-in-dutch-agricultural-exports-driven-by-european-trade.htm" rel="">agricultural exports reaching €128.9 billion in 2024</a><span> (remarkable for a country holding only 0.04% of global agricultural land).

This model works brilliantly for agricultural interventions (disease-resistant crop varieties, fertilizer optimization, efficient irrigation). It does not solve manufacturing oyster reefs at scale, producing seeding drones, or building automated kelp farm infrastructure. Seed breeding requires laboratory facilities and experimental plots. Manufacturing Mother Reefs requires kilns, automated production lines, biosecure hatcheries, and coastal logistics networks (fundamentally different challenges requiring different institutional structures).</p><p><span>Yet even Wageningen faces vulnerability. </span><a href="https://www.resource-online.nl/index.php/2024/07/11/wur-tasked-with-80-million-in-budget-cuts/?lang=en" rel="">WUR announced in July 2024 it must cut spending by €80 million</a><span>. </span><a href="https://epgroningen.nl/disappearing-funding-and-disappearing-words-how-budget-cuts-and-government-policy-are-threatening-academic-research/" rel="">A 2019 Rabobank analysis found that every €1 of research and development capital resulted in €4.20 of added value for society</a><span>. The institution that enabled the Netherlands to become the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter faces budget cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Politicians see “expensive universities” consuming budget without visible output. The €4.20 return per €1 invested is diffuse (spread across thousands of farms, millions of consumers, decades of incremental improvement). This reveals a perverse dynamic: successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures. A functioning oyster reef production line (with invested capital, trained workers, established supply chains, and purchase contracts) is harder to dismantle through budget cuts than a university research program. Manufacturing capacity has political economy advantages over knowledge institutions: it’s visible, employs workers who vote, generates revenue, and involves private capital that resists expropriation.</span></p><p><span>Companies like </span><a href="https://oysterheaven.org/our-technology/" rel="">Oyster Heaven</a><span> and </span><a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/climate-adaptation-challenge/solutions/71420" rel="">Coastal Technologies Corp</a><span> have proven technical feasibility of oyster reef restoration. Economic barriers remain: oyster reefs need 5-10 years to provide comparable wave attenuation to traditional breakwaters; existing engineering liability insurance doesn’t cover biological systems; traditional infrastructure budgets don’t include line items for ecological monitoring. Wageningen’s approach suggests solutions: establish demonstration reefs at scale (10+ hectares) generating performance data for insurers and engineers; create public-private partnerships sharing risk and revenue from avoided coastal damages; train coastal managers in ecological engineering; integrate living shorelines into infrastructure codes. The Netherlands now requires nature-based solutions be evaluated alongside traditional engineering for any coastal project over €5 million, creating guaranteed market demand.</span></p><p>Climate impacts accelerate while biological systems require time to mature, from fast interventions like bioswales and seaweed farming (1-5 years) through medium-term oyster reef and mangrove restoration (5-20 years) to slow forest establishment for climate regulation (20+ years). Three responses address this mismatch: combine biological and engineered systems (Dutch flood management combines dikes for immediate protection with wetland restoration for long-term flexibility); accept partial solutions (young mangrove forests provide 30% of mature forest storm protection but sequester carbon at 3x the rate); deploy biological systems where speed advantages exist.</p><p><span>The real frontier isn’t choosing between engineered and biological systems but integrating them effectively. </span><a href="https://www.windtech-international.com/projects-and-contracts/van-oord-pilots-oyster-reef-restoration" rel="">Van Oord’s oyster reef integration with offshore wind infrastructure</a><span> demonstrates this: cultivating oyster larvae in hatcheries, then integrating oyster-bearing rocks into wind farms, subsea cabling, and breakwaters. This provides enhanced wave protection for wind farm foundations, biodiversity offsets required for construction permits, additional revenue from potential harvest, and simplified permitting. Integration requires professionals who understand both engineered and biological systems (a skill set current education systems don’t systematically produce).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg" width="1080" height="1080" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1080,&#34;width&#34;:1080,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;ArtStation - God Emperor of Dune&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="ArtStation - God Emperor of Dune" title="ArtStation - God Emperor of Dune" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!74V4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eba4bc2-c2b0-48ba-80ab-e37252eb1b71_1080x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Technical feasibility is proven. Beavers engineer watersheds, the Amazon manufactures weather, mangroves provide $855 billion in flood protection (planetary-scale infrastructure operating through Lovelock’s self-regulating mechanisms). But Section 5’s constraints reveal we’re nowhere close to climate-relevant deployment. Ecological mismatch and governance have solutions. Wageningen works brilliantly for agricultural applications but solves perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering (offering no template for manufacturing oyster reefs or seeding drones at scale). </p><p>Industrial capacity is the ultimate bottleneck: cheap electricity (China’s $0.09/kWh vs California’s $0.24/kWh), automated production (China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined), and capital allocation for diffuse public benefits over decades. Even Wageningen (returning €4.20 per €1 invested) faces €80 million in cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Three choices: build domestic capacity (expensive, slow, autonomous); leverage Chinese manufacturing (cheaper, faster, dependent); or accept biological geoengineering won’t scale, forcing us toward riskier interventions. Current trajectories suggest the third by default.</p><p>The Fremen succeeded technically (planted trees, established water cycles, created paradise) then discovered they’d destroyed the desert ecology sustaining them ( I mean, it’s all part of the Golden Path and the God Emperor did break himself down into the sand trout that become’s Dune’s iconic worms but that’s besides the point!). We’re making the opposite mistake. We understand biological systems remarkably well but haven’t built industrial capacity to deploy them at necessary speed and scale. </p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.governance.fyi/p/all-natural-geoengineering-with-frank?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/all-natural-geoengineering-with-frank?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></div>
