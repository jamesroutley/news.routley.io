            <p>
              Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the
              <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/efaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low Tech Electronics Faire</a>, a two-day event at Temple University in Philly. I led an
              <em>HTML Journal Workshop</em>, in which we crafted homepages on
              the web according to a simple
              <a href="https://journal.miso.town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec created by m15o</a>. As you can see in the screenshot above, my example website from
              the workshop also included cutting-edge graphic design motifs such
              as the Wingdings and Papyrus fonts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a great time at the faire, though it was a bit of a
              whirlwind. I had some great conversations with a bunch of people,
              met some internet friends IRL, built a tiny handmade speaker,
              learned about programming primitive computer games in BASIC, and
              purchased a LoRa mesh radio node from the
              <a href="https://iffybooks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iffy Books</a>
              table. I also enjoyed the art exhibition and talk series,
              especially Lori Emerson&#39;s talk about her book,
              <a href="https://loriemerson.net/books/other-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other Networks</a>. Andrei also came and taught a workshop on video synthesis.
              Unfortunately we had to miss some of the live performances, since
              we were quite tired by that point and had a long trip home ahead
              of us, but I heard they were great as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn&#39;t take any photos at all during the event, which is
              probably a testament to how busy I was having a good time and not
              looking at my phone. There might be some photos shared from the
              volunteer photographers I saw (some of who were shooting on film!)
              If they send me any of that documentation, I&#39;ll add them to this
              post.
            </p>

              The Electronics Faire is a yearly event organized by
              <a href="https://www.hannahtardie.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannah Tardie</a>, who also manages the Charles Library Makerspace at Temple. They
              did an amazing job putting everything together, with support from
              the other library staff and student volunteers. Thanks to everyone
              involved for an excellent array of programming and serendipitous
              convergence. I hope I can come back again next year!
