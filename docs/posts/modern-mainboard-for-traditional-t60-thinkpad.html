<p>New 11th gen motherboard based on the T61/T60 series</p>



<ul><li>Compatible chassis: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T60" target="_blank">T60</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T61" target="_blank">T61</a></li><li>Intel 11th gen 1165G7</li><li>Thunderbolt 4</li><li>All stock displays supported</li><li>eDP 1.4 display supported: up to 4K60</li><li>Coreboot supported</li><li><strong>Price for motherboard and peripherals: $1099USD</strong> <strong>(Price breakdown below)</strong></li></ul>







<p>The T700 project is a drop-in replacement motherboard for the TP T60 and T61 series of laptops. This consists of an aftermarket motherboard not produced by L that fits in the chassis with little to no modifications necessary. </p>



<p>The goal is to recreate the TP experience as much as possible, while incorporating the latest CPUs and technology. As the motherboard is not from L, it will require quite a bit of hands-on from the user to get the best experience out of the machine. It will be as stable as any other computer motherboard but will not have original TP software support and features. </p>

<p>The T700 will have full support for all stock displays, including widescreen displays. However, a batch of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190318140731/https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/thinkpad/led-kit.shtml" target="_blank">xiphmont’s kit</a> will be recreated and custom designed for the 15.0″ UXGA displays. This will incorporate the best of the 4:3 displays and bring it to modern standards.</p>



<h2><span id="eDP_modern_LED_panels">eDP modern LED panels</span></h2>



<p>The T700 has an eDP 1.4 port built-in, enabling up to 4K60 panels. The following panels are shortlisted as viable options:</p>

If anyone knows any viable panel, please let me know. </li></ul>







<p>The T700 will have coreboot ported over by 3mdeb. The cost of port is 10K EURO or more which is included in the price of the motherboard as well. Coreboot will not be present on launch and will have manufacturer BIOS but will be made available by a BIOS update. </p>



<p>At launch, the stock BIOS will not support Thunderbolt 4. The TB4 hardware is fully incorporated in the motherboard design though. Coreboot should enable full TB4 functionality once it has been fully ported.</p>







<p>As the LED backlight is still being looked into, there will only be an estimate pricing for full builds.</p>



<p>All prices listed are by TransferWise or USDT. PayPal will also be accepted but there will be an additional 10% surcharge. PayPal does not refund merchant cost in case of refunds and charges 4.45% on every transaction.</p>
