    <h1>Ford Is Going to 100% Online, Fixed-Price Sales for EVs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>The Ford brand will transition to exclusively online, fixed-price, delivered-to-your-door sales for EVs, CEO Jim Farley said, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to" data-product-url="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-vars-ga-product-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-id="8f0cc66a-f6ea-4e47-9739-cb2d4f63cd3a" data-vars-ga-product-price="2.00" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-id="" data-affiliate-network="" data-vars-ga-media-type="" data-affiliate="true">according to </a><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USA Today" data-product-url="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-vars-ga-product-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-id="8f0cc66a-f6ea-4e47-9739-cb2d4f63cd3a" data-vars-ga-product-price="2.00" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-id="" data-affiliate-network="" data-vars-ga-media-type="" data-affiliate="true">USA Today</a>.</em></p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve got to go to non-negotiated price. We&#39;ve got to go 100 percent online. There&#39;s no inventory (at dealerships), it goes directly to the customer. And 100 percent remote pick up and delivery,&#34; he said during Bernstein&#39;s Annual Strategic Decisions Conference, per <em>USA Today.</em></p><p>It&#39;s unclear if Ford also plans to implement this sales strategy shift for its non-EV products. </p><p>Farley went on to say that he sees the physical locations of dealers as a huge opportunity to push an edge over competitors, but that the current stores will have to radically evolve. Dealers can do it, he said, &#34;but the standards are going to be brutal.&#34; </p>






<p>The fixed-price model has been trialed by countless new car dealerships, <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a36673767/are-carvana-offers-real/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a36673767/are-carvana-offers-real/">used car chains</a>, and even manufacturers like Saturn. Yet it was Tesla that showed that a successful automaker could fully rely on fixed-price sales. The EV juggernaut also pioneered an online ordering system that so-called legacy automakers have been struggling to replicate. If Ford wants to be a huge player in this and take advantage of what Farley sees as a historically significant market-share land grab, the company has to adapt to give the customers what they want. Right now, as <em>USA Today </em>notes, Ford estimates that it spends $2000 more than Tesla per car on distribution.</p><p>The company also intends to massively scale back advertising for its EVS, another way it has to adapt. &#34;If you ever see Ford Motor Co. doing a Super Bowl ad on our electric vehicles, sell the stock,&#34; he said. </p><p>For the full breakdown of Farley&#39;s remarks, check out <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the USA Today story" data-product-url="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcars%2F2022%2F06%2F01%2Fev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft%2F7474822001%2F%3Fgnt-cfr%3D1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/?gnt-cfr=1" data-vars-ga-product-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-id="8f0cc66a-f6ea-4e47-9739-cb2d4f63cd3a" data-vars-ga-product-price="2.00" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-id="" data-affiliate-network="" data-vars-ga-media-type="" data-affiliate="true">the <em>USA Today </em>story </a>which explores post-sales service, the role of the Super Duty and other gas guzzlers, EV profitability, custom cars for Uber and Lyft, Chinese <em></em>EVs, and &#34;very large consolidation.&#34;<em></em></p><p><em>Road &amp; Track </em>has reached out to Ford for additional comment and will update this story if we hear back. <em></em></p>
