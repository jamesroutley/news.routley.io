<p data-block-key="hveln">Sometimes <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/three-ways-i-exercise-in-my-apartment/">I exercise with friends via videocall</a>, but when I want to exercise by myself, I often listen to stuff. I like having a mix of things to concentrate on and things I can half-listen to while keeping count of my situps and whatnot. A few longish recommendations you can listen to for free:</p><p data-block-key="5m9ve"><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a>: an interview podcast about people who started things that became substantial organizations. I particularly remember enjoying the episodes about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/07/604382242/dermalogica-jane-wurwand">Dermalogica</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/14/570526158/live-episode-black-entertainment-television-robert-johnson">Black Entertainment Television</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/690686584/jetblue-airways-david-neeleman">JetBlue Airways</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/13/551871365/southwest-airlines-herb-kelleher">Southwest Airlines</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/05/974090406/rick-steves-europe-rick-steves">the Rick Steves travel empire</a>.</p><p data-block-key="dep6c"><a href="https://freshtext.fireside.fm/">Fresh Text</a>: a Christianity podcast &#34;in which Pastor-scholars discuss a scripture passage and swap sermon starter ideas. This weekly podcast is especially (though not exclusively) useful for preachers who follow revised common lectionary.&#34; I kind of find it soothing to half-listen to the episodes in which <a href="https://freshtext.fireside.fm/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=amanda">a married couple (the regular host and his wife, who&#39;s also a pastor-scholar)</a> nerd out about translations, share reminiscences, and defer generously to each others&#39; interpretations.</p><p data-block-key="e2to5">BBC audio fiction: I recommend to your attention the <a href="https://raven.dreamwidth.org/829696.html">hilarious, profoundly moving, elegant three-hour work of art</a> that is the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk97n/episodes/player">9th season (&#34;Series 9&#34;) of the sketch comedy show <i>John Finnemore&#39;s Souvenir Programme</i></a>. I also laughed and cried at the recent-history musical <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000d6yy"><i>Magnitsky: the Musical</i></a> which includes an impressively riveting &#34;how the complicated paperwork con works&#34; scene. In audio! I&#39;m nearly done with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00161rf">a musical adaptation of <i>Rossum&#39;s Universal Robots</i></a> which was funny enough in Part I that I fully did not expect choking up during Part II. I have not yet tried <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010glpd"><i>Kafka the Musical</i> starring David Tennant</a> nor <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mrgn"><i>Beethoven Can Hear You</i> starring Peter Capaldi</a>. I had a pretty uneven time with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015l42"><i>Hall of Mirrors</i></a>, the musical about John Maynard Keynes at the Versailles peace conference following the Great War. It looks like the BBC has a whole ongoing project funding new cerebral audio musicals? My muscles thank them!</p>
