    <h1>PSA VII</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>In this installament of my famous series of PSAs, I want to announce that I’ll be talking about Carp for a little more than half an hour in New York City on the 23rd of October! The talk is organized by the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> and is part of their <a href="https://www.recurse.com/localhost">Localhost talk series</a>. I’m honored to be part of the illustrous group of people who have spoken there!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-veit-heller">RSVP</a> right now if you’d like to see me and are in the area! Sadly, the talk will not recorded, but I expect that I’ll be talking about Carp more than anyone cares to hear in the coming future.</p>
<p>If you’d like a little bit more information before RSVPing, you can also <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/142-localhost-15-veit-heller-on-carp-a-programming-language-for-the-21st-century">read the announcement</a> of my blog post on the Recurse blog!</p>
