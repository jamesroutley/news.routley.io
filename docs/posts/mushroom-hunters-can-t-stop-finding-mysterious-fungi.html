    <h1>Mushroom hunters can&#39;t stop finding mysterious fungi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Strange things appear in the forests and chaparral of California after a big rain. Invigorated by the damp, fungi living quietly in the soil sprout fruiting bodies. Some have the familiar mushroom shape of a stalk and a cap, but others resemble fluorescent corals, wads of clear brown jelly, brilliant yellow buttons — bizarre forms visible to the naked eye for only a brief window while the organisms release their spores.</p><p>With each emergence comes a chance for mushroom hunters to identify new species. As many as 95 percent of the planet’s fungal species have yet to be described, according to a 2023 report from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. For some years now, professional mycologists and hobbyists alike have been using DNA sequencing on foraged fungi, said Mandie Quark, a mycologist and the communications lead for California’s <a href="https://fundis.org/observe/ca-fundis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fungal Diversity Survey</a>, which aims to add sequences from tens of thousands of fungi to scientific databases. With sequencing, fungus enthusiasts often identify fungi that are the first examples of their kind in the databases.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/11/multimedia/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/11/multimedia/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/11/multimedia/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq/00SCI-MUSHROOM-DNA-quark-vcgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A portrait of Mandie Quark and Alan Rockefeller in their garage lab.

Red-and-white paper takeout boxes, each containing a fungus rather than a corn dog or French fries, piled up on picnic tables. In a makeshift lab, volunteers demonstrated how to extract DNA from the growths. Sequencing a short region of each fungus’s genetic code can tell them apart.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Reiner, expert mushroom identifier, discussed the different mushrooms foraged during SOMA camp.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><figcaption><span>SOMA campers examining their haul; Cynthia Le smelling a clitocybe she found at Salt Point State Park; an identification guide.</span></figcaption></div></div><div><p>Once collectors receive a match for their sequence, they can enter the information on iNaturalist, a website where hobbyists can share observations of the natural world. Meanwhile, organizations like the Ohio Mushroom DNA Lab and Mycota Lab, founded by Stephen Russell, a biochemist at the University of Michigan, enter the sequences into scientific databases accessible to the research community. This way, the information generated by dispersed networks of foragers can be funneled directly to scientists and conservation organizations.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mikhael Selk with mushrooms he foraged in Occidental, Calif.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fiorella Lema with a mushroom species known as a golden turkey or a dyer’s polypore she found on an organized mushroom hike at Salt Point State Park.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Recent years have brought an explosion in sequencing, Ms. Quark said. More than 21,000 samples have already been sequenced this year, she said, up from 5,600 in 2022. “We will probably end the year with over 40,000,” she said.</p><p>And there are still many fungi left to be identified. Some of these organisms, living as a network of threads hidden in the soil, may not have sent up a fruiting body in years. But after a drenching rain in Southern California, collectors might encounter mushrooms that have not been seen for decades, Ms. Quark said.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Reiner and Debbie Klein documenting the mushrooms collected during camp in their makeshift lab.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><figcaption><span>Darrian Wagy photographed a birds nest fungus; several types of mushroom, including, left to right, top to bottom, a wax cap, candy cap, cremoricolor, a yellow-gilled Cypress leplota, jelly baby and jelly antler; foragers learning how to DNA barcode at a SOMA camp workshop.</span></figcaption></div></div><div><div><p>Generating sequences from fungi in the soil, then, may be the next step. Only then will it be possible to get a handle on the true diversity of fungal species in North America, and, as the climate changes, consider ways to conserve what lies beneath the surface.</p><p>“We are at this incredible fulcrum right now, where we need to figure this out,” Ms. Quark said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
