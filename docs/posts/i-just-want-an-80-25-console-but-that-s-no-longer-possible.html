    <h1>I just want an 80×25 console, but that&#39;s no longer possible</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Somehow along the way, a feature that I’ve had across DOS, OS/2, FreeBSD, and Linux — and has been present on PCs for more than 40 years — is gone.</p>
<p>That feature, of course, is the 80×25 text console.</p>
<p>Linux has, for awhile now, rendered its text console using graphic modes.  <a href="https://blog.dowhile0.org/2022/04/22/fedora-36-a-brave-new-drm-kms-only-world/">You can read all about it here.</a>  This has been necessary because only PCs really had the 80×25 text mode (Raspberry Pis, for instance, never did), and even they don’t have it when booted with UEFI.</p>
<p>I’ve lately been annoyed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The console is a different size on every screen — both in terms of size of letters and the dimensions of it</li>
<li>If a given machine has more than one display, one or both of them will have parts of the console chopped off</li>
<li>My system seems to run with three different resolutions or fonts at different points of the boot process.  One during the initrd, and two different ones during the remaining boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, I wanted to run some software on the console that was designed with 80×25 in mind.  And I’d like to be able to plug in an old VGA monitor and have it just work if I want to do that.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t be so hard, right?  Well, the old <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/svga.html">vga=</a> option that you are used to <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/svga.html">doesn’t work when you booted from UEFI or on non-x86 platforms</a>.  Most of the tricks you see online for changing resolutions, etc., are no longer relevant.  And things like setting a resolution with GRUB are useless for systems that don’t use GRUB (including ARM).</p>
<p>VGA text mode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_text_mode#Fonts">uses 8×16 glyphs in 9×16 cells</a>, where the pixels are non-square, giving a native resolution of 720×400 (which historically ran at 70Hz), which should have streched pixels to make a 4:3 image.</p>
<p>While it is possible to select a console font, and 8×16 fonts are present and supported in Linux, it appears to be impossible to have a standard way to set 720×400 so that they present in a reasonable size, at the correct aspect ratio, with 80×25.</p>
<p>Tricks like <tt>nomodeset</tt> no longer work on UEFI or ARM systems.  It’s possible that <a href="https://github.com/Aetf/kmscon">kmscon</a> or something like it may help, but I’m not even certain of that (video=eDP1:720×400 produced an error saying that 720×400 wasn’t a supported mode, so I’m unsure kmscon would be any better.)  Not that it matters; all the kmscon options to select a font or zoom are broken, and it doesn’t offer mode selection anyhow.</p>
<p>I think I’m going to have to track down an old machine.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
