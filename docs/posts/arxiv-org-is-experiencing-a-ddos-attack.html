    <h1>Arxiv.org is experiencing a DDoS attack</h1>

		<p><span>arXiv users may be experiencing email disruption due to a DDOS attack. Over the past few days, a small number of users issued over a million email change requests.</span></p>
<p><span>These requests originated from over 200 IP addresses – almost all owned by an ISP for a particular province in China. The confirmation emails for this volume of requests overwhelmed our email service. As a result, many arXiv users may not have received their daily emails. And other users may not have received their confirmation emails for registering accounts, or legitimate email change requests.</span></p>
<p><span>We are taking measures to mitigate this attack, including temporarily blocking certain IP ranges. </span><span>Unfortunately, this may mean some legitimate users will be unable to access arXiv until this issue is resolved. We will shortly be reaching out to the abuse desk of the affected ISP for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>arXiv operates with a very small development and operations staff. We’re really not equipped to combat DDOS attacks and must rely on the goodwill of the world community in order to continue offering our services.</span></p>
<p>We apologize to any arXiv users that have been affected by this disruption.</p>
<p>We will continue monitoring the situation and update the community.</p>
