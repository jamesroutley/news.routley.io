    <h1>Dead and Reborn</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I have abandoned my blog for a long time. This might be due to my sub par writing skills in English, a lack of time or—most likely—a mixture of both. I would like to change that, though, and I hope I will with this new format. It also means that I had to move from <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was never my thing to begin with, to a more DIY platform.</p>
<p>This blog solely consists of static pages that I write in markdown and then convert to <code>html</code>, not unlike <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> would do it. This tool, however, is written in <a href="https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto">zepto</a>, my own concoction. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for today! Have a pleasant start into 2017 and be sure to check back every once in a while.</p>
