<p><a href="http://proton.me">Proton</a>, the secure-minded email and productivity suite, is becoming a nonprofit foundation, but it doesn&#39;t want you to think about it in the way you think about other notable privacy and web foundations.</p>
<p>&#34;We believe that if we want to bring about large-scale change, Proton can’t be billionaire-subsidized (like Signal), Google-subsidized (like Mozilla), government-subsidized (like Tor), donation-subsidized (like Wikipedia), or even speculation-subsidized (like the plethora of crypto “foundations”),&#34; Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post announcing the transition. &#34;Instead, Proton must have a profitable and healthy business at its core.&#34;</p>
<p>The announcement comes exactly 10 years to the day after a crowdfunding campaign saw 10,000 people give more than $500,000 to launch Proton Mail. To make it happen, Yen, along with co-founder Jason Stockman and first employee Dingchao Lu, endowed the Proton Foundation with some of their shares. <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">The Proton Foundation</a> is now the primary shareholder of the business Proton, which Yen states will &#34;make irrevocable our wish that Proton remains in perpetuity an organization that places people ahead of profits.&#34; Among other members of the Foundation&#39;s board is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of HTML, HTTP, and almost everything else about the web.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Of particular importance is where Proton and the Proton Foundation are located: Switzerland. As Yen noted, Swiss foundations do not have shareholders and are instead obligated to act &#34;in accordance with the purpose for which they were established.&#34; While the for-profit entity Proton AG can still do things like offer stock options to recruits and even raise its own capital on private markets, the Foundation serves as a backstop against moving too far from Proton&#39;s founding mission, Yen wrote.</p>
<h2>There’s a lot more Proton to protect these days</h2>
<p>Proton has gone from a single email offering to a wide range of services, many of which specifically target the often invasive offerings of other companies (read, mostly: Google). You can now take your cloud files, passwords, and calendars over to Proton and use its VPN services, most of which offer end-to-end encryption and open source core software hosted in Switzerland, with its notably strong privacy laws.
</p><p>None of that guarantees that a Swiss court can&#39;t compel some forms of compliance from Proton, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/privacy-focused-protonmail-provided-a-users-ip-address-to-authorities/">happened in 2021</a>. But compared to most service providers, Proton offers a far clearer and easier-to-grasp privacy model: It can&#39;t see your stuff, and it only makes money from subscriptions.</p>
<p>Of course, foundations are only as strong as the people who guide them, and seemingly firewalled profit/non-profit models <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-says-company-could-become-benefit-corporation-information-2024-06-15/">can be changed</a>. Time will tell if Proton&#39;s new model can keep up with changing markets—and people.</p>
