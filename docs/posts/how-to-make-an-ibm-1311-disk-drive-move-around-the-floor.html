<p>The question &#39;<a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2261/can-a-usr-command-damage-a-zx-spectrum">Can a USR command damage a ZX Spectrum?</a>&#39; has led me to wonder if there was once a microcomputer that could actually be damaged by software.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<p>Is there a case that a microcomputer, using its default shipped hardware configuration (i.e. no added interfaces and the like), could be permanently damaged (requiring service to return to working order) just by writing a program and letting it execute it?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not talking about damage to elements connected to it (such as the monitor, a disk drive or a printer) but to the computer itself.</p>

<p>This was, and often still is, a deliberate design feature of safety critical computers.</p>

<p>The Harmon VHLC, which is a 80186-based solid state interlocking used for railway signalling has been around since the late 1980s.  Its two CPUs cross-check each other every 39ms to make sure that they are at the same point in the program and agree on the value of certain key registers.  If one processor decides that the other processor is misbehaving, it can write to a memory mapped I/O address that switches 110V into the 5V input.  This is a deliberate ploy to kill the misbehaving processor so that the system fails safe.</p>

<p>This technique of multiple processors cross-checking each other is common practice if designing to Safety Integrity Level 4, as defined by CENELEC.</p>

    <p>My teacher asked me the question back when I was in college.  My answer was to write in assembly a simple command that asked the hard drive arm to read well beyond what it was allowed.  This caused the hardware to burn out making the hard drive inoperable.  Hard drives now have a safety precaution built in to avoid this scenario.</p>

<p>Some retro computers such as the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC did not fully decode I/O addresses. Instead they used a single address line to select each I/O chip, so it was possible (by using an invalid I/O address) to enable two or more chips at the same time. If the two chips are putting different data on the bus then they are shorting each other out, which could damage their bus drivers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not particularly &#34;retro&#34;, but many x86 computers in the early Pentium IV era could be permanently damaged in a matter of weeks by setting the operating voltage and frequency too high.  This would cause the CPU to run hot and literally cook itself.</p>

<p>Earlier computers used jumpers rather than software controls for these settings, and later computers had better safeguards and thermal management.</p>

<p>The PDP-10 (KA-10 model) is a retro-computer but not a retro-<em>micro</em>-computer.  But maybe you&#39;ll allow it.</p>
<p>A friend in college programmed a few PDP-10 assembly language routines for multi-precision integer arithmetic (aka bignums).  He ran it to compute 50000! and Harvey Mudd College&#39;s PDP-10 crashed.  And wouldn&#39;t restart.  PDP-10 service was called, they came out, and replaced a burnt-out set of machine registers.  Well, that was a coincidence.</p>
<p>He ran it again: same thing happened.  The PDP-10 service guy was perturbed: Whatever you were doing, don&#39;t do it again!  I&#39;m not coming back for this!</p>
<p>The PDP-10 has 16 registers.  You can refer to them in the register field of instructions - or you can refer to them as addresses 0..15 in the addressing field of instructions:  In other words, the PDP-10 registers are <em>addressable</em> like main memory.  And this works throughout the machine: You can jump to address 5 (say) and start executing instructions <em>out of the registers</em>.</p>
<p>But the registers were transistors - not <em>core</em> memory - and thus it was much faster to fetch instructions from registers than main memory.  And if you had a tight little loop where you could fit your data <em>and</em> your instructions in registers - it would really fly.  Which is the way my friend wrote this code.</p>
<p>But actually, the registers apparently weren&#39;t designed for the 100% duty cycle of adding instruction fetches to data read/write.  So they could overheat, and burn up, when calculating, say, 50000!.</p>

<p>As I explained in <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/1841/409">my answer to Can removing a cartridge from an NES (or any other cartridge-based game system) damage the hardware or software?</a>, the NES can be damaged by software.</p>
<p>The 2C02 PPU in the NES normally reads the background color from palette index 0, but this isn&#39;t hard-wired into the chip -- it actually reads the palette index of the background from four EXT pins. These pins are grounded on the NES, forcing the palette index to 0, but an arcade board using the 2C02 or a similar chip could connect these pins to another PPU.</p>
<p>Bit 6 of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Controller_.28.242000.29_.3E_write%20PPUCTRL" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PPUCTRL</a> selects whether the PPU should run in master or slave mode. If the PPU is in master mode, it reads the palette index from the EXT pins as explained above, but in slave mode, <em>it outputs the palette indices it is currently drawing to the EXT pins</em>.</p>
<p>This way, the images from two PPUs can be layered. The slave PPU draws one image, and the master draws another image on top of that and outputs the combined images.*</p>
<p>The NES didn&#39;t use that feature, but the hardware still exists in the PPU. If the PPU is set to slave mode, it will attempt to output the background palette index to the EXT pins. If it outputs a 1 to any of these pins, it will cause a short from Vcc, through the PPU, and to ground (because the EXT pins are grounded), possibly damaging the PPU.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>*: The image generated by the slave PPU can only use colors from the background palette of the main PPU because there are only 4 EXT pins, not 5.</sup></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620" rel="noreferrer">IBM 1620</a> is a retro-computer but not a retro-micro-computer. But maybe you&#39;ll allow it.</p>
<p>You could get it with a hard disk drive - one of those washing machine-sized cabinets that had replaceable multi-platter disks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_1311" rel="noreferrer">Here&#39;s a picture in a wikipedia article</a> - note that the disk pack on top weighed 10 pounds and rotated at 1500rpm, and had 14&#34; metal platters.  So you can imagine how big the multi-platter read head was - and how fast it had to move (light as it was), and also how much mass and momentum was involved in that spinning disk at the top of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was a thick multi-wire cable attaching the drive to the main computer cabinet.  And in the installation I was familiar with - at the local junior college (Pierce Jr College) in Los Angeles - the drive wasn&#39;t &#34;embedded&#34; into a raised floor - it was just sitting on it&#39;s 4 little legs and the cable went under one of those plastic tunnels.</p>
<p>So the guys hanging around the computer lab were friendly to high schoolers and would show them stuff if they were curious.  Like me.  And one day they showed me a single-card program that sent the drive head back and forth from cylinder to cylinder in a narrowing sequence, e.g., <code>0 - 99 - 0 - 99 - 0 - 99 - 1 - 98 - 1 - 98 - 1 - 98 - 2 - 97 - ...</code></p>
<p>After a bit of this the drive would start to vibrate a bit, then start vibrating like an unbalanced washing machine, then it would <em>really</em> start to go ... you&#39;d found the resonant frequency where the heads bashing back and forth would interact with the entire device.</p>
<p>And then you&#39;d flip one of the console switches on the 1620 and the program would just start seeking between the two last tracks - <code>... - 32 - 68 - 32 - 68 - 32 - 68 - ...</code>.</p>
<p>And the drive would start walking across the floor, dragging its cable behind it.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&#39;t see it, but they told me that one time they let it go so far that it pulled its own cable out of the plug.  Stopping it, of course.</p>
<p>Does that count as &#34;damaging&#34; the machine?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t suppose an IBM System 370/145 counts as a microprocessor, but let me tell you the story anyway as best I remember it. In 1975 or so, Boston University was running a home-grown operating system on its System 370. It had the typical mainframe peripherals of the day, including disks, tape drives, card reader, card punch, and a line printer, all in a raised-floor machine room. The line printer could be commanded (using privileged I/O instructions) to open its cover so the operator could load more fan-fold paper or change the print ribbon. My housemates and I were students, and one of us (Lew Nathan) made a bet with one of the OS developers that he could write a user-mode program to get the line printer to open. The program he wrote was a loop that repeatedly printed a full line of underscore characters followed by a carriage return WITHOUT a line feed. So a full line across was printed endlessly at the same spot on the paper. Lew&#39;s intention was to cut the paper in half, which the printer would sense, and would respond to by sounding an alarm and opening so it could be reloaded. What actually happened was that he also shredded the ribbon, so when the printer opened a cloud of (electrically conductive?) ink-coated ribbon shreds were wafted into the air and settled everywhere, including being drawn into the processor by the cooling fans. That shut down the computing center until everything could be cleaned. So that&#39;s a user-mode program that damaged the processor (admittedly by means of a peripheral). Sorry I can&#39;t do better.</p>

<p>The original MSX specification requires the AY-3-8910 sound chip to be included as part of the hardware, and indeed many machines (like the Philips VG-8020/00, for example) were built using that chip.</p>
<p>This chip has two 8-bit I/O ports, and the decision of whether a port is an input or an output is made by software. In the MSX, one of the ports is used for input, and the other for output. The input port is used for the joystick and the cassette. If it&#39;s configured as output by the software, it&#39;s possible to short-circuit one or several of the lines that get to the port, which can lead to permanent damage.</p>
<p>Later machines typically use the Yamaha S3527 chip, which integrates several functions necessary in MSX computers, among them a sound generator compatible with the AY-3-8910. But in this chip, the port direction bit for the joystick/cassette port is not honoured: the port is an input regardless of the setting, therefore this problem does not exist.</p>
<p>This is known as the &#34;unsafe port directions&#34; problem. The openMSX emulator emits a warning when it detects a program that does this.</p>

<p>Damaging the computer itself is hard to imagine, but damaging peripherals is much easier. Back in the early days of Linux (94-95), configuring the X11 server (that put graphics on the screen) required you to define video modes by specifying them in terms of clock rates listed in a text based configuration file. Unfortunately, this was not at all intuitive, and you ran the risk of damaging at least some monitors that didn&#39;t have adequate internal safeguards. This resulted in the XFree86 HOWTO having this friendly bit of language as a disclaimer (Emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shouldn&#39;t use monitor timing values or ModeLine values for monitors other than the model that you own. If you attempt to drive the monitor at a frequency for which it was not designed, <strong>you can damage or even destroy it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time I first set this up, I was a full time college student that&#39;d just spent around $1,200 on a then state-of-the art Sony 17 inch monitor (GDM-17SE1). </p>

<p>Starting up X11 for the first time was more than a bit nerve wracking.</p>

<p>(<em>Edit</em>: One additional bit of damage you could do wasn&#39;t hardware... but you could make the argument that it&#39;s worse.  When Microsoft first introduced write buffering to the smartdrv disk cache, it would sometimes defer writes for longer than it probably should have... including to file location metadata. Combine this with the lack of memory protection, and it should not be a surprise that at least one errant memory write from software I was developing crashed the system before the cache was flushed and corrupted virtually the entire contents of the disk.)</p>

<p>Maybe what you&#39;re looking for is the semi-mythological halt-and-catch-fire instruction?</p>

<p>Several of the Motorola processors had an instruction or two that put the CPU itself into a HALT state, but cycled the address lines from 0 to 65535 endlessly. This was great for testing, since you could check for address decode errors and such quite easily. </p>

<p>The only way out was hard reset or cycling power.</p>

<p>These were jokingly called &#34;HCF&#34; by some engineers, but, of course, it would take a poorly designed bit of hardware to actually be damaged permanently by it. </p>

<p>The wikipedia page</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire</a></p>

<p>has a little bit more on the subject of invalid op codes putting the CPU into a state requiring power cycling or hard reset. It mentions one possible (apocryphal) scenario in the pre-microprocessor world, of a magnetic core design that might burn the control lines.</p>

<p>Thinking of the sort of things a hobbiest might build, one could imagine something like improperly designed dynamic RAM circuits or even data buffers with too much loading that could be burned out by a CPU&#39;s HALT state. But I think hobby projects don&#39;t count for this question.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not too much of a stretch, to add to the &#34;over-exercising the drive&#34; examples, <a href="http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/06/making-crash-bandicoot-part-5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">per one of the developers of Crash Bandicoot for the original Playstation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kelly is a smart guy, and a good game critic, but he had a lot more to
  worry about than just gameplay.  For example, whether Crash was
  physically good for the hardware!</p>
  
  <p>Andy had given Kelly a rough idea of how we were getting so much
  detail through the system: spooling.  Kelly asked Andy if he
  understood correctly that any move forward or backward in a level
  entailed loading in new data, a CD “hit.”  Andy proudly stated that
  indeed it did.  Kelly asked how many of these CD hits Andy thought a
  gamer that finished Crash would have.  Andy did some thinking and off
  the top of his head said “Roughly 120,000.”  Kelly became very silent
  for a moment and then quietly mumbled “the PlayStation CD drive is
  ‘rated’ for 70,000.”</p>
  
  <p>Kelly thought some more and said “let’s not mention that to anyone”
  and went back to get Sony on board with Crash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think it doesn&#39;t hit the definition of a retro <em>computer</em>, but on the Playstation not only could a sequence of instructions damage the hardware, but one of the best-selling pieces of software was knowingly likely to do so.</p>

<p>A straight, simple CPU and memory arrangement of a (sufficiently simple) computer is made to start from a reproducible state after RESET into the next deterministic state. </p>

<p><em>Permanent damage</em> requires <em>permanent storage</em> or the <em>ability to change something permanently</em> in a computer through the ability to control external circuitry - and early home computers didn&#39;t have such luxury items. Even if you might (theoretically) be able to drive the same bus line from two devices to a conflicting state (which would be the closest to being able to damage anything), this is not very probable to really cause permanent damage to TTL and early CMOS chips - Early electronics can stand such a strain for quite some time, most even forever.</p>

<p>When more modern devices started to have EEPROM or Flash memory that could be permanently changed to store configuration data or have upgradable firmware, it became easier to permanently brick them. But I would deliberately exclude such devices here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that floppy drive &#34;music&#34; (using low level head/motor instructions to create noises/frequencies and play music) isn&#39;t very good for a computer internal floppy disk.</p>
<p>(For instance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NYbd5AcwPY" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NYbd5AcwPY</a>, A500 playing a star wars theme)</p>
<p>When you operate a floppy disk normally, you read a track, then step, then read ... and the drive wear is real, but slow.</p>
<p>With those kinds of hacks the drive wear/heating is much faster. Let&#39;s imagine a virus waiting you to leave your computer inattended (by scanning the keyboard/mouse/joystick) to trigger a massive step/motor operation that lasts until you notice it, it could damage the drive/accelerate the normal drive wear tenfold or more. And if the drive is an internal one, the replacement is more complicated.</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve heard rumours of Atari ST overheating and catching fire because of such code but was unable to confirm it, maybe it was just a hoax spread by Amigans :))</p>

<p>This is outside of boundaries but:
one of the storage manufacturers (EMC ?) had special firmware in their drives which allowed the storage controller to replace the same firmware (ie easy upgrades/fixes of faulty firmware.)</p>
<p>Which basically allows an intruder to brick all the drives at the same time...</p>
