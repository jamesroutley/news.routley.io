Ralph made many contributions to the royalty-free media ecosystem, whether it was as a project lead on Theora, serving as release manager for multiple Xiph libraries or maintaining Xiph infrastructure that has been used across the industry by codec engineers and researchers[2].
He was also the first to ship Rust code in Firefox[3] during his time at Mozilla, which was a major milestone for both the language and Firefox itself.</p><p>Ralph was a great contributor, a kind colleague and will be greatly missed.</p><p>Official Announcement: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427730451626262530" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427730...</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="http://www.wizards-of-os.org/archiv/sprecher/g_h/ralph_giles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards-of-os.org/archiv/sprecher/g_h/ralph_giles...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://media.xiph.org/" rel="nofollow">https://media.xiph.org/</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/deploying-rust-in-a-large-codebase-7e50328074e8" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/deploying-rust-in-a-large-co...</a></p></div></td></div></div>
