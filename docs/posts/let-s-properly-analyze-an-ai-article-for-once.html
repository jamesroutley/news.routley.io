    <h1>Let&#39;s properly analyze an AI article for once</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2796283269388226709" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Recently the CEO of Github wrote a blog post called <a href="https://ashtom.github.io/developers-reinvented">Developers reinvented</a>. It was reposted with various clickbait headings like <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/github-ceo-thomas-dohmke-warns-developers-embrace-ai-or-quit">GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke Warns Developers: &#34;Either Embrace AI or Get Out of This Career&#34;</a> (that one feels like an LLM generated summary of the actual post, which would be ironic if it wasn&#39;t awful). To my great misfortune I read both of these. Even if we ignore whether AI is useful or not, the writings contain some of the absolute worst reasoning and stretched logical leaps I have seen in years, maybe decades. If you are ever in the need of finding out how not to write a &#34;scientific&#34; text on any given subject, this is the disaster area for you.</p><p>But before we begin, a detour to the east.</p><p>One of the great wonders of statistical science of the previous century was without a doubt the Soviet Union. They managed to invent and perfect dozens of ways to turn data to your liking, no matter the reality. Almost every official statistic issued by USSR was a lie. Most people know this. But even most of those do not grasp <i>just how much</i> the stats differed from reality. I sure didn&#39;t until I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39679779-empire-of-the-absurd">this book</a>. Let&#39;s look at some examples.</p><h2>Only ever report percentages</h2><p>The USSR&#39;s glorious statistics tended to be of the type &#34;manufacturing of shoes grew over 600% this five year period&#34;. That certainly sounds a lot better than &#34;In the last five years our factory made 700 pairs of shoes as opposed to 100&#34; or even &#34;7 shoes instead of 1&#34;. If you are really forward thinking, you can even cut down shoe production on those five year periods when you are not being measured. It makes the stats even more impressive, even though in reality many people have no shoes at all.</p><p>The USSR classified the real numbers as state secrets because the truth would have made them look bad. If a corporation only gives you percentages, they may be doing the same thing. Apply skepticism as needed.</p><h2>Creative comparisons</h2><p>The previous section said the manufacturing of shoes has grown. Can you tell what it is not saying? That&#39;s right, growth over what? It is implied that the comparison is to the previous five year plan. But it is not. Apparently a common comparison in these cases was the production amounts of the year 1913. This &#34;best practice&#34; was not only used in the early part of the 1900s, it was used far into the 1980s.</p><p>Some of you might wonder why 1913 and not 1916, which was the last year before the bolsheviks took over? Simply because that was the century&#39;s worst year for Russia as a whole. So if you encounter a claim that &#34;car manufacturing was up 3700%&#34; some year in 1980s Soviet Union, now you know what that actually meant.</p><h2>&#34;Better&#34; measurements</h2><p>According to official propaganda, the USSR was the world&#39;s leading country in wheat production. In this case they even listed out the production in absolute tonnes. In reality it was all fake. The established way of measuring wheat yields is to measure the &#34;dry weight&#34;, that is, the mass of final processed grains. When it became apparent that the USSR could not compete with imperial scum, they changed their measurements to &#34;wet weight&#34;. This included the mass of <i>everything</i> that came out from the nozzle of a harvester, such as stalks, rats, mud, rain water, dissidents and so on.</p><p>Some people outside the iron curtain even believed those numbers. Add your own analogy between those people and modern VC investors here.</p><p>The actual blog post starts with this thing that can be considered a picture.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnvKIDpXIXw4sobIuJol13Nyvo2k3lS465_e8v-HNDYAR0pMz653j2pKgenz8pJodfFpqdJaAT-N68z-M_REejgPWmv9z0j87EqFsQ6prRY_u8AezZKHjpvbvXvMx2fgOd3B9HqUeIumtRiaZFDRZJwERKKr0Q-zHq83XD6T2nrPbo1VwyTLPlBqzg01Q/s720/reinvented.png"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="720" height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnvKIDpXIXw4sobIuJol13Nyvo2k3lS465_e8v-HNDYAR0pMz653j2pKgenz8pJodfFpqdJaAT-N68z-M_REejgPWmv9z0j87EqFsQ6prRY_u8AezZKHjpvbvXvMx2fgOd3B9HqUeIumtRiaZFDRZJwERKKr0Q-zHq83XD6T2nrPbo1VwyTLPlBqzg01Q/s320/reinvented.png" width="320"/></a></p><p>What message would this choice of image tell about the person using it in their blog post?</p><ol><li>Said person does not have sufficient technical understanding to grasp the fact that children&#39;s toy blocks should, in fact, be affected by gravity (or that perspective is a thing, but we&#39;ll let that pass).</li><li>Said person does not give a shit about whether things are correct or could even work, as long as they look &#34;somewhat plausible&#34;.</li></ol><p>Are these the sort of traits a person in charge of <i>the largest software development platform on Earth</i> should have? No, they are not.</p><p>To add insult to injury, the image seems to have been created with the Studio Ghibli image generator, which Hayao Miyazaki described as an abomination on art itself. Cultural misappropriation is high on the list of core values at Github HQ it seems.</p><p>With that let&#39;s move on to the actual content, which is this post from Twitter (to quote Matthew Garrett, I will respect their name change once Elon Musk starts respecting his child&#39;s).</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt9Ybd7z0kDtsXvmnc398YA5WEL1wzhJm7zvZMY8N68ms8UfUBkIvrz0upLIlZzPAAYytcOyE84bEoCCFA_lxafqrOTDKpGZtQD9IqYeIZsBgj_F_YBCtW6MEsZsfemMvAb4B2shrZHywPf5da8cyB3MYuYJF4EcFhqu_1j4nAhvanCQPi4fE5Is7mNCg/s808/evidence.png"><img data-original-height="403" data-original-width="808" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt9Ybd7z0kDtsXvmnc398YA5WEL1wzhJm7zvZMY8N68ms8UfUBkIvrz0upLIlZzPAAYytcOyE84bEoCCFA_lxafqrOTDKpGZtQD9IqYeIZsBgj_F_YBCtW6MEsZsfemMvAb4B2shrZHywPf5da8cyB3MYuYJF4EcFhqu_1j4nAhvanCQPi4fE5Is7mNCg/s320/evidence.png" width="320"/></a></p><p>Oh, wow! A field study. That makes things clear. With evidence and all! How can we possibly argue against that?</p><p>Easily. As with a child.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at this &#34;study&#34; (and I&#39;m using the word in its loosest possible term here) and its details with an actual critical eye. The first thing is statistical representativeness. The sample size is 22. According to <a href="http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html">this sample size calculator</a> I found, a required sample size for just one thousand people would be 278, but, you know, one order of magnitude one way or another, who cares about those? Certainly not business big shot movers and shakers. Like Stockton Rush for example.</p><p>The math above assumes an unbiased sampling. The post does not even attempt to answer whether that is the case. It would mean getting answers to questions like:</p><ul><li>How were the 22 people chosen?</li><li>How many different companies, skill levels, nationalities, genders, age groups etc were represented?</li><li>Did they have any personal financial incentive on making their new AI tools look good?</li><li>Were they under any sort of duress to produce the &#34;correct&#34; answers?</li><li>What was/were the exact phrase(s) that was asked?</li><li>Were they the same for all participants?</li><li>Was the test run multiple times until it produced the desired result?</li></ul><p>The latter is an age old trick where you run a test with random results over and over on small groups. Eventually you will get a run that points the way you want. Then you drop the earlier measurements and publish the last one. In &#34;the circles&#34; this is known as <i>data set selection</i>.</p><p>Just to be sure, I&#39;m <i>not</i> saying that is what they did. But if someone drove a dump truck full of money to my house and asked me to create a &#34;study&#34; that produced these results, that is exactly how I would do it. (I would not actually do it because I have a spine.)</p><p>Moving on. The main headline grabber is &#34;Either you embrace AI or get out of this career&#34;. If you actually read the post (I know), what you find is that this is actually a quote from one of the participants. It&#39;s a bit difficult to decipher from the phrasing but my reading is that this is not a grandstanding hurrah of all things AI, but more of a &#34;I guess this is something I&#39;ll have to get used to&#34; kind of submission. That is not evidence, certainly not of the clear type. It is an opinion.</p><p>The post then goes on a buzzwordsalad tour of statements that range from the incomprehensible to the puzzling. Perhaps the weirdest is this nugget on education:</p><blockquote><p>Teaching [programming] in a way that evaluates rote syntax or memorization of APIs is becoming obsolete.</p></blockquote><p>It is not &#34;becoming obsolete&#34;. It has been considered the wrong thing to do for as long as computer science has existed. Learning the syntax of most programming languages takes a few lessons, the rest of the semester is spent on actually using the language to solve problems. Any curriculum not doing that is just plain bad. Even worse than CS education in Russia in 1913.</p><p>You might also ponder that if the author is <i>so</i> out of touch with reality in this simple issue, how completely off base the rest of his statements might be. In fact the statement is so wrong at such a fundamental level that it has probably been generated with an LLM.</p><p>As nonsensical as the Twitter post is, we have not yet even mentioned the biggest misdirection in it. You might not even have noticed it yet. I certainly did not until I read the actual post. Try if you can spot it.</p><p>Ready? Let&#39;s go.</p><p>The actual fruit of this &#34;study&#34; boils down to this snippet.</p><blockquote><p>Developers rarely mentioned “time saved” as the core benefit of working in this new way with agents. They were all about increasing ambition.</p></blockquote><p>Let that sink in. For the last several years the main supposed advantage of AI tools has been the fact that they save massive amounts of developer time. This has lead to the &#34;fire all your developers and replace them with AI bots&#34; trend sweeping the nation. Now even this AI advertisement of a &#34;study&#34; can not find any such advantages and starts backpedaling into something completely different. Just like we have always been at war with Eastasia, AI has never been about &#34;productivity&#34;. No. No. It is all about &#34;increased ambition&#34;, whatever that is. The post then carries on with this even more baffling statement.</p><blockquote><p>When you move from thinking about reducing effort to expanding scope, only the most advanced agentic capabilities will do.</p></blockquote><p>Really? Only the most advanced agentics you say? That is a bold statement to make given that the leading reason for software project failure is scope creep. This is the one area where human beings have decades long track record for beating any artificial system. Even if machines were able to do it better, &#34;Make your project failures more probable! Faster! Spectacularer!&#34; is a tough rallying cry to sell. </p><p> To conclude, the actual findings of this &#34;study&#34; seem to be that:</p><ol><li>AI does not improve developer productivity or skills</li><li>AI does increase developer ambition</li></ol><p>This is strictly worse than the current state of affairs.
