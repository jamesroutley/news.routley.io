      <p>My top picks for managers navigating chaos and upheaval</p>
  </div>
</div><article>
    <p>Recently, I pinged a colleague to ask how his new job was going. His very senior, but definitely individual contributor, non-manager job. He said “actually, I could use your advice! I seem to be a manager now? And things are pretty chaotic...”</p><p>Here’s how his first two weeks went: the person who hired him departed, they handed him a bunch of direct reports, told him they were about to do layoffs. As if starting a new job wasn’t stressful enough, he also had to stabilize his team, remind himself how to be a manager, and produce a “roadmap” which, of course, was poorly defined by the org. All without context and the person who he thought would be guiding him.</p><figure><img src="https://media.tenor.com/5MibLt95scAAAAAC/%ED%98%BC%ED%8C%8C%EB%A7%9D-%ED%94%BC%EC%9E%90.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="498" height="326"/></figure><p>He called me and asked for some emergency readings, specifically quick reads for stabilizing his team in this chaotic period. Here’s what I sent him. </p><p>These might be useful to anyone trying to support a team through chaos and upheaval...which seems to be all of us, all the time these days.</p><blockquote>Hi [redacted],</blockquote><p>What readings would you recommend to someone in this situation?
