    <h1>Quick Take: Screens Age Children by Forcing Early Exploit Mode</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I read a paper yesterday about what screens actually do to kids. The finding that stuck: screens don’t make kids stupid exactly—they prematurely age their brains.</p>

<p>The mechanism is shifting from explore to exploit mode permanently faster. Your whole life starts exploring (literally everything is new) and then naturally transitions to exploitation. Screens accelerate this transition.</p>

<p>The consequences for empathy development are serious. Kids stop soaking in people ambiently. Everything becomes transactional earlier: “what can others do for you and you for them?” Who wants to live like that at five years old?</p>

<p>There’s a mitigation: reading to kids a lot seems to negate the effect. Probably because of the feedback loop—reading is inherently interactive in a slower, more human way than the algorithmic engagement optimization of screens.</p>

<p>The interactive aspect is what makes modern screens worse than TV. It’s not just passive consumption anymore—it’s an active feedback loop optimized to keep attention, which is exactly what accelerates the explore-to-exploit shift.</p>
