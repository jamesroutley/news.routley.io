    <p>Espressif Systems (SSE: 688018.SH) announced ESP32-C5, the industry’s first RISC-V SoC that supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz dual-band Wi-Fi 6, along with Bluetooth 5 (LE) and IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee, Thread) connectivity. Today, we are glad to announce that ESP32-C5  is now in mass production.</p>
<p>ESP32-C5 is designed for applications that require high-efficiency, low-latency wireless transmission. ESP32-C5 has a 32-bit single-core processor which can clock up to 240 MHz in speed. It has a 384 KB on-chip SRAM along with external PSRAM support, 320 KB of ROM. It has up to 29 programmable GPIOs, supporting all the commonly used peripherals, high speed interfaces like SDIO, QSPI, and the best-in-class security features. The ESP32-C5 also includes an LP-CPU running upto 40MHz which can act as the main processor for power sensitive applications. To learn more about the various capabilities and features of this MCU, please visit our <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c5">website</a>.</p>
<p>The ESP32-C5 benefits from software support provided by Espressif&#39;s well-established IoT development framework, ESP-IDF. The upcoming ESP-IDF v5.5, will include initial support for the ESP32-C5. For a detailed list of ESP-IDF features supported for the ESP32-C5, <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/14021">click here</a>. The ESP32-C5 can also act as the connectivity coprocessor for external hosts using the <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-at">ESP-AT</a> or <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted">ESP-Hosted</a> solutions.</p>
<p>ESP32-C5 development boards are now available for purchase at <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008790788462.html">Espressif&#39;s official stores</a> If you are interested in the ESP32-C5 series products, please contact our <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/sales-questions">customer support team</a>.</p>  </div>
