<p>MLC LLM is a universal solution that allows any language model to be deployed natively on a diverse set of hardware backends and native applications, plus a productive framework for everyone to further optimize model performance for their own use cases.
<strong>Everything runs locally  with no server support and accelerated with local GPUs on your phone and laptop</strong>.
Check out our <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm">GitHub repository</a> to see how we did it. You can also read through instructions below for trying out demos.</p>

<h3 id="iphone">iPhone</h3>

<p>Try out this <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/57zd7oxa">TestFlight page</a> (limited to the first 9000 users) to install and use
our example iOS chat app built for iPhone. Our app itself needs about 4GB of memory to run. Considering the iOS and other running applications, we will need a recent iPhone with 6GB (or more) of memory to run the app. We only tested the
application on iPhone 14 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Pro. You can also check out our <a href="(https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm)">GitHub repo</a> to
build the iOS app from source.</p>

<p>Note: The text generation speed on the iOS app can be unstable from time to time. It might run slow
in the beginning and recover to a normal speed then.</p>

<h3 id="windows-linux-mac">Windows Linux Mac</h3>

<p>We provide a CLI (command-line interface) app to chat with the bot in your terminal. Before installing
the CLI app, we should install some dependencies first.</p>
<ol>
  <li>We use Conda to manage our app, so we need to install a version of conda. We can install <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a> or <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge">Miniforge</a>.</li>
  <li>On Windows and Linux, the chatbot application runs on GPU via the Vulkan platform. For Windows and Linux users,
please install the latest <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver">Vulkan driver</a>. For NVIDIA GPU users, please make sure to install
Vulkan driver, as the CUDA driver may not be good.</li>
</ol>

<p>After installing all the dependencies, just follow the instructions below the install the CLI app:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Create a new conda environment and activate the environment.</span>
conda create <span>-n</span> mlc-chat
conda activate mlc-chat

<span># Install Git and Git-LFS, which is used for downloading the model weights</span>
<span># from Hugging Face.</span>
conda <span>install </span>git git-lfs

<span># Install the chat CLI app from Conda.</span>
conda <span>install</span> <span>-c</span> mlc-ai <span>-c</span> conda-forge mlc-chat-nightly

<span># Create a directory, download the model weights from HuggingFace, and download the binary libraries</span>
<span># from GitHub.</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> dist
git lfs <span>install
</span>git clone https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/demo-vicuna-v1-7b-int3 dist/vicuna-v1-7b
git clone https://github.com/mlc-ai/binary-mlc-llm-libs.git dist/lib

<span># Enter this line and enjoy chatting with the bot running natively on your machine!</span>
