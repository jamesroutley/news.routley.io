        <p>Google-fu search skill is something I‚Äôve prided myself ever since elementary school, when the librarian challenged the class to find things in the almanac; not infrequently, I‚Äôd win. And I can still remember the exact moment it dawned on me in high school that much of the rest of my life would be spent dealing with searches, paywalls, and broken links. The Internet is the greatest almanac of all, and to the curious, a never-ending cornucopia, so I am sad to see many fail to find things after a cursory search‚Äîor not look at all. For most people, if it‚Äôs not the first hit in Google/‚ÄãGoogle Scholar, it doesn‚Äôt exist. Below, I reveal my best Internet search tricks and try to provide a rough flowchart of how to go about an online search, explaining the subtle tricks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">tacit knowledge</a> of search-fu.</p>
        <p>Roughly, we need to have proper tools to create an occasion for a search: we cannot search well if we avoid searching at all. Then each search will differ by which search engine &amp; type of medium we are searching‚Äîthey all have their own quirks, blind spots, and ways to modify a failed search. Often, we will run into walls, each of which has its own circumvention methods. But once we have <em>found</em> something, we are not done: we would often be foolish &amp; short-sighted if we did not then make sure it <em>stayed</em> found. Finally, we might be interested in advanced topics like ensuring in advance resources can be found in the future if need be, or learning about new things we might want to then go find. To illustrate the overall workflow &amp; provide examples of tacit knowledge, I include many Internet case studies of finding hard-to-find things.</p>

              <p>Note that GS supports other useful features like alerts for search queries, alerts for anything citing a specific paper, and reverse citation searches (to followup on a paper to look for failures-to-replicate or criticisms of it).</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Title searches</strong>: if a paper fulltext doesn‚Äôt turn up on the first page, start tweaking (hard rules cannot be given for this, it requires development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">‚Äúmechanical sympathy‚Äù</a> and asking a mixture of ‚Äúhow would a machine think to classify this‚Äù and ‚Äúhow would other people think to write this‚Äù):</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>The Golden Mean</strong>: Keep mind when searching, you want some but not too many or too few results. A few hundred hits in GS is around the sweet spot. If you have less than a page of hits, you have made your search too specific.</p>
                    <p>If nothing is turning up, try trimming the title. Titles tend to have more errors towards the end than the beginning, and people often drop So start cutting words off the end of the title to broaden the search. Think about what kinds of errors you make when you recall titles: you drop punctuation or subtitles, substitute in more familiar synonyms, or otherwise simplify it. (How might OCR software screw up a title?)</p>
                    <p>Pay attention to technical terms that pop up in association with your own query terms, particularly in the snippets or full abstracts. Which ones look like they might be more popular than yours, or indicate yours are usually used slightly different from you think they mean? You may need to switch terms.</p>
                    <p>If deleting a few terms then yields way too many hits, try to filter out large classes of hits with a negation <code>foo -bar</code>, adding as many as necessary; also useful is using OR clauses to open up the search in a more restricted way by adding in possible synonyms, with parentheses for group. This can get quite elaborate, and border on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">hacking</a>‚ÄîI have on occasion resorted to search queries as baroque as <code>(foo OR baz) AND (qux OR quux) -bar -garply -waldo -fred</code> to the point where I hit search query length limits and CAPTCHA barriers.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> (By that point, it is time to consider alternate attacks.)</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Tweak The Title</strong>: quote the title; delete any subtitle; try the subtitle instead; be suspicious of any character which is not alphanumeric and if there are colons, split it into two title quotes (instead of searching <code>Foo bar: baz quux</code>, or <code>&#34;Foo bar: baz quux&#34;</code>, search <code>&#34;Foo bar&#34; &#34;baz quux&#34;</code>); swap their order.</p>

                    <p>Libgen had trouble with colons for a long time, and many websites still do (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodreads" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">GoodReads</a>); I don‚Äôt know why colons in particular are such trouble, although hyphens/‚Äãem-dashes and any kind of quote or apostrophe or period are problematic too.

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Tweak Spelling</strong>: Try alternate spellings of British/‚ÄãAmerican terms. This shouldn‚Äôt be necessary, but then, deleting colons or punctuation shouldn‚Äôt be necessary either.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Check For Book Publication</strong>: many papers are published in the form of <em>book anthologies</em>, not journal articles. So look for the book if the paper is mysteriously abent.</p>
                    <p>A book will not necessarily turn up in GS and thus its constituent papers may not either; similarly, while SH does a good job of linking article paywalls to their respective book compilation in LG, it is far from infallible. If a paper was published in any kind of ‚Äòproceeding‚Äô or ‚Äòconference‚Äô or ‚Äòseries‚Äô or anything with an ISBN, the paper may be absent from the usual places but the book readily available. It can be quite frustrating to be searching hard for a paper and realize the book was there in plain sight all along. (My suggestion in such cases for <a href="#post-finding">post-finding</a> is to cut out the relevant page range &amp; upload the paper for others to more easily find.)</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Use URLs</strong>: if you have a URL, try searching chunks of it, typically towards the end, stripping out dates and domain names.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Date Search</strong>:</p>
                    <p>Use a search engine (eg. G/‚ÄãGS) date range feature (in ‚ÄúTools‚Äù) to search ¬±4 years: metadata can be wrong, publishing conventions can be odd (eg. a magazine published in ‚ÄòJune‚Äô may actually be published several months before or after), publishers can be <em>extremely</em> slow. This is particularly useful if you add a date constraint &amp; simultaneously loosen the search query to turn up the most temporally-relevant of what would otherwise be far too many hits. If this doesn‚Äôt turn up the relevant target, it might turn up related discussions or fixed citations, since most things are cited most shortly after publication and then vanish into obscurity.</p>

                        <span>Consider errors</span>: typos are common. If nothing is showing up in the date-range despite a specific date, perhaps there was a typographic error. Even a diligent typist will occasionally copy metadata from a previous entry or type the same character twice or 2 characters in the wrong order, and for numbers, there is no spellcheck to help catch such errors.

Think about transpositions &amp; neighboring keys on a QWERTY keyboard: eg. a year like ‚Äú1976‚Äù may actually be 1966, 1967, 1975, 1977, or 1986.

                    <p>If you don‚Äôt know what jargon might be used, you may need to back off and look for a review article or textbook or WP page and spend some quality time reading. If you‚Äôre using the wrong term, period, nothing will help you; you can spend hours going through countless pages, but that won‚Äôt make the wrong term work. You may need to read through overviews until you finally recognize the skeleton of what you want under a completely different (and often rather obtuse) name. Nothing is more frustrating that <em>knowing</em> there must be a large literature on a topic (‚ÄúCowen‚Äôs Law‚Äù) but being unable to <em>find</em> it because it‚Äôs named something completely different from expected‚Äîand many fields have different names for the same concept or tool. (Occasionally people compile ‚ÄúRosetta stones‚Äù to translate between fields: eg. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/arxiv.org/999c2f28682d1581b2fa3d939a54c2c9bc05cad6.pdf" id="baez-stay-2009" data-link-icon="ùõò" data-link-icon-type="text" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/0903.0340?fallback=original" title="Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone (Original URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340 )"><span><span>Baez‚Äâ&amp;‚ÄâStay</span><span>2009</span></span></a>‚Å†, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/arxiv.org/e43cd8342289fecff435e5142a48f10bbdf8e849.pdf" id="bertsekas-2018" data-link-icon="ùõò" data-link-icon-type="text" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1804.04577?fallback=original" title="Feature-Based Aggregation and Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey and Some New Implementations (Original URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04577 )"><span><span>Bertsekas</span><span>2018</span></span></a>‚Å†, <a href="https://gwern.net/backstop#meta-learning-paradigms" id="gwern-backstop-meta-learning-paradigms"><span><span><span title="et al">Metz</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2018</span></span>‚Äôs Table‚ÄÖ1</span></a>‚Å†.

                    <p><strong>Even The Humble Have A Tale To Tell</strong>: Beware hastily dismissing ‚Äòbibliographic‚Äô websites as useless‚Äîthey may have more than you think.</p>
                    <p>While a bibliographic-focused library site like <code>elibrary.ru</code> is (almost) always useless &amp; clutters up search results by hosting only the citation metadata but not fulltext, every so often I run into a peculiar foreign website (often Indian or Chinese) which happens to have a scan of a book or paper. (eg. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/heritable/1954-darlington.pdf" id="darlington-1954" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Heredity and Environment"><span><span>Darlington</span><span>1954</span></span></a>‚Å†, which eluded me for well over half an hour until, taking the alternate approach of hunting its volume, I out of desperation clicked on an <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/3df4adaed8ad670bbe2efc9d5ebbb928d4b073b2.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/21169" title="(Original URL: http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/21169 )">Indian index‚Ää/‚Ää‚Äãlibrary website</a> which‚Ä¶ had it. Go figure.) Sometimes you have to check every hit, just in case.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Search The Internet Archive</strong>:</p>
                    <p>The Internet Archive (IA) deserves special mention as a target because it has a remarkable assortment of scans &amp; uploads from all sorts of sources, including the aforementioned Indian/‚ÄãChinese libraries with more laissez-faire approaches. It also exposes OCR of them all. So not infrequently, a book may be available, or a paper exists in the middle of a scan of an entire journal volume, but the IA will be ranked very low in search queries and the snippet will be misleading due to bad OCR. A good search strategy is to drop the quotes around titles or excerpts and focus down to <code>site:archive.org</code> and check the first few hits by hand.</p>

                  <p>If the basic tricks aren‚Äôt giving any hints of working, you will have to get serious. The title may be completely wrong, or it may be indexed under a different author, or not directly indexed at all, or hidden inside a database. Here are some indirect approaches to finding articles:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Reverse Citations</strong>: Take a look in GS‚Äôs ‚Äúrelated articles‚Äù or ‚Äúcited by‚Äù to find similar articles such as later versions of a paper which may be useful. (These are also good features to know about if you want to check things like ‚Äúhas this ever been replicated?‚Äù or are still figuring out the right jargon to search.)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Anomalous Hits</strong>: Look for hints of hidden bibliographic connections and anomalous hits.</p>
                      <p>Does a paper pop up high in the search results which doesn‚Äôt <em>seem</em> to make sense, such as not containing your keywords in the displayed snippet? GS generally penalizes items which exist as simply bibliographic entries, so if one is ranked high in a sea of fulltexts, that should make you wonder why it is being prioritized. Similarly, for Google Books (GB): a book might be forbidden from displaying even snippets but rank high; that might be for a good reason‚Äîit may actually contain the fulltext hidden inside it, or something else relevant.</p>
                      <p>Likewise, you cannot trust metadata too much. The inferred or claimed title may be wrong, and a hit may be your desired target lurking in disguise.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Compilation Files</strong>: Some papers can be found by searching for the volume or book title to find it indirectly, especially conference proceedings or anthologies; many papers <em>appear</em> to not be available online but are merely buried deep inside a 500-page PDF, and the G snippet listing is misleading.</p>
                      <p>Conferences are particularly complex bibliographically, so you may need to apply the same tricks as for page titles: drop parts, don‚Äôt fixate on the numbers, know that the authors or ISBN or ordering of ‚Äútitle:subtitle‚Äù can differ between sources, etc.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Search By Issue</strong>: Another approach is to look up the listing for a journal issue, and find the paper by hand; sometimes papers are listed in the journal issue‚Äôs online Table of Contents, but just don‚Äôt appear in search engines (‚ÄΩ). In particularly insidious cases, a paper may be digitized &amp; available‚Äîbut lumped in with another paper due to error, or only as part of a catch-all file which contains the last 20 miscellaneous pages of an issue. Page range citations are particularly helpful here because they show where the overlap is, so you can download the suspicious overlapping ‚Äòpapers‚Äô to see what they <em>really</em> contain.</p>
                      <p>Esoteric as this may sound, this has been a problem on multiple occasions. (I searched in vain for any hint of <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/animal/maze/1929-shepard.pdf" id="shepard-1929" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="An Unexpected Cue in Maze Learning"><span><span>Shepard</span><span>1929</span></span></a>‚Äôs existence, half-convinced it was a typo for his 19<em>5</em>9 publication, until I turned to the raw journal scans. A particularly epic example was <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/heritable/1966-shockley.pdf" id="shockley-1966" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Possible Transfer of Metallurgical and Astronomical Approaches to Problem of Environment versus Ethnic Heredity&#39;, Shockley‚ÄÖ1966"><span><span>Shockley</span><span>1966</span></span></a> where after an hour of hunting, all I had was bibliographic echoes despite apparently being published in a high-profile, easily obtained, &amp; definitely digitized journal, <em>Science</em>‚Äîleaving me thoroughly baffled. I eventually looked up the ToC and inferred it had been hidden in a set of abstracts!<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Or a number of <a href="https://gwern.net/smpy" id="gwern-smpy" title="&#39;SMPY Bibliography&#39;, Branwen‚ÄÖ2018">SMPY</a> papers turned out to be split or merged with neighboring items in journal issues, and I had to fix them by hand.)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Masters/‚ÄãPhD Theses</strong>: sorry. It may be hopeless if it‚Äôs pre-2000. You may well find the citation and even an abstract, but actual fulltext‚Ä¶?</p>
                      <p>If you have a university proxy, you may be able to get a copy off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProQuest" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ProQuest</a> (specializing in US theses). If ProQuest does not allow a download but indexes it, that usually means it has a copy archived on microfilm/‚Äãmicrofiche, but no one has yet paid for a scan to be made; you can sign up without any special permission, and then purchase ProQuest scans for ~$43 (as of 2023), and that gives you a downloadable PDF. (They apparently scan non-digital works from their vast backlog only on request, so it‚Äôs almost like ransoming papers; which means that buying a scan makes it available to academic subscribers as part of the ProQuest database.)</p>
                      <p>Otherwise, you need full university ILL services<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>‚Å†, and even that might not be enough (a surprising number of universities appear to restrict access only to the university students/‚Äãfaculty, with the complicating factor of most theses being stored on microfilm).</p>

                          <p><span>US federal courts</span>: US federal court documents can be downloaded off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER_(law)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">PACER</a> after registration; it is pay-per-page ($0.10/‚Äãpage) but users under a certain level each quarter (currently $15) have their fees waived, so if you are careful, you may not need to pay anything at all. There is a public mirror, called <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/" data-link-icon="PACR" data-link-icon-type="text,quad">RECAP</a>‚Å†, which can be searched &amp; downloaded from for free. If you fail to find a case in RECAP and must use PACER (as often happens for obscure cases), please install the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Law_Project#RECAP" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Firefox‚Ää/‚Ää‚ÄäChrome RECAP browser extension</a>‚Å†, which will copy anything you download into RECAP. (This can be handy if you realize later that you should‚Äôve kept a long PDF you downloaded or want to double-check a docket.)</p>
                          <p>Navigating PACER can be difficult because it is an old &amp; highly specialized computer system which assumes you are a lawyer, or at least very familiar with PACER &amp; the American federal court system. As a rule of thumb, if you are looking up a particular case, what you want to do is to search for the first name &amp; surname (even if you have the case ID) for either criminal or civil cases as relevant, and pull up all cases which might pertain to an individual; there can be multiple cases, cases can hibernate for years, be closed, reopened as a different case number, etc. Once you have found the most active or relevant case, you want to look at the ‚Äúdocket‚Äù, and check the options to see <em>all</em> documents in the case. This will pull up a list of many documents as the case unfolds over time; most of these documents are legal bureaucracy, like rescheduling hearings or notifications of changed lawyers. You want the <em>longest</em> documents, as those are most likely to be useful. In particular, you want the ‚Äúindictment‚Äù, the ‚Äúcriminal complaint‚Äù<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>‚Å†, and any transcripts of trial testimony.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Shorter documents, like 1‚Äì2pg entries in the docket, <em>can</em> be useful, but are much less likely to be useful unless you are interested in the exact details of how things like pre-trial negotiations unfold. So carelessly choosing the ‚Äòdownload all‚Äô option on PACER may blow through your quarterly budget without getting you anything interesting (and also may interfere with RECAP uploading documents).</p>
                          <p>There is no equivalent for state or county court systems, which are balkanized and use a thousand different systems (often privatized &amp; charging far more than PACER); those must be handled on a case by case basis. (Interesting trivia point: according to Nick Bilton‚Äôs account of the Silk Road‚ÄÖ1 case, the FBI and other federal agencies in the SR1 investigation would deliberately steer cases into state rather than federal courts in order to hide them from the relative transparency of the PACER system. The use of multiple court systems can backfire on them, however, as in the case of SR2‚Äôs DoctorClu (see <a href="https://gwern.net/dnm-arrest" id="gwern-dnm-arrest" title="&#39;DNM-related arrests, 2011‚Äì2015&#39;, Branwen‚ÄÖ2012">the DNM arrest census</a> for details), where the local police filings revealed the use of hacking techniques to deanonymize SR2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Tor</a> users, implicating CMU‚Äôs CERT center‚Äîdetails which were belatedly scrubbed from the PACER filings.)</p>

                <h4><a href="#by-quote-or-description" title="Link to section: ¬ß &#39;By Quote or Description&#39;">By Quote or Description</a></h4>
                <p>For quote/‚Äãdescription searches: if you don‚Äôt have a title and are falling back on searching quotes, try varying your search similarly to titles:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Novel sentences</strong>: Try the easy search first‚Äîwhatever looks most memorable or unique.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Short quotes are unique</strong>: Don‚Äôt search too long a quote, a sentence or two is usually enough to be near-unique, and can be helpful in turning up other sources quoting different chunks which may have better citations.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span>Break up quotes</span>: Because even phrases can be unique, try multiple sub-quotes from a big quote, especially from the beginning and end, which are likely to overlap with quotes which have prior or subsequent passages.</li>
                      <li><span>Odd idiosyncratic wording</span>: Search for oddly-specific phrases or words, especially numbers. 3 or 4 keywords is usually enough.</li>
                      <li><span>Paraphrasing</span>: Look for passages in the original text which seem like they might be based on the same source, particularly if they are simply dropped in without any hint at sourcing and don‚Äôt sound like the author; authors typically don‚Äôt cite every time they draw on a source, usually only the first time, and during editing the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô appearance of a source could easily have been moved to later in the text. All of these additional uses are something to add to your searches.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Robust Quotes</strong>: You are fighting a game of Chinese whispers, so look for unique-sounding sentences and terms which can survive garbling in the repeated transmissions.</p>
                    <p>Memories are urban legends told by one neuron to another over the years. Pay attention to how you mis-remember things: you distort them by simplifying them, rounding them to the nearest easiest version, and by adding in details which <em>should</em> have been there. Avoid phrases which could be easily reworded in multiple equivalent ways, as people usually will reword them when quoting from memory, screwing up literal searches. Remember the fallibility of memory and the basic principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">textual criticism</a>: people substitute easy-to-remember versions for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_difficilior_potior" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">hard</a>‚Å†, long<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>‚Å†, or unusual original.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Tweak Spelling</strong>: Watch out for punctuation and spelling differences hiding hits.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Gradient Ascent</strong>: Longer, less witty versions are usually closer to the original and a sign you are on the right trail. The worse, the better. Sniff in the direction of worse versions. (Authors all too often fail to write what they were supposed to write‚Äîas Yogi Berra remarked, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/quoteinvestigator.com/9901447988c3e611b2ff9a241679b89bcb56adad.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/12/30/yogi-didnt-say/" title="(Original URL: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/12/30/yogi-didnt-say/ )">‚ÄúI really didn‚Äôt say everything I said.‚Äù</a>)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Search Books</strong>: Switch to GB and hope someone paraphrases or quotes it, and includes a real citation; if you can‚Äôt see the full passage or the reference section, look up the <em>book</em> in Libgen.</p>

                  <p><span>Use Sci-Hub/‚ÄãLibgen for books/‚Äãpapers.</span> A paywall can usually be bypassed by using Libgen (LG)/‚ÄãSci-Hub (SH): <a href="http://libgen.rs/scimag/" data-link-icon="raven" data-link-icon-type="svg">papers</a> can be searched directly (ideally with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DOI</a><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>‚Å†, but title+author with no quotes will usually work), or an easier way may be to prepend<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <code>sci-hub.st</code> (or whatever SH mirror you prefer) to the URL of a paywall. Occasionally Sci-Hub will not have a paper or will persistently error out with some HTTP or proxy error, but searching the DOI in Libgen directly will work. Finally, there is a <a href="https://z-lib.is/fulltext">LibGen‚Ää/‚ÄäSci-Hub fulltext search engine</a> on the Z-Library mirror, which is a useful alternative to Google Books (despite the poor OCR).</p>
                  <p><span>Use university Internet.</span> If those don‚Äôt work and you do not have a university proxy or alumni access, many university libraries have IP-based access rules and also open WiFi or Internet-capable computers with public logins inside the library, which can be used, if you are willing to take the time to visit a university in person, for using their databases (probably a good idea to keep a list of needed items before paying a visit).</p>
                  <p><span>Public libraries too.</span> Public libraries often subscribe to commercial newspapers or magazine databases; they are inconvenient to get to, but you can usually at least check what‚Äôs available on their website. Public &amp; school libraries also have a useful trick for getting common schooling-related resources, such as the OED, or the archives of the <em>New York Times</em> or <em>New Yorker</em>: because of their usually unsophisticated &amp; transient userbase, some public &amp; school libraries will post lists of usernames/‚Äãpasswords on their website (sometimes as a PDF). They shouldn‚Äôt, but they do. Googling phrases like ‚Äúpublic library <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">New Yorker</a> username password‚Äù can turn up examples of these. Used discreetly to fetch an article or two, it will do them no harm. (This trick works less well with passwords to anything else.)</p>
                  <p>If that doesn‚Äôt work, there is a more opaque ecosystem of filesharing services: booksc/‚Äãbookfi/‚Äãbookzz, private torrent trackers like Bibliotik, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/old.reddit.com/f0d2bc439c217ff55bc7659a1ba27eb72ddd68e7.html" data-link-icon="reddit" data-link-icon-type="svg" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/" title="(Original URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/ )">IRC</a> channels with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDCC" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">XDCC</a> bots like <code>#bookz</code>/‚Äã<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/ebooks.byethost6.com/49a1f20ea30a50b5e73e590542a13d11e7a1278f.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://ebooks.byethost6.com/?i=1" title="(Original URL: http://ebooks.byethost6.com/?i=1 )"><code>#ebooks</code></a>‚Å†, old P2P networks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">eMule</a>‚Å†, private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC%2B%2B" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DC++</a> hubs‚Ä¶</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>PubMed</strong>: most papers with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">PMC</a> ID can be purchased through the Chinese scanning service <a href="https://eurekamag.com/">Eureka Mag</a>‚Å†; scans are $30 &amp; electronic papers are $20.</p>

                      <p>Note that many Elsevier journal websites do not work with the SH proxy, although their <code>sciencedirect.com</code> version <em>does</em> and/‚Äãor the paper is already in LG. If you see a link to <code>sciencedirect.com</code> on a paywall, try it if SH fails on the journal website itself.</p>
                    </li>

                      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PsycINFO" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><strong>PsycNET</strong></a>: one of the worst sites; SH/‚ÄãLG never work with the URL method, rarely work with paper titles/‚ÄãDOIs, and with my university library proxy, loaded pages ‚Äòexpire‚Äô and redirect while breaking the browser back button (‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ), combined searches don‚Äôt usually work (frequently failing to pull up even bibliographic entries), and only DOI or manual title searches in the EBSCOhost database have a chance of fulltext. (EBSCOhost itself is a fragile search engine which is difficult to query reliably in the absence of a DOI.)</p>
                      <p>Try to find the paper anywhere else besides PsycNET!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>ProQuest/‚ÄãJSTOR</strong>: ProQuest/‚ÄãJSTOR are not standard academic publishers, but have access to or mirrors of a surprisingly large number of publications.</p>
                      <p>I have been surprised how often I have hit deadends, and then discovered a copy sitting in ProQuest/‚ÄãJSTOR, poorly-indexed by search engines.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Custom journal websites</strong>: sometimes a journal will have its own website (eg. <em>Cell</em> or <em>Florida Tax Review</em>), but will still be ultimately run by one of the giants like Elsevier or HeinOnline. (You can often see hints of this in the site design, such as the footer, the URL structure, direct links to the publisher version, etc.)</p>
                      <p>When this is the case, it is usually a waste of time to try to use the journal website: it won‚Äôt whitelist university IPs, SH/‚ÄãLG won‚Äôt know how to handle it, etc. Instead, look for the alternative version.</p>

            <p>After finding a fulltext copy, you should find a reliable long-term link/‚Äãplace to store it and make it more findable (remember‚Äîif it‚Äôs not in Google/‚ÄãGoogle Scholar, it doesn‚Äôt exist!):</p>

There are no guarantees either one will be around for long under their legal assaults or the behind-the-scenes dramas, and no guarantee that they are being properly mirrored or will be restored elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>When in doubt, make a copy. Disk space is cheaper every day. Download anything you need and keep a copy of it yourself and, ideally, host it publicly.</p>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><span>Scribd</span>: never link Scribd‚Äîthey are a scummy website which impede downloads, and anything on Scribd usually first appeared elsewhere anyway.

                  <li>
                    <p><span>RG</span>: avoid linking to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResearchGate" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ResearchGate</a> (compromised by new ownership &amp; PDFs get deleted routinely, apparently often by authors) or <code>Academia.edu</code> (the URLs are one-time and break)</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><span>high-impact journals</span>: be careful linking to Nature.com or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(journal)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>Cell</em></a> (if a paper is not <em>explicitly</em> marked as Open Access, even if it‚Äôs available, it may disappear in a few months!<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>); similarly, watch out for <code>wiley.com</code>, <code>tandfonline.com</code>, <code>jstor.org</code>, <code>springer.com</code>, <code>springerlink.com</code>, &amp; <code>mendeley.com</code>, who pull similar shenanigans.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><code>?token=</code>: beware any PDF URL with a lot of trailing garbage in the URL such as query strings like <code>?casa_token</code> or <code>?cookie</code> or <code>?X</code> (or hosted on S3/‚ÄãAWS); such links may or may not work for other people but will surely stop working soon.

                <p><strong>PDF Editing</strong>: if a scan, it may be worth editing the PDF to crop the edges, threshold to binarize it (which, for a bad grayscale or color scan, can drastically reduce filesize while increasing readability), and OCR it.</p>

                <p><strong>Check &amp; Improve Metadata</strong>.</p>
                <p>Adding metadata to papers/‚Äãbooks is a good idea because it makes the file findable in G/‚ÄãGS (if it‚Äôs not online, does it really exist?) and helps you if you decide to use bibliographic software like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zotero" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Zotero</a> in the future. Many academic publishers &amp; LG are terrible about metadata, and will not include even title/‚Äãauthor/‚ÄãDOI/‚Äãyear.</p>
                <p>PDFs can be easily annotated with metadata using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExifTool" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ExifTool</a>:: <code>exiftool -All</code> prints all metadata, and the metadata can be set individually using similar fields.</p>
                <p>For papers hidden inside volumes or other files, you should extract the relevant page range to create a single relevant file. (For extraction of PDF page-ranges, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDFtk" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><code>pdftk</code></a>‚Å†, eg: <code>pdftk 2010-davidson-wellplayed10-videogamesvaluemeaning.pdf cat 180-196 output 2009-fortugno.pdf</code>. Many publishers insert a spam page as the first page. You can drop that easily with <code>pdftk INPUT.pdf cat 2-end output OUTPUT.pdf</code>, but note that PDFtk may drop all metadata, so do that before adding any metadata. To delete pseudo-encryption or ‚Äòpassworded‚Äô PDFs, do <code>pdftk INPUT.pdf input_pw output OUTPUT.pdf</code>; PDFs using actual encryption are trickier but <a href="#astronomy">can often be beaten</a> by off-the-shelf password-cracking utilities.)</p>
                <p>I try to set at least title/‚Äãauthor/‚ÄãDOI/‚Äãyear/‚Äãsubject, and stuff any additional topics &amp; bibliographic information into the ‚ÄúKeywords‚Äù field. Example of setting metadata:</p>

                <p><strong>Link Specific Pages</strong>: as noted before, you can link a specific page by adding <code>#page=N</code> to the URL. Linking the relevant page is helpful to readers. (I recommend against doing this if this is done to link an <em>entire article</em> inside a book, because that article will still have bad SEO and it will be hard to find; in such cases, it‚Äôs better to crop out the relevant page range as a standalone article, eg. using <code>pdftk</code> again for <code>pdftk 1900-BOOK.pdf cat 123-456 output 1900-PAPER.pdf</code>.)</p>

            <p>Aside from the (highly-recommended) use of hotkeys and Booleans for searches, there are a few useful tools for the researcher, which while expensive initially, can pay off in the long-term:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><a href="https://gwern.net/archiving#remote-caching" id="gwern-archiver-bot"><code>archiver-bot</code></a>: automatically archive your web browsing and/‚Äãor links from arbitrary websites to forestall linkrot; particularly useful for detecting &amp; recovering from dead PDF links</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Subscriptions</strong> like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg">PubMed</a> &amp; GS search alerts: set up alerts for a specific search query, or for new citations of a specific paper. (‚Ää<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Alerts" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Google Alerts</a> is not as useful as it seems.)</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><span>PubMed</span> has straightforward conversion of search queries into alerts: ‚ÄúCreate alert‚Äù below the search bar. (Given the volume of PubMed indexing, I recommend carefully tailoring your search to be as narrow as possible, or else your alerts may overwhelm you.)</li>
                  <li>To create generic <span>GS</span> search query alert, simply use the ‚ÄúCreate alert‚Äù on the sidebar for any search. To follow citations of a key paper, you must: 1. bring up the paper in GS; 2. click on ‚ÄúCited by X‚Äù; 3. <em>then</em> use ‚ÄúCreate alert‚Äù on the sidebar.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>GCSE</strong>: a <a href="https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/" data-link-icon="alphabet" data-link-icon-type="svg">Google Custom Search Engines</a> is a specialized search queries limited to whitelisted pages/‚Äãdomains etc (eg. my <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=009114923999563836576%3A1eorkzz2gp4" data-link-icon="alphabet" data-link-icon-type="svg">Wikipedia-focused anime‚Ää/‚Ää‚Äãmanga CSE</a>).</p>
                <p>A GCSE can be thought of as a saved search query on steroids. If you find yourself regularly including scores of the same domains in multiple searches search, or constantly blacklisting domains with <code>-site:</code> or using many negations to filter out common false positives, it may be time to set up a GCSE which does all that by default.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Clippings</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_note-taking_software" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">note-taking services</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evernote" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Evernote</a>‚Å†/‚Ää‚Äã<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Microsoft OneNote</a>: regularly making and keeping excerpts creates a personalized search engine, in effect.</p>
                <p>This can be vital for refinding old things you read where the search terms are hopelessly generic or you can‚Äôt remember an <em>exact</em> quote or reference; it is one thing to search a keyword like ‚Äúautism‚Äù in a few score thousand clippings, and another thing to search that in the entire Internet! (One can also reorganize or edit the notes to add in the keywords one is thinking of, to help with refinding.) I make heavy use of Evernote clipping and it is key to refinding my references.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Crawling Websites</strong>: sometimes having copies of whole websites might be useful, either for more flexible searching or for ensuring you have anything you might need in the future. (example: <a href="https://gwern.net/dnm-archive" id="gwern-dnm-archive" title="&#39;Darknet Market Archives (2013‚Äì2015)&#39;, Gwern‚ÄÖ2013">‚ÄúDarknet Market Archives (2013‚Äì2015)‚Äù</a>).</p>

                <p>Short of downloading a website, it might also be useful to pre-emptively archive it by using <code>linkchecker</code> to crawl it, compile a list of all external &amp; internal links, and store them for processing by another archival program (see <a href="https://gwern.net/archiving" id="gwern-archiving" title="&#39;Archiving URLs&#39;, Gwern‚ÄÖ2011">Archiving URLs</a> for examples). In certain rare circumstances, security tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><code>nmap</code></a> can be useful to examine a mysterious server in more detail: what web server and services does it run, what else might be on it (sometimes interesting things like old anonymous FTP servers turn up), has a website moved between IPs or servers, etc.</p>

          <p>With proper use of pre-emptive archiving tools like <code>archiver-bot</code>, fixing linkrot in one‚Äôs own pages is much easier, but that leaves other references. Searching for lost web pages is similar to searching for papers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Just Search The Title</strong>: if the page title is given, search for the title.</p>
              <p>It is a good idea to include page titles in one‚Äôs own pages, as well as the URL, to help with future searches, since the URL may be meaningless gibberish on its own, and pre-emptive archiving can fail. HTML supports both <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> parameters in link tags, and, in cases where displaying a title is not desirable (because the link is being used inline as part of normal hypertextual writing), titles can be included cleanly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Markdown</a> documents like this: <code>[inline text description](URL &#34;Title&#34;)</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Clean URLs</strong>: check the URL for weirdness or trailing garbage like `<code>or</code>?utm_source = feedburner&amp;utm_medium = feed&amp;utm_campaign = Feed%3A+blogspot%2FgJZg+%28Google+AI+Blog%29<code>? Or a variant domain, like a</code>mobile.foo.com<code>/</code>m.foo.com<code>/</code>foo.com/‚Äãamp/‚Äã` URL? Those are all less likely to be findable or archived than the canonical version.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Domain Site Search</strong>: restrict G search to the original domain with <code>site:</code>, or to related domains</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Time-Limited Search</strong>: restrict G search to the original date-range/‚Äãyears</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Switch Engines</strong>: try a different search engine: corpuses can vary, and in some cases G tries to be too smart for its own good when you need a literal search; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">DuckDuckGo</a> (especially for ‚Äòbang‚Äô special searches), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Bing</a>‚Å†, and Yandex are usable alternatives</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Check Archives</strong>: if nowhere on the clearnet, try the Internet Archive (IA) or the <a href="http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/" data-link-icon="internetarchive" data-link-icon-type="svg">Memento meta-archive search engine</a>:</p>
              <p>IA is the default backup for a dead URL. If IA doesn‚Äôt Just Work, there may be other versions in it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><span>misleading redirects</span>: did the IA ‚Äòhelpfully‚Äô redirect you to a much-later-in-time error page? Kill the redirect and check the earliest stored version for the exact URL rather than the redirect. Did the page initially load but then error out/‚Äãredirect? Disable JS with NoScript and reload.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><span>Within-Domain Archives</span>: IA lets you list all URLs with any archived versions, by searching for <code>URL/*</code>; the list of available URLs may reveal an alternate newer/‚Äãolder URL. It can also be useful to filter by filetype or substring.</p>
                  <p>For example, one might list all URLs in a domain, and if the list is too long and filled with garbage URLs, then using the ‚ÄúFilter results‚Äù incremental-search widget to search for ‚Äúuploads/‚Äã‚Äù on a WordPress blog.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

            <p>E-books are rarer and harder to get than papers, although the situation has improved vastly since the early 2000s. To search for books online:</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>More Straightforward</strong>: book searches tend to be faster and simpler than paper searches, and to require less cleverness in search query formulation, perhaps because they are rarer online, much larger, and have simpler titles, making it easier for search engines.</p>
                <p>Search G, not GS, for books:</p>

                <p>To double-check, you can try a <code>filetype:pdf</code> search; then check LG. Typically, if the main title + author doesn‚Äôt turn it up, it‚Äôs not online. (In some cases, the author order is reversed, or the title:subtitle are reversed, and you can find a copy by tweaking your search, but these are rare.).</p>

                <p>Another example of this would be the Wellcome Library; while looking for <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/d63gy9b7"><em>An Investigation Into The Relation Between Intelligence And Inheritance</em><span>, <span><span>Lawrence</span><span>1931</span></span></span></a>‚Å†, I came up dry until I checked one of the last search results, a ‚ÄúWellcome Digital Library‚Äù hit, on the slim off-chance that, like the occasional Chinese/‚ÄãIndian library website, it just might have fulltext. As it happens, it did‚Äîgood news? Yes, but with a caveat: it provides <em>no</em> way to download the book! It provides OCR, metadata, and individual page-image downloads all under CC-BY-NC-SA (so no legal problems), but‚Ä¶ not the book. (The OCR is also unnecessarily zipped, so that is why Google ranked the page so low and did not show any revealing excerpts from the OCR transcript: because it‚Äôs hidden in an opaque archive to save a few kilobytes while destroying SEO.) Examining the download URLs for the highest-resolution images, they follow an unfortunate schema:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><code>https://dlcs.io/iiif-img/wellcome/1/5c27d7de-6d55-473c-b3b2-6c74ac7a04c6/full/2212,/0/default.jpg</code></li>

                  <li>etc</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instead of being sequentially numbered 1‚Äì90 or whatever, they all live under a unique hash or ID. Fortunately, one of the metadata files, the ‚Äòmanifest‚Äô file, provides all of the hashes/‚ÄãIDs (but not the high-quality download URLs). Extracting the IDs from the manifest can be done with some quick <code>sed</code> &amp; <code>tr</code> string processing, and fed into another short <code>wget</code> loop for download</p>

                <p>if you can find a copy to <em>read</em>, but cannot figure out how to <em>download</em> it directly because the site uses JS or complicated cookie authentication or other tricks, you can always exploit the ‚Äòanalogue hole‚Äô‚Äîfullscreen the book in high resolution &amp; take screenshots of every page; then crop, OCR etc. This is tedious but it works. And if you take screenshots at sufficiently high resolution, there will be relatively little quality loss. (This works better for books that are scans than ones born-digital.)</p>

            <p><span>Expensive but feasible.</span> Books are something of a double-edged sword compared to papers/‚Äãtheses. On the one hand, books are much more often unavailable online, and must be bought offline, but at least you almost always <em>can</em> buy used books offline without much trouble (and often for &lt;$10 total); on the other hand, while paper/‚Äãtheses are often available online, when one is not unavailable, it‚Äôs usually <em>very</em> unavailable, and you‚Äôre stuck (unless you have a university ILL department backing you up or are willing to travel to the few or only universities with paper or microfilm copies).</p><!-- TODO: outsourcing to the IA? https://openlibrary.org/sponsorship -->

                  <li>
                    <p><span>used book search engines</span>: Google Books/‚Äã<a href="https://www.find-more-books.com/">find-more-books.com</a>: a good starting point for seller links; if buying from a marketplace like AbeBooks/‚ÄãAmazon/‚ÄãBarnes &amp; Noble, it‚Äôs worth searching the seller to see if they have their own website, which is potentially much cheaper. They may also have multiple editions in stock.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><span>bad</span>: eBay &amp; Amazon are often bad, due to high-minimum-order+S&amp;H and sellers on Amazon seem to assume Amazon buyers are easily rooked; but can be useful in providing metadata like page count or ISBN or variations on the title</p>
                  </li>

                    <p>Note: on AbeBooks, international orders can be useful (especially for behavioral genetics or psychology books) but be careful of international orders with your credit card‚Äîmany debit/‚Äãcredit cards will fail on international orders and trigger a fraud alert, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">PayPal</a> is not accepted.</p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Price Alerts</strong>: if a book is not available or too expensive, set price watches: AbeBooks supports email alerts on stored searches, and Amazon can be monitored via <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> (remember the CCC price alert you want is on the <em>used third-party</em> category, as new books are more expensive, less available, and unnecessary).</p>

            <p>Scanning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Destructive Vs Non-Destructive</strong>: the fundamental dilemma of book scanning‚Äîdestructively debinding books with a razor or guillotine cutter works much better &amp; is much less time-consuming than spreading them on a flatbed scanner to scan one-by-one<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>‚Å†, because it allows use of a sheet-fed scanner instead, which is easily 5x faster and will give higher-quality scans (because the sheets will be flat, scanned edge-to-edge, and much more closely aligned), but does, of course, require effectively destroying the book.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Tools</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><span>cutting</span>: For simple debinding of a few books a year, an X-acto knife/‚Äãrazor is good (avoid the ‚Äòtriangle‚Äô blades, get curved blades intended for large cuts instead of detail work).</p>
                    <p>Once you start doing more than one a month, it‚Äôs time to upgrade to a guillotine blade paper cutter (a fancier swinging-arm paper cutter, which uses a two-joint system to clamp down and cut uniformly).</p>
                    <p>A guillotine blade can cut chunks of 200 pages easily without much slippage, so for books with more pages, I use both: an X-acto to cut along the spine and turn it into several 200-page chunks for the guillotine cutter.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><span>scanning</span>: at some point, it may make sense to switch to a scanning service like <a href="https://1dollarscan.com/">1DollarScan</a> (1DS has acceptable quality for the black-white scans I have used them for thus far, but watch out for their nickel-and-diming fees for OCR or ‚Äúsetting the PDF title‚Äù; these can be done in no time yourself using <code>gscan2pdf</code>/‚Äã<code>exiftool</code>/‚Äã<code>ocrmypdf</code> and will save a <em>lot</em> of money as they, amazingly, bill by 100-page units). Books can be sent directly to 1DS, reducing logistical hassles.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Clean Up</strong>: after scanning, crop/‚Äãthreshold/‚ÄãOCR/‚Äãadd metadata</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span>Adding metadata</span>: same principles as papers. While more elaborate metadata can be added, like bookmarks, I have not experimented with those yet.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <p><strong>Uploading</strong>: to LibGen, usually, and Gwern.net sometimes. For backups, filelockers like Dropbox, Mega, MediaFire, or Google Drive are good. I usually upload 3 copies including LG. I rotate accounts once a year, to avoid putting too many files into a single account.

                <p><strong>Hosting</strong>: hosting papers is easy but books come with risk:</p>
                <p>Books can be dangerous; in deciding whether to host a book, my rule of thumb is host only books pre-2000 and which do not have Kindle editions or other signs of active exploitation and is effectively an ‚Äò<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_work" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">orphan work</a>‚Äô.</p>
                <p>As of 2019-10-23, hosting 4090 files over 9 years (very roughly, assuming linear growth, &lt;6.7 million document-days of hosting: 3763 √ó 0.5 √ó 8 √ó 365.25 = 6722426), I‚Äôve received 4 takedown orders: a behavioral genetics textbook (2013), <em>The Handbook of Psychopathy</em> (2005), a recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">meta-analysis</a> <span>paper (<span><span title="et al">Roberts</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2016</span></span>), and a CUP DMCA takedown order for 27 files. I broke my rule of thumb to host the 2 books (my mistake), which leaves only the 1 paper, which I think was a fluke. So, as long as one avoids relatively recent books, the risk should be minimal.</span> <!-- Sep‚ÄÖ2020 update: +2: IEEE, and newspaper over mirrored page; Oct‚ÄÖ2020: CUP, 1 book --></p>

              <p>Does anybody know where the online appendix to Nordhaus‚Äô <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f60f/e757587be15c29ad6ee5695bc48a44df3e8a.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Nordhaus‚ÄÖ2007">‚ÄúTwo Centuries of Productivity Growth in Computing‚Äù</a> is hiding?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I look up the title in Google Scholar; seeing a friendly <code>psu.edu</code> PDF link (CiteSeerx), I click. The paper says ‚ÄúThe data used in this study are provided in a background spreadsheet available at <code>http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/Computers/Appendix.xls</code>‚Äù. Sadly, this is a lie. (Sandberg would, of course, have tried that already.)</p>
            <p>I immediately check the URL in the IA‚Äînothing. The IA didn‚Äôt catch it at all. Maybe the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/two-centuries-of-productivity-growth-in-computing/856EC5947A5857296D3328FA154BA3A3" id="nordhaus-2007" data-link-icon="‚õ®" data-link-icon-type="text" title="&#39;Two Centuries of Productivity Growth in Computing&#39;, Nordhaus‚ÄÖ2007">official published paper website</a> has it? Nope, it references the same URL, and doesn‚Äôt provide a copy as an appendix or supplement. (What do we pay these publishers such enormous sums of money for, exactly?) So I back off to checking <code>http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/</code>, to check Nordhaus‚Äôs personal website for a newer link. The Yale personal website is empty and appears to‚Äôve been replaced by a Google Sites personal page. It links nothing useful, so I check a more thorough index, Google, by searching <code>site:sites.google.com/site/williamdnordhaus/</code>. Nothing there either (and it appears almost empty, so Nordhaus has allowed most of his stuff to be deleted and bitrot). I try a broader Google: <code>nordhaus appendix.xls</code>. This turns up some spreadsheets, but still nothing.</p>
            <p>Easier approaches having been exhausted, I return to the IA and I pull up <em>all</em> URLs archived for his original personal website: <code>https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/*</code> This pulls up way too many URLs to manually review, so I filter results for <code>xls</code>, which reduces to a more manageable 60 hits; reading through the hits, I spot <code>http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/Appendix_Nordhaus_computation_update_121410.xlsx</code> from 2014-10-10; this sounds right, albeit substantially later in time than expected (either 2010 or 2012, judging from the filename).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I was in a consignment type store once and picked up a book called ‚ÄúEat fat, get thin‚Äù. Giving it a quick scan through, it was basically the same stuff as Atkins but this book was from the 50s or 60s. I wish I‚Äôd have bought it. I think I found a reference to it once online but it‚Äôs been drowned out since someone else released a book with the same name (and it wasn‚Äôt Barry Groves either).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The easiest way to find a book given a corrupted title, a date range, and the information there are many similar titles drowning out a naive search engine query, is to skip to a specialized search engine with clean metadata (ie. a library database).</p>
            <p>Searching in WorldCat for 1950s‚Äì1970s, ‚ÄúEat fat, get thin‚Äù turns up nothing relevant. This is unsurprising, as he was unlikely to‚Äôve remembered the title <em>exactly</em>, and this title doesn‚Äôt quite sound right for the era anyway (a little too punchy and ungrammatical, and ‚Äòthin‚Äô wasn‚Äôt a desirable word back then compared to words like ‚Äòslim‚Äô or ‚Äòsleek‚Äô or ‚Äòsvelte‚Äô). People often oversimplify titles, so I dropped back to just ‚ÄúEat fat‚Äù.</p>
            <p>This immediately turned up the book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mackarness" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Richard Mackarness‚Äôs</a> 1958 <em>Eat Fat and Grow Slim</em>‚Äînote that it is <em>almost</em> the same title, with a comma serving as conjunction and ‚Äòslim‚Äô rather than the more contemporary ‚Äòthin‚Äô, but just different enough to screw up an overly-literal search.</p>
            <p>With the same trick in mind, we could also have found it in a regular Google search query by adding additional terms to hint to Google that we want old books, not recent ones: both <code>&#34;Eat Fat&#34; 1950s</code> or <code>&#34;Eat Fat&#34; 1960s</code> would have turned it up in the first 5 search results. If we didn‚Äôt use quotes, the searches get harder because broader hits get pulled in. For example, <code>Eat fat, get thin 1950s -Hyman</code> excludes the recent book mentioned, but you still have to go down 15 hits before finding Mackarness, and <code>Eat fat, get thin -Hyman</code> requires going down 18 hits.</p>

            <p>This could be solved by guessing that the formal citation is given in the book, and doing keyword search to find a similar passage. The second line of the speech says:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>For more information on this topic, read Dr.¬†Baumeister‚Äôs book <em>Is There Anything Good About Men?</em> available in bookstores everywhere, including here.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A search of <em>Is There Anything Good About Men</em> in Libgen turns up a copy. Download. What are we looking for? A reminder, the key lines in the speech are:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not a trick question, and it‚Äôs not 50%. True, about half the people who ever lived were women, but that‚Äôs not the question. We‚Äôre asking about all the people who ever lived who have a descendant living today. Or, put another way, yes, every baby has both a mother and a father, but some of those parents had multiple children. Recent research using DNA analysis answered this question about two years ago. Today‚Äôs human population is descended from twice as many women as men. I think this difference is the single most under-appreciated fact about gender. To get that kind of difference, you had to have something like, throughout the entire history of the human race, maybe 80% of women but only 40% of men reproduced.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We could search for various words or phrase from this passage which seem to be relatively unique; as it happens, I chose the rhetorical ‚Äú50%‚Äù (but ‚Äú80%‚Äù, ‚Äú40%‚Äù, ‚Äúunderappreciated‚Äù, etc. all would‚Äôve worked with varying levels of efficiency since the speech is heavily based on the book), and thus jumped straight to chapter 4, ‚ÄúThe Most Underappreciated Fact About Men‚Äù. (If these had not worked, we could have started searching for years, based on the quote ‚Äúabout two years ago‚Äù.) A glance tells us that Baumeister is discussing exactly this topic of reproductive differentials, so we read on and a few pages later, on page 63, we hit the jackpot:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The correct answer has recently begun to emerge from DNA studies, notably those by Jason Wilder and his colleagues. They concluded that among the ancestors of today‚Äôs human population, women outnumbered men about two to one. Two to one! In percentage terms, then, humanity‚Äôs ancestors were about 67% female and 33% male.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Who‚Äôs Wilder? A C-f for ‚ÄúWilder‚Äù takes us to pg286, where we immediately read:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>‚Ä¶The DNA studies on how today‚Äôs human population is descended from twice as many women as men have been the most requested sources from my earlier talks on this. The work is by Jason Wilder and his colleagues. I list here some sources in the mass media, which may be more accessible to laypersons than the highly technical journal articles, but for the specialists I list those also. For a highly readable introduction, you can Google the article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040922020546/http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20040819224859data_trunc_sys.shtml" data-link-icon="internetarchive" data-link-icon-type="svg">‚ÄúAncient Man Spread the Love Around,‚Äù</a> which was published September, 20, 2004 and is still available (last I checked) online. There were plenty of other stories in the media at about this time, when the research findings first came out. In <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/">‚ÄúMedical News Today,‚Äù</a>‚Å†, on the same date in 2004, a story under ‚ÄúGenes expose secrets of sex on the side‚Äù covered much the same material.</p>
              <p>If you want the original sources, read Wilder, J. A., Mobasher, Z., &amp; Hammer, M. F. (2004). <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/21/11/2047/1147770" data-link-icon="OUP" data-link-icon-type="text,tri">‚ÄúGenetic evidence for unequal effective population sizes of human females and males‚Äù</a>‚Å†. <em>Molecular Biology and Evolution</em>, 21, 2047‚Äì2057. If that went down well, you might try Wilder, J. A., Kingan, S. B., Mobasher, Z., Pilkington, M. M., &amp; Hammer, M. F. (2004). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1428" data-link-icon="n" data-link-icon-type="text">‚ÄúGlobal patterns of human mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome structure are not influenced by higher migration rates of females versus males‚Äù</a>‚Å†. <em>Nature Genetics</em>, 36, 1122‚Äì1125. That one was over my head, I admit. A more readable source on these is Shriver, M. D. (2005), <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/5201329" data-link-icon="n" data-link-icon-type="text">‚ÄúFemale migration rate might not be greater than male rate‚Äù</a>‚Å†. <em>European Journal of Human Genetics</em>, 13, 131‚Äì132. Shriver raises another intriguing hypothesis that could have contributed to the greater preponderance of females in our ancestors: Because couples mate such that the man is older, the generational intervals are smaller for females (ie. baby‚Äôs age is closer to mother‚Äôs than to father‚Äôs). As for the 90% to 20% differential in other species, that I believe is standard information in biology, which I first heard in one of the lectures on testosterone by the late James Dabbs, whose book <em>Heroes, Rogues, and Lovers</em> remains an authoritative source on the topic.</p>

            <p>The simplest solution was to search a direct quote, turning up a Scribd mirror; Scribd is a parasite website, where people upload copies from elsewhere, which ought to make one wonder where the <em>original</em> came from. (It often shows up before the original in any search engine, because it automatically runs OCR on submissions, making them more visible to search engines.) With a copy of the journal issue to work with, you can easily find the official HP archives and <a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1989-04.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg">download the original PDF</a>‚Å†.</p>
            <p>If that hadn‚Äôt worked, searching for the URL without <code>/pg_2/</code> in it yields the full citation, and then that can be looked up normally. Finally, somewhat more dangerous would be trying to find the article just by author surname &amp; year.</p>

            <p>Does NYC really have 114,000+ homeless school children? This case study demonstrates the critical skill of <em>noticing</em> the need to search at all, and the search itself is almost trivial.</p>
            <p><span>Won‚Äôt someone think of the children?</span> In March‚ÄÖ2020, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">New York coronavirus cases began their exponential increase</a> centered in Manhattan (with a similar trend to Wuhan/‚ÄãIran/‚ÄãItaly), NYC Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Bill de Blasio</a> refused to take social distancing/‚Äãquarantine measures like ordering the NYC public school system closed, and this delay until 16 March contributed to the epidemic‚Äôs unchecked spread in NYC; one justification was that there were ‚Äú114,085 homeless children‚Äù who received social services like free laundry through the schools. This number has been widely cited in the media by the <em>NYT</em>, <em>WSJ</em>, etc, and was vaguely sourced to ‚Äústate data‚Äù reported by ‚ÄúAdvocates for Children of New York‚Äù. This is a terrible reason to not deal with a pandemic that could kill tens of thousands of New Yorkers, as there are many ways to deliver services which do not require every child in NYC to attend school &amp; spread infections‚Äîbut first, is this number even true?</p>
            <p><span>Basic numeracy: implausibly-large!</span> Activists of any stripe are untrustworthy sources, and a number like 114k should make any numerate person uneasy even without any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Fermi estimation</a> or fact-checking; ‚Äú114,085‚Äù is suspiciously precise for such a difficult-to-measure or define thing like homelessness, and it‚Äôs well-known that the population of NYC is ~8m or 8,000k‚Äîis it really the case that around 1 in every 70 people living in NYC is a homeless child age ~5‚Äì18 attending a public school? They presumably have at least 1 parent, and probably younger siblings, so that would bring it up to &gt;228k or 1 in every &lt;35 inhabitants of NYC being homeless in general. Depending on additional factors like transiency &amp; turnover, the fraction could go much higher still. Does that make sense? No, not really. This quoted number is either surprising, or there is something missing.</p>
            <p><span>Redefining ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù.</span> Fortunately, the suspiciously-precise number and attribution make this a good place to start for a search. Searching for the number and the name of the activist group instantly turns up <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/www.advocatesforchildren.org/4396d149ff553a24534dfa3063f32211fbb8fe9c.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/node/1403" title="New Data Show Number of NYC Students who are Homeless Topped‚ÄÖ100,000 for Fourth Consecutive Year (Original URL: https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/node/1403 )">the source press release</a>‚Å†, and the reasons for the bizarrely high number are revealed: the statistic actually redefines ‚Äòhomelessness‚Äô to include living with relatives or friends, and counts any experience of any length in the previous year as rendering that student ‚Äòhomeless‚Äô at the moment.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The data, which come from the New York State Education Department, show that in the 2018-2019 school year, New York City district and charter schools identified 114,085, or one in ten, students as homeless. More than 34,000 students were living in New York City‚Äôs shelters, and more than twice that number (73,750) were living ‚Äòdoubled-up‚Äô in temporary housing situations with relatives, friends, or others‚Ä¶‚ÄúThis problem is immense. The number of New York City students who experienced homelessness last year‚Äî85% of whom are Black or Hispanic‚Äîcould fill the Barclays Center six times,‚Äù said Kim Sweet, AFC‚Äôs Executive Director. ‚ÄúThe City won‚Äôt be able to break the cycle of homelessness until we address the dismal educational outcomes for students who are homeless.‚Äù</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/376804c98cc59e6939f6e3879828c286a3f1ee22.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/todays-read-new-york-city-had-114000-homeless-students-last-year/" title="Today&#39;s Read: New York City Had‚ÄÖ114,000 Homeless Students Last Year (Original URL: https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/todays-read-new-york-city-had-114000-homeless-students-last-year/ )"><em>WSJ</em>‚Äôs article</a> (but not headline) confirms that ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô does indeed mean ‚Äòat any time in the year for any length of time‚Äô, rather than ‚Äòat the moment‚Äô:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>City district and charter schools had 114,085 students without their own homes at some point last year, topping 100,000 for the fourth year in a row, according to state data released in a report Monday from Advocates for Children of New York, a nonprofit seeking better services for the disadvantaged. Most children were black or Hispanic, and living ‚Äúdoubled up‚Äù with friends, relatives or others. But more than 34,000 slept in city shelters at some point, a number larger than the entire enrollment of many districts, such as Buffalo, Rochester or Yonkers.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span>Less than meet the eye.</span> So the actual number of ‚Äòhomelessness‚Äô (in the sense that everyone reading those media articles understands it) is less than a third the quote, 34k, and that 34k number is likely itself a loose estimate of how many students would be homeless at the time of a coronavirus closure. This number is far more plausible and intuitive, and while one might wonder about what the underlying NYS Education Department numbers would reveal if fact-checked further, that‚Äôs probably unnecessary for showing how ill-founded the anti-closure argument is, since even by the activists‚Äô own description, the relevant number is far smaller than 114k.</p>

            <p>The source information is merely a broken URL: <code>http://www.cochrane.org.uk/opinion/archive/articles.phd</code> which stands out for looking doubly-wrong: ‚Äú.phd‚Äù is almost certainly a typo for ‚Äú.ph<em>p</em>‚Äù (probably muscle memory on the part of Hofman from ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù), but it also gives a hint that the entire URL is wrong: why would an article or essay be named anything like <code>archive/articles.php</code>? That sounds like an <em>index</em> page listing all the available articles.</p>
            <p>After trying and failing to find Cochrane‚Äôs paper in the usual places, I returned to the hint. The Internet Archive doesn‚Äôt have that page under either possible URL, but the directory strongly hints that all of the papers would exist at URLs like <code>archive/brain.php</code> or <code>archive/information-processing.php</code>, and we can look up all of the URLs the IA has under that directory‚Äîhow many could there be? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.cochrane.org.uk/opinion/archive/*" data-link-icon="internetarchive" data-link-icon-type="svg">A lot</a>‚Å†, but only one has the keyword ‚Äúbrain‚Äù in it, providing us <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/iq/1995-cochrane-biologicallimitstoinformationprocessinginthebrain.html" id="cochrane-et-al-1995" title="&#39;Biological limits to information processing in the human brain&#39;, Cochrane‚ÄÖet‚ÄÖal‚ÄÖ1995">the paper itself</a>‚Å†.</p>
            <p>If that hadn‚Äôt worked, there was at least one other version hiding in the IA. When I googled the quoted title ‚ÄúBiological limits to information processing in the human brain‚Äù, the hits all appeared to be useless citations repeating the original Hofman citation‚Äîbut for a crucial difference, as they cite a different URL (note the shift to an ‚Äòarchive.cochrane.org‚Äô subdomain rather than the subdirectory <code>cochrane.org.uk/opinion/archive/</code>, and change of extension from <code>.html</code> to <code>.php</code>):</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Yes, clearly my Google-fu is lacking. I think I searched for phrases like ‚Äúsun went around the Earth,‚Äù which fails because your quote has ‚Äúsun went round the Earth.‚Äù</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As discussed in the search tips, when you‚Äôre formulating a search, you want to balance how many hits you get, aiming for a sweet spot of a few hundred high-quality hits to review‚Äîthe broader your formulation, the more likely the hits will include your target (if it exists) but the more hits you‚Äôll return. In The_Duck‚Äôs case, he used an overly-specific search, which would turn up only 2 hits at most; this should have been a hint to loosen the search, such as by dropping quotes or dropping keywords.</p>
            <p>In this case, my reasoning would go something like this, laid out explicitly: ‚Äò‚ÄúWittgenstein‚Äù is almost guaranteed to be on the same page as any instance of this quote, since the quote is about Wittgenstein; LW, however, doesn‚Äôt discuss Wittgenstein much, so there won‚Äôt be many hits in the first place; to find this quote, I only need to narrow down those hits a <em>little</em>, and after ‚ÄúWittgenstein‚Äù, the most fundamental core word to this quote is ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù or ‚Äúsun‚Äù, so I‚Äôll toss one of them in and‚Ä¶ ah, there‚Äôs the quote!‚Äô</p>
            <p>If I were searching the general Internet, my reasoning would go more like ‚Äú‚ÄòWittgenstein‚Äô will be on, like, a <em>million</em> websites; I need to narrow that down a <em>lot</em> to hope to find it; so maybe ‚ÄòWittgenstein‚Äô <em>and</em> ‚ÄòEarth‚Äô <em>and</em> ‚ÄòSun‚Äô‚Ä¶ nope, nothing on the first page, so toss in <code>&#39;goes around&#39; OR &#39;go around&#39;</code>‚Äîah there it is!‚Äù</p>
            <p>(Actually, for the general Internet, just <code>Wittgenstein earth sun</code> turns up a first page mostly about this anecdote, several of which include all the details one could need.)</p>

              <p>I read a webcomic ~15 years ago that I‚Äôve been unable to find since, even with my best google-fu. It involved a robot living a bleak life as a working stiff. At the end he cracked open his ‚Äúskull‚Äù and there was a small dying creature inside. The art style was less cartoony, and more like Moebius, I think? And maybe it was wordless? And, sorry, it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwebcomic‚Äù in the sense of a long-running thing. It was a self-contained story, maybe 15 pages long?</p>

              <p>The comic was called <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/fiction/science-fiction/2004-chivers-headcase.pdf" id="chivers-2004" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Headcase&#39;, Chivers‚ÄÖ2004">‚ÄúHeadcase‚Äù</a> and it was by Sam Chivers.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Unfortunately, no mirrors of it appeared online or on Chivers‚Äôs current website, and discussions of it mentioned that it was interesting for being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Adobe Flash</a> webcomic. Worse still, nothing useful appeared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/http://www.realitytax.com/*" data-link-icon="internetarchive" data-link-icon-type="svg">in the Internet Archive for the original website</a>‚Äîsomehow the IA appeared to have missed any relevant <code>.swf</code> files, and ‚Äòhead‚Äô/‚Äã‚Äòcase‚Äô turned up no relevant looking filenames. It might have been buried in the opaquely-named images, and my usual next step would be to download the IA archives and inspect every image, but in other hits, I found that an obscure comics publisher had published an anthology involving Chivers, and <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/theslingsandarrows.com/8a9eded3ebec4e1a610ff3ca854d8a0c2c5fe963.html" id="plowright-2020" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://theslingsandarrows.com/prophecy-anthology-volume-1/" title="&#39;&lt;em&gt;Prophecy Anthology Volume‚ÄÖ1&lt;/em&gt;, review&#39;, Plowright‚ÄÖ2020 (Original URL: https://theslingsandarrows.com/prophecy-anthology-volume-1/ )">closer inspection</a> confirmed that ‚ÄúHeadcase‚Äù was in fact published in their (long out of print) 2004 anthology <em>Prophecies: Volume‚ÄÖ1</em>. (Not a prophetic name inasmuch as there was no volume 2.)</p>
            <p>In one of the usual ironies of linkrot, Chivers presumably taking down ‚ÄúHeadcase‚Äù for print publication in <em>Prophecy</em> may have preserved it, as while I am unable to find any digital copies, the paper version is easily obtained as a used book &amp; scanned at modest cost.</p>

            <p><span id="astronomy"><a href="https://cognitivemedium.com/vme" data-link-icon="MN" data-link-icon-type="text">A physics article</a></span> mentioned they had been unable to get <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/science/1973-drake.pdf" id="drake-1973" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Life on a Neutron Star: An Interview With Frank Drake&#39;, Drake‚ÄÖ1973">an old 1973 interview</a> in a popular magazine; as is usually the case for non-scholarly magazines, after looking thoroughly, I could find no trace of it anywhere (not even in libraries or used-magazine sellers) other than an expensive DVD collection of back issues 1970‚Äì2010 still being sold by the publisher. Reasoning that if they had digitized the archives and were even selling it as a DVD collection, they ought to provide subscribers access to them as well, I signed up‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt! So I resorted to the DVD, as, worst-case, I should be able to get it running under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">WINE</a> if nothing else, and can screenshot the interview.</p>
            <p>The DVDs turned out to store all the PDFs as encrypted PDFs and the metadata in an ancient opaque database format I‚Äôd never heard of. Despite WINE AppDB‚Äôs claims, the viewing software only partially worked, and I set about attacking the PDFs directly. They used actual encryption, so pdftk couldn‚Äôt strip the passwording. Given the viewing software, I hypothesized that there was either a single master password or per-PDF passwords stored in the database.</p>
            <p>In the hopes of it being a single short master password, I installed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">John the Ripper</a> (JtR) jumbo edition and extracted the hash of a random file to attack: <code>/snap/john-the-ripper/current/run/pdf2john.pl *.pdf &gt; ~/hash</code>. (Note: pdf2john is not in the default JtR, and it depends on JtR internal files so you can‚Äôt easily just copy it out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Github</a> repo &amp; run it, as I discovered the hard way. You need to install the jumbo edition.) The password hashes of all the PDFs indeed turned out to be the same, so it used a master password. A simple attack with default password-space could be executed as <code>john-the-ripper ~/hash</code>. While I waited for all of the DVDs to copy, I saw that JtR was getting something like only a hundred thousand hashes/‚Äãs on my 16 Threadripper CPU cores, and did not have any success up to 5-character passwords.</p>
            <p>If the password wasn‚Äôt really short, CPU wouldn‚Äôt be enough. I decided to switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcat" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">Hashcat</a> to put my 2√ó1080ti Nvidia GPUs to good use, as they ought to run hundreds of times faster than JtR. (To convert the JtR hash format to Hashcat hash format, you delete the colon-separated filename field at the beginning of each line.) Hashcat uses a <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/hashcat.net/87fbd82f8b8794603fb3b0cca174c21310b4741b.html" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack" title="(Original URL: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack )">powerful but confusing</a> DSL of specifying the exact password-space, and I made a reasonable guess that if the original programmer was so lazy as to use a single master password, he would also use a simple alphanumeric password (uppercase + lowercase + decimal numbers), and nothing harder to type or read. To specify the PDF hash type and an attack starting at 1-character alphanumeric &amp; increasing, I wound up with the incantation <code>hashcat -m 10500 ~/hash.cat -w 3 --force -a 3 --increment -1 &#39;?l?u?d&#39; ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code>.</p>
            <p>Hashcat worked much better and within an hour had bruteforced on the order of 170 billion hashes and up somewhere around 8 characters. This did not succeed either. At this point, another programmer thought it‚Äôd be fun to participate and, while reverse-engineering the executable to see how it decrypted PDFs, suggested that the master password was probably hardcoded as a string literal inside the viewer executable. One could just dump all the strings inside it with the CLI utility <code>strings *.exe &gt; strings.txt</code>, and then use it as a Hashcat password list. To my chagrin, when I finally got around to trying <code>cat strings.txt | hashcat -m 10500 ~/hash.cat -w 3</code>, it finished within 1s.</p>
            <p>The password turned out to be <code>B775tO11dQvu74</code>. I was right that it was alphanumerical, but at a length of 14 characters, I doubt I would have brute-forced it. (He successfully reverse-engineered it and discovered the viewer had been used for several other magazine archives as well, apparently, and simply switched master passwords to decrypt each one; the other passwords left in the executable were <code>PbS19LuXd2pTXw</code>, <code>1386r8wRrH01</code>, &amp; <code>mfU33QQNlAFGI1</code>.)</p>
            <p>I then decrypted the PDF (<code>for PDF in *.pdf; do pdftk &#34;$PDF&#34; input_pw &#34;B775tO11dQvu74&#34; output foo.pdf &amp;&amp; mv foo.pdf &#34;$PDF&#34;; done</code>), extracted &amp; uploaded the interview, and archived the collection elsewhere.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>For more than 40 years evolutionary theory has remained free of a naive selectionism, but in recent times there has been a return to the extreme form of the adaptationist program, as evolutionists have rediscovered behaviour. Beginning with the undoubted truth that behaviour must, like morphology and physiology, be subject to the force of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">natural selection</a>‚Å†, the new Panglossians end with the old error that all describable behaviour must be the direct product of natural selection. The scientific manifestation of this trend can be seen in every issue of say, <em>The American Naturalist</em>, which is permeated by the language, if not the formal apparatus, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">game theory</a>‚Å†, and in the development of the school of ‚Äòsociobiology‚Äô, among whose more extraordinary productions is a recent highly praised dissertation explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>fellatio</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunnilingus" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg"><em>cunnilingus</em></a> among the upper middle classes as an adaptive response to constant resources. The popular manifestation of this new caricature of Darwinism reaches its most extreme form in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> by Richard Dawkins.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As is common in book reviews, Lewontin provides no citations, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DevoEvoMed/status/1478785200964476929" data-link-icon="twitter" data-link-icon-type="svg">2 biologists</a> were curious but unable to figure out what Lewontin was referring to despite searching.</p>
            <p>The thesis in question is easy to find in under a minute, because the context gives so many hints: Lewontin refers to it as notorious &amp; widely discussed so it will have many substantive citations (if only to attack it); it is ‚Äòrecent‚Äô (and sociobiology was a heated controversy so it is unlikely to be ‚Äòrecent‚Äô in the sense of ‚Äòa quiet field of research still mulling over a provocative paper from 2 decades‚Äô before, but more like ‚Äòwithin the past 2 or 3 years‚Äô &amp; certainly at least 1970‚Äì1977), it is a ‚Äòdissertation‚Äô and so single-authored &amp; almost certainly a PhD thesis by someone who became at least a postgrad researcher (because a master‚Äôs thesis would be too low-status to be discussed or praised, or singled out for abuse in <em>Nature</em>‚Äîit would be unclassy for a chaired Harvard professor to attack such a junior grad student‚Äôs work there like that), and it likely uses the words ‚Äúfellatio‚Äù and ‚Äúcunnilingus‚Äù as technical terms &amp; decorous Latinate scientific censoring.</p>
            <p>If we plug into Google Scholar a date-range of 1970‚Äì1977 and the simplest possible query <code>fellatio cunninglingus &#34;evolutionary psychology&#34; OR sociobiology</code> or <code>fellatio cunninglingus sociobiology</code> or <code>fellatio cunninglingus &#34;evolutionary psychology&#34;</code>, we see in GS‚ÄÖ2 hits (for the former) or among the hits (latter), the immediately-relevant looking <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/selection/natural/human/1977-weinrich.pdf" id="weinrich-1977" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Human sociobiology: Pair-bonding and resource predictability (effects of social class and race)&#39;, Weinrich‚ÄÖ1977">‚ÄúHuman sociobiology: Pair-bonding and resource predictability (effects of social class and race)‚Äù<span>, <span><span>Weinrich</span><span>1977</span></span></span></a> and <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/selection/natural/human/1976-weinrich.pdf" id="weinrich-1976" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Human Reproductive Strategy: I.

            <p>I rose to the challenge.</p>
            <p><span>Standard checks.</span> Matuschak is indeed correct that this paper does not show up in any of the usual places, nor does ‚Äòyearbook‚Äô #9 seem to show up; this nut will not be cracked instantly. We do not see any encouraging hints if we google the citation (only a sporadic handful of later citations to it, which are sporadic enough to suggest that they too <a href="https://gwern.net/leprechaun#citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" id="gwern-leprechaun-citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" title="‚ÄòLeprechaun Hunting &amp; Citogenesis ¬ß Citogenesis: How Often Do Researchers Not Read The Papers They Cite?‚Äô, Gwern‚ÄÖ2014">are citing papers they have not read</a> &amp; that this will be hard to find). University &amp; ProQuest databases turn up nothing for either.</p>
            <p>This begins to look anomalous, so I broadened the search in Google. Here I stumbled across several of the yearbooks hosted at what looks like the National Reading Conference‚Äôs website; a targeted <code>site:</code> search, alas, fails to turn up anything useful. They may have scanned some later yearbooks, but apparently not the 1989 one‚Ä¶? Unfortunately, a dead end.</p>
            <p><span>Barkless dogs.</span> So we turn to book sources, like used-book search engines. We can find many of these yearbooks used at reasonable prices, but <em>not</em> #39‚Äînot a trace of it! This is odd. Being the 39<sup>th</sup> yearbook, with the others often available, would imply that it is available too: such serial publications don‚Äôt usually vary that much from year to year‚Äîif the ones before &amp; after it are easy to get, it should be too. What one notices is that the titles don‚Äôt look anything like ‚Äú<em>National Reading Conference Yearbook</em>, 39‚Äù: this citation must be wrong, that‚Äôs not how they were titled! With this in mind, we can search for a used copy to buy &amp; scan, but this would be premature to do: now we have explained the prior absence of hits, and need to redo our searches; we thought there was no scan online before, but we know that was misleading so it may exist after all.</p>
            <p><span>Alternate titles.</span> Knowing this, we can search more broadly in Google, and skimming search results, look what we find! The PDF snippet reveals that our quarry, ‚ÄúProceedings of the Annual Meeting of The National Reading Conference (39<sup>th</sup>‚Ä¶)‚Äù has been hidden behind the long uncited title ‚Äú<em>Literacy Theory and Research: Analyses from Multiple Paradigms</em>‚Äù. Well, no wonder you can‚Äôt find it normally, and also (disappointingly but unsurprisingly), no wonder everyone copies the same incorrect citation.</p>

            <p><span>Alternate paths.</span> <span>Downloading it, <span><span title="et al">Pressley</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1989</span></span> turns out to be buried on pg256 of this PDF; now that we know what to look for, this book turns out to have been easily findable after all‚Äîwe can readily find the original non-Academia.edu PDF on our old friend</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Resources_Information_Center" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">ERIC</a><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> and can find other yearbooks easily. We can also doublecheck other strategies: for example, if we had known the full names of the authors rather than the abbreviated ones in the citation, and we had googled something like ‚ÄúMichael Pressley, Elizabeth Ghatala, Jennifer Pirie, Vera E. Woloshyn‚Äù, that would have matched the indexed fulltext PDFs immediately. (Since you can often find the full names of authors even if the citation abbreviates them, this is a good tactic to know.)</p>
            <p>Thus, in this instance, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that citations can be inaccurate and one must try variations. Over-fixating on the book title can hamper efforts to locate the article, which was, in reality, merely a click away.</p>

I explain how to find &amp; extract specific websites.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>A little-known way to ‚Äòundelete‚Äô a blog or website is to use Google Reader (GR). <span>Unusual archive: Google Reader.</span> GR crawled regularly almost all blogs‚Äô RSS feeds; RSS feeds often contain the fulltext of articles. If a blog author writes an article, the fulltext is included in the RSS feed, GR downloads it, and then the author changes their mind and edits or deletes it, GR would redownload the new version but it would continue to show the version the old version as well (you would see two versions, chronologically). If the author blogged regularly and so GR had learned to check regularly, it could hypothetically grab different edited versions, even, not just ones with weeks or months in between. Assuming that GR did not, as it sometimes did for inscrutable reasons, stop displaying the historical archives and only showed the last 90 days or so to readers; I was never able to figure out why this happened or if indeed it really did happen and was not some sort of UI problem. Regardless, if all went well, this let you undelete an article, albeit perhaps with messed up formatting or something. Sadly, GR was closed back in 2013 and you cannot simply log in and look for blogs.</p>
            <p><span>Archive Team mirrored Google Reader.</span> However, before it was closed, <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Google_Reader" data-link-icon="internetarchive" data-link-icon-type="svg">Archive Team</a> launched a major effort to download as much of GR as possible. So in that dump, there may be archives of all of a random blog‚Äôs posts. Specifically: if a GR user subscribed to it; if Archive Team knew about it; if they requested it in time before closure; and if GR did keep full archives stretching back to the first posting.</p>
            <p><span>AT mirror is raw binary data.</span> Downside: the Archive Team dump is <em>not</em> in an easily browsed format, and merely figuring out what it <em>might</em> have is difficult. In fact, it‚Äôs so difficult that before researching Craig Wright in November‚ÄìDecember‚ÄÖ2015, I never had an urgent enough reason to figure out how to get anything out of it before, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever seen anyone actually use it before; Archive Team takes the attitude that it‚Äôs better to preserve the data somehow and let posterity worry about <em>using</em> it. (There is a site which claimed to be a frontend to the dump but when I tried to use it, <a href="https://github.com/hubgit/archiveteam-reader-warc-extract/issues/1" data-link-icon="github" data-link-icon-type="svg">it was broken</a> &amp; still is in December‚ÄÖ2018.)</p>

              <p><span>Success: raw HTML.</span> My <code>dd</code> extraction was successful, and the resulting HTML/‚ÄãRSS could then be browsed with a command like <code>cat *.warc | fold --spaces -width=200 | less</code>. They can probably also be converted to a local form and browsed, although they won‚Äôt include any of the site assets like images or CSS/‚ÄãJS, since the original RSS feed assumes you can load any references from the original website and didn‚Äôt do any kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg">data-URI</a> or mirroring (not, after all, having been intended for archive purposes in the first place‚Ä¶)</p>
