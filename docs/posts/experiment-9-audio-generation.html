<p>It seems I forgot to post Experiment 8 to this blog – find it on <a href="https://medium.com/@hackerm0m/experiment-8-llm-generated-ascii-art-879e96053867">medium</a> – it generates ascii art.  </p>

<p>Today was a bit of a gpt fail. I decided I was going to install the blender python library on my linux machine and do that – but as of now the install is still failing! In the meantime I returned to my csound puttering which I will not officially give up on sinceI have not been able to generate anything that works in a week. I’ll move on to tidal cycles. What I did was generate the sound of the lifecycle of milkweed.</p>

<h3 id="h-what-did-i-do">What did I do</h3>



<p>Roughly I asked gpt to generate a csound file that represents the lifecycle of milkweed and when the csound file did not work I asked it to use a different programming language. It picked python and the result is in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/msrobot0/llmlexperiments/" target="_blank">Experiment 9 in my github repo</a>.</p>



<p>The Result is also in that file because I am too lazy to upload it to soundcloud.</p>



<h3 id="h-reflections">Reflections</h3>



<p>I also attempted to generate a visualization of this that looked like an oscilliscope. None of my efforts worked. And then I asked GPT to just generate a video – this also did not work. Sometimes experiments fail.</p>



<p>I do feel super burnt out. But I am pushing through on the daily experiments. I believe there is something on the other side of this!</p>
