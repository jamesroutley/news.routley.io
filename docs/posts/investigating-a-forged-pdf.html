    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now you&#39;ve looked at California tenancy law would you happen to have any comments on the film <b>M3GAN 2.0</b> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3GAN_2.0)?  (The robot girl M3GAN runs Linux: an outdated version of groups.c is <b>very briefly flashed on screen</b> (https://www.reddit.com/r/M3GAN/comments/192vm76/m3gan_runs_linux/) in the first film scene when her codebase is being exfiltrated by Kurt.)  In the second film Gemma has moved herself and Cady into an &#34;insanely cheap&#34; upmarket property in the San Francisco Mission District which, minor spoiler, turns out to have a secret elevator down to a M3GAN-designed underground lair.  Gemma thought it was cheap because the unidentified landlord was using it for some kind of money laundering (which doesn&#39;t seem to bother her as a tenant, should it?), another character says the landlord probably likes her and it&#39;s basically implied that M3GAN set herself up as a fake landlord despite not having legal personhood.  Presumably this would have been done via a (real or fake) agency and Megs was counting on Gemma not to realise she could write in to demand the name and address of the landlord (or, if she did, provide a fraudulent reply).  Presumably as M3GAN has no legal personhood and was Gemma&#39;s creation anyway, there wouldn&#39;t be a case: you can&#39;t sue your own code for bugs (there might however be separate consequences to Gemma of whatever method M3GAN used to obtain the property in the first place: we could be charitable and assume she set herself up as a bunch of highly-paid remote workers or consultants to obtain funds rather than compromising bank computers or whatever; hopefully by the end of the film they&#39;d let them off anyway by virtue of very publicly saving the world).  But I say all that without having actually read Californian tenancy law as you have, so I wondered if you&#39;d happen to have any extra insights for the M3GAN fans.</p><p><em>Edited (fix wrong markup) <span><span>Date: </span> <span title="">2025-09-25 08:18 am (UTC)</span></span></em></p></div></div>
