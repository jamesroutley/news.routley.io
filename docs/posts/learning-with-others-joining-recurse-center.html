    <h1>Learning With Others: Joining Recurse Center</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Today I’m excited to join a community of learners. For the next 12 weeks I’m going to participate in the Fall-2 2023 <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=dcdcd5fced9bfab4a02b4dd6bb05199e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Recurse Center</a> batch.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>If this blog is “learning in public”, Recurse Center is “learning with others”. RC is a code retreat for self-directed passionate programmers. It’s a place to work on your own projects and learn new things, surrounded by other people doing the same.</p>
<h2 id="my-plan">My plan</h2>
<p>I want to continue my journey from SWE to MLE and take the opportunities being surrounded by a community of learners provides to accelerate my own learning.</p>
<h3 id="learn-more-in-public">Learn (more) in public</h3>
<p>The more eyeballs around the more power you can leverage from learning in public.</p>
<h3 id="teach-to-learn">Teach to learn</h3>
<p>Richard Feynman is attributed the quote <em>“If you want to master something, teach it.”</em></p>

<p>I want to use my stay at the Recurse Center as an opportunity to teach what I learn to others. As a way to share joy with other, and selfishly as a way to solidify my own understanding of the topics at hand.</p>
<h3 id="learn-from-others">Learn from others</h3>
<p>I am hopping to collaborate on projects, review material in a group, and pair program with others to learn from their experience and tap into their unique understanding. See a subject from a different set of lens.</p>
<h3 id="building-intuition-and-analogies-through-pounds-of-clay">Building Intuition and Analogies through pounds of clay</h3>
<p>One more concept borrowed from Richard Feynman is to build Intuition through Analogies. What I wish the most is to leave the retreat with an intuitive understanding of ML. And I plan to achieve that by going through a lot of very minimal barebone toy projects.</p>
<p>In the RC community there is a term for that: “Pounds of Clay”. According to RC’s historians the term is a reference to <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">this story</a> and the driving hypothesis it to speedup your learning by finishing many small imperfect projects rather than one bigger “perfect” project.</p>
