<p>Collective Shout, an Australian anti-pornography group, has claimed credit for Steam&#39;s recent removal of a large number of sexually explicit games and new, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/">stricter moderation guidelines</a> regarding such material. In a statement to PC Gamer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/">Valve cited pressure from payment processors</a> like credit card companies and Paypal for the move, while Collective Shout touted its open letter and consumer campaign targeting payment processors for inciting that pressure.</p><p>This was first reported by Waypoint, which has since pulled its two articles on the subject without explanation. The articles&#39; author, Ana Valens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" data-url="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">has alleged</a> that Vice&#39;s parent company, Savage Ventures, removed the articles due to concerns over their controversial content rather than any error in the reporting.</p><p>Collective Shout began in 2009, co-founded by self-described &#34;pro-life feminist&#34; Melinda Tankard Reist. Collective Shout describes itself as &#34;A grassroots campaigning movement against the objectification of women and sexualization of girls in media, advertising, and popular culture&#34;.

Ana Valens and two other Waypoint writers, Shaun Cichacki and Matt Vatankhah, have all resigned from the site. &#34;I stand by all of my retracted articles, especially the Collective Shout ones,&#34; Valens said in a statement to PC Gamer.</p><p>&#34;I fact-checked every article&#39;s content rigorously. I believe that Collective Shout and its related organizations deserve further journalistic investigation by other reporters in the games industry. I hope more writers look into the clear and obvious signs of payment processor-based censorship that are occurring toward Steam, and have occurred against Pixiv, itch.io, DLSite, Gumroad, Patreon, and other sites.&#34;</p><p>This is likely far from over: Collective Shout is no doubt feeling emboldened by a second public success in its efforts to police content on Steam specifically. The games I saw removed from Steam in this wave all featured risible content and suspect quality, but Collective Shout has a broader anti-pornography, even anti-expression remit that it has demonstrated in the past.</p>

He is obsessed with all things CRPG and CRPG-adjacent, but has also covered esports, modding, and rare game collecting. When he&#39;s not playing or writing about games, you can find Ted lifting weights on his back porch.</p></div></div>
