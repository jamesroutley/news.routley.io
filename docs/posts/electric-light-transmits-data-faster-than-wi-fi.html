</div><p>Li-fi, a communication technology harnessing visible light for data transmission, has a potential to surpass Wi-Fi&#39;s speed by more than 100 times and boasts a high bandwidth, facilitating the simultaneous transmission of copious information. Notably, Li-fi ensures robust security by exclusively transmitting data to areas illuminated by light.</p>

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>Most important, it capitalizes on existing indoor lighting infrastructure, such as LEDs, eliminating the need for separate installations. However, implementing <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/visible+light/" rel="tag">visible light</a> communication (VLC) in practical lighting systems poses an issue of diminished stability and accuracy in <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/data+transmission/" rel="tag">data transmission</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, a collaborative team led by Professor Dae Sung Chung, from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), with researcher Dowan Kim, Professor Dong-Woo Jee and Hyung-Jun Park from the Department of Intelligence Semiconductor Engineering at Ajou University, and Professor Jeong-Hwan Lee from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Inha University, succeeded in utilizing indoor lighting for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/wireless+communication/" rel="tag">wireless communication</a> by reducing <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/light/" rel="tag">light</a> interference with a novel light source. Their findings were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202309416">published</a> in <i>Advanced Materials</i>.</p>
<p>When light of the same wavelength intersects, interference occurs, resulting in the merging or cancellation of amplitudes. This phenomenon was observed when using LEDs as a single-color light source in VLC technology. To overcome this hurdle, the team developed a novel light source to replace the conventional one. By combining red, green, and blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), they crafted a light source that mimics standard white illumination but with minimal interference zones.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- TechX - News - In-article -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <p>Furthermore, the team introduced a cavity structure to enhance the OLED&#39;s color representation for each wavelength and incorporated a Fabry-Pérot structure into the light-absorbing organic photodiodes (OPDs) to selectively receive specific wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>The team&#39;s composite white light exhibited a significantly lower bit error rate (BER) than that of conventional light sources. BER, representing the error ratio to the total transmitted bits, serves as a key quantifier of digital signal quality. This remarkable achievement signifies effective suppression of interference among light sources, ensuring accurate information transmission.</p>
<p>Professor Dae Sung Chung, the leader of the consortium, explained, &#34;In contrast to conventional light sources, our <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/light+source/" rel="tag">light source</a>, which blends three wavelengths, circumvents interference thereby enhancing stability and accuracy in data transmission. We foresee this technology as a potentially beneficial tool for diverse industries, serving as a next-generation wireless communication solution that utilizes conventional lighting systems.&#34;</p>
<p>In a multichannel VLC system, mixed <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/white+light/" rel="tag">white light</a> is created by using red, green, and blue OLEDs with non-overlapping wavelengths to minimize interference among channels. The system utilizes OPDs that selectively absorb the light.</p>
