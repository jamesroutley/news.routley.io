    <h1>Logarithmic Scales</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>The first lesson I learned about logarithms is not to mention them when speaking to a large crowd. All the other lessons sucked, so I thought I&#39;d create my own.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by talking about the simplest of linear scales: a ruler.</p>
<p>Everyone understands how rulers work: you place them next to tiny trinkets and you look at the ruler&#39;s marks to determine the object&#39;s size. You can then use a pen and the ruler&#39;s marks to represent the size of these objects on a board.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log1.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The problem with rulers is that you can’t use them to measure larger objects, such as trees, park benches, and city blocks. To solve that problem, we&#39;ll need a bit of imagination.</p>
<p>Instead of having each of our ruler&#39;s marks represent 1 inch, we&#39;ll pretend they represent 100 inches. That way, we&#39;ll compress larger distances into smaller ones.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log2.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Now, we can use the same ruler to represent the size of a park bench, a tree, and even a city block.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log3.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Notice how we&#39;re not using the ruler for measuring anymore. Instead, we&#39;re using it to <em>represent</em> the sizes of different objects.</p>
<p><strong>The way we squished hundreds of inches into one mark on the ruler is called a linear transformation because when you draw it on a graph, it makes a straight line</strong>. Each mark on the ruler represents 100 more inches, showing a steady, even increase.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log5.png" alt=""/></p>
<p><strong>Linear transformations preserve the measurements&#39; relative spaces.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, if the marks for 1 and 5 inches are 4 segments apart on a ruler, then the marks for 100 and 500 inches will also be 4 segments apart when we use our scaled-up ruler. That way, the proportional distances remain the same, even though the actual measurements have increased.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log6.png" alt=""/></p>
<p><strong>The problem with applying a linear transformation to a ruler is that it can only either measure small trinkets or large objects, not both.</strong></p>
<p>A ruler scaled from 0 to 10 inches isn&#39;t big enough to measure a park bench, while a ruler scaled from 0 to 900 inches makes it hard to distinguish the marks for smaller objects — they become too close together.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log7.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>To solve this problem, we&#39;ll need to transform our ruler so that each segment represents a greater increase.</p>
<p>Typically, going from the first mark to the second represents a 1-inch increase, just like there&#39;s a 1-inch increase when going from the second mark to the third. In other words, segments in normal rulers represent linear increases.</p>
<p>In our new scale, going from the first mark to the second represents a 10-inch increase, and going from the second to the third mark represents a 100-inch increase. Each subsequent segment represents a distance ten times greater than the previous. In this case, each segment represents a <em>non-linear</em> increase.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log8.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This way, with just 10 marks, you can represent objects from 1 inch to 100,000,000 inches. Each step exponentially increases the range we can measure without cluttering our ruler with countless tiny increments.</p>
<p>Now, you can represent tiny stones at the first mark and a mountain just 10 segments further because, by the time you get to the 10th mark, the value this mark represents hasn&#39;t just grown tenfold, it&#39;s grown 10¹⁰ inches.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another example using our new scale. If you plot a cockroach in the scale&#39;s first mark, a badger in the second mark, and a troll in the third, it means that the badger is 10x larger than the cockroach and that the troll is 10x larger than the badger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it shows that the troll is 100x larger than the cockroach, because they&#39;re 2 segments apart, so 100 (10²) times larger.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log9.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Going left has the opposite effect, it causes things to become increasingly smaller. If you keep going left from 1, you&#39;ll start working with fractions, and they get 10x as small as you move on to the leftward mark.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log10.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>As we&#39;ve just demonstrated, this type of scale is great for representing ratios.</p>
<p>Now compare how the represented values increase exponentially as you move up marks. See how it&#39;s not a linear growth like in the previous transformation?</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log11.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>As shown above, each mark represents an exponential increase in the value it represents. Still, this type of scale is <em>not</em> an exponential scale. It&#39;s a <em>logarithmic</em> scale.</p>
<p>If you were to plot the actual values against their corresponding logarithmic values, you&#39;d notice that it resembles the plot of a logarithmic function. This resemblance occurs because, as the actual values increase, the increase in their logarithmic values becomes increasingly smaller.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log12.png" alt=""/></p>
<p><strong>An interesting effect of using the logarithmic scale is that small values get relatively more distant, while larger values get relatively closer.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log13.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The reason you should care about this change in relative distances is because it may cause unintended distortions, or, in the case of ill-intentioned people, <em>intended</em> distortions.</p>
<p>For example. Assume that a general council of alchemists doesn&#39;t want people to think there&#39;s a dragon fever pandemic. In that case, they can plot the number of infected people using a log scale, making it seem linear, when, in fact, it&#39;s exponential.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log14.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>However, there might be compelling reasons behind the decision to use a logarithmic transformation for this chart.</p>
<p>Imagine there are two kingdoms, Hyrule and the Mushroom Kingdom, each with vastly different population sizes. Hyrule has 10,000 inhabitants, while the Mushroom Kingdom boasts 10,000,000.</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s say a disease outbreak occurs in both kingdoms, starting with 10 infected individuals in each. On a regular linear scale, the number of infected individuals in Hyrule might seem insignificant compared to the Mushroom Kingdom&#39;s numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log15.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>If we switch to a logarithmic scale, the picture changes. The slope of the curve representing the increase in infected individuals in both kingdoms becomes comparable. So, when the disease spreads from 10 to 100 infected individuals in Hyrule, the curve&#39;s slope remains consistent. Similarly, when the Mushroom Kingdom sees its infected population rise from 10,000 to 100,000, the slope of its curve mirrors that of Hyrule&#39;s.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/logs/log16.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This scaling ensures that the threat level posed by the disease is communicated effectively in both kingdoms, regardless of their size. Without it, Hyrule&#39;s situation might appear deceptively less severe simply because of its smaller population. By utilizing a logarithmic scale, public health officials can accurately assess and address the risk posed by the disease in each kingdom, enabling more informed decision-making and resource allocation.</p>
<p>In addition to impacting visualizations, logarithmic transformations are also useful for statistical purposes, mostly because of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Symmetry</strong>. Logarithmic transformations may make data more balanced, which is essential for certain statistical techniques to work effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Homoscedasticity</strong>. Logarithmic transformations may help keep the spread of data consistent, which helps compare effects on different groups.</li>
<li><strong>Linearity</strong>. Logarithmic transformations may make it easier to see straight-line patterns in data, simplifying analysis.</li>
