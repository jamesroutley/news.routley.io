    <h1>Handoff Waste and Taylorism</h1>

I’m creating flashcards from my notes of Ward’s book on product
development<span><sup>1</sup> <i>Lean Product and Process Development</i>; Ward &amp; Sobek; Lean
Enterprises Institute, Inc.; 2014.</span> and it is chock full of wisdom. It’s an
insanely good book. Read it.

<p>
In product development organisations, there is usually a lot of work happening
that doesn’t make things better for the customer, also known as <i>waste</i>.
</p>

<p>
There’s one particular type of waste that’s built into every single one of our
organisations, thanks to <i>Taylorism</i>, or “scientific management”<span><sup>2</sup> I dislike
that term because it’s about as scientific as Young Earth creationism.</span>. In
essence, Taylorism advocates that when structuring work,
</p>

<ul>
<li>the Manager is responsible for project success;</li>
<li>the Expert decides how to do things;</li>
<li>the Worker does the actual job; and</li>
<li>feedback is unnecessary because the Expert has thought of it all already.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This sounds sensible because we’re culturally trained to accept it<span><sup>3</sup> And it
might even be sensible for some kinds of work, but not for product development
and other creative lines of work.</span>, but it leads to work being done
inefficiently, with lots of wasted cognitive effort.

<p>
The type of waste we are discussing is called <i>handoff</i> by Ward, and you might
recognise its effect from your past work experiences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the Worker does not have the knowledge necessary to do good work, they will
either do it badly or have to go back and forth to the Expert.</li>

<li>If the feedback of a quality problem does not reach the Worker they will
continue producing low quality.</li>

<li>If the Manager does not have the knowledge of how the thing is done they will
set a bad direction and hold both Workers and Experts to meaningless
standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some other consequences/symptoms of handoff are
</p>

<ul>
<li>Excessive status reporting, which takes time and produces no value for the
customer.</li>

<li>Lost knowledge, resulting in demands for explanations and irrelevant questions
being asked repeatedly.</li>

<li>Finger pointing and responsibility shirking, when people realise they can just
claim “I did my part correctly. The thing you’re talking about is not my job!”</li>

<li>Mistrust for management, because people respect and follow leaders who are
skilled at their job, not just appointed into some management position for
their political connections or business acumen.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These things are not inevitable parts of an organisation – they are created
specifically by handoff waste.
</p>

<p>
We can minimise handoff by keeping the four functions of <i>responsibility</i>,
<i>knowledge</i>, <i>action</i>, and <i>feedback</i> together. For each product being
developed, there should be exactly one person who is
</p>

<ul>
<li>responsible for project success, including quality targets, profitability,
staffing demands, etc.;</li>

<li>has the knowledge to develop it on their own, given enough time;</li>

<li>actively spends time on the floor working on the details; and</li>

<li>receives feedback about how things are going, both internally and from the
customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That person can hire other people to help them, but what they cannot do is
completely delegate any of the above functionalities to someone else. If they
do, waste will creep into the operation.
</p>

<p>
Toyota calls that person a Chief Engineer, and Ward suggests Entrepreneur System
Designer<span><sup>4</sup> There are good reasons for this specific name, but going into it
might be a separate article.</span>. Either way, it’s a role I’d like to see more of
in the industry.
