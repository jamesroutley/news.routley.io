<p>Subramanya was previously corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, and before that, he spent 16 years at Google. He was head of engineering for Google&#39;s Gemini Assistant, and Apple says that he has &#34;deep expertise&#34; in both AI and ML research that will be important to &#34;Apple&#39;s ongoing innovation and future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features.&#34;</p>
<p>Some of the teams that Giannandrea oversaw will move to Sabih Khan and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a>, such as AI Infrastructure and Search and Knowledge. Khan is Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/">new Chief Operating Officer</a> who took over for Jeff Williams earlier this year. Cue has long overseen Apple services.</p>
<p>Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> thanked Giannandrea for his role advancing Apple&#39;s AI work, and he said that he looks forward to working with Subramanya. He also said that Federighi has played an important role in Apple&#39;s AI efforts.<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users,&#34; said Tim Cook, Apple&#39;s CEO. &#34;AI has long been central to Apple&#39;s strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig&#39;s leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar&#39;s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple said that it is &#34;poised to accelerate its work in delivering intelligent, trusted, and profoundly personal experiences&#34; with the new AI team.</p>
<p>Giannandrea&#39;s departure comes after Apple&#39;s major iOS 18 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> failure. Apple introduced a smarter, &#34;‌Apple Intelligence‌&#34; version of ‌Siri‌ at WWDC 2024, and advertised the functionality when marketing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>. In early 2025, Apple announced that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">would not be able to release</a> the promised version of ‌Siri‌ as planned, and updates were delayed until spring 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-ai-executive-leaves-for-meta/">An exodus of Apple&#39;s AI team</a> followed as Apple scrambled to improve ‌Siri‌ and deliver on features like personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. Apple is now rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/apple-siri-google-gemini-partnership/">partnering with Google</a> for a more advanced version of ‌Siri‌ and other ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features that are set to come out next year.</p>
