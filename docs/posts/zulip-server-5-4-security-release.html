            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We released Zulip Server 5.4 today! This is a security release, containing a security fix and several cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.3.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a> in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes">Notable changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2022-31134: Exclude private file uploads from <a href="https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-of-public-data">exports of public data</a>; see the <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/07/12/zulip-cloud-data-exports/">accompanying Zulip Cloud post</a> for more details. We would like to thank Antoine Benoist for bringing this issue to our attention.</li>
<li>Upgraded python requirements.</li>
<li>Improved documentation for load balancers to mention CIDR address ranges.</li>
<li>Documented an explicit list of supported CPU architectures.</li>
<li>Switched <code>html2text</code> to run as a subprocess, rather than a Python module, as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.</li>
<li>Replaced  <code>markdown-include</code> python module with a reimplementation, as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.</li>
<li>Relicensed as GPL the <code>tools/check-thirdparty</code> developer tool which verifies third-party licenses, due to a GPL dependency by way of <code>python-debian</code>.</li>
<li>Closed a potential race condition in the Tornado server, with events arriving at exactly the same time as request causing server errors.</li>
<li>Added a tool to help automate more of the release process.</li>
</ul>
