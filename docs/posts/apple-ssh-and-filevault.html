<p>When FileVault is enabled, the data volume is locked and
    unavailable during and after booting, until an account has been
    authenticated using a password. The macOS version of OpenSSH stores all of
    its configuration files, both system-wide and per-account, in the data
    volume. Therefore, the usually configured authentication methods and shell
    access are not available during this time. However, when Remote Login is
    enabled, it is possible to perform password authentication using SSH even in
    this situation. This can be used to unlock the data volume remotely over the
    network. However, it does not immediately permit an SSH session. Instead,
    once the data volume has been unlocked using this method, macOS will
    disconnect SSH briefly while it completes mounting the data volume and
    starting the remaining services dependent on it. Thereafter, SSH (and other
    enabled services) are fully available.</p>

<p>The capability to unlock the data volume over SSH appeared in
    macOS 26 Tahoe.</p>
