            <p><SPAN face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to the &#34;<b><SPAN color="#000033">Battlestar 
                Galactica: Tech-Manual</SPAN></b>.&#34; Due to the many inconsistencies 
                found in the realm of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; science, we have dedicated 
                our efforts to applying real science to the popular 1979 TV series 
                created by Glenn A. Larson.</SPAN></p>
            <p><SPAN face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientific inaccuracies 
              plagued many of the science fiction movies/series during the late 
              70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s. It was not until the mid-80&#39;s that Hollywood 
              began to really tap NASA and other aerospace scientists for assistance 
              in fine tuning the technobable being used in science fiction films 
              and TV shows. </SPAN></p>
            <p><SPAN face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Listed on this site 
              are the rational explanations as to how the science and technology 
              of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; would have worked in the real world. I 
              hope you enjoy the site and, if you have any problems or questions,
