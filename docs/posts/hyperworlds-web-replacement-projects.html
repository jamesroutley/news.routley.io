<blockquote>
<p>The freedom to be yourself, to express who you are, freely using the results of group efforts, and of other individuals&#39; works, but recomposing them into artistic, scientific, religious, and philosophic works that don&#39;t force you to compromise what you believe (and allow you to combine all these disciplines). And you will get paid fairly for your work, as well as all those you quote, and whose work you borrow from. It will be groups working together, but without imposing group-think mentality upon anyone, as each person can individually publish and benefit from their own edition of any final products. But no document will be truly final, because it can always be corrected and improved upon by the author, and then modified and republished by other writers. The original author can then use the improvements added by collaborators in another version. Everyone gets credit for their work, gets paid, borrows freely, speaks freely, and works together while maintaining individuality. If you wish, you can even promote (or not) products, services, and artistic works you appreciate without being forced to lie about their weaknesses by your sponsors, since you will get paid for your evaluation by those who listen to and view and value your opinion. You can work with others to produce services that combine news, entertainment, and education without editorial quality being compromised by financial considerations from controlling forces bigger than you. These are the goals of Xanadu that are not possible with the tools we have today. These documents present and link to the methods and tools needed to accomplish these goals.</p>

<p>Xanadu: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tool worthy of chronicaling and creating the achievements, documents, and discussions * of all mankind ( * scientific, political, artistic, literary, mathematical, personal, social, religious, etc.). Because no two people have ever lived the same life.</p>
<p>A many lensed camera with many microphones and reels of film, cloned and spliced, being created, edited, and viewed by many people, with the Universe and its&#39; inhabitants as stage and actors; semi-chaotic but being continuously reorganized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding useless complication, gimcracks and geegaws to keep you distracted from what really matters: worthwhile content and highly interconnected relationships as you and others see them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*complication - especially in the creation process</p>
<p>*gimcrack:  adjective - flimsy or poorly made but deceptively attractive: plastic gimcrack cookware. </p>
<p>*geegaw: noun - a showy thing, esp. one that is useless or worthless.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="#FOI">The Future of Information</a> for a fuller expounding of these thoughts.</p>
<p>Also see - If Xanadu and Mirror Worlds are the answers, <a href="https://hyperworlds.org/answers.html">what are the questions?</a></p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><a name="Basic Principles"><b>Basic Principles of the WWW&#39;s replacements - goals, paradigms, benchmarks: </b></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Xanadu will provide all of these capabilities.</b> </p>
<ol>
<li>Facilitate the modeling of thought and reality with software. The reality of all that exists, has existed, and might exist in the future; it&#39;s meaning, interpretation, and interconnections - these are the objects and concepts to focus on. These should influence the data structures, not the other way around. We need to go beyond the mere imitation of paper in our software design.
</li><li>Everything Must be editable, quotable, annotatable - all the time by everyone. This is not optional. It must, however, be clear what has been modified, and who made the revisions. 
</li><li>The same information can be structured-viewed-formatted in various ways. Simultaneously having multiple dimensions and views. Potentially infinite dimensions will allow the same data to be included in vast numbers of sets, lists, and structures. Each user can have many unique personal dimensions linking all the documents they have ever accessed. They will be able to view these dimensions on any Internet connected computer, thus in effect, allowing their complete personal computing environments to follow them to any available screen in the world. By following along their personal time dimension from past through future, it provides a simple chronological organizing structure. You could even have a dimension linking all your favorite dimensions created by others. The real world will be one of the transparent overlays, it will be that other reality. It will be the strongly predominant display in mission critical situations, such as driving and close encounters with loved ones.
</li><li>Transclusion - (cloning, see-thru links). These allow quoting anything without losing the connection to the original document. This refers to a compound document where the viewer sees what appears to be a single work, but is in fact seeing parts of several works. This is not cut and pasted together, but seeing parts of several &#34;pages&#34;, as if they were stacked transparent overlays. 
</li><li>Easy royalty payments. Necessary if you want all the world&#39;s libraries and copyrighted media to potentially be available everywhere. Transclusions facilitate this. 
</li><li>All versions accessible, comparable side-by-side, with changes, deletions, and additions made visible between any two or more versions.
</li><li>Persistent, unbreakable 2-way links. This means that renaming files and directories and changing servers will have no effect on links and addresses. Links can be to and from points, spans (sentences, phrases, chapters, video segments, etc.), and documents. There will also be many author and reader defineable link types: comment, addition, disagreement, correction, outlines, and versions.
</li><li>A permanent data store. This makes it all possible. Everything gets an unchangeable storage location (automatically encrypted and backed-up in several locations). All documents, versions, and transclusions refer to this for content. 
<p>&#34;No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget&#34; - from the movie - One Hour Photo.</p>

</li></ol>
<p><b>Mirror Worlds will provide some of the above capabilities and the following as well.</b> </p>
<ol>
<li>Data mining. Seek insight into the nature of vast quantities of information by finding patterns in it.
</li><li>Automatic summarizing of huge amounts of information. When universal broadband connections make possible millions of fire-hoses of information all feeding into the Internet, a powerful method of making sense of it will be needed. This will probably be most useful in analyzing types of information that can be expressed as statistical data; and in diagnostic uses and monitoring current conditions of complex systems.
</li><li>A zoom-able interface, where you gain a system-wide view of the structure of the world or part of it, and can see all the parts in the context of the whole. Then you can zoom in anywhere for more detail. 
</li><li>Seamlessly integrate the analytical and creative capabilities of people and software.
</li><li>Integrate the storage and processing capabilities of millions of computers by combining them into a virtual supercomputer. If you need more processing power, your program spawns more programs on any connected computer and returns the results to you.
</li></ol>
<p>I expect the future of software to include some combination or merging of these; or a new data structure that will offer the benefits of both. Perhaps the ideas behind Mirror Worlds can be used to build a distributed archival system for Xanadu; as well as distributed processing, similar to that used in the <a href="https://foldingathome.org">Folding At Home Project</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs showed some amazing capabilities of the Mac OS 10.4 and applications, which has some eye-popping algorithms. But the other half of the computing picture are advanced data structures. Spotlight has some of the indexing capabilities of Mirror Worlds, but the basic features of Xanadu are still absent. See Jobs&#39; <a href="https://youtu.be/Skl923fLf_4">keynote address</a></p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><b>What is wrong with the World Wide Web?</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It violates or lacks all of the above principles.</p>
<p>Links break when web pages move. Links are one-way (when you link to something, it doesn&#39;t link back to you. It is difficult or impossible to add your own notes and comments to the content you are accessing. The lack of transclusions makes royalty payments and copyright protection very difficult, thus excluding tens of millions of valuable documents from being on the web, despite the web&#39;s enormous efficiencies of distribution. Previous and alternate versions are almost never available. It is a mishmash of technologies that are virtually impossible for one person to learn. Most software today is like frosting with no cake underneath. The frosting looks and tastes good (is user-friendly), but without a solid structure underneath, it collapses. It lacks a structure that is strong, yet flexible. (In Xanadu, the back-end server software is the cake, the front-end client, always editable, is the frosting). </p>
<p>The Web is the most popular form of hypertext, but one of the worst. The fact that this is a website pointing this out highlights it&#39;s greatest strengths. It was the first hypertext to use the Internet and it is cross-platform. </p>
<p>But it will not last. It does not have strong and flexible structure. It is a towering house of cards held up by hype and short-sighted expediency. It is collapsing.</p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><b>What needs changing?</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current software isn&#39;t totally worthless. Some of the best could become part of the front-end software for creatively interacting with the contents of a persistent data* store. Monthly subscriptions could be re-distributed proportionally to some of the content providers: writers, painters, animators, movie-makers, commentators, programmers, singers, musicians, translators, narrators, etc. </p>
<p> * The words data, content, hypertext and hypermedia are often used interchangeably and include all forms of communication; including newspapers, television, radio, magazines, books, movies, virtual (realities, 3-D artistic creations, mathematical, geometrical, fractal, and topological universes in infinite dimensions, land-sea-planet-space scapes and travel, shared chat spaces where each participant can choose their environment and activity). These &#34;documents&#34; can be a new shared artistic medium: swimming, flying, dreaming, and imagining together. All made possible by a flexible and scalable data structure. My belief is that there will be VR environments where each person engaged in a conversation can at the same time be in the location and activity of their own choosing: spelunking, sitting on a beach or in a tree in a rain forest, bungee jumping, spinning a pottery wheel, exploring the Marianas Trench, or merely shopping.</p>
<p>While watching a movie, you could add your own audio commentary or textual notes and links as a supplement. Someone watching the movie could have the option to listen or read your additions. When they do this, micropayments would automatically be deposited into your account and the movie maker would also receive royalties from each viewer. The same thing for all media: books, magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs, music. You could create a composite document of any or all these media, freely using everything available. When viewed or listened to, all the content creators would receive payments automatically, unless they want to give their content away.</p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><b>Our tools become extensions of ourselves.</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why we can develop such a personal attachment to them. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I think about what we need developed in software: When I am engaging in any form of human communication, (day)dreaming, or other sensory interaction, I think about how it could be done even better with software and hardware. I may be watching a movie in a theater or DVD, listening to a live orchestra, watching the news on TV, hiking in the woods, reading a math book, talking on the phone, whatever I may be doing. How could I record, share, link, annotate, enhance this experience? How can it be improved? What am I missing because of current design limitations? When  I think of a movie, I think of one that is visually, aurally, and intellectually complex, but with some unifying structure (Lord of the Rings, for example). When I think about linking, I think of each word linked to dictionaries, thesauri, and encyclopedias; each footnote linked to the location in the book referred to; each reference to a work of music or video linked to the actual work. And of course, everything must be editable all the time by anyone (creating a new version). In other words, when I think of hypertext, the one thing I don&#39;t think of is the World Wide Web (except to think of limitations to overcome).</p>
<p>How can you know if what you believe is the best of all possible alternatives if you haven&#39;t read the best presentations available of all the alternatives?</p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><b>What Xanadu has that others don&#39;t:</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When responding to any argument (for or against something), you will be able to comment on each and every relevant sentence. The document you are commenting on will automatically link to your analysis. Whether readers of the document see your comments or not is up to them. They will have filtering tools to include or exclude whoever they want. That is their decision to make. Thus every possible viewpoint can be heard and can cross-comment on each other as much as desired.</p>

<p><b>Ted Nelson</b> - a pioneer in hypertext and designer of Xanadu, Zigzag, and Floating World. I recommend reading everything he has written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To design the new structures of writing for screens is a profound issue of literary structure. It is important to provide the best literary structure that we can, for hypertext, as the literature of tomorrow, determines in part the new structure of civilization. Civilization is in large part about, and around, what is written. This is what we call literature. Literature is an endless river, connected, like water, in all directions. Document connections go forward and backward in time, and sideways between documents. Scholarship and fiction, political speeches and criticism, advertising, journalism and technical reports-- all affect each other and evolve in a constant flow of ideas and writings.</p>

<p><a href="http://wirehose.com/research/entvisualization">The Loaf Question</a> &#34;This is the data structure created for the Xanadu? project between 1988 and 1992, and may be the most complex data structure in the world. At the very least, it&#39;s fiendishly hard to comprehend by reading the literature and the code. Hence the pictures.&#34; </p>
<p>&#34;It was designed to hold all the knowledge in the world. You tell it secrets, and they are dutifully stored away in an ever-branching, walking tree of long memory. It knows everything it&#39;s ever been told. It knows who told it. And if you change your mind, it remembers both the new secret, and the old, and what parts of the new secret were taken from the old. It remembers if you&#39;ve combined two or more secrets. It can tell you what secrets contain other secrets, even secrets that have since been changed. It knows what secrets simply refer to other secrets. It knows every revision of everything it&#39;s ever been told to remember.&#34;</p>
<p>I have only a vague understanding of the structure of this design. Maybe someone will get Xanadu fully implemented this way. Time will eventually tell. </p>

<p>With current technology, pieces of information are destroyed, get lost or are stored but never found by the people who most need them. Libraries burn, files are misplaced in cabinets, or a piece of knowledge is simply lost in the growing sea of information. Take the notion of a theory and a refutation. The two ideas are separated by space, time, authorship, perhaps even disciplines. The refutation may be undiscovered and undiscoverable by a researcher, who then wastes years of effort pursuing an erroneous idea. If theory and refutation could be permanently linked together, the web of context would be vastly enriched. -- Udanax Green Febe Protocol </p>

<p><a name="tokenword"></a><a href="http://www.hyperworlds.org/cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord.pl">token_word</a> - created by Jason Rohrer in just 9 days of Perl coding - Pay attention to this, as it is the pre-curser to getting the tens of millions of copyrighted works onto the Internet, in a way where everyone gets fair payment, even when quoted and re-quoted. Implements some of the major features of Xanadu in a web browser (amazingly), including transclusions and micro-payment royalties. Just try it out. I was stunned. If you want to read about it first, see <a href="http://hypertext.sf.net/token_word/token_word.pdf">http://hypertext.sf.net/token_word/token_word.pdf</a> Although not as graphically fancy as the Web (yet), it has the most important elements needed to replace the World Wide Web as we know it now. If you sign up for an account, you get 50,000 demo tokens free, to purchase that many characters of text. You can later buy more tokens at 1 million for a dollar using PayPal. When you read someone&#39;s document, tokens are transferred from your account to the author&#39;s. When someone reads your document, you get paid in tokens. If someone quotes your document, you get paid every time someone reads your words. The non-demo tokens have cash value. <b>Finally, after 40 years of waiting, a working subset of xanalogical hypertext. </b>Although the ultimate Xanadu will need to do more than current browsers can support, <a href="http://www.hyperworlds.org/cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord.pl">token word</a> is the best proof yet that the main elements do work. A full-blown graphical version of Xanadu with visual editing and comparison of versions is bound to be just around the corner.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hypertext.sourceforge.net/docuplex">Docuplex</a> Jason Rohrer has written another fascinating demo of xanalogical editing. It&#39;s a Java program he wrote in an afternoon that allows you to edit text, see the edit pointer list below, and below that to see the permanent record of all keystrokes. If you have read Nelson&#39;s books, you may find this as interesting as I have. If you have ever edited film or video using an edit decision list, you will see the similarity. A record is made of all the in and out edit points. You can see from this exactly what frames are to be deleted and which ones moved to create a new edit. In Docuplex, you can see exactly what characters you deleted because they are excluded from the edit list, and every character that was recorded in the permanent record. This is like lifting the hood on Xanadu and seeing the pistons firing real-time. To run it from Mac OSX, I typed &#34;java -cp . DocuplexFrame&#34;. It also runs on Windows, Unix, and Linux.

<p><a href="http://lazysoft.com">Sentences</a> is a very interesting database system with several ideas in common with Xanadu and zigzag. They have an excellent book about data modeling you can download called &#34;The Associative Model of Data&#34;. Here is an excerpt from pages 70-71: &#34;What makes a good application? Well, first, what do we mean by &#34;good&#34;? The answer is twofold: firstly, a good application must fulfil its users&#39; needs now, and secondly it must be capable of adapting so that it continues to fulfil those needs as they change over time. Conceptually an application comprises two parts: a data model and a user interface. Broadly, the user  interface determines how well the application meets its users&#39;  needs now, and the data model determines how well it can adapt  over time. It is now generally acknowledged that the lion&#39;s share  of software development budgets are spent on maintenance  rather than new development, so from an economic standpoint  the ability to adapt over time (or more fully stated, the ability to  be maintained at reasonable cost) is clearly the more important  criterion. Thus the data model is more important than the user  interface in determining the quality of an application. An  application with a good data model and a poor user interface is  not necessarily a good application, but an application with a  poor data model can never be a good application. A good data  model with a poor user interface is preferable to a poor data  model with a good user interface, because it is relatively easy to  fix a poor user interface and almost impossible to fix a poor data  model.&#34;</p>

<p><b>How to make it all happen?</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What principles and precautions need to be kept in mind to make Xanadu and/or Mirror Worlds a reality.</p>
<p>Xanadu has been a dream and on and off project since 1961. It could become a working reality by business, non-profit group, or a university: anyone willing to supply the creativity, discipline, and resources to make it happen.</p>
<p>Good business books I have read that dramatically changed my thinking (actually I listened to the audiobooks many times). Some books are far better than average and deserve repeated readings.</p>
<blockquote>

I first read (listened to) this book in 2008. For the past several years, I had given up hope that effective management and organization was a possibility. I have now regained hope.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncscaug.us/intvomniscience.htm">Jim Wingard interview</a> &#34;It seems that the real challenge (as with most software projects) is defining exactly what the requirements are and how to build your beast. Once you&#39;ve nailed down the &#34;what and how&#34; of your project the actual implementation doesn&#39;t take too long. Beyond that, there is always the matter of coordinating schedules with outside help.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just because something has been done wrong for ten years doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be done right - it only means nobody&#39;s done it yet. - Makes you wonder what other &#39;tried and failed&#39; opportunites are out there waiting for someone to find the magic combination of factors that will turn it into the next revolutionary idea.&#34; <a href="http://www.fortymedia.com/blog/opinion/11/why-podcasting-took-off">http://www.fortymedia.com/blog/opinion/11/why-podcasting-took-off</a> <br/>

<p>Five or ten years ago, I predicted privately that some newspaper would figure out it could save millions of dollars a year in printing costs by giving away hundred dollar computers to read it&#39;s &#34;paper&#34; and sell its&#39; presses. Just think of the enourmous waste of resources newspapers are! Well, that may soon become a reality.
