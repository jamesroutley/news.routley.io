    <h1>Genie 3: A new frontier for world models</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="swoy7">Next steps</h2><p data-block-key="5i4jt">We believe Genie 3 is a significant moment for world models, where they will begin to have an impact on many areas of both AI research and generative media. To that end, we&#39;re exploring how we can make Genie 3 available to additional testers in the future.</p><p data-block-key="2us9t">Genie 3 could create new opportunities for education and training, helping students learn and experts gain experience. Not only can it provide a vast space to train agents like robots and autonomous systems, Genie 3 can also make it possible to evaluate agents’ performance, and explore their weaknesses.</p><p data-block-key="b7jov">At every step, we’re exploring the implications of our work and developing it for the benefit of humanity, safely and responsibly.</p>
