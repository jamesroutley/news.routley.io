            <p>One of the minor marvels of sunsets is that phone cameras cannot capture them well. This much is known.</p>
<p>One of the slightly less minor marvels of sunsets is that phone cameras cannot even provide a good portal back to their beauty. If I take a picture by an ice-cream stand on a summer afternoon, the camera will not capture the texture of the heat, nor the physicality of the cone, but it will remind me of these things, and I might think that I remember that day.</p>
<p>Not so with sunsets. All I&#39;m left with is leaden swath of color.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I&#39;m often tempted to think of myself as a noun. I, as a thing, am a body, with a collections of other things arrayed about me, an assortment of friends I&#39;ve made, and a set of achievements of memories. Sure, I <em>do</em> things, but only as a noun does them. A baseball bat is a baseball bat, whether or not it hits a ball.</p>
<p>Phones flatter this thought, because all day, they collect. They gather the places I&#39;ve been, the things I&#39;ve seen, even most of the words I say. Little is lost; everything else is offered out to me on a platter. Except for sunsets.</p>
<p>Sunsets remind me that I am a verb. The collections of things around me are not passive stuff; they are objects that I <em>relate</em> to. I <em>wear</em> clothes, I <em>write</em> on paper, I <em>walk</em> in shoes. My friends are not flowers in a notebook; we&#39;re only friends because we <em>act</em> as friends together. Even my memories, the last things I would have if you took everything else from me, are things which I can only access by <em>living</em> them from scratch, every time.</p>
<p>So yes, I am a verb. I <em>verb</em>. &#34;To be&#34; is a verb. All I can do is live in the narrow strip between yesterday and tomorrow, no matter what anyone says. No matter what my phone offers me.</p>
<p>So as I look out at this sunset, this glorious panoramic view over Berkeley, I cannot capture it in any meaningful way. All I can do is live this moment so vividly that when I remember this day, I still feel the tremors.</p>
