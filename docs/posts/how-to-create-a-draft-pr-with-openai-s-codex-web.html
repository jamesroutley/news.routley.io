    <h1>How to Create a Draft PR with OpenAI&#39;s Codex (Web)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I&#39;ve been playing around with AI for building software the past few months. While I believe that <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_stop-vibe-coding">vibe engineering &gt; vibe coding</a>, I still think there&#39;s a place for agentic coding workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a> has been very supportive in letting us try out new AI tools and I&#39;ve been playing around with Codex Cloud - Open AI&#39;s web-based coding agent - for putting up small adhoc fixes and refactors.</p>

<p>A problem I&#39;ve run into is that the default <code>Create PR</code> button creates an <code>Open</code> PR which immediately tags teams for review. This is NOT what I want as it&#39;s typically a half-baked solution that I&#39;m trying to iterate on, not smth that I want to waste someone else&#39;s time with. As a reminder, you should <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-09_review-your-ais-code">always review your AI&#39;s code</a>.</p>

<p>So as a note to future me, you can create a draft PR with Codex by clicking the little drop down arrow next to <code>Create PR</code> and select <code>Create draft PR</code>. This will send the code up to GitHub where it can run in CI and give you time to review / refine it BEFORE another human looks at it.</p>
