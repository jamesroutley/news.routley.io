    <h1>Show HN: Performant intracontinental public transport routing in Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Fast RAPTOR implementation in Rust designed for memory-constrained machines.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Built on top of Valhalla for transfers and first/last mile routing.</li>
<li>Multi-agency and timezone-aware routing.</li>
<li>Route shapes are not returned with the itineraries.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to supplement OpenTripPlanner in <a href="https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway">Headway</a> as an infill service for areas not covered by <a href="https://www.opentripplanner.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenTripPlanner</a> instances.
Memory mapping is used for the timetables with the aim of enabling planet-scale coverage with a single instance, and affordable hosting costs.
GTFS-RT support is in scope.
Per-request walking/cycling costing model tweaks will likely never be supported because RAPTOR requires pre-computation of transfers, but pre-defined costing models for walking, cycling, and wheelchair usage are in scope.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project may be obsoleted by Valhalla&#39;s built-in multimodal support depending on its performance characteristics.
Based on the information in the RAPTOR paper about its performance versus A* based methods, it seems likely that there will still be a place for <code>farebox</code> even once Valhalla can do multimodal trips.
This project may also eventually support a rRAPTOR routing option which would allow simultaneous calculation of itineraries across a wide range of departure times, which isn&#39;t something you can do with an A* search through a time-dependant routing graph to my knowledge.</p>
