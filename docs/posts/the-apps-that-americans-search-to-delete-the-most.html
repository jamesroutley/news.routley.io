    <h1>The apps that Americans search to “delete” the most</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the midst of the winter blues, individuals everywhere are sprucing up, clearing out, and taking a break from the things that are no longer serving them — Android apps included. What better time for an early “spring clean” than a new calendar year?</p><p>With screen time reaching record highs in recent years and the average American <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/average-screen-time-now-6-hours-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending a whopping 4-6 hours</a> per day on their phone — we wanted to find out which apps are most likely to be headed for the trash can in 2023.</p><section><h3 id="key-takeaways">

Snapchat has raised many concerns since its inception, including issues with <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/social-media/snapchat-privacy-settings/">Snapchat’s privacy</a> and security, invasive location services, and the common misconception that snaps are private and temporary. </p><p>Despite the average American Snapchat user spending around <a href="https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/snapchat-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 minutes a day on the app</a>, our data found that New Mexico (89 searches per 100,000) and Arizona (88 searches per 100,000) were the states most keen to give Snapchat the cut from their phone screens. </p><h3 id="bye-bye-birdy-could-it-be-the-end-for-twitter">Bye bye birdy – Could it be the end for Twitter?</h3><p>Since Elon Musk was appointed owner, many users are of the opinion that the once-renowned social networking app has been on a downward flight. Our data shows that Twitter has the fourth-highest negative search volume amongst all apps analyzed at 92,490. Could this be due to Twitter’s recent rival ‘Mastodon’?</p><p>Our data found that California, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington were the states most keen to deactivate or delete Twitter. </p><h3 id="telegram-ranks-fifth-for-the-app-americans-most-want-to-delete">Telegram ranks fifth for the app Americans most want to delete</h3><p>Telegram has raised a few too many eyebrows since its inception. Firstly, the online messaging service’s Telegram chats aren’t <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/apps/is-telegram-safe/">encrypted by default</a>. Secondly, according to <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegrams-doxing-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, Telegram has a serious <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/internet-safety/cybercrime/what-is-doxing/">doxing</a> problem and is a haven for politically motivated vitriol.</p><p>Since it became popular, Telegram has willingly moderated harmful content and messages on its platform, and now it ranks fifth with a negative search volume of 24,810. New Jersey ranked for the highest negative search volume per capita among all analyzed states. </p><h3 id="spotifydeleted">#Spotifydeleted</h3><p>At the start of 2022, the music streaming app Spotify faced a lot of controversies after #ByeByeSpotify and #SpotifyDeleted blew up on social media amid the Joe Rogan uproar. This could explain why Spotify currently sits a firm sixth in our listings with a search volume of 14,560. That said, the search volume is marginal when compared to social giants such as Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>‘Delete Spotify’ reigned supreme in Vermont, yet had minimal search volume in states such as Louisiana and Alabama.</p><h3 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-tiktok">The rise and fall of TikTok</h3><p>When compared to Instagram, <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/social-media/tiktok-privacy/">TikTok</a> — also known as the app that pioneered a new age of instant attention — has a marginal delete search volume of 14,120. Of those searches, 6,320 were for “delete TikTok account.”</p><p>In November 2022, TikTok caused huge controversy by announcing an update to its privacy policy which would allow employees in both China and other countries <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/news/tiktok-to-allow-chinese-staff-access-european-users-data/">access to its European users’ data</a>. </p><p>That said, <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/tiktok-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research has shown</a> that US TikTok users spend around 45.8 minutes a day on the app. Despite the government’s attempts to remove the app, it seems the US just can’t get enough. Even so, our study shows that the app ranks seventh most likely to be deleted.</p><h3 id="is-linkedin-losing-links">Is Linkedin losing links?</h3><p>There are many reasons why people may decide to delete the business and employment-focused social media platform LinkedIn. They might be tired of unhealthy competition, constant spam messages, or <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/social-media/manage-your-linkedin-privacy-settings/">lack of privacy</a>, for example.</p><p>It seems an increasing number of US residents are edging towards throwing LinkedIn in the trash can, as it takes eighth place on our list with a combined search volume of 8,540: 2,780 searches for “delete app” and 5,760 for “delete account.”</p><h3 id="tinder-sees-a-decline-in-its-dating-game">Tinder sees a decline in its dating game</h3><p>Our research suggests that residents in the US are prioritizing more of an IRL (in real life) attitude to the sport. Tinder ranks ninth in our listings, with a combined search volume of 7,980 — including 4,810 searches for “delete Tinder account”. This could be due to the number of <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/apps/privacy-tinder/">privacy risks of using Tinder</a>, or they’ve simply found their match.</p><p>With 890 searches for both “delete app” and “delete account” combined in California, 470 in Florida, 350 in New York and 690 in Texas, it seems there are a number of US residents looking to move the dating app into the trash bin.</p><h2 id="the-apps-with-the-most-active-users">The Apps with the Most Active Users</h2><p>Using Similarweb, we looked into the active amount of users and downloads to analyze the current and past popularity of each Android app across the last six months. Which shifts have taken place? Which popular apps have been dethroned? And which new platforms are on the rise? Our findings are listed down below.</p><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="550" height="1719" src="https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022.png" alt="App Store-like graphic with the top 20 apps Americans used the most in 2022" srcset="https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022.png 550w, https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022-96x300.png 96w, https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022-328x1024.png 328w, https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022-491x1536.png 491w, https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographic-Top-20-Apps-Americans-Used-the-Most-in-2022-182x570.png 182w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></figure><h3 id="twitter-vs-mastodon-unpacked">Twitter vs. Mastodon Unpacked</h3><p>The app that saw the biggest increase in active users in the past six months was Mastodon whilst Twitter saw a decrease of 2.33%. When Elon Musk became CEO of Twitter at the end of October, the company saw a decrease of -5.59% in active users between November and December. December was the lowest month for active users (13.3 million) over a six-month period. This indicates that Musk’s acquisition likely prompted people to search for alternative platforms for their everyday musings.</p><p>For most people, that app was Mastodon. The new upcoming social media app saw an impressive increase of 4231% in active users and an 8602% download increase in the past six months. Clearly, many individuals were looking for a taste of this “decentralized social medium.”</p><p>That said, Mastodon saw a 15.46% reduction in active users and a 53.40% reduction in downloads between November and December 2022. This could be due to Twitter beginning to block links to Mastodon or people going back to the familiarity of Twitter.</p><h3 id="bereal-hype-or-hit">BeReal – hype or hit?</h3><p>BeReal saw an increase of 268.46% in active users in the second half of 2022. According to <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/bereal-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business of Apps</a>, in July 2022, BeReal hit the number one spot on Apple’s App Store in the US.</p><p>In the past six months, the upcoming social media app saw a 56.38% increase in downloads. So the question is, will BeReal continue to be a hit?</p><h3 id="paramount-sees-a-rise-in-active-users">Paramount+ sees a rise in active users</h3><p>Between November and December 2022, the Paramount+ app saw a 33.55% increase in active users. This could be due to the popular content that Paramount+ dropped in December, which includes the movies and shows Little Women, A League of Their Own, the latest Yellowstone prequel, 1923, and Top Gun: Maverick.</p><h3 id="nintendos-new-update-pleases-users">Nintendo’s new update pleases users</h3><p>In March 2022, the Nintendo app had a sizable update, which brought great improvements to the user experience. In the past six months, Nintendo has seen a 76.72% increase in active users, reflective of the update.</p><h2 id="the-most-downloaded-apps-in-america">The Most Downloaded Apps in America</h2><p>We’re now aware of which brands saw the biggest increase in active users in the past six months, but which apps have the largest number of downloads? If apps are gaining traction in downloads each month, it shows their ability to attract new users.</p><h3 id="instagram-is-the-most-downloaded-app-of-2022">Instagram is the most downloaded app of 2022</h3><p>Instagram ranked the most popular app of 2022 with over 11.8 million downloads on average each month — highlighting that the controversies of the photo-sharing app didn’t slow down its downloads. It seems Instagram’s introduction of reels and other videos could have been a smart change.</p><p><a href="https://petapixel.com/2022/01/14/instagram-was-the-number-one-downloaded-app-globally-in-q4-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research suggests</a> that as “Instagram shifts away from photography, long-time, successful Instagram photographers are coming to terms with the fact they may have to shift back to a multi-platform marketing strategy.”</p><h3 id="lord-of-the-rings-spikes-amazon-prime-downloads">Lord of the Rings spikes Amazon Prime downloads</h3><p>Amazon Prime has over 1.6 million downloads on average each month, making it the 11th most downloaded app overall. Recently, the long-awaited and highly anticipated TV series, Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power hit the screens of Amazon Prime in September 2022, accounting for a spike in downloads of the Amazon Prime app. Between the months of August 2022 and September 2022, they shot up from 1.6 million to 2.3 million, an increase of 700,000 downloads.</p><p>Yet, when October hit, the number of downloads decreased back down to 1,300,000. This highlights that apps are temporary: people download and are active on them right up until they feel they no longer gain anything from the app — which, in this case, was new episodes of the Lord of the Rings prequel.</p><h3 id="between-november-and-december-tiktok-saw-an-8-7-increase-in-downloads">Between November and December, TikTok saw an 8.7% increase in downloads </h3><p>Recently, President Joe Biden approved the ban of TikTok from federal government phones<span> </span>and vitriol towards TikTok, claiming the video-sharing app invades its user’s privacy by potentially passing on data to the <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/news/tiktok-to-allow-chinese-staff-access-european-users-data/">Chinese government</a>. Our research has shown that the social media platform has a current average of 21,705,714 active users (ranking fourth) and a download average of 6,442,847 (ranking third).</p><p>Interestingly, in the past six months, TikTok saw a 13.97% decrease in downloads. However, between the months of November to December, there was an 8.70% increase. TikTok isn’t expected to be decreasing in popularity: according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1116512/uk-tiktok-users-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statista</a>, the video-sharing app is set to have 15 million users by 2025! that is, unless the US government steps in and bans the app once and for all.</p><h2 id="apps-with-the-largest-decrease-in-downloads-over-the-last-six-months">Apps with the Largest Decrease in Downloads Over the Last Six Months</h2><figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Rank</strong></th><th><strong>App</strong></th><th><strong>6 month change in downloads</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Facebook Messenger</td><td>-80.42%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Clubhouse</td><td>-58.24%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Snapchat</td><td>-46.43%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Linkedin</td><td>-41.26%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Whatsapp</td><td>-35.00%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Disney Plus</td><td>-31.25%</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Instagram</td><td>-25.15%</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Bumble</td><td>-23.53%</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Spotify</td><td>-23.12%</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Facebook</td><td>-22.73%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 id="facebook-messengers-downloads-plummet-fast">Facebook Messenger’s downloads plummet – fast</h3><p>With the highs inevitably come the lows: our data has highlighted that, in the past six months, <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/social-media/delete-facebook/">Facebook</a> Messenger has seen its fair share of percentage lows, with a decrease of 52% of active users.</p><p>Not only are fewer US residents using the once-unrivaled messaging app, Facebook Messenger additionally saw an 80.42% decrease in downloads from new users in the past six months. In comparison, the rival messaging app WhatsApp saw a 35% decline.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>From the takeover of Elon Musk to the vitriol of harmful content, there are various reasons why users all around the United States are choosing to fling some of their once-beloved Android apps into the trash can.</p><p>The question is, are these changes here to stay, or will social giants such as Instagram and Facebook be able to learn from their mistakes and create a fresh start?</p><hr/><h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3><p>We analyzed search volume using <a href="https://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keywordtool.io</a> for the 50 states across the US to find out which apps they wanted to delete the most. We researched similar keywords like “delete Instagram app” and “deactivate Instagram account” to help give us the full picture.</p><p>We then researched the number of users actively utilizing the apps on a daily basis, and the number of users downloading the app on a daily basis in America using <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Similarweb</a> to further recognize the apps that were losing popularity.</p><section><div><figure><img src="https://vpnoverview.com/wp-content/uploads/Kat-Oran-Profile-Avatar-150x150.png" alt="Kat Oran" width="128" height="128" loading="lazy"/></figure><div><h4>Content &amp; Copywriter Coordinator</h4><p>Kat is an IT security business professional in the areas of cybersecurity, online privacy, and censorship with experience in project management, process development, and leadership.
