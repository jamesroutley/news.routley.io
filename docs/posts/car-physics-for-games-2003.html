<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This tutorial is about simulating cars in games, in other words
vehicle physics.   </p>
<p>One of the key points in simplifying vehicle physics is to handle
the longtitudinal and lateral forces separately.  Longtitudinal
forces operate in the direction of the car body (or in the exact
opposite direction).  These are wheel force, braking force, rolling
resistance and drag (= airresistance).  Together these forces
control the acceleration or deceleration of the car and therefore the
speed of the car.  Lateral forces allow the car to turn. 
These forces are caused by sideways friction on the wheels.  We&#39;ll
also have a look at the angular moment of the car and the torque caused
by lateral forces. </p>
<h4>Notation and conventions</h4>
Vectors are shown in<b> bold,</b> we&#39;ll be using 2d vectors.  So the
notation <b>a</b> = -<b>b </b>would translate to the following code
