Chaim Gingold’s “Play Design” dissertation tells the story of how that happened (except the X11 conversion and open sourcing the code came later):</p><h2 id="284f">Open Sourcing SimCity, by Chaim Gingold</h2><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/364/0*-XDlPU9Iy86QI7SX.jpg" width="182" height="218" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption><a href="http://chaim.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Chaim Gingold</a> described <a href="https://medium.com/@donhopkins/open-sourcing-simcity-58470a275446" rel="noopener">Open Sourcing SimCity</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="2158">In 1991 the computer manufacturer Sun Microsystems, as part of an initiative to address the market for GIS computing (geographic information system), became interested in bringing SimCity into their platform. Sun’s business was rooted in selling Unix workstations, and to that end, would often support the development of applications for specific market verticals. In the summer of 1991, Sun circulated a message to gauge interest in SimCity:</p></blockquote><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/736/1*b5bmP7W-ckrsbKLg9XWF8A.png" width="368" height="160" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>Sun thought SimCity would help sell workstations to the GIS market.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="6d0e">The GIS and Desktop Applications Segments have a window of opportunity to get the #1 selling game “SimCity” ported to Sun. The opportunity also allows us to open up the software so that it can become a front end to GIS applications by including ToolTalk and/or import/export file capability to the standard GIS formats. This and networking will differentiate it from the PC version. The Sun SimCity version will allow Sun to offer a true “desktop” GIS solution as well as a leading entertainment package!</p><p id="b2a5">The game is currently being used by many government offices to train their city planners. We have already received high support from ESRI [a developer of commercial GIS products] and URISA [a GIS education and advocacy non-profit] to move the game over and now are seeking Sun field encouragement that will concur with our direction.</p><p id="e1ff">Please respond with any comments or customer interest that you think would support the project.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p id="9d93">The potential for a serious application, such as GIS, is overblown — it is hard to imagine SimCity enabling Sun to offer a “true ‘desktop’ GIS solution.” The email, however, speaks to the appeal of SimCity as a compelling representation of a city. Not only was it serious enough for GIS, but it was fun, qualities which enabled it to become absorbed into the current of Sun’s marketing agenda.</p><p id="5add">One person who responded enthusiastically to this proposition was Don Hopkins, a programmer at Sun who first played SimCity in 1989, while studying computer science at the University of Maryland, where it made a deep impression upon him. While a student, Hopkins had worked for the influential user interface researchers Ben Shneiderman and Marc Weiser, where he contributed to the development of pie menus (see Callahan et al. 1988), an unconventional graphical user interface mechanism that would eventually figure prominently in The Sims, on which Hopkins would be a key contributor.</p><p id="8f97">Hopkins began work on the SimCity to Unix conversion while working at Sun, but the project was eventually completed under the aegis of DUX Software. On July 19th 1991, DUX signed a ten year contract to convert and market SimCity on Unix, with Hopkins brought on as a contractor about six months later. Using the Macintosh version of SimCity, Hopkins performed the conversion, rewrote the remaining sections of assembly language to platform neutral C, and changed the platform from Macintosh to X11. Throughout the 1990’s, Hopkins did the programming necessary to convert SimCity to a wide variety of Unix platforms, adding pie menus and multiplayer support (Perkins 1993; Hopkins 2013; Joffe 2015).</p></blockquote></div><div><figure><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Institute"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1090/0*JfZ8_z-M2GxganI8.gif" width="545" height="593" role="presentation"/></p></a><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Institute" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Turing Institute</a> in Glasgow Scotland</figcaption></figure><p id="459a">I packed up my SparcStation 2 and moved to Glasgow in 1992, to work at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Institute" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Turing Institute</a> with Arthur, making what was then called HyperNeWS into a product, and porting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">SimCity</a> to run the Sun Workstation’s NeWS window system with HyperNeWS.</p><p id="e8d1">We then renamed it HyperLook, developed a runtime version suitable for publishing commercial products, wrote documentation and promotions, and released it simultaneously with SimCity, using them both to synergistically promote and demonstrate each other’s value!</p><h2 id="51ab">Eating Our Own Dog Food, and Loving It</h2><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/790/1*cZB2cBUfh75Kb2TRUGYAFA.png" width="395" height="600" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>Developing HyperLook and SimCity together forced us to eat our own dog food.</figcaption></figure><p id="0654">Since we developed HyperLook and SimCity at the same time, that forced us to eat our own dog food, and ensure that HyperLook supported everything you needed to develop real world applications. (Not to imply that SimCity is a real world! ;)</p><p id="aa54">Having such a demanding game as SimCity stress tested HyperLook and forced us to provide features that SimCity required, like high speed raster views and a sound mixer, in a way that benefited the entire environment and all other applications.</p><h2 id="d32d">Shared Memory Library</h2><p id="57d9">The shared memory library we developed for SimCity enabled a client written in C or other languages to read/write the pixels of an image shared in NeWS server, so both the C client and NeWS PostScript can efficiently synchronize, draw into and read back pixels from shared memory. That enables some creative ways of combining raster bitmaps and PostScript graphics, as the Cellular Automata engine demonstrates.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1110/0*lr42ibPgbivRXARD.gif" width="555" height="882" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>HyperLook had a message oriented network client interface, a shared memory raster animation library, and a real time sound mixer.</figcaption></figure><p id="810c">We also used the shared memory library with a video capture device, by implementing a C client that connected to the device and dithered the YUV image into an 8 bit NeWS compatible color palette.</p><h2 id="f09b">Audio Mixer</h2><p id="11b0">The audio mixer was essential for SimCity itself, since it required playing multiple simultaneous sounds, that must be mixed in real time. But of course all other HyperLook applications could benefit from being able to play sounds without tripping over each other, too.</p><p id="ba88">The Sun’s /dev/audio device was too low level to support mixing sounds, or even more than one application playing a sound at once. The solution was to develop a sound mixer server, which was simply a HyperLook client who connects to the Sound stack and listens for messages, while mixing any playing sounds in real time.</p><p id="3208">When any HyperLook applications sends a PlaySound message to the Sound stack, it doesn’t have a handler for it so it’s delegated to the sound mixer client, which handles the message and starts paying the sound. It supports a typical set of messages for controlling the volume per application, globally, or per sound, configuring channels, canceling sounds, etc.</p><p id="958c">In this way, HyperLook messaging was able to serve the same purpose as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">D-Bus</a> does today on the Linux desktop.</p><h2 id="4811">It’s Burgher Time!</h2><p id="28ef">In summary, it was great for HyperLook to have an application like SimCity driving it, and when we released them together, SimCity served as proof of HyperLook’s capabilities, while HyperLook’s capabilities make SimCity even better than it would have been otherwise.

Users could create and edit stacks at runtime.</figcaption></figure><p id="e551">Then you get a bunch more items in the context menu for selecting and creating and editing objects, and you can click and drag to select any object on the card, background or stack, and edit their properties and scripts.</p><p id="3426">You can copy and paste and duplicate objects around, and they carry their properties and procedures around with them.</p><p id="2172">Property sheets have one panel to edit their generic properties shared by all objects, and another custom panel that can be tailored specific to each kind of object. Users can even edit the existing property sheets and make their own.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1002/1*g_eXiKHoVjbtwB__KLKeTQ.png" width="501" height="333" role="presentation"/></p></figure><p id="2c01">Warehouse stacks like “Warehouse,” “Button Ideas,” “Clocks,” and “Neat Clocks” contain collections of exemplary preconfigured objects, whose names automatically appear under the editor’s “New Object” menu. You can create pre-configured objects from the warehouse anywhere in your own stack.</p><p id="7312">And you can create your own reusable object prototypes in a warehouse simply by, duplicating or copy/pasting in an existing object, giving it a descriptive name, and customizing its properties or scripts to your heart’s content. Then you can even define a custom property sheet if you need to.</p><h2 id="be70">Networking and Message Passing</h2><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1368/0*V5Mv6bFy7uGKuxvo.gif" width="684" height="567" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>How HyperLook can solve the world hunger crisis.</figcaption></figure><p id="5bb4">Unlike HyperCard, which did not natively support networking, HyperLook clients could connect to the NeWS server, and load and attach to user-editable HyperLook stacks, so they could communicate with each other by sending messages back and forth over the network.</p><p id="a567">The client, running in a different Unix process that the NeWS server, would register asynchronous handlers for named messages with parameters, and it could send named messages with parameters back to HyperLook objects.</p><h2 id="d48b">Object =&gt; Card =&gt; Background =&gt; Stack =&gt; Client Delegation</h2><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1394/0*vDMJSEpDK33zbPLw.gif" width="697" height="860" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>HyperLook Messages Delegate From</figcaption></figure><p id="c136">Both HyperCard and HyperLook use delegation: When you click on a Button, it first sends a “Click” message to the Button itself. If the Button doesn’t know how to handle it, the event bubbles on to to the Card that contains the Button. If the Card doesn’t know how to handle it, the event then bubbles up to the Background that contains the Card. If the background doesn’t know how to handle it, the event bubbles up to the Stack itself. Finally, if the Stack doesn’t know how to handle it, the events and its parameters get sent over the network to the client, who has the last chance at handling it.</p><p id="4565">All objects in HyperLook have names, unique within their container, used to address them by path.</p><p id="02ca">When an HyperLook object (or client) receives a message, it includes the message name, the name of the object to whom it was originally sent (like the Button, so the receiver knows where to send any reply), the name of the object who received it (which could be different due to delegation), and a list of parameters. The client can at any time send messages with parameters back to any HyperCard Stack, Background, Card or Object by a path of names.</p><h2 id="9f2e">HyperLook Client Libraries</h2><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1090/0*oZSo8du2luHtRuUR.gif" width="545" height="593" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>The Turing Institute held the First International Robot Olympics in September 1990.</figcaption></figure><p id="f000">HyperLook stacks could send messages to clients over a network connection, and the clients could call native C libraries, Prolog or Lisp programs, image and signal processing algorithms, games like SimCity, simulations like cellular automata, tools like sound mixers, and they could control real world hardware like video capture devices and robots through device drivers.</p><p id="f01f">There was also a shared memory raster animation library (so clients could efficiently draw into image pixels, and NeWS could display multiple scaled views of those images on the screen with PostScript), and a sound mixer (so SimCity and other HyperLook clients could share the audio device, and make overlapping sounds which would be mixed in real time).</p><h2 id="d85e">Structured PostScript Graphics Editor Component</h2><p id="15fd">HyperCard had a wonderful built-in image editor, but it was black and white pixel based (although there were extensions to handle color pixels).</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/0*KmbJzSmp7AchVc7W.gif" width="628" height="548" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>HyperLook had a wonderful structured PostScript graphics editor component.</figcaption></figure><p id="4c80">HyperLook, on the other hand, is completely PostScript based, but PostScript graphics do include pixel based images, which can be scaled, rotated, clipped and transformed in various ways. HyperLook also supports embedding Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files in drawings, and exporting drawings as EPS to be printed or embedded in other documents.</p><p id="9a2b">HyperLook had a nice simple built-in structured PostScript graphics editor component, which it used in its own property sheet stacks for editing the graphical properties of any objects, like the shape and background of a stack, or the images of a switch.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1198/1*ZyxmThYqH_i_UvG-9XRXWw.png" width="599" height="310" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>Cellular Automata Lava Lamp With Melting Hippie Face (courtesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">John Gilmore</a>)</figcaption></figure><p id="e7f4">HyperLook made it extremely easy (and fun) to set the stack’s shape and appearance to anything you desired!</p><p id="7976">For example, I quickly was able to whip up a Lava Lamp shaped stack that rendered a live clipped animated view of a psychedelic cellular automata that melted people’s faces.</p><h2 id="fb21">It’s the PostScript, Dammit!</h2><p id="041c">There are many advantages to using the same language for graphics, scripting, and data. PostScript data consists of arrays, dictionaries, strings, numbers, booleans and null — virtually identical to JSON or Lisp S-expressions.</p><p id="4c3d">PostScript’s not just for drawing. PostScript data is great for representing persistent objects, structured graphics, messages, program code, data structures, and everything else that JSON is now used for. PostScript code is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">homoiconic</a>, in that PostScript code is simply normal PostScript data (a powerful property that JavaScript does not share with PostScript, but Lisp does).</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1002/0*sHClGU8ALljuRQKb.gif" width="501" height="333" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>Button Ideas Warehouse With Cool Custom Buttons and Switches To Clone</figcaption></figure><p id="fd27">You get to use the same language to draw all parts of the user interface, as you use to handle events and react to button presses and menu selections and network connections, as you use to read and write objects to the disk or the network.</p><p id="e190">Customizable buttons and switches flip between different drawings when you click them. You could point at any graphical object and press the “Props” key to bring up a property sheet to edit its properties and graphics, or edit its script to understand and change its behavior.</p><p id="1525">The ability of the user to easily open up any part of the system and look inside to see how it works, then copy and change it and use it for their own purposes, is extremely important.</p><h2 id="e253">Ubiquitous Structured PostScript Drawings</h2><p id="0ecb">HyperLook’s structured PostScript graphics including stroking and filling paths, rendering text and images, embedding EPS files, grouping, transformation, and clipping. They were represented by big trees of PostScript data.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1090/0*Dqhteuuj-nXrCnSs.gif" width="545" height="593" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>The Hands-On Demonstration stack had snapshots of other demo stacks, that opened when clicked.</figcaption></figure><p id="4571">One cool technique that NeWS supported was “PostScript Capture” for snapshotting the results of procedurally drawing PostScript graphics as a flat sequence of drawing commands without any computation (like a PDF file). That’s known as “distilling” PostScript, or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">partial evaluation</a>”, and is how <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/creating-pdfs-acrobat-distiller.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Acrobat Distiller</a> creates safe dumb and happy PDF files from dangerous artificially intelligent Turing-complete PostScript documents.</p><p id="ffeb">HyperLook stacks had a “Copy as Drawing” menu items that could use PostScript Capture for procedural drawing like Happy Tool, but it created transformed groups that you could deconstruct in the editor for capturing the contents of stacks and objects. So the graphics of a window snapshot maintained their structure as much as possible. It made for very pretty printed documentation!</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*m10g7ANW8kQzvs_6.gif" width="500" height="347" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>The Clipboard stack showed whatever was on the clipboard, like an object ,a drawing, an image, or text.</figcaption></figure><p id="c9d5">Structured PostScript graphics were ubiquitous throughout HyperLook, and could be copied and pasted on the clipboard, edited by the user, read and written to files and the network, and were used to define how everything looked (while PostScript code was used to define how everything behaved).</p><p id="c02a">Here is a structured PostScript snapshot of the Clipboard stack showing the clipboard containing a structured PostScript snapshot of a graphics editor stack editing a picture of a robot arm holding a structured PostScript snapshot of a demo browser stack, containing a bunch of structured PostScript snapshots of other demo stacks to play with!

The Official Marimba Guide to Bongo covers Marimba’s Bongo environment, which is designed to allow rapid development of Java user interfaces. The book shows you how to use the large library of graphics “widgets” supplied with Bongo, how to wire them together with simple scripting, and how to integrate other Java applets. It also explains how Bongo can be used to build channels for Marimba’s Castanet system. -Amazon.com Review</p><p id="5300">Java users should be rejoicing at the promise of programming aid Bongo, which is is the reincarnation of HyperCard on the Internet. It is fitting that the first major book about Bongo comes from Goodman, the author of the definitive HyperCard book of days gone by (The Complete HyperCard Handbook, Random, 1994). His background is as a journalist, not a technologist, and readers will make good use of this first-rate introduction.
