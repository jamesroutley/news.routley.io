<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> is the most widely deployed database engine (or likely even software of any type) in existence. It is found in nearly every smartphone (iOS and Android), computer, web browser, television, and automobile. There are likely over one trillion SQLite databases in active use. (If you are on a Mac laptop, you can open a terminal, type &#34;sqlite3&#34;, and start conversing with the SQLite database engine using SQL.)</p></div>

What do modern cloud workloads look like? And what does that have to do with new chip designs? I found these gems in Peter DeSantis&#39;s ReInvent20 and ReInvent21 talks. These talks are very informative and educational. Me likey! The speakers at ReInvent are not just introducing new products/services, but they are also explaining the thought processes behind them. To come up with this summary, I edited the YouTube video transcripts slightly (mostly shortening it). The presentation narratives have been really well planned, so this makes a good read I think. Graviton2 This part is from the ReInvent2020 talk from Peter DeSantis.   Graviton2 is the best performing general purpose processor in our cloud by a wide margin. It also offers significantly lower cost. And it&#39;s also the most power efficient processor we&#39;ve ever deployed. Our plan was to build a processor that was optimized for AWS and modern cloud workloads. But, what do modern cloud workloads look like? Let&#39;s start by

I talked about the importance of reading foundational papers  last week. To followup, here is my compilation of foundational papers in the distributed systems area. (I focused on the core distributed systems area, and did not cover networking, security, distributed ledgers, verification work etc. I even left out distributed transactions, I hope to cover them at a later date.)  I classified the papers by subject, and listed them in chronological order. I also listed expository papers and blog posts at the end of each section. Time and State in Distributed Systems Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System.

I love learning.  I wanted to write about how I learn, so I can analyze if there is a method to this madness. I will first talk about what my learning process looks like in abstract terms, and then I&#39;ll give an analogy to make things more concrete and visual.   Learning is a messy process for me I know some very clear thinkers. They are very organized and methodical. I am not like that. These tidy thinkers seem to learn a new subject quickly (and effortlessly) by studying the rules of the subject and then deriving everything about that subject from that set of rules. They speak in precise statements and have clear and hard-set opinions about the subject. They seem to thrive most in theoretical subjects. In my observation those tidy learners are in the minority. Maybe the tidy thinkers are able to pull this feat off because they come from a neighboring domain/subject and map the context there to this subject quickly. But, again from my experience, it doesn&#39;t feel like that. It s

<p>
This is definitely not a &#34;learn distributed systems in 21 days&#34; post. I recommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed systems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more months to build competence after that.   If you are practical and coding oriented you may not like my advice much. You may object saying, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I learn distributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by deploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.&#34; I think that is the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code and programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar territory, and will give you a false sense of security. But, nothing can be further from the truth.   Distributed systems need radically different software than centralized systems do.    --A.

Strict-serializability guarantees that transactions appear to occur in an order consistent with the &#34;real-time&#34; ordering of those transactions: If transaction T1 commits before transaction T2 is invoked, then the commit timestamp of T1 precedes the commit timestamp of T2.  This is, in fact, the real-time constraint from linearizability , but applied across transactions not just per-key. A strict-serializability system satisfies both serializability (transactions appear to occur as if they are executed one at a time in isolation) and linearizability per key (after all single-key reads/writes are transactions over one item). Below figure is from https://jepsen.io/consistency . However, this is a one-way implication, the other direction does not hold. You can satisfy both serializability per transactions and linearizability per key, but fail to satisfy strict-serializability. (Below I give an example accompanied with a TLA+ specification to check it.) This is because, in strict-

This paper appeared in Sigmod 2020.  Here is a link to the 10 minute, but extremely useful, Sigmod presentation . There is also a 1 hour extended presentation . CockroachDB is open source available via GitHub.  The core features of the database are under a Business Source License (BSL), which converts to a fully open-source Apache 2.0 license after three years. Storage layer CockroachDB (or CRDB for short) consists of a distributed SQL layer on top of a distributed key-value store. The key value store is laid out in a single monolithic ordered key space. The logical key space is physically realized by dividing it into contiguous ranges of keys which we call ranges. Ranges are about 64 megabytes in size. Ranges start empty, grow, and split when they get too large, and merge with their neighbors when they get too small. The ranges are sorted, and I will talk about why in the SQL discussion later. As we will discuss soon, CRDB uses multi-version concurrency control. Hybrid logical clocks

Every 5 years, researchers from academia and industry gather to write a state-of-the-union (SOTU) report on database research. This one was released recently . It is a very readable report, and my summary consists of important paragraphs clipped from the report. Emphasis mine in bolded sentences. I use square brackets for when I paraphrase a long text with a more direct statement. TL;DR: The SOTU is strong (the relational database market alone has revenue upwards of $50B) and growing stronger thanks to boom in cloud computing and machine learning (ML). For the next 5 years, research should scale up to address emerging challenges in data science, data governance, cloud services, and database engines.   What has changed in the last 5 years Over the last decade, our research community pioneered the use of columnar storage, which is used in all commercial data analytic platforms.

Amazon Aurora is a high-throughput cloud-native relational database. I will summarize its design as covered by the Sigmod 17  and Sigmod 18  papers from the Aurora team. Aurora uses MySQL or PostgreSQL for the database instance at top, and decouples the storage to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service.  In this decoupled architecture, each database instance acts as a SQL endpoint and supports query processing, access methods, transactions, locking, buffer caching, and undo management. Some database functions, including redo logging, materialization of data blocks, garbage collection, and backup/restore, are offloaded to the storage nodes. A big innovation in Aurora is to do the replication among the storage  nodes by pushing the redo log; this reduces networking traffic and  enables fault-tolerant storage that heals without database involvement. In contrast to CockroachDB  and FoundationDB , Aurora manages not to use consensus at all. It uses a primary secondary failover at the comp

This paper  introduces a simple yet powerful idea to provide efficient multi-key transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded NoSQL data store. The Warp protocol prevents serializability cycles forming between concurrent transactions by forcing them to serialize via a chain communication pattern rather than using a parallel 2PC fan-out/fan-in communication. This avoids hotspots associated with fan-out/fan-in communication and prevents wasted parallel work from contacting multiple other servers when traversing them in serial would surface an invalidation/abortion early on in the serialization. I love the elegance of this idea. As far as I can see, this paper did not get published in any conference. The authors published a followup paper to this in NSDI 16, called &#34;The Design and Implementation of the Warp Transactional Filesystem.&#34;  But that paper does not talk about the internals of Warp protocol like this archive report, rather talks about the Warp Transactional File
