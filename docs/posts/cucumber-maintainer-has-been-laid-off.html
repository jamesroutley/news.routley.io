    <h1>Cucumber maintainer has been laid off</h1>

<p>Well, this is new.</p>

<p>After ten years <a href="https://cucumber.io/blog/news/cucumber-limited/">building a company</a> around the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber">Cucumber</a> open source project, I suddenly find myself out of a job.</p>

<p>I was laid off last Friday by SmartBear, who in June 2019 <a href="https://smartbear.com/blog/smartbear-acquires-cucumber/">acquired</a> the company I co-founded back in August 2013. Itâ€™s no secret that I had recently been <a href="https://twitter.com/mattwynne/status/1598768968034095104" title="Survey">involved in a research project</a> to determine Cucumberâ€™s future direction at SmartBear. As the last remaining employee lucky enough to be paid to work on the open source project full-time, I guess the powers that be had already made their minds up about what the outcome of that research would be.</p>

<p>I figured we might be in the end-game, but I hadnâ€™t expected it to come around so suddenly.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>

<p>I was actually on vacation, with no internet, while all this happened last week, so I was not prepared. Iâ€™ve lost access to my <strong>matt@cucumber.io</strong> email address, meaning there are various services (like Cucumberâ€™s community Slack) that I canâ€™t sign into with my normal account. My GitHub notifications for the Cucumber project were also going into that inbox too.</p>

<p>So if youâ€™ve written to me at that email address, or youâ€™ve pinged me in GitHub or Slack and havenâ€™t got a response, thatâ€™s the reason why.</p>

<h2 id="wow-are-you-ok">Wow. Are you OK?</h2>

<p>Emotionally, Iâ€™m OK; thanks for asking ðŸ’–</p>

<p>While itâ€™s been interesting, from an anthropological point of view, to spend so much time on the inside of a private-equity backed US company, the culture didnâ€™t suit me well I am pretty relievedâ€”even excitedâ€”to be out. I also did a lot of grieving around the time of the acquisition, and I have a lot less attachment to the Cucumber project or my role in it than I used to.</p>

<p>Still, I feel a sense of responsibility towards it, and I hold a great deal of respect and affection for the volunteer members of the community who put so much of their free time into nurturing the project.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not taking this personally. SmartBear has grown significantly since we were acquired in 2019, and the scale of their ambitions has grown too. Although our research showed there is a market for commercial tools built for the Cucumber audience, that market probably just isnâ€™t big enough for a company like SmartBear. Thereâ€™s no compelling reason for them to continue sponsoring an open source project that doesnâ€™t directly contribute to the bottom line.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m optimistic that SmartBear will have the good sense to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_(software)">doing a Hudson</a>, and Iâ€™ll do what I can to try and ensure that assets such as the domain, trademarks, <a href="https://school.cucumber.io/">training videos</a>, <a href="https://reports.cucumber.io/">reports</a> service and so on will be transferred into community ownership in due course. Iâ€™ve had some positive conversations with senior SmartBear executives about this before I left, and have had some reassuring signals since as well. So Iâ€™m hopeful, but weâ€™ll see.</p>

<p>Still, without a significant commercial sponsor, the future of the project is uncertain right now. Would your company like to <a href="https://opencollective.com/cucumber">step in and help</a>?</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-do-now">What are you going to do now?</h2>

<p>Almost <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/commit/55d02528cdebe50c1adbd9d39abec11e26acf8e5">fifteen years since my first commit</a> to Cucumber, I want to take some space to consider what the next chapter of my work-life will look like; to figure out whatâ€™s important.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ll indulge me, I may be using this new blog to think out loud about that a little. It uses the <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a> service, which I rather like so far.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to try and keep the laptop closed as much as possible for the next few weeks, but Iâ€™d love to <a href="https://mattwynne.net/contact">hear from you</a>, whether you think you have an interesting work opportunity for me, or just want to say hi.</p>

<p>In the short term, Iâ€™m interested in providing remote coaching to teams in and around the Pacific timezone (Iâ€™m based on BC, Canada) who want to apply skills like ensemble programming, test-driven development (TDD), domain-driven design and <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">continuous delivery</a> to interesting and worthwhile problems.</p>
