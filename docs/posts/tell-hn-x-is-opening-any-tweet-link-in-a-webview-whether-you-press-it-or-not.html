    <h1>Tell HN: X is opening any tweet link in a webview whether you press it or not</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just saw the CEO of Substack celebrating traffic from X/Twitter shooting up thinking they stopped suppressing tweets with links[0]. Actually, this traffic is because now any time you open a tweet with a link, the in-app webview loads in the background, and displays when you press the link.</p><p>I run an ecom store that gets a lot of its customers from Twitter. I was also shocked to see my traffic double or triple overnight and thought the algorithm had blessed me and my business. Soon realized what was actually happening. Thought other traffic-monitors might appreciate this explanation.</p><p>Meanwhile Nikita Bier is pretending they never suppressed tweets with links to begin with, offering the alternative explanation: &#34;a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower reach. This is because the web browser covers the post and people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn&#39;t get a clear signal whether the content is any good&#34;[1]. A bit of a rewriting of history since Elon and his mom both tweeted about how it wasn&#39;t fair to use his platform to promote other links/platforms, even banning people who shared profiles of other social networks (including Paul Graham for a period). They suppressed all links shortly after.</p><p>[0] https://x.com/cjgbest/status/1985464687350485092</p><p>[1] https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1979994223224209709</p></div></div></div>
