He added that he hoped “this is not one of those wake-up calls” where “you hit the snooze and then you go back to sleep.”</p><p>Last year, global electricity demand was up by more than 6 percent — the largest increase since 2010, the U.S. Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-market-report-january-2022" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The “exceptional demands” were in large part because of strong economic growth and colder winters and warmer summers linked to climate change, the report said.</p></div></div><div><p>Although available renewable energy sources like wind and solar have been increasing, their contribution is still lower than the increase in global demand. For the United States, that means it may not meet its ambitious plan to have a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">net-zero carbon economy by 2050</a>.</p></div><div><div><p>That reality, along with the war in Ukraine, may mean that nuclear is back on the table — at least in large parts of the world.</p><p>Andrés Gluski, chief executive of the energy company AES, said he believed nuclear power is “part of the solution because of its ability to provide capacity.”</p><p>But, Mr. Gluski said, while “small modular nukes are very interesting,” he didn’t know whether any small plants had received permits for building.</p><p>“The thing is, when we’re talking about climate change, how much time do we have?” he added. “If it’s going to take you 20 years to get a plant built, it’s not part of the solution.”</p></div></div><div><p>Others had similar reservations, agreeing that nuclear power — an energy source that emits no carbon, but one that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/23/americans-continue-to-express-mixed-views-about-nuclear-power/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Americans are conflicted about</a> — could help fill in the gaps where renewable energy may be lacking, but that it could take years before there is commercial production from the next generation of reactors. By then, it might be too late to make a difference in rolling back carbon emissions and ameliorating the worst effects of climate change.</p></div><div><div><p>Maria G. Korsnick, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group that promotes nuclear power, said that the timeline was going to be much quicker than that — “like in the next year or two.”</p><section role="complementary" aria-label="The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global Economy"><h2>The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global Economy</h2><hr/><div id="storyline-context-container" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p><span>Card 1 of 7</span></p><div data-scrolled-index="0"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><strong>A far-reaching conflict.<!-- --> </strong><span>Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/business/stock-market-correction.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-business-ukraine-conflict&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">stock market’s woes</a>.
