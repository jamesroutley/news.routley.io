<h2>Welcome to the Yamaha* TX81Z Homepage</h2>

<p>

If you&#39;re getting sick of making
<a href="https://mgregory22.me/tx81z/files/blind.mp3">patches that sound like this.</a> then this page is for
you!

    be given the awesome scan I did of their TX81Z.

<h3>Obligatory Story and Introduction</h3>

<p>

Yamaha came out with the DX7 in 1983, which used a new type of synthesis
technology at the time called &#34;FM synthesis&#34;.  It was the first widely used FM
synthesizer and it turned out to be the best selling professional synthesizer
of all time.  These synthesizers featured six sine wave operators that could be
routed in 32 different arrangements, which are called algorithms.  They
produced a few different models using this synthesis engine, including the DX1,
DX5 and TX7.  They also produced a line of four operator synthesizers, like the
DX9, DX100, DX27, and DX21.  These were less expensive and a little more
limited than the six operator synths, since the operators also produced only
sine waves.  But in 1986 they introduced the four operator TX81Z, which was the
first FM synth that could use different operator waveforms.  The TX81Z&#39;s
operators can each be configured to use one of eight different waveforms and
this is what gives the TX81Z the ability to make sounds that the six operator
synths aren&#39;t capable of making (although the converse is also true).

</p><p>

This page is dedicated to this synthesizer and I hope it will help you get the
most out of it and FM synthesis in general.  I&#39;m here to put it to the test, to
run it through the paces, to push it to its limits, and maybe even put it
through the wringer.  I&#39;m going to post articles, patches for download, and all
kinds of stuff that&#39;s fun for the whole dog gone family.  So, grab some sticks
and marshmallows and gather round the LCD!

<h3>TX81Z Trivia</h3>

<p>

Did you know that the TX81Z was invented by an Icelandic llama herder when he
regained consciousness after he fell and hit his head on a tree stump?

</p><p>

Well, that&#39;s completely false!  There are no llamas in Iceland!  This section
is dedicated to debunking myths about the TX81Z like these.

<h3>TX81Z Programming Articles</h3>

<p>

I thought I would write up some little articles on programming the TX81Z.  You
should be able follow along with a different type of FM synth, too, since the
basic concepts are pretty much the same behind all of them.  I&#39;m not a great
synth programmer or anything, so you probably won&#39;t be blown away by the sounds
I make, but I&#39;m willing to write about it anyway.

</p><p>

The way I see it, synth programming is part of the art of playing the
synthesizer.  Only using the presets is kind of like playing the piano with one
hand all the time.  You can do it, but it&#39;s a lot more fun with two because you
can do so much more.  And not only that, using two hands on the piano puts you
more fully into your musical expression.  With a synthesizer you can put
yourself into the expression with both hands <i>and</i> with the timbre of the
sound you&#39;re playing.  So the synthesizer gives you unprecedented power to make
your music an expression of what you are in your own uniqueness!

<h3>TX81Z Editor Programs</h3>

<p>

These make editing the TX81Z a heck of a lot easier!  There are quite a few of
them to choose from.  I&#39;ve tried out most of the Windows editors, since that&#39;s
the only operating system I have set up at the moment.  Some of the editors
I&#39;ve found were written a long time ago and don&#39;t run real well on modern
versions of Windows or are no longer supported by the author, so I&#39;ve left
those out.

    This is the TX81Z editor and librarian for Windows that I wrote myself,
    so it gets the top slot!  It supports all the features on the unit and has
    a number of more advanced functions like multiple parameter editing and undo.
    I&#39;ve now made the program <strong>free software!</strong>

  This is a scale editor for microtuning tables and it&#39;s very extensive, it supports the TX81Z, runs on multiple
