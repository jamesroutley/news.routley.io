    <h1>Android 12 forces you to choose a default browser unless you disable Chrome</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-pin-condition="function() {return this.style.display != &#39;none&#39;;}"><form action="#" onsubmit="return post_form(this, &#39;editusertext&#39;)" id="form-t3_qc02y1t3s"><div><div><p>This is a tip for people like me who open links with different browsers depending on what they click. This behavior is now seemingly impossible on Android 12 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/o1mz9t/any_way_to_keep_chrome_from_stealing_the_default/">unless you disable Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>While you could never straightforwardly clear the default browser setting on Android, on Android 10 you could go to app info for any browser and &#34;clear defaults&#34;. On A11 Google hid that button much deeper into settings (apps -&gt; default apps -&gt; opening links -&gt; [browser]) but still worked at least. On A12, it&#39;s still there, only that Chrome is not on that &#34;opening links&#34; app list.</p>

<p>You can try setting any other browser as default, then go to that &#34;opening links&#34; setting for that browser and clear defaults, but then instead of &#34;none&#34; for default browser, Chrome will be set (like the link above indicates for A12 beta).</p>

<p>Another workaround used to be when you installed a new browser Android would also clear the default browser, not anymore. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any other workaround besides disabling Chrome.</p>

<p>If you still want to use Chrome, you can install Chrome Beta, it still doesn&#39;t appear on the list, but it won&#39;t hijack the default browser when you select and clear another browser as default.</p>
