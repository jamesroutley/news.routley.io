<p>The cute, portable, and banana yellow $179 Playdate console is now shipping to its first batch of preorder customers, so we&#39;re now free to review the quirkiest gaming system in years.</p>
<p>Thanks to chip shortages and general manufacturing chaos, buying Playdate is much less fun than using it. If you preordered the system in July 2021 after reading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/playdate-preview-you-wont-believe-how-fun-this-dorky-179-game-system-is/">my hands-on preview</a>, great. If you waited for a proper review like this one, however, expect a backorder queue of no fewer than eight months. (At least Panic say it will make as many Playdates as people want to buy, instead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/nintendo-hates-money-discontinues-the-nes-classic/">pulling an NES Classic and limiting production</a>.)</p>

<p>To those who ran with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/playdate-preview-you-wont-believe-how-fun-this-dorky-179-game-system-is/">my previous optimism about Playdate&#39;s squat form factor, quirky games, and unique crank control system</a>, I am happy to report that I didn&#39;t lead you astray—so long as you heeded my specific bias. As I wrote in July:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#39;m partial to experimental, quick-fire indie fare, which the Playdate is clearly tailored toward. This most often means lo-fi point-and-click adventures, arcadey score-chasers, and quirky platformers—either with a crank or without. If that sounds like a fresh breath of air—possibly akin to the earliest days of devs exploiting the novelty of touchscreens on either the earliest iPhone or the original Nintendo DS—then Panic&#39;s hardware and software ecosystem will hold up their end of the bargain to affirm your bias.</p></blockquote>
<p>That preview came after testing just four of the system&#39;s included games. This week, I can more fully answer the question of what Playdate delivers for $179, including a look at all 24 of its &#34;first season&#34; games.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Panic&#39;s earliest Playdate sales pitch included the &#34;surprise factor&#34; of two new games unlocking each week for 12 weeks. If you&#39;re buying Playdate to enjoy the ritual of tearing off virtual wrapping paper and revealing surprises on a weekly basis, this review merely summarizes what you can expect from the system&#39;s included games. Think of it like picking up wrapped gifts and shaking them a few times.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d rather know exactly what $179 buys you after 12 weeks, I have broken out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/all-24-of-playdates-included-games-reviewed/">game-specific mini-reviews into a separate report</a>. That report clarifies how many weeks you&#39;ll have to wait for each game to unlock, as well.
</p><p>I hope you&#39;ll come away knowing whether Playdate is your perfect boutique portable or whether you&#39;d be happier investing $179 into something like a Raspberry Pi, an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">Analogue Pocket</a>, or a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<h2>Diminutive yet still mostly excellent</h2>
<p>While reading my mix of praise and criticism, keep in mind that I have an ideal Playdate owner in mind: a wide-eyed, world-questioning pre-teen, eager for a variety of portable, accessible gaming experiences that combine classic gameplay principles and silly text with reckless, crank-fueled abandon. (This may also apply to the wide-eyed pre-teen inside many of us.)</p>

<p>Though this is a &#34;final&#34; review, it recaps much of what I already wrote about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/playdate-preview-you-wont-believe-how-fun-this-dorky-179-game-system-is/">the &#34;near final&#34; hardware in July 2021</a>. In terms of physical form factor and general usability, Playdate then is seemingly identical to Playdate now.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Meaning: I&#39;ve never seen a lightweight game system with this combination of comfort, control precision, and screen clarity that also manages to run simple games smoothly. Its portable gaming prowess is unsurprising, as <a href="https://teenage.engineering/">the music-gadget wizards at Teenage Engineering</a> are behind much of Playdate&#39;s design. I&#39;m cool with the compromises required to squeeze so much into so little, but interested buyers should keep those compromises in mind.</p>

<p>Playing the entire &#34;first season&#34; of 24 included Playdate games hasn&#39;t changed my general impression of the device; instead, it reminded me that there&#39;s only so much comfort owners can expect from a 3×3 inch (74×74 mm) device. As I previously wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Playdate fits neatly in an adult-sized palm, which might lead you to expect claw-hand woes once you hold it with two hands (think Nintendo&#39;s Game Boy Micro). Panic avoids this pitfall with a few crucial design-language tricks, including thinness (9 mm), lightness (3.03 oz / 86 g), and adequate width. Combine those three factors, and the system lands in adult hands without requiring awkward weight bracing.</p>
<p>So the Playdate gets away with a smooth, rubberized finish like the exterior of a vinyl toy. This never feels &#34;light and cheap&#34;—since that lightness and cheapness are crucial to its handheld gaming comfort. Instead of including gamepad-like curves that fit into hands, the Playdate buttresses its four corners with mild curves, and these roll across a palm quite comfortably.</p></blockquote>
