        <h2>400 richest Americans ($3.2 trillion)</h2>

            Jeff Bezos may be insanely rich, but it is a drop in the ocean compared to the combined wealth of his peers. The 400 richest Americans own about $3.2 trillion, which is more than the bottom 60% of Americans.

        <div>
          <p>A trillion dollars is such a large figure, that you might as well say &#34;eleventy gajillion zillion dollars.&#34;  So in this section, we will try to understand the scale of this figure by looking at what could be accomplished with various chunks of this wealth.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Some will argue that using this wealth for public benefit is not possible, because it&#39;s &#34;tied up&#34; in stocks, and therefore inaccessible. <a href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/THE_PAPER_BILLIONAIRE.md" target="_blank">This is just not true</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>As we proceed, try to keep in mind: all of this wealth is controlled by a group so small, that they could fit on a single 747 airplane—with 260 seats left over.</p>

          <p>Based on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/eu-coronavirus-vaccines-cheaper-than-united-states/2020/12/18/06677e34-4139-11eb-b58b-1623f6267960_story.html">cost of vaccines</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/costs-of-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-in-92amc_08.02.21.pdf" target="_blank">cost of delivery</a>, it would take around <a href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/docs/COST_OF_VACCINATION.md" target="_blank">$200 billion</a> to vaccinate every person on earth, which is about 6% of the wealth currently controlled by 400 Americans. After paying for this vaccination program, these individuals would still be $40 billion richer than they were before the pandemic.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Even setting aside the desperate humanitarian need for a global vaccination, there is still a strong self-interested argument that wealthy countries should do it: the longer covid circulates in the world, the more chance of a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933201-800-vaccine-nationalism-will-leave-everyone-more-at-risk-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank">vaccine resistant variant</a> emerging, and undoing all the vaccine progress we&#39;ve already made.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The World Health Organization is currently organizing a global vaccine donation program which aims to vaccinate <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax" target="_blank">about 20%</a> of residents in poor countries by the end of 2021, and even that approach has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/covax-healthcare-workers-funding/" target="_blank">substantial funding shortfalls</a>.</p>

              <h2>Permanently eradicate malaria</h2>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Malaria is one of the worst infectious diseases ever visited on mankind, possibly killing more people than any other infectious disease in history. In the 20th century alone, malaria killed more people than the Black Death.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div>
            
            <div><p>Ebola deaths in <strong>all of human history</strong> combined (about 15,000)</p>
              
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            These figures are even more shocking when you learn that malaria overwhelmingly kills children; around two-thirds of malaria deaths each year are children under five. That&#39;s around 275,000 children.
          </p>
        </div>

        

        <div>
          <div>
            <p><em>All</em> of these deaths are preventable. Treating and preventing malaria is a well understood science, universally practiced in the developed world.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551454" target="_blank">It is estimated</a> that malaria could be globally eradicated by 2030 for a cost around $1.84 per at-risk person per year, or around $100 billion total. This would be around 3% of the wealth currently possessed by the 400 richest Americans.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Around 800 children will die of malaria today. A small group of super rich people could stop it for a sum of money so small that they would likely never even notice its absence. But they choose not to.</p>

              <h2>Wipe out all the delinquent medical debt in America</h2>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Americans have about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/millennials-rack-up-the-most-medical-debt-and-more-frequently" target="_blank">$81 billion</a> in medical debt that is sufficiently past due as to appear on their credit report. These are generally small debts, with a median value of <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201412_cfpb_reports_consumer-credit-medical-and-non-medical-collections.pdf" target="_blank">$207 dollars</a> per person.</p>
            <p> These debts hinder the credit of over 50 million Americans, and do long term damage to their housing, employment, and borrowing options. The cost of repaying this debt dollar-for-dollar would be around 2.5% of the wealth controlled by 400 Americans.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            This situation looks even better once you understand that delinquent debt is often purchased for as <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46455844/charity-buys-and-erases-past-due-medical-debt" target="_blank">little as 1%</a> of its face value. This would make the total cost of eliminating all delinquent medical debt around $810 million. In 2020, the richest 400 Americans accrued this amount roughly every 29 hours.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            Note that this figure includes only <em>delinquent</em> medical debt, not all medical debt. The value of all medical debt in America is not publicly known, but probably in the neighborhood of <a href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/docs/VALUE_OF_MEDICAL_DEBT.md" target="_blank">$300 billion</a>, or 9% of the wealth controlled by 400 Americans.

        <div>
          <p>
            As of 2021, around 38 million Americans lived in poverty. If Americans in poverty were a state, they would be second largest by population. There are more Americans living in poverty than the entire population of Canada.
          </p>

          <p><a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.pdf" target="_blank">Every single person</a> in America could be lifted above the poverty line with a one-time cash subsidy of around $10,000 per impoverished family (and about $7,000 for impoverished individuals). The total cost would be $170 billion, a little over 5% of the wealth currently controlled by 400 individuals.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div>
            <p>It may seem counter intuitive that a one-time subsidy could have any lasting impact on chronic poverty. But one of the surprising truths about poverty is that it&#39;s fluid. Americans move in and out of poverty many times throughout their lives, and one good year can have a massive and long lasting effect.</p>

              <p>A wealth of data now supports the idea that <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/" target="_blank">one-time cash transfers can permanently transform a local economy.</a> Given a sudden windfall, people invest in their future. They go back to school, obtain transportation, pay for childcare, pay down debilitating debts, and do any number of things to improve their career prospects and financial future.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        

        <div>
          <p>This would not be a permanent fix for all Americans. Surely, some would quickly return to poverty, and others face debts so large that the subsidy would make little difference. But for tens of millions of Americans, this would be a life changing event. It would be a generation defining social program that reshapes our economy for decades to come.</p>
