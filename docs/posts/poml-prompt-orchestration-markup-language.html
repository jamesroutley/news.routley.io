<p>Tyree</p>
<p>capo 2, Am, C, Dm, C thingy (a C with a drop 3rd finger)?</p>
<p>he was 29
fourteen days my
junior I
weighed the same at 1
45
on the night he died</p>
<p>when you
look at me
standing right in
front of you
see these things in common with the man who
was beaten to death by some bad apples</p>
<p>“Didn’t do
anything”
was what he said
“get on the
fuckin ground”
was the response
“I hope they stomp his ass”
was the follow up
well they did
and he never woke up</p>
<p>punched
in the face
he called out for his mother
I’d
do the same
who do you turn to
when the men whose job is it to protect you
kick you while you’re down</p>
<p>homicide
at claws of the scorpion
a special unit we’d never heard of then
disbanded after the incident
there are still 34 more</p>
<p>and 39 percent
of the bluff city budget
pays for the men and women in blue
and this is what they do</p>
<p>when you look at me
I’m not 6’3 like Tyree
we weighed the same
we were the exact same age</p>
<p>and my bones would break the exact same way
at the feet of five grown men
who never brought him
took fourty five minutes to call an ambulance
(took fourty five minutes to call an ambulance)</p>
<p>He was from Sacremento
he liked skateboarding and photography
he had a 4 year old son who is now about 6
Tyree told his mom “I’ll be famous one day”</p>
<p>I wish that he never had to be famous</p>
<p>Some thumbdrumming
