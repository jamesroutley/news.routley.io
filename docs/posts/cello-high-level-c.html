<h3>F.A.Q</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why does this exist?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I made Cello as a fun experiment to see what C looks like hacked to its limits. 
As well as being a powerful library and toolkit, it should be interesting to 
those who want to explore what is possible in C.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How does it work?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend reading 
<a href="https://libcello.org/learn/fatpointer">A Fat Pointer Library</a> to get an overview of how Cello 
works.You can also peek at the source code, which I&#39;m told is fairly readable, 
or ask me any questions you like via e-mail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can it be used in Production?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It might be better to try Cello out on a hobby project first. Cello does aim to 
be <em>production ready</em>, but because it is a hack it has its fair share of 
oddities and pitfalls, and if you are working in a team, or to a deadline, 
there is much better tooling, support and community for languages such as C++.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is anyone using Cello?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>People have experimented with it, but there is no high profile project I know 
of that uses it. Cello is too big and scary a dependency for new C projects if 
they want to be portable and easy to maintain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can I get involved?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! That would be great. If you do anything with Cello I&#39;d love to know, you 
can e-mail me at <code>contact@theorangeduck.com</code>, or help with the development at 
the <a href="https://github.com/orangeduck/libCello">Cello github repo</a>. Contributions 
are very welcome.</p>
