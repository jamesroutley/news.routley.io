The ABS zone will be a two-dimensional plane in the middle of the plate that spans its full width (17 inches). The zone&#39;s top will be 53.5% of a player&#39;s height and the bottom 27%.</p><p>Teams that run out of challenges over the first nine innings will be granted an extra challenge in the 10th inning, while those that still have unused challenges will simply carry them into extras. If a team runs out of challenges in the 10th, it will automatically receive another in the 11th -- a rule that extends for any extra inning.</p><p>During the league&#39;s spring training test this season, teams combined to average around four challenges per game and succeeded 52.2% of the time, according to the league. Catchers, whose value in framing pitches outside the zone to look like strikes could take a hit due to the new rule, were the most successful at a 56% overturn rate, while hitters were correct 50% of the time and pitchers 41%.</p><p>MLB&#39;s minor league testing, which started in 2021, led to Triple-A players in 2023 using ABS challenge three days a week and a full ABS system, with every pitch adjudicated by computer, the other three.</p><p>Support among league executives grew around the challenge system as the more palatable of the two options for fans, allowing for umpires still to play a role in balls and strikes but to have a backup system in case of blown calls in integral moments.</p><p>Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.</p><p>Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.</p><p>Management officials on the competition committee include Seattle chairman John Stanton, St. Louis CEO Bill DeWitt Jr., San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson, Colorado CEO Dick Monfort, Toronto CEO Mark Shapiro and Boston chairman Tom Werner.</p><p>Players include Arizona&#39;s <a data-player-guid="801e1ea7-15e4-fcbc-982c-9efc9d6050df" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39878/corbin-burnes">Corbin Burnes</a> and <a data-player-guid="fc1345d7-f487-a73d-b74a-5c781b21d2d1" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39910/zac-gallen">Zac Gallen</a>, Seattle&#39;s <a data-player-guid="6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh">Cal Raleigh</a> and the <a data-clubhouse-guid="2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees">New York Yankees</a>&#39; <a data-player-guid="9fbc59fb-fcbd-03c3-1cfc-9adf24c0fc03" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35265/austin-slater">Austin Slater</a>, with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>&#39; <a data-player-guid="2db89dcd-a767-f856-baad-c7522b5dc24b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34945/ian-happ">Ian Happ</a> and Detroit&#39;s <a data-player-guid="a3fa18ed-b06e-079d-533f-d5e9a4356028" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41167/casey-mize">Casey Mize</a> as alternates.
