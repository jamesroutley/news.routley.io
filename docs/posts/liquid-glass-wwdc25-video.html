								<p><span><span data-start="7.0">Liquid Glass is a significant new step </span></span><span><span data-start="9.0">and evolution of the look and feel of Apple software. </span></span><span><span data-start="13.0">It introduces a flexible, dynamic layer </span></span><span><span data-start="16.0">to apps and system experiences across Apple’s ecosystem of products.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="21.0">It builds on learnings from all the way from the Aqua user interface of Mac OS X, </span></span><span><span data-start="26.0">through to the realtime blurs of iOS 7, to the fluidity of iPhone X, </span></span><span><span data-start="31.0">the flexibility of the Dynamic Island, and the immersive interface of visionOS. </span></span><span><span data-start="38.0">Building off these learnings, </span></span><span><span data-start="39.0">rather than trying to simply recreate a material from the physical world, </span></span><span><span data-start="43.0">Liquid Glass is a new digital meta-material </span></span><span><span data-start="47.0">that dynamically bends and shapes light.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="50.0">And simultaneously, it behaves and moves organically </span></span><span><span data-start="55.0">in a manner that feels more like a lightweight liquid, </span></span><span><span data-start="59.0">responding to both the fluidity of touch and the dynamism of modern apps.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="66.0">I’m Chan and i’m a designer on Apple’s Human Interface design team. </span></span><span><span data-start="70.0">In this session, we’ll go over some of the core dynamic properties of Liquid Glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="75.0">Then, my colleague Shubham will discuss how Liquid Glass </span></span><span><span data-start="78.0">automatically adapts to different contexts and environments.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="82.0">Lastly, Bruno will take us through some key principles </span></span><span><span data-start="85.0">on how to work with Liquid Glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="87.0">Let’s dive in.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="89.0">Liquid glass complements the evolution of Apple product design, </span></span><span><span data-start="93.0">as screens have gotten more rounded and immersive.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="97.0">It’s represented in the UI in rounded, floating forms </span></span><span><span data-start="101.0">that nest neatly in the rounded curves of modern devices. </span></span><span><span data-start="104.0">These clearly defined shapes feel easy to tap </span></span><span><span data-start="108.0">and are designed to relate to the natural geometry of our fingers </span></span><span><span data-start="112.0">so they feel friendly to touch interaction.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="115.0">The primary way Liquid Glass visually defines itself </span></span><span><span data-start="118.0">is through something called Lensing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="121.0">Lensing occurs all around us in our experience of the natural world. </span></span><span><span data-start="125.0">Through this experience we’ve all gained an intuitive understanding </span></span><span><span data-start="129.0">of how the warping and bending of light of a transparent object </span></span><span><span data-start="133.0">communicates to us its presence, its motion, and form.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="138.0">Liquid Glass uses these instinctive visual cues to provide separation </span></span><span><span data-start="143.0">and communicate layering </span></span><span><span data-start="144.0">in a new way while letting content shine through underneath it.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="149.0">Where as previous materials scattered light, </span></span><span><span data-start="152.0">this new set of materials dynamically bends, </span></span><span><span data-start="155.0">shapes, and concentrates light in real time.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="159.0">This provides definition against the background content </span></span><span><span data-start="162.0">while still feeling visually grounded in our experience of the natural world. </span></span><span><span data-start="167.0">By sculpting light like this, controls can feel ultra lightweight </span></span><span><span data-start="171.0">and transparent while still being visually distinguishable.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="175.0">Instead of fading, Liquid Glass objects materialize in and out </span></span><span><span data-start="180.0">by gradually modulating the light bending and lensing, </span></span><span><span data-start="183.0">ensuring a graceful transition </span></span><span><span data-start="186.0">that preserves the optical integrity of the material.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="190.0">How the material feels and behaves is just as important as the way it looks. </span></span><span><span data-start="195.0">From its foundation, </span></span><span><span data-start="196.0">both the visuals AND motion of LiquidGlass were designed as one. </span></span><span><span data-start="201.0">The motion of liquids is something we all have an intuitive feel for. </span></span><span><span data-start="205.0">Their smooth, responsive, and effortless motion and behavior </span></span><span><span data-start="209.0">are properties that interfaces can reference to move and react </span></span><span><span data-start="213.0">in a way that aligns with our innate grasp of the physical world.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="218.0">To this effect, Liquid Glass responds to interaction </span></span><span><span data-start="221.0">by instantly flexing and energizing with light.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="226.0">This makes the interface feel responsive, satisfying, and alive.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="231.0">And it has an inherent gel-like flexibility to it </span></span><span><span data-start="234.0">that communicates its transient and malleable nature, </span></span><span><span data-start="238.0">as it moves in tandem with your interaction. </span></span><span><span data-start="241.0">This fluidity helps the interface feel aligned </span></span><span><span data-start="244.0">with the dynamism and continually changing nature of our thinking and movement.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="250.0">Elements can even lift up into Liquid Glass temporarily, </span></span><span><span data-start="254.0">such as when you interact with a component. </span></span><span><span data-start="257.0">This lets the resting state stay visually quiet, while it comes to life on touch.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="262.0">This works great for things like controls, </span></span><span><span data-start="265.0">where the transparent liquid lens can be seen through </span></span><span><span data-start="268.0">to precisely observe the value underneath it.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="272.0">This sense of fluidity </span></span><span><span data-start="274.0">also extends not just to how the material reacts to your input, </span></span><span><span data-start="278.0">but also how it reacts to the dynamically changing environments of modern apps. </span></span><span><span data-start="283.0">As you go between states in an app, </span></span><span><span data-start="285.0">Liquid Glass dynamically morphs between thecontrols in each context. </span></span><span><span data-start="290.0">This maintains the concept of having a singular floating plane </span></span><span><span data-start="294.0">that the controls live on. </span></span><span><span data-start="296.0">And it makes transitions between different sections of an app feel fluid and seamless, </span></span><span><span data-start="301.0">as the controls continually shape shift. </span></span><span><span data-start="305.0">When showing a menu, </span></span><span><span data-start="307.0">the bubble simply pops open to reveal the content contained within.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="311.0">This lightweight, in-line transition keeps everything right where you just tapped. </span></span><span><span data-start="316.0">And it communicates a very clear and direct relationship </span></span><span><span data-start="320.0">between the button and the content contained within.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="324.0">With these properties, Liquid Glass ushers in a new era of how apps look. </span></span><span><span data-start="329.0">But it also changes how they feel, too.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="333.0">With the ability to bend and shape light in new ways, </span></span><span><span data-start="337.0">fused with the ability to dynamically flex and shape shift, </span></span><span><span data-start="341.0">Liquid Glass is designed to make the experience of apps feel </span></span><span><span data-start="344.0">fundamentally more organic, more immersive, and more fluid.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="351.0">Next, to dive into how Liquid Glass adapts </span></span><span><span data-start="354.0">automatically across different context and platforms, </span></span><span><span data-start="357.0">I’d like to hand it over to Shubham.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="360.0">Thanks Chan. </span></span><span><span data-start="361.0">Liquid Glass is designed from the ground up to be adaptive to both </span></span><span><span data-start="365.0">its size and its environment. </span></span><span><span data-start="367.0">Its primary goal is to remain visually clear, deferring to the content underneath. </span></span><span><span data-start="373.0">But it&#39;s also constantly, subtly changing to ensure legibility </span></span><span><span data-start="377.0">and to maintain clear separation from the content layer.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="381.0">Liquid Glass is composed of a number of layers </span></span><span><span data-start="384.0">that work together to give it its unique look. </span></span><span><span data-start="387.0">And unlike previous materials that had a fixed light or dark appearance, </span></span><span><span data-start="391.0">each layer continuously adapts based on what’s behind it.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="395.0">As text scrolls underneath, </span></span><span><span data-start="397.0">shadows become more prominent to create additional separation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="402.0">The amount of tint and the dynamic range </span></span><span><span data-start="404.0">shift to always ensure buttons remain legible, </span></span><span><span data-start="407.0">while letting as much of the content through as possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="411.0">And when needed, it can also independently switch between light and dark, </span></span><span><span data-start="415.0">allowing it to feel perfectly at home in any context… </span></span><span><span data-start="419.0">really letting your app&#39;s content shine.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="422.0">When glass flexes and morphs to larger sizes – </span></span><span><span data-start="425.0">like when presenting a menu from a toolbar button </span></span><span><span data-start="428.0">– its material characteristics change to simulate </span></span><span><span data-start="431.0">a thicker, more substantial material. </span></span><span><span data-start="434.0">It casts deeper, richer shadows, has more pronounced lensing and refraction effects, </span></span><span><span data-start="439.0">and a softer scattering of light. </span></span><span><span data-start="442.0">These subtle changes enhance the perceived depth </span></span><span><span data-start="445.0">and aid in the legibility of the content within the glass element itself.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="449.0">Liquid Glass is fundamental to creating </span></span><span><span data-start="452.0">a unified design language across all our platforms. </span></span><span><span data-start="455.0">On iPad and Mac, we&#39;ve applied these very same principles.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="460.0">Just like on iPhone, these Liquid Glass layers form a distinct functional layer </span></span><span><span data-start="465.0">for controls and navigation, floating above everything </span></span><span><span data-start="468.0">and giving you a larger, more expansive canvas for your content.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="473.0">Glass controls nest perfectly into the rounded corners of windows, </span></span><span><span data-start="478.0">maintaining concentricity throughout the UI.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="481.0">On larger elements, like sidebars, the appearance of Liquid Glass </span></span><span><span data-start="485.0">is informed by the ambient environment within the app.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="489.0">Light from colorful content nearby can subtly spill onto its surface, </span></span><span><span data-start="494.0">reinforcing the material&#39;s context and its sense of elevation within the interface. </span></span><span><span data-start="499.0">And the effect isn&#39;t limited to the surface, </span></span><span><span data-start="502.0">the light reflects, scatters, and bleeds into the shadow as well – </span></span><span><span data-start="506.0">much like it would in the physical world.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="509.0">Floating sidebars on iPad and Mac enable a whole new level of immersion.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="515.0">The sidebar and tab bar, together, form a cohesive and consistent language </span></span><span><span data-start="520.0">for the core navigation of apps across all platforms. </span></span><span><span data-start="524.0">It can now be thought of as a single navigational element </span></span><span><span data-start="527.0">that fluidly scales as the canvas of the app grows.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="532.0">Next, let’s talk about scroll edge effects.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="535.0">Scroll edge effects work in concert with </span></span><span><span data-start="537.0">Liquid Glass to maintain that crucial separation </span></span><span><span data-start="540.0">between the UI and content layers and ensure legibility, </span></span><span><span data-start="544.0">especially with dynamically scrolling content.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="547.0">Just like Liquid Glass, scroll edge effects are inherently adaptive. </span></span><span><span data-start="552.0">As content begins to scroll underneath a glass element, </span></span><span><span data-start="556.0">the effect gently dissolves the content into the background, </span></span><span><span data-start="559.0">lifting the glass visually above the moving content, </span></span><span><span data-start="562.0">and allowing floating elements like titles to always remain clear.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="568.0">When darker content scrolls under, </span></span><span><span data-start="570.0">triggering the glass itself to transition to its dark style, </span></span><span><span data-start="573.0">the effect intelligently switches to apply a subtle dimming instead, </span></span><span><span data-start="578.0">again ensuring contrast and legibility. </span></span><span><span data-start="581.0">In some cases, like when there are pinned accessory views under a toolbar, </span></span><span><span data-start="586.0">such as column headers for example, we use a “hard style” effect instead.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="591.0">Instead of a gradual fade, </span></span><span><span data-start="593.0">the effect is applied uniformly across the height of the toolbar </span></span><span><span data-start="597.0">and the pinned accessory view. </span></span><span><span data-start="599.0">You&#39;ll want to use this style when you need that extra degree of visual separation </span></span><span><span data-start="603.0">between floating elements in the accessory view </span></span><span><span data-start="606.0">and the scrolling content below. </span></span><span><span data-start="608.0">So that’s a look at how Liquid Glass adapts across sizes, environments, and platforms, </span></span><span><span data-start="613.0">and how you can leverage it alongside the scroll edge effects </span></span><span><span data-start="616.0">to ensure clarity and legibility, </span></span><span><span data-start="618.0">all while letting your app&#39;s content truly take center stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="622.0">Next I’d like to hand if off to Bruno to discuss Liquid Glass variants in more depth </span></span><span><span data-start="627.0">and guidelines on how to best use them in your apps. </span></span><span><span data-start="630.0">Thanks Shubham. </span></span><span><span data-start="631.0">To get the most out of Liquid Glass </span></span><span><span data-start="633.0">it is important to understand it at a deeper level. </span></span><span><span data-start="636.0">Lets go over how its built and some of its behaviors. </span></span><span><span data-start="639.0">That way you’ll know what to expect when you start designing with it.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="644.0">The true magic of Liquid Glass lies in its holistic design. </span></span><span><span data-start="649.0">The light play, the depth effects, the adaptive changes, </span></span><span><span data-start="652.0">they aren&#39;t isolated features. </span></span><span><span data-start="654.0">They are layers inside a sophisticated system, </span></span><span><span data-start="656.0">working together to create a material that is greater than the sum of its parts. </span></span><span><span data-start="661.0">Let&#39;s look at some of these layers more closely. </span></span><span><span data-start="664.0">First, the highlights layer </span></span><span><span data-start="667.0">Liquid Glass lives inside an environment that behaves like the world around us. </span></span><span><span data-start="671.0">Light sources inside of this environment shine on the material </span></span><span><span data-start="675.0">producing highlights that respond to geometry just as you’d expect. </span></span><span><span data-start="679.0">On interactions, such as locking and unlocking your phone, </span></span><span><span data-start="682.0">these lights move in space, </span></span><span><span data-start="684.0">causing light to travel around the material, defining its silhouette. </span></span><span><span data-start="689.0">And in some cases, the lighting responds to device motion, </span></span><span><span data-start="692.0">making it feel like Liquid Glass is aware of its position in the real world </span></span><span><span data-start="698.0">Shadows also play an important role </span></span><span><span data-start="700.0">in helping elements feel grounded and defined. </span></span><span><span data-start="703.0">Pay close attention to the shadow in this next slide.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="707.0">The element is aware of what’s behind it </span></span><span><span data-start="709.0">and increases the opacity of its shadow when it is over text. </span></span><span><span data-start="713.0">Conversely, it lowers the opacity of its shadow </span></span><span><span data-start="716.0">when it is over a solid light background.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="718.0">This provides separation from the content </span></span><span><span data-start="721.0">to make sure elements are always easy to spot.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="725.0">When you interact with Liquid Glass, the material illuminates from within </span></span><span><span data-start="728.0">as a form of feedback.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="731.0">Starting right under your fingertips, the glow spreads throughout the element </span></span><span><span data-start="734.0">and onto any Liquid Glass elements nearby, </span></span><span><span data-start="737.0">interacting with the flexible properties of the material </span></span><span><span data-start="740.0">in a way that feels natural and fluid.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="743.0">These behaviors make the interface feel alive </span></span><span><span data-start="746.0">and directly connected to the physical world and device input. </span></span><span><span data-start="749.0">There are times where multiple layers adapt together </span></span><span><span data-start="753.0">to maintain clarity and focus within the UI hierarchy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="757.0">For example, when a window loses focus on the Mac or iPad, </span></span><span><span data-start="761.0">Liquid Glass shifts its appearance and visually recedes to guide attention.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="766.0">And this sophistication comes built-in. </span></span><span><span data-start="769.0">You get all these nuanced, dynamic behaviors automatically </span></span><span><span data-start="772.0">when applying Liquid Glass to your designs. </span></span><span><span data-start="775.0">Alright, now that i’ve gone over its structure and behaviors, </span></span><span><span data-start="779.0">I’ll talk about how and when to use Liquid Glass, </span></span><span><span data-start="781.0">as well as the different variants you can choose from. </span></span><span><span data-start="784.0">You may be tempted to use Liquid Glass everywhere </span></span><span><span data-start="787.0">but it is best reserved for the navigation layer </span></span><span><span data-start="790.0">that floats above the content of your app.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="793.0">Consider this tableview: </span></span><span><span data-start="794.0">making it Liquid Glass would make it compete with other elements and muddy the hierarchy. </span></span><span><span data-start="799.0">So keep it in the content layer instead to ensure clarity </span></span><span><span data-start="804.0">Similarly, always avoid glass on glass </span></span><span><span data-start="808.0">Stacking Liquid Glass elements on top of each other </span></span><span><span data-start="810.0">can quickly make the interface feel cluttered and confusing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="814.0">When placing elements on top of Liquid Glass, </span></span><span><span data-start="816.0">avoid applying the material to both layers. </span></span><span><span data-start="819.0">Instead, use fills, transparency, and vibrancy for the top elements </span></span><span><span data-start="824.0">to make them feel like a thin overlay that is part of the material.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="828.0">Next, let&#39;s talk about Liquid Glass variants. </span></span><span><span data-start="831.0">There are two to choose from: Regular and Clear. </span></span><span><span data-start="835.0">They should never be mixed, as they each have </span></span><span><span data-start="837.0">their own characteristics and specific use cases.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="840.0">Regular is the most versatile and the one you will be using the most. </span></span><span><span data-start="844.0">This variant gives you all the visual and adaptive effects we’ve talked about, </span></span><span><span data-start="848.0">and provides legibility regardless of context. </span></span><span><span data-start="851.0">It works in any size, over any content and anything can be placed on top of it. </span></span><span><span data-start="856.0">Clear, on the other hand, does not have adaptive behaviors. </span></span><span><span data-start="859.0">It is permanently more transparent, </span></span><span><span data-start="861.0">which allows the richness of the content underneath </span></span><span><span data-start="864.0">to come through and interact with the glass in beautiful ways. </span></span><span><span data-start="867.0">To provide enough legibility for symbols or labels, </span></span><span><span data-start="870.0">it needs a dimming layer to darken the underlying content. </span></span><span><span data-start="873.0">Without it, legibility gets noticeably worse. </span></span><span><span data-start="877.0">If Liquid Glass elements in your app have a smaller footprint, </span></span><span><span data-start="880.0">you can use localized dimming </span></span><span><span data-start="882.0">and allow the content to retain more of its original vibrancy </span></span><span><span data-start="886.0">To recap, whereas the Regular variant can work anywhere, </span></span><span><span data-start="890.0">Clear should only be used when these 3 conditions are met.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="894.0">First, the element you’re applying it to is over media-rich content. </span></span><span><span data-start="898.0">Second, your content layer won’t be negatively affected </span></span><span><span data-start="902.0">by introducing a dimming layer. </span></span><span><span data-start="904.0">And lastly, the content sitting above it is bold and bright. </span></span><span><span data-start="909.0">Now, I’ll talk about legibility: </span></span><span><span data-start="911.0">a central consideration that went into the design of Liquid Glass.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="916.0">Small elements like navbars and tabbars, </span></span><span><span data-start="918.0">constantly adapt their appearance depending on what’s behind them. </span></span><span><span data-start="921.0">They also flip from light to dark based on the background </span></span><span><span data-start="924.0">to make sure the material looks as good as possible and is easily discernible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="929.0">Bigger elements, like menus or sidebars also adapt based on context, </span></span><span><span data-start="933.0">but they don’t flip from light to dark. </span></span><span><span data-start="935.0">Their surface area is too big and transitions like these would be distracting. </span></span><span><span data-start="940.0">To maintain legibility, </span></span><span><span data-start="941.0">symbols and glyphs on top of Liquid Glass, do the same. </span></span><span><span data-start="944.0">They flip from light to dark and vice versa, </span></span><span><span data-start="947.0">mirroring the glass’s behavior to maximize contrast. </span></span><span><span data-start="951.0">All content placed on the Regular variant will automatically receive this treatment. </span></span><span><span data-start="957.0">You can also use custom colors. </span></span><span><span data-start="958.0">But use them selectively. </span></span><span><span data-start="960.0">When items or elements serve a distinct functional purpose, you can tint them </span></span><span><span data-start="964.0">to bring attention to them. </span></span><span><span data-start="965.0">Lets take a closer look at how this works.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="968.0">Liquid Glass introduces a new way of tinting elements </span></span><span><span data-start="971.0">that respects the principles of the material and maximizes legibility.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="976.0">This technique is consistent across all Liquid Glass elements, </span></span><span><span data-start="980.0">from labels, text and fully tinted buttons… to the time on your lock screen. </span></span><span><span data-start="984.0">It brings life and vibrancy to the material </span></span><span><span data-start="987.0">and connects it more deeply to the content around it.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="991.0">Selecting a color generates a range of tones </span></span><span><span data-start="993.0">that are mapped to content brightness underneath the tinted element. </span></span><span><span data-start="997.0">It draws inspiration from how colored glass works in reality: </span></span><span><span data-start="1000.0">changing its hue, brightness and saturation </span></span><span><span data-start="1003.0">depending on whats behind without deviating too much from the intended color.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1008.0">Not only does this emphasize the physicality of the material, </span></span><span><span data-start="1010.0">but it also helps legibility and contrast.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1014.0">What’s great is that tinting is natively compatible with all the behaviors of glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="1019.0">So, you can tint any element very easily.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1023.0">Here is a button that is using a solid fill instead of the built-in tinting. </span></span><span><span data-start="1027.0">As you can tell, it is completely opaque and breaks the visual character of Liquid Glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="1032.0">But notice when it starts using the new tinting. </span></span><span><span data-start="1035.0">All of a sudden it feels more transparent and more grounded in its environment.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1041.0">Tinting should only be used to bring emphasis </span></span><span><span data-start="1043.0">to primary elements and actions in the UI. </span></span><span><span data-start="1046.0">First, lets look at an example of what not to do. </span></span><span><span data-start="1049.0">Avoid tinting all your elements. </span></span><span><span data-start="1051.0">When every element is tinted, nothing stands out, and it can be confusing. </span></span><span><span data-start="1055.0">If you want to imbue color into your app, do it in the content layer instead. </span></span><span><span data-start="1060.0">On the other hand, this View Bag button is a great example of when to use tinting, </span></span><span><span data-start="1065.0">the red makes it stand out as the primary action in this food delivery app. </span></span><span><span data-start="1070.0">The content layer is also key to avoiding any unwanted visual noise. </span></span><span><span data-start="1074.0">In steady states, such as when an app first launches, </span></span><span><span data-start="1077.0">avoid intersections between content and Liquid Glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="1080.0">Instead, reposition or scale the content to maintain separation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1086.0">In addition to the these legibility considerations, </span></span><span><span data-start="1088.0">there are also several accessibility features that </span></span><span><span data-start="1090.0">Liquid Glass offers to suit all kinds of people and needs.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1095.0">These act as modifiers on the material that change certain layers of Liquid Glass, </span></span><span><span data-start="1099.0">without sacrificing its magic.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1102.0">For instance, Reduced Transparency, makes Liquid Glass frostier </span></span><span><span data-start="1106.0">and obscures more of the content behind it. </span></span><span><span data-start="1109.0">Increased contrast, makes elements predominantly black or white </span></span><span><span data-start="1112.0">and highlights them with a contrasting border </span></span><span><span data-start="1115.0">and Reduced Motion decreases the intensity of some effects </span></span><span><span data-start="1118.0">and disables any elastic properties for the material. </span></span><span><span data-start="1122.0">These are available automatically whenever you use the new material. </span></span><span><span data-start="1125.0">So whenever these settings are turned on at a system-level, </span></span><span><span data-start="1128.0">Liquid Glass elements will get them across the board. </span></span><span><span data-start="1132.0">Throughout this session we covered the core principles and values for Liquid Glass. </span></span><span><span data-start="1136.0">We explored its functionality, behavior, and discussed </span></span><span><span data-start="1139.0">practical guidelines to use it effectively and inclusively.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1143.0">Liquid Glass delivers a unified design language across all platforms, </span></span><span><span data-start="1148.0">seamlessly blending hardware and software. </span></span><span><span data-start="1150.0">It introduces a more fluid and dynamic interaction experience than ever before, </span></span><span><span data-start="1155.0">bringing a striking new look to every part of the interface. </span></span><span><span data-start="1158.0">This is the start of a new chapter in Apple’s visual and interaction design, </span></span><span><span data-start="1162.0">and we can&#39;t wait for you to be part of it.</span></span></p>
