<p><em>I posted some later content on this piece - responding to reader takes - <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/misc-thematic-links/#innovation-stagnation">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>
My <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/wheres-todays-beethoven/">Where’s Today’s Beethoven</a> analysis involved finding a lot of “most critically acclaimed music/TV/film/books” lists, and charting patterns in them. While doing this, something I was very surprised to learn was that some of the Beach Boys’s music is incredibly acclaimed, respected, and thought of as genius. 
</p>
<p>
In particular, their 1966 album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sounds">Pet Sounds</a> is the <a href="http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/year/alltime_albums.htm">#1 most acclaimed album of all time</a>, and their followup single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a> is the the <a href="http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/year/alltime_songs.htm">4th-most acclaimed song of all time</a>. As the Wikipedia pages show, this isn’t some fluke of the rankings, e.g.:</p><blockquote><p>Promoted there as &#34;the most progressive pop album ever&#34;, Pet Sounds garnered recognition for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyric content. It is considered to be among the most influential albums in music history … 
</p>
<p>
<em>Pet Sounds</em> revolutionized the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_production">music production</a> and the role of producers within the music industry, introduced novel approaches to orchestration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicing_(music)">chord voicings</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony">structural harmonies</a>, and furthered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_music#Popular_music">cultural legitimization of popular music</a>, a greater <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_era">public appreciation for albums</a>, the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio_as_an_instrument">recording studios as an instrument</a>, and the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music">psychedelic music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock">progressive</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_rock">art rock</a> ...
</p>
<p>
It has topped several critics&#39; and musicians&#39; polls for the best album of all time, including those published by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME">NME</a></em>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(magazine)">Mojo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)">Uncut</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times">The Times</a></em>. In 2004, it was inducted into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recording_Registry">National Recording Registry</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> … 
</p>
<p>
Pet Sounds is evaluated as &#34;one of the most innovative recordings in rock&#34; and as the work that &#34;elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius&#34;.[118] Music historian Luis Sanchez viewed the album as &#34;the score to a film about what rock music doesn&#39;t have to be …&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>
After learning this, I tried listening to Pet Sounds several times, and was not able to figure out what the hoopla is about. It sounds like a cheesy pop album. 
</p>
<p>
I was unable to connect the experience of listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBKFoeDKJo&amp;ab_channel=pieandjoe1">Wouldn&#39;t It Be Nice</a> to this statement: “it was out to eclipse  ... previous sonic soap operas, to transform the subject&#39;s sappy sentiments with a God-like grace so that the song would become a veritable pocket symphony.&#34; (The term “pocket symphony” seems to come up a surprising amount for Beach Boys songs that have, as far as I can tell, 3 or so themes like most pop songs.)
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u90beUXTKwo&amp;ab_channel=TheBeachBoys-Topic">God Only Knows</a> is by far my favorite track on the album, but “often praised as one of the greatest songs ever written”? Hmm.
</p>
<p>
After struggling with this for a while, I had a stroke of inspiration. I decided to listen to <em>all</em> of the Beach Boys albums in order.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (The things I do to understand the world better! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3BtTwlHiFCcHBsMMdzooJj?si=0cb26970817c4f52">Here’s my playlist if you want to try it</a>.) 
</p>
<p>
And indeed, <strong>after ~4 hours of the simplest, sappiest music imaginable, I could sort of hear Pet Sounds as something comparatively deeper and richer</strong> - more challenging, more complex, more contemplative, more cohesive.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> In particular, a lot of the cheesy-seeming instrumental arrangements now sounded like some badly needed variety; maybe the at-the-time version of this reaction would’ve been “What creative instrumentation, it’s like a symphony!”
</p>
<p>
So maybe Pet Sounds was a remarkable new sound at the time? 
</p>
<p>
But, I think, only if you had a really fanatical commitment to only listening to the poppiest of pop music. <strong>Pet Sounds came out more than a year after legendary jazz album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme">A Love Supreme</a>!</strong> I don&#39;t want to get carried away about what my subjective taste says, but … even if A Love Supreme isn’t your cup of tea, I’d guess you’ll think it’s a great deal more complex, cohesive, impressive, and interesting in just about every way (other than the lack of prominent &#34;studio effects&#34;) than Pet Sounds. And it&#39;s not even clearly less accessible - looks like they sold a similar number of copies?<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A Love Supreme is ranked well below Pet Sounds on the <a href="http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/year/alltime_albums.htm">Acclaimed Music </a>aggregated list, as well as on the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">Rolling Stone list</a>. Reading what the critics say about Pet Sounds, after listening to both works, is quite a trip - it reminds me of reading a parent&#39;s description of their child&#39;s art, with the most generous possible interpretation of the &#34;genius&#34; of every humdrum thing in there. 
</p>
<p>
This feels roughly as close as I’m going to get to a smoking gun that rock music critics are living in a strange, strange world. If that&#39;s right, I think we also have to question whether classical music critics - and our own minds - are playing similar strange tricks on us when they assert with such conviction that Beethoven&#39;s music is unparalleled.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe I’m the one hearing (or failing to hear) things? I would love to hear from any readers who could give me any idea of what kind of headspace I’d have to inhabit to find Pet Sounds more impressive, enjoyable, or [any positive adjective]<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> than A Love Supreme!
