<b>NOTE:</b> the following contains several hyperboles that reflect my
emotions, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt, or not at
all. While I am intentionally expressing criticism, I most sincerely
hope not to offend anyone.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/emacs.html" title="Notes about Emacs (this free software text OS thingy here)">Emacs</a> master branch is broken—for good, it seems. Emacs
maintainers accepted a heavy-handed, harmful change, disregarding
concerns voiced by multiple users and developers. I’ve created a
fixed, and improved, Emacs fork. I’ll be using and developing this
fork, and you’re welcome to join.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a step back. What is the Emacs master branch? That’s
essentially the development version of Emacs, and what will soon
become Emacs version 30. Many Emacs hackers and enthusiasts track the
master branch to enjoy all of the latest developments and
improvements. Thanks to the tireless work of the Emacs maintainers in
scrutinizing incoming patches, the Emacs master branch has been very
stable in recent years. But a few weeks ago, Emacs master users got a
very unpleasant surprise.

<span>Author: Thierry Volpiatto</span>
<span>Date:   Sun Nov 19 20:42:56 2023 +0100</span>

<span>Improve register-preview (bug#66394)</span>

<span>    A minibuffer is used now instead of read-key.</span>
    ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This commit crippled all user interaction with Emacs registers,
turning commands such as <code>C-x r s</code>, once smooth and frictionless, into
a cumbersome and painful mess. Concretely, instead of just typing the
key for the register you want to operate on, you now get a fully blown
minibuffer for inserting a single key. This is nonsensical in various
ways, but most staggering is probably the fact that you now need to
confirm your register selection by pressing another <code>RET</code>, effectively
doubling the work you have to do for the simplest task of specifying a
single character.
</p>
<p>
Emacs registers (used to) provide a perfect UX. Silky smooth, really.
But no more, not in GNU Emacs 30. It’s gone, without as much as a
<code>NEWS</code> entry to inform the unwary user about this regression.
</p>
<p>
Surely, it’s not too late to revert one bad change, right? That’s
what I thought, unfortunately the Emacs maintainers seem bent on
dismissing the community’s outcry in an unwarranted and misguided
attempt to save face.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the core problems with this change were brought up already in
the first technical <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/87sf67qqmp.fsf@web.de/">comment</a> regarding this patch proposal, from
Michael Heerdegen:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If your version is accepted, I would vote for an option to get the old
behavior back. Your intended behavior is safer but requires more keys
(at least confirmation with RET). Some people might prefer the old
way.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, duh! If you’re gonna change long standing Emacs behavior, it
better be optional and backward compatible, people have been using
this thing for decades, after all. Hmm apparently, the patch author,
Thierry, doesn’t see it that way:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is only RET as additional key and it is a good thing IMO as it
let the time to user to see what he is doing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This rather arrogant statement, and the approach that underlies it,
led us to where we are today. After some further discussion, <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/eli-zaretskii.html" title="Notes about Eli Zaretskii (Emacs maintainer)">Eli
Zaretskii</a> applied this patch to Emacs master. I’m not sure he
understood the breaking nature of this change when he did that, which
I think might be even more disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Bastien Guerry chimed in, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I use registers ~100 times a day, so enhancements here are very
welcome, thanks!
</p>
<p>
I wonder about this [change], though. It badly hinders my usual flow,
where I do remember what registers I use and like to store new ones
quickly.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sounds like a clear and honest testimony from an esteemed community
member. But wait, no, Thierry doesn’t think so, he thinks it’s all
for the better and his change is all right. At this point I got
somewhat involved, and seconded Bastien’s request to restore the
previous, perfectly good behavior, at least optionally. Thierry
wasn’t willing to fix this damage, so Eli asked me to help out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So maybe a better way forward is for someone, perhaps you Eshel, to
add whatever is needed to provide optionally the previous behavior?
</p>
<p>
Would you like to work on that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Easy enough. I crafted and <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/m1wmtvnfpn.fsf@dazzs-mbp.home/">posted</a> a couple of patches that add some
bells and whistles from Thierry’s patch in an optional and compatible
manner. It’s really not that hard to make no harm in this case. But
my work was disregarded just as well, sadly. Thierry didn’t like how
I reverted his change to use the minibuffer for reading a single key,
which is exactly the root cause of the problems I tried to fix—and
in fact I did fix it, just not in Emacs master, but in my new fork.
</p>
<p>
Since then, <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CA+Nei8MfEw_iDj3Xjbzop+7n-oqNp1jSJcweOgEQMKUkB3mifQ@mail.gmail.com/">another bug report</a> came in from an Emacs master branch
user that suffered from one of the consequences of this change (a
specific regression that I spelled out days before, but was ignored,
for some reason), and several users reached out to the Emacs
development in request to restore the previous behavior in an ongoing
thread titled <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CAFgA-y2wUR0tGRk+RkUGn2TF2YoMyf3B=+78TGyDZP5+Ew2uyA@mail.gmail.com/">“Please, Restore Previous Behavior for
jump-to-register”</a>. Astonishingly, the maintainers seem insistent
not to budge, and Emacs 30 will thus likely suck.
</p>
<p>
I find the willingness of the Emacs maintainers to entertain this bad
behavior (of both a rouge developer and of Emacs itself) at the
expense of user experience, unacceptable. This demonstrates clear
disrespect for Emacs user preferences, and indeed their freedom.
</p>
<p>
For me, this freedom is the number one reason for using Emacs, so I
obviously won’t use an Emacs that forces on me weird breaking changes.
For that reason I’ve created a new Emacs branch, the “main” branch,
which was born from the master branch before this registers fiasco.
</p>
<p>
If these changes will be reverted before Emacs 30, I’ll surely
consider switching back to building Emacs from the upstream master
branch. But in the meantime, and for the foreseeable future, I’ll be
keeping my main branch up to date by cherry picking (only) good
changes from the master branch. And of course, I also improve it with
developments of my own.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interested, feel free to checkout my main branch from here:

<p>
I’ll be happy to coordinate and incorporate other’s work. <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f79a92b792849f929b8e96859899d994989a">Let me know</a>
if you have any suggestions, thoughts, or nice harmless patches that I
should try out.
