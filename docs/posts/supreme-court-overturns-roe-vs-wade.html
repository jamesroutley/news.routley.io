Wade</a>, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years in a decision that will transform American life, reshape the nation’s politics and lead to all but total bans on the procedure in about half of the states.</p><p>The ruling will test the legitimacy of the court and vindicate a decades-long Republican project of installing conservative justices prepared to reject the precedent, which had been repeatedly reaffirmed by earlier courts. It will also be one of the signal legacies of President Donald J. Trump, who vowed to name justices who would overrule Roe. All three of his appointees were in the majority in the 6-to-3 ruling.</p><div><p>The decision, which echoed a leaked draft opinion <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published by Politico in early May</a>, will result in a starkly divided country in which abortion is severely restricted or forbidden in many red states but remains freely available in most blue ones.</p><p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted with the majority but said he would have taken “a more measured course,” stopping short of overruling Roe outright. The court’s three liberal members dissented.</p><p>The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, concerned a law enacted in 2018 by the Republican-dominated Mississippi Legislature that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/mississippi-abortion-ban.html" title="">banned abortions</a> if “the probable gestational age of the unborn human” was determined to be more than 15 weeks. The statute, a calculated challenge to Roe, included narrow exceptions for medical emergencies or “a severe fetal abnormality.”</p><p>Mississippi’s sole abortion clinic sued, saying the law ran afoul of Roe and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, the 1992 decision that affirmed Roe’s core holding.</p><p>Lower courts ruled for the clinic, saying the law was plainly unconstitutional under Roe, which prohibited states from banning abortions before fetal viability — the point at which fetuses can sustain life outside the womb, currently about 23 weeks.</p><p><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/reeves-carlton-wayne" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Carlton W. Reeves</a> of Federal District Court in Jackson, Miss., blocked the law in 2018, saying the legal issue was straightforward and questioning the state lawmakers’ motives.</p><p>“The state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,” <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5205137/11-20-18-Jackson-Women-s-Health-v-Currier.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Reeves wrote</a>. “This court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.”</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Jackson Women’s Health Organization is the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>“With the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court, it may be that the state believes divine providence covered the Capitol when it passed this legislation,” he wrote. “Time will tell. If overturning Roe is the state’s desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court. For now, the United States Supreme Court has spoken.”</p><p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/138354/20200316172854205_final%20JWHO%20appendix.031620.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affirmed Judge Reeves’s ruling</a>. “In an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and reaffirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability,” <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/higginbotham-patrick-errol" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham</a> wrote for the majority.</p><p>In ruling for the state, the Supreme Court did more than merely sustain the Mississippi law, leaving questions about stricter limits for another day. Instead, it overruled Roe outright.</p><p>When the court decided Roe in 1973, it established a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.</p><p>The court discarded the trimester framework in 1992 in the Casey decision but retained what it called Roe’s “essential holding” — that women have a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies until fetal viability.</p><p>Two years ago, in June 2020, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-abortion-louisiana.html" title="">Supreme Court struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law</a> by a 5-to-4 margin, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. providing the decisive vote. His concurring opinion, which expressed respect for precedent but proposed a relatively relaxed standard for evaluating restrictions, signaled an incremental approach to cutting back on abortion rights.</p><p>But that was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" title="">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died</a> that September. Her replacement by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/amy-coney-barrett-abortion.html" title="">spoken out against “abortion on demand,”</a> changed the dynamic at the court, diminishing the chief justice’s power to guide the pace of change.</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Supporters of abortion rights holding a vigil in front of the Supreme Court last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDlmMTU0OWEtNmM1ZS01ZmMzLWE2NWYtMGE4M2ViY2E1OGMx"><div id="09f1549a-6c5e-5fc3-a65f-0a83ebca58c1" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#09f1549a-6c5e-5fc3-a65f-0a83ebca58c1"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="David Goodman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/nyregion/author-j-david-goodman/author-j-david-goodman-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T15:08:47.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 11:08 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 11:08 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">David Goodman</span></p></div></div></div><p>Gov.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, the case before the nation’s highest court on a restrictive Mississippi law, is the most consequential on women’s access to abortion since the court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. </p><p>But the legal case, over a law that makes most abortions illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy, is by no means the first to challenge or chip away at Roe v. Wade. Here is a look at some of the most significant past rulings.</p><div><h3 id="link-4a76b58a"><span>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 1989</span></h3><p>The narrow 5-4 ruling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/04/us/supreme-court-supreme-court-5-4-narrowing-roe-v-wade-upholds-sharp-state-limits.html" title="">gave states the right to impose new restrictions</a> on abortion, upholding parts of a 1986 Missouri law relating to public resources being used to assist women in abortions not necessary to save their lives. The laws barred public employees from being involved and banned the use of public buildings, and separately required doctors to perform tests to determine whether the fetus can live outside the womb if the woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant.</p><h3 id="link-7c28e686"><span>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992</span></h3><p>In the draft opinion leaked in May, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that Casey should be overruled along with Roe v. Wade. In this decision, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/washington/high-court-54-affirms-right-to-abortion-but-allows-most-of.html" title="">reaffirmed the “essence”</a> of the constitutional right to abortion outlined in Roe v. Wade while giving states new leeway to impose restrictions on the procedure. The 5-4 ruling upheld part of a Pennsylvania law regulating access to abortions while finding that laws prohibiting all or most abortions are unconstitutional, with the majority writing that Roe v. Wade established a “rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.” The decision also set the standard that it was unconstitutional for states to ban abortions before “fetal viability,” estimated to be about 24 weeks into pregnancy.</p><h3 id="link-750f9af2"><span>Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007</span></h3><p>The 5-4 decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html" title="">upheld a federal law banning a method of abortion</a> known by opponents of the procedure as “partial birth,” reversing course from a decision to strike down a similar state law seven years earlier in Stenberg v. Carhart. It was the first time the court backed a ban on a specific method of abortion, opening up doctors to criminal prosecution for performing the procedure. The federal law, enacted in 2003, prohibited on a procedure known medically as “intact dilation and extraction” used to terminate pregnancies beginning at about 12 weeks.</p><h3 id="link-78be4d84"><span>Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016</span></h3><p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html" title="">struck down parts of a restrictive Texas law</a> that required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics, which could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state. The 5-to-3 decision was the court’s most sweeping since Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It found that Texas’ restrictions would place an “undue burden” on the ability to obtain an abortion. The decision curbed states’ ability to restrict and regulate abortion</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzJiYzJhNTEtNjVhOS01YjQ2LThkNjctZTU4YjA3ZTIxZDY4"><div id="c2bc2a51-65a9-5b46-8d67-e58b07e21d68" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#c2bc2a51-65a9-5b46-8d67-e58b07e21d68"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Jesus Jimenez" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/reader-center/author-jesus-jimenez/author-jesus-jimenez-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T15:04:15.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 11:04 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 11:04 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Jesus Jimenez</span></p></div></div></div><p>Gov.

Casey</a> in 1992, the Supreme Court affirmed what it called the central holding of Roe v. Wade: that states may not prohibit abortions before fetal viability, the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb, which is now about 23 weeks.</p><p>Three members of the court — Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter, all Republican appointees — collaborated on the controlling opinion. “The woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade,” the opinion said.</p><div><p>“We must justify the lines we draw,” the opinion said. “And there is no line other than viability which is more workable.”</p><p>But the opinion also revised aspects of the Roe decision in ways that supporters of abortion rights had said would amount to overruling Roe.</p><p>Roe had established a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.</p><p>The court discarded the trimester framework in 1992 in the Casey decision.<span>  </span>In the process, it adopted the now familiar undue burden test, under which the court has sustained restrictions on abortion.<span>  </span>But the controlling opinion said the core of Roe survived.</p><p>“Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade<em>,</em> and we reaffirm that holding,” it said. “Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTljNGUwZGEtNjUyMy01OGNlLTgwMWMtNTg2MDcxYzFhMDRj"><div id="a9c4e0da-6523-58ce-801c-586071c1a04c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#a9c4e0da-6523-58ce-801c-586071c1a04c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Emily Cochrane" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-emily-cochrane/author-emily-cochrane-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T14:39:40.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 10:39 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 10:39 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Emily Cochrane</span></p></div></div></div><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, on a day that was supposed to focus on the landmark passage of bipartisan gun reform legislation: “This cruel ruling is outrageous and heart-wrenching.<span>  </span>But make no mistake: the rights of women and all Americans are on the ballot this November.”</p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODI5OWEyNzUtZDIwOC01NTE2LWE1ZGMtMjlkN2YyMzI0ZWRl"><div id="8299a275-d208-5516-a5dc-29d7f2324ede" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#8299a275-d208-5516-a5dc-29d7f2324ede"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Emma Goldberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/16/opinion/emma-goldberg/emma-goldberg-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T14:37:26.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 10:37 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 10:37 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Emma Goldberg</span></p></div></div></div><p>While employers have been asked to weigh in on many social and political issues in recent years, abortion is distinct because it raises questions about employee health care access, especially if they are headquartered in one of the 13 states that will ban abortion immediately or very quickly with Roe overturned. “Employers like us may be the last line of defense,” said Sarah Jackel, chief operating officer of Civitech, a 55-person company based in Texas that committed to covering travel expenses for employees in need of an abortion.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYmQ1MTJiZDItMTUxNi01ZDRkLTgxMTUtOTRlODY2ZTFiYTk0"><div id="bd512bd2-1516-5d4d-8115-94e866e1ba94" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#bd512bd2-1516-5d4d-8115-94e866e1ba94"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Stephanie Lai" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/21/reader-center/author-stephanie-lai/author-stephanie-lai-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T14:37:10.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 10:37 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 10:37 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Stephanie Lai</span></p></div></div></div><p>There are mixed reactions from the House of Representatives this morning as they trickle in to vote.

So, it is notable that the decision by Republican-appointed justices to end a constitutional right to abortion conflicted with the views of a majority of Americans.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/21/us/major-supreme-court-cases-2022.html" title="">a recent SCOTUSPoll</a>, for example, 62.3 percent of respondents opposed overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent that established abortion rights. Just 37.8 percent of respondents believed the Supreme Court should do so.</p><div><p>The nationally representative survey was conducted from March 30 to April 6, before a draft version of the opinion leaked, and polled more than 2,100 adult residents of the United States. It was sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the University of Texas.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the results were somewhat different when broken down by political party. By an even larger margin, Democrats overwhelmingly said they opposed overturning Roe, 78.8 percent to 21.2 percent. A smaller but still large majority of independents and members of third parties shared that view: 62.7 percent to 37.4 percent.</p><p>By contrast, a slightly smaller but also still sizable majority of Republicans — 59.2 percent — said they wanted the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, while 40.8 percent of Republicans said they were opposed.</p><p>The same poll also asked whether the specific Mississippi law at issue — which bans abortions after 15 weeks — is constitutional. The results were largely similar, but there was a striking flip among the independents: A small majority, 52.2 percent, joined Republicans in saying they thought the law should be upheld.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNWVjNWE5MWQtYjczZi01NWFkLTkzZDgtYjhmOTUxNWNmNDIw"><div id="5ec5a91d-b73f-55ad-93d8-b8f9515cf420" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#5ec5a91d-b73f-55ad-93d8-b8f9515cf420"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Julie Bosman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/09/multimedia/author-julie-bosman/author-julie-bosman-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T14:32:27.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 10:32 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 10:32 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Julie Bosman</span></p></div></div></div><p>Eric Schmitt, the attorney general of Missouri, issued an opinion that activated Missouri’s “trigger” law, effectively ending abortion in the state except for in cases of medical emergencies.

Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed Roe and did so by considering the stare decisis factors,” he said in 2018. “So Casey now becomes a precedent on precedent.

The reliance interest considerations are important there, and all of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered,” he told senators in March 2017. “It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992 and in several other cases. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.”</p><p>He added, “For a judge to start tipping his or her hand about whether they like or dislike this or that precedent would send the wrong signal.

Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough — and the court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly decided,” he said at the time. “That really doesn’t answer the question. It just poses the question. And you do look at these other factors, like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments. All of those factors go into the determination of whether to revisit a precedent under the principles of stare decisis.</p><p>He continued, “I’ve tried as scrupulously as possible today to avoid making any commitments about cases that might come before the court.”</p><h2 id="link-1f153d4"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CHRG-THOMAS/pdf/GPO-CHRG-THOMAS-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas, 1991</a></h2><p>Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 1991, Judge Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/13/us/thomas-hearings-high-court-nominee-s-testimony-continues-frustrate-democrats.html" title="">sidestepped</a> declaring his views on abortion and declined to state whether Roe had been properly decided.</p><p>“The Supreme Court, of course, in the case of Roe v.

Wade</a> in 1973 established a constitutional right to abortion, striking down laws in many states that had banned the procedure.

In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.</p><p>The court discarded the trimester framework in 1992 in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood v.
