Wade</a>, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years in a decision that will transform American life, reshape the nation’s politics and lead to all but total bans on the procedure in about half of the states.</p><p>The ruling will test the legitimacy of the court and vindicate a decades-long Republican project of installing conservative justices prepared to reject the precedent, which had been repeatedly reaffirmed by earlier courts. It will also be one of the signal legacies of President Donald J. Trump, who vowed to name justices who would overrule Roe. All three of his appointees were in the majority in the 6-to-3 ruling.</p><div><p>The decision, which echoed a leaked draft opinion <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published by Politico in early May</a>, will result in a starkly divided country in which abortion is severely restricted or forbidden in many red states but remains freely available in most blue ones.</p><p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted with the majority but said he would have taken “a more measured course,” stopping short of overruling Roe outright. The court’s three liberal members dissented.</p><p>The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, concerned a law enacted in 2018 by the Republican-dominated Mississippi Legislature that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/mississippi-abortion-ban.html" title="">banned abortions</a> if “the probable gestational age of the unborn human” was determined to be more than 15 weeks. The statute, a calculated challenge to Roe, included narrow exceptions for medical emergencies or “a severe fetal abnormality.”</p><p>Mississippi’s sole abortion clinic sued, saying the law ran afoul of Roe and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, the 1992 decision that affirmed Roe’s core holding.</p><p>Lower courts ruled for the clinic, saying the law was plainly unconstitutional under Roe, which prohibited states from banning abortions before fetal viability — the point at which fetuses can sustain life outside the womb, currently about 23 weeks.</p><p><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/reeves-carlton-wayne" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Carlton W. Reeves</a> of Federal District Court in Jackson, Miss., blocked the law in 2018, saying the legal issue was straightforward and questioning the state lawmakers’ motives.</p><p>“The state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,” <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5205137/11-20-18-Jackson-Women-s-Health-v-Currier.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Reeves wrote</a>. “This court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.”</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Jackson Women’s Health Organization is the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>“With the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court, it may be that the state believes divine providence covered the Capitol when it passed this legislation,” he wrote. “Time will tell. If overturning Roe is the state’s desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court. For now, the United States Supreme Court has spoken.”</p><p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/138354/20200316172854205_final%20JWHO%20appendix.031620.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affirmed Judge Reeves’s ruling</a>. “In an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and reaffirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability,” <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/higginbotham-patrick-errol" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham</a> wrote for the majority.</p><p>In ruling for the state, the Supreme Court did more than merely sustain the Mississippi law, leaving questions about stricter limits for another day. Instead, it overruled Roe outright.</p><p>When the court decided Roe in 1973, it established a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women’s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.</p><p>The court discarded the trimester framework in 1992 in the Casey decision but retained what it called Roe’s “essential holding” — that women have a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies until fetal viability.</p><p>Two years ago, in June 2020, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-abortion-louisiana.html" title="">Supreme Court struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law</a> by a 5-to-4 margin, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. providing the decisive vote. His concurring opinion, which expressed respect for precedent but proposed a relatively relaxed standard for evaluating restrictions, signaled an incremental approach to cutting back on abortion rights.</p><p>But that was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" title="">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died</a> that September. Her replacement by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/amy-coney-barrett-abortion.html" title="">spoken out against “abortion on demand,”</a> changed the dynamic at the court, diminishing the chief justice’s power to guide the pace of change.</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Supporters of abortion rights holding a vigil in front of the Supreme Court last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="41" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYjNkODk3MWQtNmRjZS01YjZkLTk2YzUtMjY0ZWJiZDEyYTdj"><div id="b3d8971d-6dce-5b6d-96c5-264ebbd12a7c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#b3d8971d-6dce-5b6d-96c5-264ebbd12a7c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Carl Hulse" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-carl-hulse/author-carl-hulse-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:21:40.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:21 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:21 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Carl Hulse</span></p></div></div></div><p>Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who was a key supporter of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in his 2018 confirmation, says in a new statement that Kavanaugh and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch misrepresented their views on Roe in private meetings with her. “This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon,” she said. Ms. Collins said that “throwing out a precedent overnight that the country has relied upon for half a century is not conservative. It is a sudden and radical jolt to the country that will lead to political chaos, anger, and a further loss of confidence in our government.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="40" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQzMjZiNjUxLTBiZDMtNTY2Yi1iNzQ3LWZmYzYxM2ZhZWZhMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#in-mississippi-where-the-case-started-most-abortions-will-be-illegal-in-a-matter-of-days" data-source-id="100000008414801"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tariro-mzezewa"><img alt="Tariro Mzezewa" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/opinion/tariro-headshot/tariro-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:19:10.793Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:19 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:19 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Jackson Women’s Health Organization in Jackson, Miss.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rory Doyle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In Mississippi, the state at the center of the case that led the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, nearly all abortions will likely be illegal within a matter of days.</p><p>The state has a so-called trigger law that will prohibit most abortions 10 days after the Mississippi attorney general certifies the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The law contains exceptions in cases of rape or to save the life of the pregnant person.</p><div><p>Abortions are, temporarily, legal until 20 weeks of probable gestational age.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling came as an unsurprising blow to the abortion rights activists in Mississippi who had sued on behalf of Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the state’s sole abortion clinic, after the state passed a law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mississippi-abortion-law.html" title="">banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy</a>.</p><p>“A lot of people are now not going to be able to make their own reproductive choices to be able to shape their futures,” said Vara Lyons, policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. “We are going to see people and teens, especially lower-income ones, being forced to have children that they otherwise would not choose.”</p><p>The closest states where women will be able to get abortions are Florida and Illinois. Ms. Lyons said that the distance and cost of travel would make it difficult for women who did not have the money, child care or ability to take time off work to travel and get the abortions.</p><p>“Fighting for women’s reproductive rights is going to take a lot of creative litigation now,” she said.</p><p>Dr. Cheryl Hamlin, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Massachusetts who travels regularly to Mississippi to help women who are seeking abortions at Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which is also known as the Pink House, said neighboring states would see an increase in the number of women traveling from Mississippi seeking abortions. In the short-term, she said, there will be an increase in the number of women suffering from complications from self-induced abortions.</p><p>“I can’t quite wrap my mind around it,” she said. “The people scheduled for the week after, you just have to just say, ‘Sorry.’”</p><p>Derenda Hancock, who leads the Pink House defenders, as the volunteers who escort women in and out of the Jackson clinic are known, said they saw 30 patients on Thursday and she expected Friday to be just as busy.</p><p>The A.C.L.U. is considering campaigning for a ballot initiative that would protect women’s reproductive rights in Mississippi.</p><p>In the meantime, state and local law enforcement agencies were prepared for protests. </p><p>“Each agency will remain on standby for critical incidents that may arise in areas identified as possible rally points or targets for any potential threats,” said Bailey Martin, the press secretary for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="37" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YyNTRkNjQ1LTZmODUtNTgzYS1iNzY4LTE2MTIzOWEzMTQwZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#demonstrators-gathered-outside-the-court-after-the-ruling-was-announced" data-source-id="100000008415027"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:17:49.761Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:17 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:17 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">The New York Times</span></p></div></div></div><p>Outside the Supreme Court on Friday, supporters and opponents of abortion gathered after the court’s decision was announced — some to celebrate, and others to protest. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="36" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdhNTg2NTUyLTQ0YjgtNWQwNi05N2RkLWFjYjE1YjFiYTk0Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#the-decision-to-overturn-roe-could-have-economic-ramifications" data-source-id="100000008414841"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport"><img alt="Alan Rappeport" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:17:47.344Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:17 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:17 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Supreme Court’s decision on Friday to overturn Roe V. Wade could deal a blow to the financial well-being of women, whom economists argue bear steep economic burden from unwanted pregnancies.</p><p>The decision comes as the United States has for years struggled with pay disparities among women and men, and as the Biden administration has called for policies to broaden access to child care so that women can have more easily participate in the work force. Unwanted pregnancies increase the chance that women drop out of school or leave their jobs, eroding their earning potential and making it more likely that they require federal assistance.</p><div><p>Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen made this case last month after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/08/us/politics/roe-wade-supreme-court-abortion.html" title="">leaked draft decision</a> indicated that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that established a constitutional right to abortion.</p><p>“I believe that eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades,” Ms. Yellen said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/business/treasury-janet-yellen-abortion-rights.html" title="">during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee</a> in May.</p><p>A Brookings Institution report last year laid out some of the costs related to pregnancy that women face in the United States. A “motherhood wage penalty” and the high expense of child care can cause severe financial strain, the report said. Since low-income women are more likely to seek abortions, the new restrictions will place a more significant burden on them, widening income inequality.</p><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26662" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a 2020 study</a> that analyzed the economic consequences of being denied an abortion, researchers found a “large increase in financial distress that is sustained for several years” and evidence of a short-term reduction in credit access.</p><p>“Abortion rights are economic rights, and this decision means the loss of economic security, independence, and mobility for abortion seekers,” <a href="https://www.epi.org/people/heidi-shierholz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heidi Shierholz</a>, president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>Ms. Yellen said in May that legalization of abortion helped lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/business/roe-women-workforce-abortion-rights.html" title="">increased labor force participation</a> among women, allowing more to finish school and increase their earning potential, and she pointed to economic research suggesting that those gains could be reversed if access to abortions are curbed.</p><p>“It makes clear that denying women access to abortion increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance,” Ms. Yellen said of the research.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="34" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNkYWQyZjQ2LWExYmItNTQ3OC04NTU0LWFmMTliYjZlN2I1OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#abortion-companies-travel-expenses" data-source-id="100000008414784"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:16:29.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:16 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:16 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><p>After a memo from the Supreme Court showing its decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization leaked in May, a handful of companies committed to protecting their employees’ access to abortion.</p><p>The small group of companies that have said they would cover travel expenses for employees who need abortions include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/business/starbucks-abortion-travel-expenses.html" title="">Starbucks</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/business/tesla-abortion-costs-texas.html" title="">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/business/yelp-abortion-employees.html" title="">Yelp</a>, Airbnb, Netflix, Patagonia, DoorDash, JPMorgan Chase, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and Reddit.</p><div><p>On Friday, after the final ruling was handed down, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive, called the decision a threat to gender equality in the workplace.</p><p>“Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision and call on Congress to codify Roe into law,” Mr. Stoppelman said.</p><p>Levi Strauss &amp; Co called on business leaders to take a stand against the ruling. “Protection of reproductive rights is a critical business issue impacting our work force, our economy and progress toward gender and racial equity,” the company said. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank, with about 170,000 U.S. employees, said the bank was focused on equal access to health care for all its employees. She highlighted a June 1 memo alerting employees that their travel costs would be covered if they needed to go more than 50 miles to receive certain medical procedures, including abortions.</p><p>Reddit also said its employees could get a stipend to cover travel for medical procedures, including abortions. “Our benefits programs are designed to support the health and safety of our employees, and we also have robust policies to support women in the workplace,” said a representative for the company.</p><p>Though a majority of these travel policies followed the leaked memo, the trend began last year, after Texas enacted its six-week ban on abortion, in September. With abortion rights now overturned on the federal level, there is more pressure for companies to respond, especially for those with headquarters in one of the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/13-states-have-abortion-trigger-bans-heres-what-happens-when-roe-overturned" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 states</a> that will ban abortion immediately or very quickly following Roe’s overturn.</p><p>“Employers like us may be the last line of defense,” said Sarah Jackel, chief operating officer of Civitech. The Texas-based company, which employs 55 people and builds technology tools for political campaigns, committed to covering travel expenses for workers seeking an abortion immediately after Texas’s ban went into effect.</p><p>Ms. Jackel said the policy had strong support from both employees and investors, though the company declined to say if anyone has used it. “It makes good business sense,” Ms. Jackel added. “There’s no reason we should be putting our employees in the position of having to choose between keeping their job or carrying out an unwanted pregnancy.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTk3YzJkNDEtZDliZC01Y2E5LThkMzQtMzRmODVlNGQzMzJj"><div id="a97c2d41-d9bd-5ca9-8d34-34f85e4d332c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#a97c2d41-d9bd-5ca9-8d34-34f85e4d332c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Alexandra Petri" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/11/reader-center/author-alexandra-petri/author-alexandra-petri-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:15:31.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:15 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:15 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Alexandra Petri</span></p></div></div></div><p> Louisiana and Kentucky are two states with trigger laws effectively banning abortions that took effect immediately after the Supreme Court handed down its ruling overturning Roe.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2U0OGFmYjAtYjYzNS01YmUzLTk5NDYtYjcyMzhjYjY3ZjEw"><div id="ce48afb0-b635-5be3-9946-b7238cb67f10" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#ce48afb0-b635-5be3-9946-b7238cb67f10"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Katie Benner" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-katie-benner/author-katie-benner-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:13:19.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:13 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:13 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Katie Benner</span></p></div></div></div><p>Attorney General Merrick B.

He said that the department would allow federal agencies in some circumstances to continue to provide reproductive health services. And he vowed to work with other federal agencies to protect and preserve access to reproductive care, noting that the FDA has approved the use of the medication Mifepristone for medical abortions.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcwOGUyYTAzLWFkZjctNWM1ZC1iM2UwLTI0Zjk5ZGMxNjM4NA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#trump-roe-wade-republicans" data-source-id="100000008414927"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:10:31.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:10 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:10 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Former President Donald J.

Trump was remarkably tight-lipped for weeks about the possible decision, which the court ultimately handed down on Friday, ending federal abortion protections. But privately, Mr. Trump has told people repeatedly that he believes it will be “bad for Republicans.”</p><div><p>The decision, Mr. Trump has told friends and advisers, will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/us/roe-overturned-women-republican-voters.html" title="">anger suburban women</a>, a group who helped tilt the 2020 presidential race to Joseph R. Biden Jr., and will lead to a backlash against Republicans in the November midterm elections.</p><p>His advisers had encouraged Mr. Trump to keep quiet about the issue until a ruling was issued, in part to ensure he was not accused of trying to influence the decision. Still, the contrast between Mr. Trump and conservatives who have heralded the decision and who worked in his administration, such as former Vice President Mike Pence, has been striking. On Friday morning, Mr. Pence issued a statement saying, “Life won,” as he called for abortion opponents to keep fighting “in every state in the land.” </p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his private remarks, or his view of the ruling. But in an interview that Fox News published after the decision on Friday, Mr. Trump, asked about his role, said, “God made the decision.” He said the decision was “following the Constitution, and giving rights back when they should have been given long ago.” </p><p>“I think, in the end, this is something that will work out for everybody,” Mr. Trump told Fox News. </p><p>Mr. Trump supported abortion rights for many years, although he said he abhorred the procedure. In 2011, preparing for a possible campaign, he reversed course and told a conservative political conference that he opposed abortion rights. And throughout his political career, he has privately called it a “tough issue” and publicly struggled to discuss it.</p><p>In an interview with The New York Times in May, Mr. Trump uttered an eyebrow-raising demurral in response to a question about the central role he had played in tipping the balance on the Supreme Court and paving the way for the reversal of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>“I never like to take credit for anything,” said Mr. Trump, who spent his career affixing his name to almost anything he could.</p><p>Pressed to describe his feelings about having helped assemble a court that was on the verge of erasing the ruling that protected abortion rights, Mr. Trump refused to engage the question and instead focused on the leak of the draft opinion in early May.</p><p>“I don’t know what the decision is,” he said. “We’ve been reading about something that was drawn months ago. Nobody knows what that decision is. A draft is a draft.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTdlMTg2YTctODg5ZC01OTJjLThlZmYtNDhjYTE4Y2ZhMjM5"><div id="57e186a7-889d-592c-8eff-48ca18cfa239" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#57e186a7-889d-592c-8eff-48ca18cfa239"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Stephen Castle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-stephen-castle/author-stephen-castle-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T16:05:13.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 12:05 p.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 12:05 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Stephen Castle</span></p></div></div></div><p>Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, characterized the Supreme Court decision as a “big step backward.”</p><p>Speaking at a news conference in Kigali, Rwanda, at a meeting of leaders of Commonwealth countries, Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the ruling was from another jurisdiction, but added that “clearly it has massive impacts on people’s thinking around the world.

It is also adjusting to a waiting period that <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2022/04/12/florida-abortion-judge-waiting-period-leon-county-tallahassee/7287912001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took effect</a> in Florida in April after years of litigation, requiring patients seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound and then wait at least 24 hours before returning for the actual procedure. And a new state law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy is set to take effect on July 1.</p><div><p>Many patients in Florida get medication abortions, which involve taking two different drugs, 24 to 48 hours apart, and are authorized for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. But the center provides surgical abortions up until almost 22 weeks of pregnancy, too — at least until the new law takes effect. It also provides pelvic and breast exams, different types of contraception, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and other types of reproductive health care.</p><p>Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the center’s former medical director, moved back to New York City last month. She had previously worked as the associate medical director of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York and would once again practice in the state, where abortion will remain legal for up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, or later if the fetus is not viable or the patient’s life or health is at risk. Part of the reason she left Florida, she said, was that she would no longer be allowed to perform abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy if the new law took effect as planned.</p><p>“The state you live in shouldn’t dictate the health care you’re able to access,” she said, “so it just feels enormously overwhelming and heartbreaking.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOTVlNGM0OGYtMjg3Mi01NGZjLWEwOTItYTU4YWMwNTMzZDZh"><div id="95e4c48f-2872-54fc-a092-a58ac0533d6a" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#95e4c48f-2872-54fc-a092-a58ac0533d6a"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Emily Cochrane" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-emily-cochrane/author-emily-cochrane-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T15:52:53.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 11:52 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 11:52 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Emily Cochrane</span></p></div></div></div><p>Speaking at her weekly news conference, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California is clearly shaken, telling reporters “I am personally overwhelmed by this decision.”</p><p>“It’s just stunning, and again as a woman, as a mother, as a grandmother, to see young girls now have fewer rights than their moms or even their grandmothers, is something very sad for our country,” she added.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRlZTMwNTE3LWEwNDMtNTMwOS1hMjg0LWY2NmY4YjBkOWNhMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#politicos-roe-v-wade-leak" data-source-id="100000008414795"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T15:52:41.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 11:52 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 11:52 a.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Anti-abortion protesters celebrated outside the Supreme Court on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shuran Huang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Supreme Court made huge headlines on Friday with its decision to end the constitutional right to abortion.

Within a day of their story publishing, the Supreme Court confirmed that the draft opinion was real and announced an investigation into the leak.

This law was ruled unconstitutional not long after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, but it was never struck from the state code. Still, it is unclear whether this law is suddenly in force again.</p><p>The uncertainty is due in part, paradoxically, to a flurry of laws restricting abortion that have passed in the decades after Roe.</p><div><p>“There are some complicating factors,” said State Senator Charles Trump, the chairman of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee. Laws passed in recent decades include a ban on certain types of abortion procedures, a ban on abortion after 20 weeks and a mandated waiting period. In putting limits on abortion, these laws carry the implication that it is not completely illegal, Mr. Trump said.</p><p>In a statement applauding the Supreme Court’s decision on Friday, the attorney general of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, said he would soon “be providing a legal opinion to the Legislature about how it should proceed to save as many babies’ lives as humanly and legally possible.”</p><p>For the West Virginia Women’s Health Center, the only clinic in the state that performs abortions, the lack of clarity is its own peril. With the overturning of Roe, “West Virginia prosecutors could begin trying to immediately enforce an abortion ban,” Katie Quinones, the executive director of the center, said several days before the decision. Without an explicit repeal of the old ban by the legislature, she said “it would be impossible for us to continue providing abortions.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzM3ZTI4MTUtMzZiNS01YTMzLTljZDAtM2MxNjRlMjE5NjE5"><div id="337e2815-36b5-5a33-9cd0-3c164e219619" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court#337e2815-36b5-5a33-9cd0-3c164e219619"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Elizabeth Dias" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-elizabeth-dias/author-elizabeth-dias-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2022-06-24T15:49:54.000Z"><p><span>June 24, 2022, 11:49 a.m. ET</span><span></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2022, 11:49 a.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Elizabeth Dias</span></p></div></div></div><p>Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director who became an anti-abortion activist, was at the Pro-Life Women’s Conference in Indianapolis.

Wade does not indicate that the Court would revisit past decisions about birth control.</p><p>In a concurring opinion, however, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the justices should reconsider “all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents,” including the case of <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>which ruled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/28/nyregion/griswold-v-connecticut-landmark-case-remembered.html" title="">ban on contraceptives</a> unconstitutional.</p><div><p>Some legal experts have raised concerns that justices could apply the argument for overturning Roe to limiting access to contraceptives. As a result, those who support birth control access worry that legislators could use a ban on abortion to make birth control less available.</p><p>“We’ve seen folks falsely equating emergency contraceptives and IUDs with abortion,” said Mara Gandal-Powers, director of birth control access and senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center. “That’s certainly something I’m concerned about.”</p><p>One concern that has been raised is whether laws, like one in Oklahoma, that ban abortion from the moment of fertilization would also outlaw intrauterine devices, or IUDs, which are designed to prevent fertilization but also can stop a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. (The Oklahoma law specifies that it does not apply to contraception, including Plan B or morning-after pills.)</p><h2 id="link-7e8984e0">What about Plan B and emergency contraception?</h2><p>There are two “morning-after pills” available: Plan B, which is available over the counter at drugstores and pharmacies, and Ella, which requires a prescription.

Wade was expected to pave the way for a law that has been held up in the federal courts that will effectively ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.</p><p>The new restrictions, which legal experts say could go into effect in a matter of days, will have particularly important political implications in Georgia, where a closely watched U.S. Senate race will take place in November, as well as a rematch governor’s contest between Democrat Stacey Abrams, an abortion rights supporter, and incumbent Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican who signed the abortion law in 2019.</p><div><p>Georgia Democrats are hoping that anger over the high court’s decision will bring more women to their side, particularly the well-educated, high-propensity female voters in the Atlanta suburbs whose distaste for Mr. Trump helped fuel recent Democratic wins in the state.</p><p>Republicans are hoping that Mr. Kemp’s signing of the law will help him continue to keep G.O.P. base voters in his camp, particularly after he lost favor with former President Trump, who was angry that Mr. Kemp did not help him overturn his election loss in the state in 2020.</p><p>The candidates in the Senate race were quick to issue statements Friday morning. Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, <a href="https://twitter.com/ReverendWarnock/status/1540338944566591489?s=20&amp;t=_wCe-t3ynxDz41sO9tfQIQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “​​I’m outraged by the Supreme Court’s decision. As a pro-choice pastor, I’ll never back down from this fight. Women must be able to make their own health care decisions, not politicians.”</p><p>“This Supreme Court decision sends the issue of abortion back to the states, which is where it belongs,” said Herschel Walker, the Trump-backed former football star and Republican challenger. “I stand for life and Raphael Warnock stands for abortion, including the heinous practice of partial birth and late term abortion. I won’t apologize for erring on the side of life, especially considering the radical abortion views held by Senator Warnock and today’s Democrat party.”</p><p>Georgia law currently allows abortions through 20 weeks of pregnancy. The new law includes exceptions in the case of rape or incest, if a police report has been filed, and exceptions to prevent death or serious harm to the woman.</p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit delayed ruling on a challenge to the Georgia law until the Supreme Court ruled on the Mississippi abortion case that triggered this week’s ruling overturning Roe.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, the case before the nation’s highest court on a restrictive Mississippi law, is the most consequential on women’s access to abortion since the court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. </p><p>But the legal case, over a law that makes most abortions illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy, is by no means the first to challenge or chip away at Roe v. Wade. Here is a look at some of the most significant past rulings.</p><div><h3 id="link-4a76b58a"><span>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 1989</span></h3><p>The narrow 5-4 ruling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/04/us/supreme-court-supreme-court-5-4-narrowing-roe-v-wade-upholds-sharp-state-limits.html" title="">gave states the right to impose new restrictions</a> on abortion, upholding parts of a 1986 Missouri law relating to public resources being used to assist women in abortions not necessary to save their lives. The laws barred public employees from being involved and banned the use of public buildings, and separately required doctors to perform tests to determine whether the fetus can live outside the womb if the woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant.</p><h3 id="link-7c28e686"><span>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992</span></h3><p>In the draft opinion leaked in May, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that Casey should be overruled along with Roe v. Wade. In this decision, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/washington/high-court-54-affirms-right-to-abortion-but-allows-most-of.html" title="">reaffirmed the “essence”</a> of the constitutional right to abortion outlined in Roe v. Wade while giving states new leeway to impose restrictions on the procedure. The 5-4 ruling upheld part of a Pennsylvania law regulating access to abortions while finding that laws prohibiting all or most abortions are unconstitutional, with the majority writing that Roe v. Wade established a “rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.” The decision also set the standard that it was unconstitutional for states to ban abortions before “fetal viability,” estimated to be about 24 weeks into pregnancy.</p><h3 id="link-750f9af2"><span>Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007</span></h3><p>The 5-4 decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html" title="">upheld a federal law banning a method of abortion</a> known by opponents of the procedure as “partial birth,” reversing course from a decision to strike down a similar state law seven years earlier in Stenberg v. Carhart. It was the first time the court backed a ban on a specific method of abortion, opening up doctors to criminal prosecution for performing the procedure. The federal law, enacted in 2003, prohibited a procedure known medically as “intact dilation and extraction” used to terminate pregnancies beginning at about 12 weeks.</p><h3 id="link-78be4d84"><span>Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016</span></h3><p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html" title="">struck down parts of a restrictive Texas law</a> that required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics, which could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state. The 5-to-3 decision was the court’s most sweeping since Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It found that Texas’ restrictions would place an “undue burden” on the ability to obtain an abortion. The decision curbed states’ ability to restrict and regulate abortion.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
