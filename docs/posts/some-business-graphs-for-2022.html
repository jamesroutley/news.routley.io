    <h1>Some business graphs for 2022</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I like looking at <a href="https://mwl.io/archives/22483">other independent authors’</a> business graphs, so I thought I’d
share some percentages and graphs of my own this year. Hopefully some of this
is useful to other writers who run internet businesses.</p>

<p>All of the graphs are about <a href="https://wizardzines.com">Wizard Zines</a>’ business selling zines – I don’t do sponsorships or consulting or commissions or anything.</p>

<h3 id="print-vs-digital-sales">print vs digital sales</h3>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/pdf-vs-print.png" height="150px"/>
</p>

<p>This year 58% of sales were digital and 42% were print. I’m really happy with
this: when I decided to start printing and shipping zines in 2021, I was a bit
worried that nobody would buy them. But we’ve sold out our first two print runs
and it’s been going great.</p>

<p><small>
Note: PDF means “PDF you can read on your computer or print at home”, print means “print version that’s physically shipped to you”
</small></p>

<h3 id="corporate-vs-personal-sales">corporate vs personal sales</h3>

<p>I sell both corporate licenses (“buy this zine for your team!”) and personal
copies. I think having corporate sales is great, but it feels like it would be risky to
be too dependent on a small number of corporate customers. So I keep an eye
on the percentage of corporate sales.</p>

<p>We’re at about 16% corporate sales for 2022 (as a percentage of revenue), which
doesn’t seem too high. It looks like this number has been pretty flat over time.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/corporate-vs-personal.png"/></p>

<h3 id="ppp-sales">PPP sales</h3>

<p>I run a PPP (“purchasing power parity”) program where I give a discount to
folks from countries with a weaker currency relative to the US. We’ll look at a
couple of things here:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many different countries are represented?</li>
<li>Which countries are the biggest users of PPP?</li>
<li>What percentage of revenue is from these sales?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/ppp-sales.png"/></p>

<p>People from 81 different countries used the program (so many!!), and the
biggest two users are India and Brazil. This has been the case as long as I can
remember, presumably because India and Brazil are two of the biggest countries
in the world.</p>

<p>About 5% of revenue comes from sales with PPP discounts.</p>

<h3 id="bundles-vs-individual-zines">bundles vs individual zines</h3>

<p>It used to be that you could only buy individual zines on the store – if you
wanted to buy a bundle, you had to buy each one individually. But then one day
someone suggested I add a way to buy all of the zines at once.</p>

<p>I did, and this turned out to be a very important business decision – here’s
a graph of the percentage of revenue from zine bundles (“packs”) over time:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/pack.png"/></p>

<p>In 2022 it was 65% of revenue (up from 3% in 2018, which I guess is when I added zine packs for the first time).</p>

<h3 id="platforms">platforms</h3>

<p>I used to sell everything on Gumroad, now I sell everything on Shopify.</p>

<p>I could include some graphs here, but I think it’s not that interesting – it’s
mostly a slow migration from 2020 to 2023, where 2020 was 100% Gumroad and 2023
is 100% Shopify.</p>

<p>Some reasons I switched to Shopify:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to sell print zines, and Shopify has inventory management. Also the amazing fulfillment company I use
(<a href="https://www.whitesquirrel.com/">White Squirrel</a>) uses a Shopify plugin.</li>
<li>Since I needed to be using Shopify anyway for print zines, it felt easier to
have everything on one platform.</li>
<li>Right now Gumroad charges 10% (7% + processing fees), and Shopify charges $38/month
plus processing fees. I actually pay more like $150/month including various
Shopify plugins, but for me $150/month is a lot less than 7% of revenue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving from Gumroad to Shopify took probably a month of energy in 2022 but it
was worth it to have everything in one place.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-graph-for-2020-2022">revenue graph for 2020-2022</h3>

<p>Here’s a graph of (relative) revenue. The blue and the purple are Shopify / Gumroad percentages, because of the Gumroad -&gt; Shopify migration I mentioned in 2021 and 2022.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/total-sales.png" height="300px"/>
</p>

<p>You can see that revenue for 2022 was less than 2020, but quite a bit more than 2021.</p>

<p>This is related to the number of zines released each year:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 zines in 2022 (The Pocket Guide to Debugging and How DNS Works), but only 1</li>
<li>1 zine in 2021 (Bite Size Bash)</li>
<li>3 zines in 2020 (Become a SELECT Star, How Containers Work, Hell Yes! CSS!)</li>
</ul>

<p>I put this towards the end because this is not something I try not to worry about
too much – every year so far the business has made comfortably enough to pay
everyone. If that looks like it might change, I’ll worry about it.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-by-month">revenue by month</h3>

<p>Here’s a graph of revenue by month for 2022 (and the first month of 2023 so far).</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/sales-by-month.png"/></p>

<p>You can see two giant spikes: in April and December when we released new zines.
(<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging-guide/">The Pocket Guide to Debugging has done super well</a> so far, thanks to all of you
who bought it! Print copies are on track to ship around the end of January.).</p>

<p>You can also see the Shopify / Gumroad migration happening in this graph – in
May I stopped using Gumroad completely.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-by-country">revenue by country</h3>

<p>I got curious about which countries most sales come from, so I drew a graph. I
combined the EU into one big group because there are a lot of European
countries and I do a lot of special case stuff for Europe (for tax issues etc). Here’s the graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/2022-graphs/revenue-by-country.png"/></p>

<p>In numbers, that’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>US: 59.63%</li>
<li>Europe: 14.71%</li>
<li>Canada: 6.62%</li>
<li>UK: 5.40%</li>
<li>Australia: 3.35%</li>
<li>Other: 10.29% (there are 117 countries in there)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mostly what this tells me is that 40% of revenue comes from outside of the US
– that’s a lot! I already offer free international shipping for large orders,
but it makes me want to figure out if it’s possible to improve the
international shipping situation for small orders too.</p>

<p>If we look at <strong>copies</strong> by country instead of revenue, this looks a bit
different – India and Brazil are both above Australia.</p>

<h3 id="more-country-data">more country data</h3>

<p>Here’s a more detailed list of revenue percentages per country, if you want to break
that “Europe” category above down more.</p>

<ul>
<li>US: 59.65%</li>
<li>Canada: 6.57%</li>
<li>United Kingdom: 5.43%</li>
<li>Germany: 4.81%</li>
<li>Australia: 3.34%</li>
<li>France: 1.85%</li>
<li>Netherlands: 1.58%</li>
<li>India: 1.41%</li>
<li>South Africa: 1.3%</li>
<li>Switzerland: 1.15%</li>
<li>Spain: 0.88%</li>
<li>Sweden: 0.87%</li>
<li>Brazil: 0.85%</li>
<li>New Zealand: 0.82%</li>
<li>Ireland: 0.7%</li>
<li>Singapore: 0.64%</li>
<li>Poland: 0.62%</li>
<li>Norway: 0.61%</li>
<li>Belgium: 0.5%</li>
<li>Italy: 0.43%</li>
<li>Finland: 0.42%</li>
<li>Austria: 0.39%</li>
<li>Denmark: 0.35%</li>
<li>Portugal: 0.34%</li>

<p>It’s fun to see so many countries on the list!</p>

<h3 id="how-were-the-graphs-generated">how were the graphs generated?</h3>

<p>One person asked how these graphs were generated. Basically I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>a “data warehouse”  (a small 100MB SQLite database)</li>
<li>a few scripts that use <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/">sqlite-utils</a> to import data from the Shopify / Gumroad APIs into the “warehouse”, that run in a cron job on my laptop</li>
<li>one view that combines my Gumroad sales and Shopify sales into a single table called <code>all_sales</code></li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> installation on my laptop where I can write SQL to make dashboards and graphs. Metabase is an open source BI tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup has worked great, I really like Metabase. All of the graphs are screenshots from Metabase.</p>

<h3 id="people">people</h3>

<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone who worked with me on the zines this year. I
couldn’t do it without them. We had:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan (we worked together on writing pretty much every weekday in 2022)</li>
<li>Dolly Lanuza (editing)</li>
<li>Gersande La Flèche (copy editing)</li>
<li>Vladimir Kašiković (cover illustration)</li>
<li>All of the beta readers who read and commented on early versions of the zines</li>
<li>The team at <a href="https://www.whitesquirrel.com/">White Squirrel</a> (fulfillment/shipping)</li>
<li>The team at <a href="https://www.girliepress.com/">Girlie Press</a> (printing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also my partner Kamal reads every zine before it’s published and he always
gives me great advice.</p>

<p>And of course I couldn’t do any of this without the readers who support
all of this work ❤.</p>
