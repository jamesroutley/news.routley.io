    <h1>Tell HN: Cloudflare Is Blocking Piped</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Lately I&#39;ve been getting frequent &#34;Error HTTP 451: Unavailable for Legal Reasons&#34; thrown by Cloudflare whilst using Piped (a YouTube alternate front end used by Nitter).</p><p>However these errors are generated... in error. The page links to a DMCA complaint which lists about a half dozen unrelated YouTube (and Piped) links, none of which are being accessed when the error is generated. In fact, viewing the video on YouTube plays back fine. There appears to be a glitch in Cloudflare&#39;s URL filtering. It&#39;s been happening so frequently that Piped is often unusable.</p></div></div></div>
