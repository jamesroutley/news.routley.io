WSS can be used to dynamically route signals between optical fibers based on wavelength. This greatly simplifies the allocation of capacity, giving the cable system the flexibility to add and reallocate it in different locations as needed. Here&amp;#8217;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branching Units are used to split a portion of the cable to land at a different location. Branching can be either at the fiber pair or wavelength level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;WSS splits the signal between the main trunk and the branch path based on its wavelength. This allows the signals from different paths to share the same fiber instead of installing dedicated fiber pairs for each link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cable system can then carve up the spectrum on an optical fiber pair and apply capacity to different locations using a single fiber pair, giving us the ability to redirect traffic on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;"><h3>Wavelength Selective Switching</h3></div></paragraph-block><!----><!----><!----></div></div></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div><div><!----><!----><div><div><div><!----><!----><paragraph-block _nghost-c77=""><div _ngcontent-c77="" innerhtml="&lt;p&gt;WSS for resilient and dynamic paths was first sketched on a Google whiteboard over four years ago.

For example, it can sometimes take weeks to repair a cable that has been physically damaged.

The typical agreement between providers involves something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/docs/overview#traffic_routing&#34;&gt;hot potato routing&lt;/a&gt;. An ISP hands off traffic to a downstream ISP as quickly as it can to minimize the amount of work that the ISP&#39;s network needs to do. This can mean more hops between networks and routers before traffic arrives at its destination. This kind of routing is available on Google Cloud with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Standard Tier network&lt;/a&gt;."><p>Though the risks are unavoidable, it’s important to remember that fiber optic cables are part of the network backbone of the internet that links data centers and thousands of computers together.

Andromeda enables you to deploy a global virtual private cloud network–with the aim of providing you both functional and performance isolation, as well as a high degree of security. With its global control plane, high-speed on-host virtual switch, and packet processors, you can burst thousands of stateful machines online in minutes or deploy firewall rules across thousands of machines immediately without chokepoints.
