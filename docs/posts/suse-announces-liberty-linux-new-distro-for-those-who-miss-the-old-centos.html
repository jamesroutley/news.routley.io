    <h1>SUSE announces Liberty Linux, new distro for those who miss the old CentOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Official details remain scant, but SUSE Liberty Linux is a new member of the growing tribe of CentOS Linux replacements. The new distro is a SUSE rebuild of CentOS 8, aimed at near-perfect RHEL 8 compatibility.</p>
<p>Since Red Hat <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/09/centos_red_hat/">killed off</a> CentOS Linux and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/10/centos_stream_9/">replaced it with CentOS Stream</a>, there&#39;s been renewed activity in the world of drop-in RHEL replacements. Now a new entrant has joined <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/16/alma_and_rocky_linux_release/">AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux</a>, as SUSE enters the fray with its own rebuild of Red Hat&#39;s freely-available source code.</p>
<p>As it has only appeared on SUSE&#39;s website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.suse.com/c/suse-liberty-linux/">over night</a>, we don&#39;t have a demo version at time of writing, so here is what we know so far.</p>

    

<p>At launch, Liberty Linux should be equivalent to the current Red Hat release – RHEL 8.5 – and compatible with packages from Red Hat&#39;s own <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/whats-epel-and-how-do-i-use-it">EPEL</a> repos.</p>

        


        

<p>SUSE is building the distro using its own <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service</a> tooling. All of the userland of the new distro will be built from Red Hat&#39;s official Source RPMs (SRPMs), with the exception of the kernel. That comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/25/suse_linux_enterprise_15/">SUSE&#39;s own SLE enterprise distribution</a>, currently on version 15 SP3, but compiled using a Red Hat-compatible configuration.</p>
<p>Since these days openSUSE&#39;s stable distro, Leap, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/04/opensuse_leaps_to_153_now/">is binary compatible with SLE</a>, that suggests that Liberty Linux will ship with kernel <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.opensuse.org/Features_15.3#Linux_kernel">5.3.18</a>. That&#39;s a lot newer than RHEL 8.5&#39;s kernel <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/3078#RHEL8">4.18</a>, so RHEL device drivers and kernel modules almost certainly won&#39;t work – but SLE ones should.</p>

        

<p>You can also only expect support for Red Hat&#39;s choice of filesystems, meaning XFS rather than SUSE&#39;s preferred Btrfs, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/08/16/red_hat_banishes_btrfs_from_rhel/">Red Hat doesn&#39;t support</a>. The new distro is also x86-64 only, with no support for POWER or Arm boxes.</p>

</ul>
<p>The new distro will be supported by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/03/03/novell_suse_manager/">company&#39;s fleet management tool, SUSE Manager</a> – because that already supports RHEL, as well as Ubuntu. Future updates should follow Red Hat&#39;s release cycle, rather than SUSE&#39;s.</p>
<p>The most important thing for SUSE&#39;s bottom line is that customers will be able to buy SUSE&#39;s commercial support for the new distro, right alongside its traditional offerings. The plan is for there to be a free download as well, but nothing is visible yet.</p>
<p>The idea is that, now that the End-of-Life for CentOS Linux 8 has passed, users have a new path forward, rather than switching distros – realistically, which includes to CentOS Stream. Previously, the options were to move to one of the relatively new community-supported distros – or to pay Red Hat, if your fingers weren&#39;t feeling too burned to reach into your wallet.</p>
<p>If you didn&#39;t want to deal with the IBM subsidiary, you could <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2006/10/25/oracle_red_hat_support/">jump ship to Oracle Linux</a>, if that didn&#39;t sound even less appealing. Now there&#39;s another way: a paid-for, fully-supported, RHEL-compatible enterprise distro, but from a long-established, Linux-centric vendor. ®</p>
