    <h1>Show HN: Interactive Smartlog VSCode Extension â€“ An Interactive Git GUI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div>
<p>Interactive Smartlog (ISL) is a graphical interface for working with your Git repo.</p>
<p>This extension, inspired by Meta&#39;s <a href="https://sapling-scm.com/docs/addons/isl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Interactive Smartlog</a> for the sapling source control system and adapted for Git, simplifies developers&#39; interaction with commit history. Designed to reduce the clutter from conventional log commands, it presents a refined view that highlights commits pertinent to the user&#39;s ongoing work.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-branches">Working with branches</h2>
<p>ISL shows you a tree of your commits and branches. Rather than typing branch names, you can directly click on branch tags to go to them. You can also add and remove branches directly from ISL.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/tnesbitt210/interactive-smartlog-issues/assets/10647853/a43a250e-eac5-479e-8944-0c01d4d6e5b9" alt="branches"/></p>
<h2 id="staging-and-managing-uncommitted-changes">Staging and Managing Uncommitted Changes</h2>
<p>ISL simplifies the process of managing your uncommitted changes directly from its interface. When you hover over files listed under uncommitted changes, ISL dynamically presents you with a set of actionable buttons, making it effortless to stage or unstage files for commit, revert modifications, or even remove newly added files from the file system without resorting to the command line.</p>

<h2 id="rebasing-and-resolving-conflicts">Rebasing and resolving conflicts</h2>
<p>You can hover over a branch to reveal a rebase button. This is the easiest way to re-arrange commits and manipulate stacks. When merge conflicts are detected, ISL will add to the list of uncommitted changes a list of unresolved conflicts.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/tnesbitt210/interactive-smartlog-issues/assets/10647853/9e9184ba-2448-4399-a990-c43bf7e270c3" alt="Rebase"/></p>
<p>After opening each file and resolving the conflict markers, you can click the checkmark next to each file in ISL to mark it as resolved. When all files have been resolved, you are free to continue the command that led to conflicts.</p>
<p>It is possible to hit merge conflicts multiple times, for example, when rebasing an entire stack of commits, as each commit is checked for conflicts one-by-one.</p>
<h2 id="running-commands">Running Commands</h2>
<p>Buttons in ISL run Git commands for you. For example, there is a <code>Pull</code> button at the top left to pull the latest changes from upstream.</p>
<p>While a command is running, you will see progress information at the bottom of the screen. This is also where you can see error messages if something goes wrong when running a command. ISL shows the arguments used to run commands, so you could replicate the behavior on the CLI if you want to.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/tnesbitt210/interactive-smartlog-issues/assets/10647853/84fb9c7a-1ef0-47e2-9ef8-0adf32a1e85c" alt="run-pull"/></p>
<p>Commands will automatically queue up to be run as you interact with the UI. ISL allows you to continue to perform additional actions while previous commands are running or queued up. This is kind of like chaining together commands on the CLI: <code>git checkout main &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; git checkout feature-branch</code></p>
<h2 id="making-commits-and-amending">Making commits and amending</h2>
<p>Changes to files in your working copy appear automatically in ISL, just like if you had run <code>git status</code>. The color and icon next to files shows you if a file was modified, added, or removed. The opacity of the filename indicates whether or not the file has been staged (via <code>git add</code>) for commit. You can click on files to open them.</p>
<p>Underneath your uncommitted changes, there&#39;s a <strong>Commit</strong> button and an <strong>Amend</strong> button. Clicking these buttons opens up the commit form sidebar on the right side, where you can write a detailed commit message. When you&#39;re satisfied with your message, the <em>Commit</em> and <em>Amend</em> buttons at the bottom right will let you create or amend your commit using your message.</p>

<h2 id="interacting-with-code-review">Interacting with code review</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ISL considers code review an integral part of the source control workflow. When making commits, you usually want to submit it for review. In the commit form on the right, ISL has a button to <em>Commit and Submit</em>, as well as <em>Amend and Submit</em>.</p>

<p>Commits in your tree which are associated with a GitHub Pull Request will show a badge underneath showing the status of that Pull Request. You can click this badge to open the Pull Request in GitHub.</p>
<p>This badge also shows the CI build status and how many comments there are.</p>
