    <h1>Emacs Speaks Statistics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div id="contents"><h2>What is ESS?</h2><p>Welcome to the home page of the ESS project</p>	      <p><i>Emacs Speaks Statistics</i> (ESS) is an add-on
	      package for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>. It is
	      designed to support editing of scripts and interaction
	      with various statistical analysis programs such as
	      R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata and OpenBUGS/JAGS. Although all users of these
	      statistical analysis programs are welcome to apply ESS,
	      advanced users or professionals who regularly work
	      with text-based statistical analysis scripts, with
	      various statistical languages/programs, or with
	      different operating systems might benefit from it the
	      most.

	      </p><p>

	      The rationale for developing ESS is that most
	      statistical analysis systems provide a more or less
	      sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI). However,
	      their full power is only available using their scripting
	      language. Furthermore, complex statistical analysis
	      projects require a high degree of automation and
	      documentation which can only be handled by creating
	      statistical analysis scripts. Unfortunately, many
	      statistics packages provide only weak text editor
	      functionality and show major differences between
	      them. Without a unified text editor user interface
	      additional effort is required from the user to cope with
	      limited functionality and with text editor differences.

	      </p><p>

	      Therefore, emacs editors and the ESS package provide the
	      following major features:

	      </p><ul>
		<li> Support for various operating systems </li>
		<li> Working environment based on emacs</li>
		<li> Support for various statistical analysis
		languages</li>
	      </ul><p>
	      ESS is freely available under the GNU General Public
	      License (GPL).  For further technical and legal
	      information please refer to the ESS Manual (cf. section
