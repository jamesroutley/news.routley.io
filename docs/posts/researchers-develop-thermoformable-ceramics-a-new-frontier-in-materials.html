</div><p>It was one of those happy accidents of science. Northeastern professor Randall Erb and Ph.D. student Jason Bice were working on a product for a university client—and wound up with an entirely new class of material.

                                                                                    <p>Their discovery of an all-ceramic that can be compression-molded into complex parts—an industry breakthrough—could transform the design and construction of heat-emitting electronics, including cellphones and other radio components.</p>
<p>&#34;Our research group&#39;s lives are very much situated at the bleeding edge of technology,&#34; says Erb, an associate professor of mechanical and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/industrial+engineering/" rel="tag">industrial engineering</a> who heads the DAPS Lab at Northeastern. &#34;Things break a lot, and every once in a while one of those breaks turns out to be good fortune.&#34;</p>
<p>Last July, Erb was in his Northeastern lab with Bice, who has since earned a mechanical engineering Ph.D. They were testing an experimental ceramic compound as part of a hypersonic project for an industrial partner when something appeared to go wrong.</p>
<p>&#34;We blasted it with a blowtorch and, while we were loading it, it unexpectedly deformed and fell out of the fixture,&#34; Erb says. &#34;We looked at the sample on the floor thinking that it was a failure.&#34;</p>
<p>Closer examination gave way to a revelation. </p>
<p>&#34;We realized it was perfectly intact,&#34; Erb says. &#34;It was just shaped differently.&#34;</p>

<p>Ceramics tend to fracture (or even explode) from thermal shock when subjected to extreme heat changes and mechanical loading. But their sample had deformed gracefully.</p>
<p>&#34;We tried it a few more times and realized that we could control the deformation,&#34; Erb says. &#34;And then we started compression-molding the material and found that it was a very fast process.&#34;</p>
<p>Its underlying microstructure uniquely allows the all-ceramic to quickly transmit heat and flow effectively during the molding process. The ceramic can be formed into exquisite geometries and exhibits impressive mechanical strength and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/thermal+conductivity/" rel="tag">thermal conductivity</a> at <a href="https://phys.org/tags/room+temperature/" rel="tag">room temperature</a>, says Erb, whose findings were recently published in <i>Advanced Materials</i>.</p>
<p>Erb and Bice are developing the product via their startup, Fourier LLC—named after the French mathematician Joseph Fourier, who studied heat flow in ceramics two centuries ago. Fourier has received a $50,000 Spark Fund award from Northeastern&#39;s Center for Research Innovation.</p>

                                                                                                
                                            
                                            
<p>&#34;It&#39;s unique: Thermoformable ceramics, from what we&#39;ve seen and read, don&#39;t really exist,&#34; Bice says. &#34;So it&#39;s a new frontier in materials.&#34;</p>
<p>The new product has the potential to introduce two industry improvements, starting with its efficiency as a heat conductor that can cool high-density electronics.</p>
<p>In general, cellphones and other electronics are fitted with a bulky layer of aluminum, which is necessary to draw heat away from the unit.</p>

<p>&#34;Our material can be less than a millimeter thick, which presents a low-profile solution,&#34; Bice says. &#34;It can be molded to conform to the surface that you&#39;re trying to cool.&#34;</p>
<p>The phononic crystal-based ceramic allows heat to flow without electron transport, says Erb. It doesn&#39;t interfere with radio frequencies (RF) of cellphones and other systems.</p>
<p>&#34;If you put an aluminum heatsink into an RF component, you&#39;ve basically introduced a series of antennae to interact with the RF signal,&#34; Erb says. &#34;Instead, we can put our boron nitride-based material in and around an RF component and it is essentially invisible to the RF signal.&#34;</p>
<p>The other improvement, says Erb, is that It can be form-fit directly to the electrical component. Echo St. Germain, a fifth-year mechanical engineering student at Northeastern who is serving as a ceramic researcher and R&amp;D engineer at Fourier, demonstrated the ceramic&#39;s non-Newtonian behavior by subjecting a clumpy slurry of it to vibration that is normal to the manufacturing process; it instantly liquified and organized the structure of the material. Such slurries are used to produce the moldable ceramics. </p>
<p>Erb and Bice believe they&#39;ll be able to form-fit the all-<a href="https://phys.org/tags/ceramic+materials/" rel="tag">ceramic materials</a> to all kinds of electrical components. The ceramic will be thinner, lighter and more efficient than the metals currently in use.</p>
<p>Bice has helped launch the startup from Munich, where his wife has started a new job.</p>
<p>&#34;Launching a company that is Boston-based while I&#39;m in Germany adds some interesting complications to things—but also opportunities,&#34; says Bice, who with Erb is engaging in customer discovery in both Europe and the U.S.
