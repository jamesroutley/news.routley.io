                    <p>If you’re ever near a relatively low flying airplane, you may have noticed that
it sounds like it’s in a different spot in the sky than where it actually is.
You can hear the loud engines, and your ears tell you it should be in one place,
but your eyes tell you it’s clearly well ahead of its noise.</p>
<p>It’s a funny visual trick, and, living near the Boston airport flight path, I
was thinking the other day about how it works.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-behind">What does it mean to be “behind”?</h3>
<p>The first key point is that the concept of the noise being “behind” the plane
relies on you, as an observer, trying to locate the plane. These planes are
generating noise from their engines constantly, and that noise spreads out from
the engines. From the plane’s point of view, there’s no real “behind” — the
engines are just constantly making noise<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Once you’re a little farther away from the plane, it gets a little more
interesting. Because noise and light travel at different speeds through air,
they can look like they’re out of sync. Let’s say you’re observing a flying
plane. At some instant, that plane’s loud engines make some noise, which travels
through the air like a ripple on a pond.</p>

<p>A small amount of time later, the sound wave will also have continued on its
journey. The plane will also have continued on its journey, and it will be
creating new sound waves. For now, let’s just think about the sound that the
plane created at that earlier point in time.</p>

<p>The plane is now some distance from where it was when it created that noise —
marked by the semi-transparent plane in the diagram. The sound hasn’t reached
you yet, but the effect is already in motion.</p>
<p>This will continue as the plane continues to fly.</p>
