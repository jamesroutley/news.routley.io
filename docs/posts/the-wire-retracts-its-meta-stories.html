    <h1>The Wire retracts its Meta stories</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Statement by </em>The Wire<em>, October 23, 2022</em></p>
<p>Earlier this week, <em>The Wire</em> announced its decision to conduct an internal review of its recent coverage of Meta, especially the sources and materials involved in our reporting.</p>
<p>Our investigation, which is ongoing, does not as yet allow us to take a conclusive view about the authenticity and bona fides of the sources with whom a member of our reporting team says he has been in touch over an extended period of time. However, certain discrepancies have emerged in the material used. These include the inability of our investigators to authenticate both the email purportedly sent from a*****@fb.com as well as the email purportedly received from Ujjwal Kumar (an expert cited in the reporting as having endorsed one of the findings, but who has, in fact, categorically denied sending such an email). As a result, <em>The Wire</em> believes it is appropriate to retract the stories.</p>
<p>We are still reviewing the entire matter, including the possibility that it was deliberately sought to misinform or deceive <em>The Wire</em>.</p>
<p>Lapses in editorial oversight are also being reviewed, as are editorial roles, so that failsafe protocols are put in place ensuring the accuracy of all source-based reporting.</p>
<p>Given the discrepancies that have come to our attention via our review so far, <em>The Wire</em> will also conduct a thorough review of previous reporting done by the technical team involved in our Meta coverage, and remove the stories from public view till that process is complete.</p>
<p><em>The Wire</em> was founded on a bond of trust with its readers and viewers. We intend to be true to our bond.</p>
<p><em>Note (10:50 am, October 23, 2022): The Wire is using the assistance of independent external experts to conduct its investigation into its Meta coverage.</em></p>
