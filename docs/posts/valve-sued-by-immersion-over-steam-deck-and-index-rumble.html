    <h1>Valve Sued by Immersion over Steam Deck and Index Rumble</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Consider it a rite of passage: Valve has finally become successful enough at building gaming hardware that it’s getting sued by Immersion Corporation.</p><p>Immersion — the haptic feedback company that’s purchased, developed, or otherwise accumulated so many patents on rumble tech that almost every major tech company has licensed or settled out of court — is now accusing Valve of infringing its patents with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">Steam Deck</a> handheld, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today">Valve Index</a> VR platform, its SteamVR software, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> among other titles. There’s no mention of Valve’s long-gone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">Steam Controller</a>, which also used lots of haptic feedback.</p><p>Immersion is asking for damages, royalties, and an injunction against Valve “from deploying, operating, maintaining, testing, and using the Accused Handheld Instrumentalities and Accused VR Instrumentalities”. </p><div><p>The company filed its complaint Monday in federal court, specifically the Western District of Washington, citing patents <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7336260B2/en?oq=7%2c336%2c260">7,336,260</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8749507B2/en?oq=8%2c749%2c507">8,749,507</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9430042B2/en?oq=+9%2c430%2c042">9,430,042</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9116546B2/en?oq=+9%2c116%2c546">9,116,546</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10627907B2/en?oq=10%2c627%2c907%2c">10,627,907</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10665067B2/en?oq=10%2c665%2c067">10,665,067</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11175738B2/en?oq=+11%2c175%2c738">11,175,738</a>. </p></div><div><div><p>Things that are certain: death, taxes, an Immersion lawsuit if you use rumble</p></div></div><p>Sony and Microsoft both license Immersion’s patent portfolio, following lawsuits and settlements. Apple, Google, Motorola and Fitbit settled as well. Meta is currently in the middle of <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txwdce/6:2022cv00541/1175657">its own Immersion lawsuit</a>, filed a year ago. Nintendo <a href="https://spong.com/article/8511/World-Exclusive-How-Nintendo-escaped-the-case-that-might-see-Sony-pay-Microsoft-for-every-PlayStation-product-sold">seemingly escaped a suit</a>, perhaps due to its own development of Rumble Pak tech for the Nintendo 64, but it also licenses Immersion tech now.</p><p>While you might be tempted to point out that Valve’s hardware uses a different form of rumble than the ones that Sony and co. got sued for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-03-01-sony-and-immersion-reach-settlement-feel-good-vibrations.html">back in the day</a> — linear resonant actuators (LRA), rather than an eccentrically swinging weight on a shaft — that didn’t stop Nintendo from <a href="https://ir.immersion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/immersion-and-nintendo-enter-agreement-bring-immersions">signing an agreement with Immersion</a> to bring its technology to the Switch, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+Switch+Teardown/78263#:~:text=Just%20to%20make%20sure%20we%20were%20getting%20our%20fill%20of%20secret%20sauce%2C%20we%20popped%20the%20top%20off%20the%20haptic%20feedback%20motor%2C%20a%20linear%20resonant%20actuator%20(LRA)%20that%20powers%20Switch%27s%20HD%20Rumble.">which uses LRAs as well</a>. So <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23680492/x-ray-vision-sony-dualsense-edition">does Sony’s DualSense</a>, for that matter. </p><p>And if you look at the individual patents I link above, they’re much more nuanced than hardware. I would be surprised if Valve <em>doesn’t</em> settle. </p><div><p>Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Steam Deck once again <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1658381782939574273">topped the Steam Weekly Top Sellers (by revenue)</a> this past week; while we don’t know sales numbers, it’s safe to say the handheld has sold well over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">a million units</a>. Valve is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">looking at an eventual successor</a>, too, and reportedly has a successor headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">codename “Deckard.”</a></p></div></div></div>
