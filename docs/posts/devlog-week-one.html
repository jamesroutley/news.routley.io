    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>It&#39;s week 3 of RC. My first week was spent testing out some ideas. I made a silly terminal spreadsheet thing, it
was neat, but not what I <em>wanted</em> to build.</p>
<p>Last week, I started to build some software that I think should exist.</p>
<p>I had some rough ideas to get started, but the hazy vision of what I&#39;m building is starting to become clear enough to
describe.</p>

<figcaption>A sort of &#34;Hello, world!&#34; program in this tool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The above video shows a &#34;development environment&#34; running a &#34;Hello, world&#34;-style program.</p>
<p>Each &#34;box&#34; is a dynamic programmable unit, which has both a &#34;value&#34; and a &#34;display&#34;.</p>
<p>The idea is that I want to see how it feels to have the lines blurred between &#34;editing&#34;, &#34;debugging&#34;, and &#34;running&#34;
code.</p>
<p>Here, the &#34;Hello, world&#34; message (in box <code>id_4</code>) is able to be controlled and manipulated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Box <code>id_0</code>, a text value, which says &#34;Hello&#34; or &#34;Howdy&#34; or whatever you&#39;d like at the beginning</li>
<li>Box <code>id_1</code>, an &#34;Excitement level&#34; button which increases the number of exclamation points each time you click it</li>
<li>Box <code>id_2</code> and <code>id_3</code>, two color pickers for the text &amp; background color</li>
<li>Box <code>id_5</code>, a &#34;Greeting&#34; text input, which lets you customize the second line text</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these boxes is like a variable declaration. Visually, they act a bit like a spreadsheet cell.</p>
<p>I want this tool to be something which can be used to build both the structure of an application <strong>and the
debugging/data-entry tools to modify that application</strong> all in the same place.</p>
<p>Right now, it&#39;s just a single &#34;module&#34; with one namespace. But I think it&#39;s possible for something like this to work for
projects both large and small.</p>
<a id="how-does-this-code-work?" href="#how-does-this-code-work%3F"><h3>How does this code work?</h3></a>
<p>Each piece of code is a &#34;live&#34; JavaScript (with JSX support) expression.</p>
<p>For reasons I don&#39;t have time to get into, each piece of code is also evaluated in a JavaScript sandbox (via
<a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a>) for more control over the execution environment.</p>
<p>Each piece of code (and each <code>calc()</code> function) exists in a big dependency graph. When a value changes, its dependencies
are marked as dirty in the graph and recalculated.</p>
<p>So each time <em>something</em> changes, everything that depends on that value is automatically recalculated. Just like a
spreadsheet!</p>

<p>The JSX itself is rendered via <a href="https://gooey.abstract.properties/">Gooey</a>, which means it behaves a bit differently
from other JSX libraries like React.</p>
<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://gooey.abstract.properties/get-started.html">a tutorial if you want to learn more</a>, but in short:</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s very early, very ugly software: it is confusing, unpolished, and not anywhere close to finished. Heck, the
menu says &#34;Put a menu here&#34;!</p>
<p>But! It cuts to the core and asks: <strong>What is an <u>extremely interactive</u> development environment?</strong></p>
<a id="where-is-this-going?" href="#where-is-this-going%3F"><h3>Where is this going?</h3></a>
<p>I want a development environment where everything is <em>extremely dynamic</em>.</p>

<p>So much of artâ€”so much of <strong>creation</strong> is discovery. And you can&#39;t discover anything if you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Twelve years ago, Brett Victor gave an extremely compelling talk called &#34;<a href="https://vimeo.com/906418692">Inventing on
Principle</a>&#34;. If you haven&#39;t seen it, watch the first 7 minutes, and if you&#39;re not convinced
it&#39;s worth finishing you can go and close this page.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about the idea of making development environments where the result of executing code feels more malleable and
connected to act of viewing and changing the code itself.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me is twelve years ago we had a demo showing some shockingly impressive development environments,
and we&#39;re all still programming in a glorified text editor.</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s sad and I&#39;d like to change that.</p>
