<p>Lately, some KDE projects have seen a revival, like <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/kde-is-finally-getting-a-native-virtual-machine-manager-called-karton/">Karton (the native virtual machine manager for KDE)</a> and the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/kde-iso-image-writer-is-finally-getting-a-ui-redesign-and-new-features/">improved ISO Image Writer.</a> Now, another abandoned KDE project, Plasma Bigscreen, is looking to return from the dead after long-time Plasma Mobile contributor Devin decided to spend a week overhauling the thing.</p>

<p>If you have not heard of it, <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-bigscreen/">Plasma Bigscreen</a> is a Plasma shell for televisions, with original support for the now-defunct Mycroft AI assistant. It used to provide a simple launcher for apps and custom &#34;Mycroft Skills&#34; before development stalled, causing most distributions to drop it.</p>

<p>The project was left behind during the big transition to Plasma 6 last year because no one had ported it in time for the megarelease. After a friend of his started poking at the code, <a href="https://espi.dev/posts/2025/07/plasma-bigscreen/">Devin stepped in</a> to tackle the much-needed work.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>He started by cleaning up the repository and then jumped into redesigning the interface, drawing inspiration from older Breeze mockups. The homescreen has been flattened, removing panel backgrounds. Here&#39;s a before-and-after comparison (click to enlarge):</p>

<p>For actually finding what you want to run, you are no longer stuck scrolling through a long list, as Devin added a new search view, searching using KRunner to quickly find and launch applications.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/07/1752595894_search.webp"><img alt="Search in the new Plasma Bigscreen" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/07/1752595894_search_story.webp"/></a></figure><p>The Settings application also got a complete redesign, adopting a simple two-pane look with a sidebar for categories. A lot of the settings modules (KCM) used hardcoded layouts, so Devin built a small component library for TV-focused UIs and ported everything over.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/07/1752595904_settings-bigscreen.webp"><img alt="The new Settings app" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/07/1752595904_settings-bigscreen_story.webp"/></a></figure><p>The rewritten Display KCM now uses the libkscreen backend, and the Wi-Fi and KDE Connect modules have been fixed and updated. Startup feedback for launching applications was also broken, and when you start up an application, a small animation now plays, similar to the one on Plasma Mobile.</p>

<p>For anyone who wants to test this out, you can do as Devin did by installing Plasma Bigscreen on a Raspberry Pi using postmarketOS, though you would have to compile it yourself or pull from the nightly repos to get the latest changes.</p>

<p>Applications like Kodi and <a href="https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube">VacuumTube (smart TV version of YouTube)</a> work well with remote navigation, and some games like <em>SuperTuxKart</em> are playable.</p>

The project is far from finished; it still needs an arrow-navigable virtual keyboard and a clearer long-term direction now that Mycroft is gone. Still, the goal is to get it back into the official Plasma release schedule, possibly for version 6.5.</p>
