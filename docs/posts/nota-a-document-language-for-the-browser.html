<span id="def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong> is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts.</span>
The goal of <a href="#def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong></a> is to <strong>bring documents into the 21st century.</strong></p><p>Documents contain a lot of structure — for example, &#34;<a href="#def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong></a>&#34; is a reference to a term defined in the preceding paragraph. <a href="#def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong></a> enables authors to <em>represent</em> that structure, which allows the reading medium (the browser) to <em>understand</em> that structure, which in turn empowers readers to <em>use</em> that structure. Try clicking on any &#34;<a href="#def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong></a>&#34; reference to see this idea in action. (Then try double-clicking!)</p><p>A <a href="#def-nota"><strong><span>Nota</span></strong></a> document compiles to a JavaScript program, meaning it&#39;s easy to:</p><ul><li>View documents on any device that has a web browser.</li>
<li>Use variables, functions, and data structures to simplify document writing.</li>
<li>Integrate with JavaScript libraries like <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a>, <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/penrose/penrose">Penrose</a>.</li>
<li>Support accessibility needs like screen readers.</li></ul></div></div></div><p><img src="https://nota-lang.org/flourish-Y5GEIXAN.jpg"/></p></div><section><p id="def-usage"><h2> Usage</h2></p><p>You can use Nota by installing the <code>nota</code> executable via the <code>@nota-lang/nota</code> package. You need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS ≥ 16</a> and <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">npm ≥ 6</a>.

To add Nota to your website or to learn more about Nota&#39;s architecture, read the <a href="https://nota-lang.org/integration.html">Integration guide</a>.</p><p><strong>Nota is a new and evolving technology.</strong> The architecture and API are continually changing. Tooling will have bugs and missing features. Documentation will be incomplete or incorrect. Right now, I am seeking early adopters that want to help make Nota the document language of the future.</p></section><section><p id="def-section-1"><h2> Why Nota?</h2></p><p>There are two main mediums for digital documents: PDFs and web pages. PDFs were designed to mirror physical documents, so they impose the real-world constraints of paper: page breaks, fixed width, and immutable styling. Web pages, by contrast, provides an essential dynamism. Web pages can be dynamically formatted: resized for phones, translated into other languages, colors changed for color-blindness. Web pages can be dynamically interactive: text prompted for more context, diagrams shifted for a new perspective, annotations added for posterity. Web pages are undeniably the future of digital documents.</p><p>But currently, that dynamism is only accessible to professional web developers. Existing document tools like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/">Scribble</a> can (for the most part) only generate static web pages. Nota&#39;s goal is to bridge that gap by providing authors with a document language that has a low floor, a high ceiling, and a smooth ramp up. </p><p>Part of this design is identifying components that are easy to use for authors and have high impact for the reader. For instance, the <code>@Definition</code> and <code>@Ref</code> components in the example above require a small amount of document annotation on the author&#39;s part. Then the Nota runtime can provide features like presenting a reference&#39;s definition in context via tooltip. Future Nota versions could include more advanced features like <q>find all references to this definition</q>.</p><p>For more on this design philosophy, you can read my original paper <a href="https://willcrichton.net/nota/">&#34;A New Medium for Communicating Research on Programming Languages&#34;</a>.</p></section></div></div></div></div>
