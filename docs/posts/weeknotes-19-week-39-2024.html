<li>sleepy but the weeknotes must flow, and also it&#39;s only 10pm</li>
<li>looking for resources for learning design, especially if they only use HTML/CSS/JS. open to figma and so on style courses if they are hands on or otherwise unmissable. if you have trusted ways of learning design sensibilities for newbies I&#39;d love to hear them!</li>
<li>carrying on with <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">CSS for JS Devs</a> + looking forward to Piccalli&#39;s <a href="https://piccalil.li/complete-css/">Complete CSS</a></li>
<li>carrying on with <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a>, the challenge from the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@struthless">Struthless</a> to create a thing for each letter of the alphabet. The original site is down still I think lol.</li>
<li>been doing a lot more tarot as i want to learn my deck and also have more grounding physical rituals in my life. I drew a card just now - the six of bells (bells in my deck, swords in the usual decks) - according to the guidebook it&#39;s about transitions and leaving behind bad experiences. neat.</li>
<li>i can&#39;t remember when i even watched it (definitely not last week) but suddenly remembered watching the <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">geoguessr</a> grand final on twitch, and realising i definitely find it more fun to watch sport and games (including chess) than actually playing them lol. i&#39;m not build for a life of adrenaline and strategy, i am built for <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1476101313/sweet-and-kind-womens-crop-top?click_key=86e6fe6821c4d7c74f48bcc4305553d514e04b11%3A1476101313&amp;click_sum=cda1653c&amp;ga_search_query=sweet&amp;ref=shop_items_search_2">softness and whimsy</a>.</li>
<li>&#34;need&#34; to/have set a Q4 goal to finish at least one sewing project. which requires organising my desk, which means organising my room. we must imagine sisyphus happy.</li>
<li>feeling very grateful for life as ever. feeling very overwhelmed by everything outside of my immediate control, as ever. life on earth is a group project and as beautiful as that is I still am annoyed that we&#39;re all getting the same grade at the end of this.</li>
<li>constantly annoyed by anti-consumerist messaging that hasn&#39;t addressed the key lie at the base; that individual purchasing power is going to buy us out of the climate crisis/fast fashion/poverty/<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-QTjX8oFOs/">our collective graves</a>. it just isn&#39;t possible for you on your own to budget or buy your way out of.</li>
<li>my word for the quarter is persist.</li>
<li>my therapist was laughing at me planning in quarters as she thought i was referring to financial quarters. luckily the brain worms haven&#39;t got me that thoroughly yet and it&#39;s just cos it feels nice and seasonal and 3 months is a good chunk of time.</li>
