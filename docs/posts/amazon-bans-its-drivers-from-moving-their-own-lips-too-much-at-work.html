At the morning safety briefing, we go through all the normal “remember to stop at stop signs” stuff, then they tell us “Amazon is trying to really cut down on distracted driving, so we can’t be singing along to the radio because the camera will ding you for distracted driving.” When people understandably started getting upset, we were told that “a lot of mouth movement will set off the camera” and that we “needed to keep mouth movement to a minimum”.</p><p>You really think you can tell me what I can do with my body?
