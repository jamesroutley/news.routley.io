    <div><p>June is probably the most predictable birding month of the year here. Our breeding birds are generally easy to see, we get sporadic visits from other birds which breed within a few miles of here, and then towards the end of the month we usually start to see the first returning birds of ‘autumn’. There are always hopes of a more unusual passage migrant towards the end of June but these hopes are more often than not in vain.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><div><p><strong>Common terns (above)</strong> have been putting on a good show here since the start of May and they were seen almost every day through June, with a high count of eight birds being seen on the 29<sup>th</sup>. These birds are probably from the Walthamstow breeding colony. <strong>Little egrets</strong>, probably also from a breeding population at Walthamstow Wetlands, were seen regularly, though mostly only a single bird at a time. The favoured spot was around the water inlet.</p>
<p>The first returning <strong>shoveler </strong>was seen on the 15<sup>th</sup>, with a<strong> teal</strong> appearing a day later. One or two of each species was then seen occasionally for the rest of the month. Interestingly when males were seen, shoveler were in eclipse plumage whilst teal were still in breeding plumage. It is difficult to keep track of our breeding ducks as there are plenty of places to hide, and the only brood of ducks other than mallards seen so far this year were a family of <strong>pochard</strong> seen on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>Two <strong>mistle thrushes</strong> seen on the 29<sup>th</sup> were probably juveniles resulting from breeding in one of the local parks, whilst <strong>peregrines</strong> which became a regular feature around mid-month, particularly on the cranes of the nearby building site, were of unknown origin.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p><strong>Reed warblers (above)</strong> breed here in good numbers and juveniles from first broods could be seen and heard all around the reed-bed during June. It is common to see adult birds foraging for insects in trees and bushes everywhere on site, and it can be a surprise when a small bird at the top of an Oak along the woodland trail turns out to be a reed warbler! Sedge warblers (below) are less common but we probably had two breeding pairs, with young being seen in the reed-bed and particularly in trees along the New River towards the end of the month.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Reed buntings (below) were also seen all month, with juveniles being seen but also a regular singing male. Two pairs probably bred here this year.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The total number of bird species seen here in June 2022 was 58, a low monthly total but not far short of a typical June total.</p></div>
