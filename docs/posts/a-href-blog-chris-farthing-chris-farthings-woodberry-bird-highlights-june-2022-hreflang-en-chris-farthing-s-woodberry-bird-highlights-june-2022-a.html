          <div><div><p><strong>Common terns (above)</strong> have been putting on a good show here since the start of May and they were seen almost every day through June, with a high count of eight birds being seen on the 29<sup>th</sup>. These birds are probably from the Walthamstow breeding colony. <strong>Little egrets</strong>, probably also from a breeding population at Walthamstow Wetlands, were seen regularly, though mostly only a single bird at a time. The favoured spot was around the water inlet.</p>
<p>The first returning <strong>shoveler </strong>was seen on the 15<sup>th</sup>, with a<strong> teal</strong> appearing a day later. One or two of each species was then seen occasionally for the rest of the month. Interestingly when males were seen, shoveler were in eclipse plumage whilst teal were still in breeding plumage. It is difficult to keep track of our breeding ducks as there are plenty of places to hide, and the only brood of ducks other than mallards seen so far this year were a family of <strong>pochard</strong> seen on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>Two <strong>mistle thrushes</strong> seen on the 29<sup>th</sup> were probably juveniles resulting from breeding in one of the local parks, whilst <strong>peregrines</strong> which became a regular feature around mid-month, particularly on the cranes of the nearby building site, were of unknown origin.</p>
