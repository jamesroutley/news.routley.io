    <h1>Jeep software update bricks vehicles, leaves owners stranded</h1>

        <p>A software update to Jeep 4xE models caused major malfunctions over the weekend – leaving many owners stranded and some in danger after their power failed.</p><p>The culprit appears to have been a buggy &#34;over the air&#34; (OTA) software update to the company’s <a href="https://www.driveuconnect.com/support/software-update.html?ref=thestack.technology" rel="noreferrer"><em>uconnect</em></a> software on Friday October 10, which “bricked” vehicles if owners installed it.</p><p>A Jeep customer support representative on a 4XE forum <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10-10-2025.8078/?nested_view=1&amp;post_id=103140&amp;ref=thestack.technology#post-103140"><u>posted</u></a> Saturday: “Please exercise extreme caution this evening if you have completed the update. If you have NOT completed the update and see the pop-up, please continue deferring...&#34;</p><p>Posting as “Kori”, they told Jeep customers on the forum that the issue was “a telematics module box update” – and later added that the software update was cancelled the same day. </p><p>But not before multiple users across the US had updated their vehicles and suffered the immediate consequences.</p><h3 id="jeep-software-update-issue">Jeep software update issue</h3><p>Some described losing power abruptly whilst driving in the wake of the update. One Jeep owner, Kerry Hollis, who works in IT infrastructure at Wells Fargo, told <a href="https://www.thestack.technology/" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Stack</em></a>: “This was a software change that obviously wasn’t tested thoroughly and was dangerous and could have had life safety implications. </p><p>“Fortunately, for me, I lost propulsion while going at low speed in my neighborhood, so I was able to pull over, restart and limp back to my home. I’ve read stories of others that weren’t in that situation, going at highway speeds, and in traffic...</p><p>&#34;Stellantis reacted quickly but it shouldn’t have happened...&#34;</p><p>He added: It’s concerning... that most auto manufacturers and new vehicles even have the ability to be disabled by the manufacturer or even worse, someone with a malicious intent.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/2025/10/RM025_040PM-1-.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1273" srcset="https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/RM025_040PM-1-.jpg 600w, https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/RM025_040PM-1-.jpg 1000w, https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/RM025_040PM-1-.jpg 1600w, https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/2025/10/RM025_040PM-1-.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Jeep describes unconnect as software that “<em>gives you access to the latest available features and enhancements. Updates can be performed over any password-protected Wi-Fi network. Select vehicles with connected service capabilities are eligible for over-the-air updates,</em>” it adds. (The software can also be found in other marques from parent company Stellantis, but it appears only Jeep brands were affected by this update.)</p><h3 id="see-also-ford-eyes-1b-in-software-sales">See also: <a href="https://www.thestack.technology/fords-software-sales/#see-also-why-time-series-data-could-drive-an-automotive-evolution">Ford eyes $1B in software sales</a></h3><p>Another owner, Stephen Gutowski, owner of the reload.com news site, told <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stackpublishing?ref=thestack.technology" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Stack</em></a>: “On Friday night, my 2024 Jeep Wrangler Willys 4xe asked me to run an update when I got back home. I clicked ‘yes’ without really thinking about it. </p><p>&#34;What&#39;s the worst that could happen, right? </p><p>He added: “Well, the next morning, I saw posts on the 4xe Facebook group I&#39;m in that the update essentially bricked the 2024 Wranglers. I&#39;m glad I saw that before I went out to my Jeep because I was prepared for something to maybe be wrong and did a test drive in my parking lot …”</p><p>“Sure enough, after driving maybe a half mile around my parking lot, the Jeep killed the gas and told me to put it in park. The dash lit up like a Christmas tree. The check engine light came on. Worse, it refused to go back into drive. It was just dead where it sat… I was [eventually] able to limp it back to my parking spot. I called my local dealership and they said it was a nationwide issue on at least the 2024 Wrangler 4xes…”</p><h3 id="pretty-scary">&#34;Pretty scary&#34;</h3><p>Gutowski added: “On Sunday morning I saw Jeep&#39;s messages in the 4xe forum and the fix was ota’d to my Jeep. So, I let my car run for 15 minutes and did two power cycles. The check engine light went away, and everything seemed to be working normally again. Took it for a test drive around the neighborhood, and it drove like nothing ever happened.”</p><p>“It seems like it could have been extremely dangerous if I hadn&#39;t read about the problem before taking my car out on the road… imagine if it went dead on the highway. Pretty scary. Honestly, this feels like more of a modern car problem.  I doubt this will be the last car to get bricked by an ota update. At least they were able to fix it with an ota update in a day.”</p><p>Posting on 4XE Forums, another Jeep owner going by “EmiK” wrote: “I just had to have my 2024 4XE towed to the dealer because it was having problems recognizing the gears, the CEL [check engine light] came on and it wouldn&#39;t drive. </p><p>&#34;The dealer called me and said 4 others came in <em>this hour.”</em></p><p>Another angry customer posted on the 4XE forum that “your negligence could have gotten me and a thousand others killed. </p><blockquote><em>“Wranglers are stopping dead on the <strong>HIGHWAY. </strong>the highway where most of us are doing 60+mph. dealerships are charging us over $200 for this. i am a marine corps wife, and we haven’t gotten paid due to the shutdown, so i can’t even afford to have them “look” at my car—plus, why should we, as owners, pay for your mess up? i would sue if i was in the position to do so. this lazy and unfinished update is leaving thousands of us stranded with a brick instead of a car. if someone dies from this, expect a damn big lawsuit—i’d be joining that.”</em></blockquote><p><em>The Stack</em> could not reach a Jeep dealership for comment.We have also contacted Jeep owner Stellantis for a comment.</p><h3 id="dont-push-to-production-on-a-friday">Don&#39;t push to production on a Friday...</h3><p>The company may want to closely read CrowdStrike’s <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/falcon-content-update-preliminary-post-incident-report/?ref=thestack.technology"><u>post-mortem</u></a> after a buggy software update from the cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.thestack.technology/fuzzing-and-staggering-crowdstrike-post-mortem-suggests-testing-lessons-learned-the-hard-way/"><u>bricked over eight million</u></a> Windows computers globally in July 2024, causing cancelled flights, hospital outages and banking errors, among other issues. </p><p>CrowdStrike promised after the incident to roll out stronger software release controls/improve quality assurance. Among other pledges, it said it would start to “implement a staggered deployment strategy… in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment…”*</p><p><em>*Editor&#39;s note: This is a fairly basic control and it is striking that so many organisations no longer seem to do this in their rush to push out software updates. </em></p><p><strong><em>Affected?
