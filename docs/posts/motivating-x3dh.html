    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> uses a protocol called &#34;<a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/">Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman</a>&#34; (X3DH) for key agreement<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. This essentially takes standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>, and enables it to be used where one party may be offline while they&#39;re receiving a message, while providing forward secrecy.</p>

<p>While the paper clearly explains how to implement X3DH, the <em>why</em> is slightly less clear. In this post, I&#39;ll briefly explain how X3DH works, then investigate what security property each of the steps involved is aimed at providing, and why particular choices were made around the signature algorithm.</p>

<h2>A quick summary of X3DH</h2>

<p>(This summary requires a understanding of Diffie-Hellman key exchange — if you are unfamiliar or need a refresher, take a look at this footnote<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>)</p>

<p>In X3DH, the receiving party (who may be offline when they receive a message) uploads the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519">Curve2519</a> public keys to a server:</p>

<ul>
<li>A identity key (<code>IK_r</code>)</li>
<li>A &#34;signed prekey&#34; (<code>SPK</code>)</li>
<li>A signature for <code>SPK</code> with <code>IK_r</code></li>
<li>A number of &#34;one-time prekeys&#34; (<code>OPK1</code>, <code>OPK2</code>, …)</li>
</ul>

<p>When the sending party wants to send a message, they download from the server <code>IK</code>, <code>SPK</code>, the signature for <code>SPK</code>, and one of the one-time prekeys (which the server deletes and does not use for future runs).</p>

<p>The sender has two keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>A long-term identity key (<code>IK_s</code>)</li>
<li>A ephemeral key used only for a single X3DH handshake (<code>EK</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>After validating the <code>SPK</code> signature is correct, the sender can generate a shared secret by invoking the Diffie-Hellman function four times:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>DH(IK_s, SPK)</code></li>
<li><code>DH(EK,   IK_r)</code></li>
<li><code>DH(EK,   SPK)</code></li>
<li><code>DH(EK,   OPKn)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The outputs of these functions are concatenated and run through a key derivation function to generate a shared secret. If the server has run out of <code>OPK</code>s, only the first three functions are performed, to the slight detriment of the forward-secrecy properties. This image summarizes the Diffie-Hellman functions that are preformed:</p>

<h2>Why, though?</h2>

<p>This is a lot of stuff, and it&#39;s understandable to ask what it&#39;s all doing. There are two basic properties that we want our key exchange to provide:</p>

<p>The first is &#34;forward secrecy&#34; — that is, if the private keys are compromised after the X3DH handshake has been completed, a attacker will not be able to decrypt the message. This is why we need the ephemeral key, and why we don&#39;t just do standard Diffie-Hellman with the identity keys and call it a day.</p>

<p>The second is &#34;mutual authentication&#34; — that is, both of the parties know the identity of the other party that they&#39;re talking to, and know that they are not being impersonated. This is why we want long-term identity keys — it&#39;s much simpler to prove ownership of a single long-term key than it is one of many ephemeral keys.</p>

<p>So, we want to use long-term keys for mutual authentication, and ephemeral keys for forward secrecy, and we can understand the one-time prekey as the ephemeral key for the receiving side. What&#39;s the signed prekey doing, then? It primarily serves as a backup, in case the server runs out of one-time prekeys. The signed prekey is replaced every time the client uploads new one-time prekeys, and thus is is more ephemeral than the identity key (which hangs around indefinitely), but not so ephemeral that we might run out.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s the explanation for <em>why</em> we have each of these keys. Once we have that, it&#39;s actually pretty clear why we do the set of Diffie-Hellman operations we do. If we look at the case without a one-time prekey, it&#39;s very clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to do a exchange between the ephemeral keys (<code>EK</code> and <code>SPK</code>), in order to get forward secrecy.</li>
<li>We need to involve <code>IK_s</code> and <code>IK_r</code>, to provide mutual authentication.</li>
<li>We don&#39;t want to use <code>DH(IK_s, IK_r)</code>, because doing so does not provide any forward secrecy, and not doing so provides better deniability (since anyone could forge a convincing looking transcript of a X3DH session without knowing either of the identity private keys, by generating all the ephemeral keys themselves)</li>
</ul>

<p>With those constraints, we end up with the only thing we can have:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.wesleyac.com/img/motivating-x3dh/no_opk.svg"/></p>

<p>However, the case where we do have a one-time prekey offers us more options. In particular, we could swap the roles of <code>SPK</code> and <code>OPK</code>, giving use either of these:</p>

<img src="https://blog.wesleyac.com/img/motivating-x3dh/all.svg"/>
<img src="https://blog.wesleyac.com/img/motivating-x3dh/spk_opk_swap.svg"/>
</center>

<p>Signal chooses to take the somewhat simpler approach of keeping the role of <code>SPK</code> the same regardless of whether we have a <code>OPK</code>, just adding in <code>DH(EK, OPK)</code> in the case where <code>OPK</code> is available. While this has slightly worse forward secrecy properties on its own (the attacker can crack more of the DH outputs if they capture the <code>SPK</code> private key), this doesn&#39;t really matter, because the DH outputs are fed through a KDF anyways, which necessitates cracking all the DH outputs to capture the key<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>On signatures</h2>

<p>One thing we haven&#39;t talked about is the reason that the signature of <code>SPK</code> is needed. Here&#39;s the attack that&#39;s intended to prevent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alice tries to send a message to Bob.</li>
<li>The server replies with Bob&#39;s <code>IK</code>, but values of <code>SPK</code> and <code>OPK</code> that it generated for itself, and thus knows the private keys for.</li>
<li>Alice sends a message. The server doesn&#39;t relay this to Bob (since he wouldn&#39;t be able to decrypt it), but instead holds on to it.</li>
<li>Later, the attacker compromises Bob&#39;s <code>IK</code> private key. Now they can calculate the shared secret, and read the initial message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Signing the <code>SPK</code> is a sensible way to prevent this. However, there are a few questions to ask about the particular way in which it&#39;s implemented in X3DH. Firstly: is it safe? Reusing keys for multiple purposes is can lead to disastrous results, and it&#39;s important to rigorously prove that any such construction is safe. My understanding is that most cryptographers believed this construction to be safe, but it was only <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/509.pdf">relatively recently that a actual proof for these specific algorithms was provided</a> (and even then, I&#39;m not entirely sure that the construction in that paper applies to X3DH, although I&#39;d be quite surprised if it didn&#39;t).</p>

<p>The second question relates to how one even goes about using the same keypair for Diffie-Hellman and EdDSA signing. The <a href="https://github.com/netfoundry/libsodium-doc/tree/master/quickstart#how-can-i-sign-and-encrypt-using-the-same-key-pair">standard approach</a> (other than &#34;don&#39;t do that&#34;, which is generally recommended) is to take a EdDSA key (which is a point on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Edwards_curve">Twisted Edwards curve</a>) and convert it into X25519 key (which is a point on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve">Montgomery curve</a>). This is convenient, since a point on a Twisted Edwards curve maps to a single point on Montgomery curve, but notably, a point on a Montgomery curve maps to <strong>two</strong> points on a Twisted Edwards curve<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Signal chooses to solve this by <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/">defining a scheme called XEdDSA</a>, which specifies which of the two possible points to use.</p>

<p>One has to ask, though, why go through the effort, when you could just start with a Twisted Edwards curve? My guess is that the signature step wasn&#39;t added until Signal was already being deployed, so using Montgomery curves for identity would be a backwards incompatible change. My understanding it that Matrix uses Twisted Edwards curves from the start in their implementation of X3DH, which I think is quite sensible, given that they had the luxury of designing their protocol with Signal&#39;s hindsight.</p>

<p>This still raises the question of why they chose to use the same key at all — it&#39;s easy to imagine a system where the identity key is exclusively used for signing, and a separate (signed) key-exchange key is used. Given recent proofs of the security of composing EdDSA and X25519, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any advantage to doing so at this point, and Signal probably didn&#39;t go down this path for the same reason that they needed to invent XEdDSA in the first place — they already had a bunch of Montgomery keys deployed, and didn&#39;t want to switch them out for Twisted Edwards keys.</p>
