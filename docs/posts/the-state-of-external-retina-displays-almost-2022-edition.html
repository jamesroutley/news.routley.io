    <h1>The State of External Retina Displays, [Almost] 2022 Edition</h1>

<p>In the middle of 2017 — roughly four and a half years ago — I went
on a search for a monitor to pair with my MacBook Pro while I was at work. I
wanted something that was “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display">retina</a>” quality — which means <em>roughly</em>
220 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density">PPI</a>.</p>
<p>While not terribly scientific, the rules of thumb I landed on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more than 24&#34; at 4K</li>
<li>No more than 27&#34; at 5K</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 2017 — one thousand six hundred and sixty five days ago, as
I write this — I <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2017/5/17/retina-monitors">compiled a list of options</a>. At the time there
were five. Two Dells, one run-of-the-mill LG, and the two LG UltraFine monitors.</p>
<h2>The Lineup</h2>
<p>1665 days later, let me revise my findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Budget Option</strong>: <a href="https://amzn.to/31DsTvo">LG 24UD58-B 24&#34; 4K Monitor</a> — ~$300</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderate Option</strong>: <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMUA2VC/A/lg-ultrafine-4k-display">LG UltraFine 4K</a> — ~$700</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deluxe Option</strong>: <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMUB2LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display">LG UltraFine 5K</a> — ~$1300</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ridiculous Option</strong>: <a href="https://amzn.to/3dsapR9">Apple Pro Display XDR</a> — ~$5000 <em>without a stand</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is the entire lineup. That’s it. Four options. Three of which existed
1665 days ago.</p>
<p><strong>In [effectively] 2022, there are <span>four</span>
options for retina-quality monitors to attach to your Mac.</strong></p>
<p>If there are others, <strong>please</strong> let me know, as I’d love to share them. I know
that others have existed at some time in the past — like the Dells I featured
in the first version of this post — but they’ve been discontinued and/or are
not readily available here in the States.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Last month I bought a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-gray-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-1tb">14&#34; MacBook Pro equipped with a M1 Max</a>. This machine
is as fast as my iMac Pro, but considerably more portable. The battery life is by
no means infinite, but it’s enough to go work without power for several hours without
stressing. MagSafe is back — <em>finally</em> — and the keyboard is both reliable
and excellent. I have a HDMI port for when I travel, and an SD card reader. The M1 Pro
and Max MacBook Pros are possibly the best machines Apple has released since I’ve
been observing the company, for about fifteen years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the display on this machine is <strong>phenomenal</strong>. My buddy Jason Snell in
particular has been <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/10/review-14-inch-macbook-pro-2021/">banging this drum for a while</a>: on any other machine, the
displays alone would be the star of the show. They’re “true” pixel-doubled retina,
they have wide color gamut, they’re backlit by mini-LED, and they sport a fast
refresh rate of 120 Hz. They’re nearly perfect.</p>
<p>Why can’t we have this in an external monitor?</p>
<p>Granted, refreshing roughly 15 million pixels 120 times per second requires an
immense amount of data/bandwidth, so maybe that isn’t possible. However, everything
else about these panels <strong>should</strong> be possible in an external monitor. Even if we
have to <em>suffer</em> through a <em>pedestrian</em> 60 Hz. Why can’t we have an Apple-produced
5K screen that has mini-LED and wide color?</p>
<p><strong>Why can’t we have an option between the unreliable $1300 LG 5K and the $5000+ XDR?</strong></p>
<p>Over the last year or two, Apple has been doing a <em>phenomenal</em> job of filling the holes
in their product line. For my money, the completely embarrasing monitor situation
is the lowest-hanging fruit. By a mile.</p>
<p>Take my money, Apple. Give me a monitor made for professionals that <strong>don’t</strong> do video
editing for a living. <strong>Please</strong>.</p>
