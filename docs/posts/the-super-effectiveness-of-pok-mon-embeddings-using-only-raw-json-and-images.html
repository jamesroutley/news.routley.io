    <h1>The super effectiveness of Pokémon embeddings using only raw JSON and images</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">Embeddings</a> are one of the most useful but unfortunately underdiscussed concepts in the artificial intelligence space relative to the modern generative AI gigahype. Embeddings are a set of hundreds of numbers which uniquely correspond to a given object that define its dimensionality, nowadays in a multiple of 128 such as 384D, 768D, or even 1536D. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The larger the embeddings, the more “information” and distinctiveness each can contain, in theory. These embeddings can be used as-is for traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> problems with your favorite statistical modeling library, but what’s really useful about these embeddings is that if you can find the minimum mathematical distance between a given query embedding and another set of embeddings, you can then find which is the most similar: extremely useful for many real-world use cases such as search.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/embedding_demo_hu72b08dedaa2bf487caae0984d6e708fe_38131_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/embedding_demo_hu72b08dedaa2bf487caae0984d6e708fe_38131_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/embedding_demo_hu72b08dedaa2bf487caae0984d6e708fe_38131_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/embedding_demo.png 1178w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/embedding_demo.png" alt="An example sentence embedding generated using Sentence Transformers: this embedding is 384D."/><figcaption><p>An example sentence embedding generated using Sentence Transformers: this embedding is 384D.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Although any kind of object can be represented by an embedding, text is the classical use case for embeddings, popularized with the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">paper</a> which along with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546">later work</a> showed that word embeddings could be used to calculate relationships such as man + women - king = queen. You could then, for example, create a sentence embedding by averaging all of its word embeddings. This actually works, although this naive averaging does not take word position and punctuation into account, both of which are critically important in identifying context for a given text.</p><p>Deep learning then entered the picture and it was eventually discovered that large language models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a> can return embeddings as an emergent behavior. Unlike the word averaging above, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)">transformers</a>-based LLMs can account for positional relationships more robustly thanks to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)">attention mechanisms</a>, and, due to their more advanced model input <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-tokenizers-shape-ai-understanding/">tokenization</a> strategies than just words, can also better incorporate punctuation. One very popular Python library for creating embeddings using LLMs easily is <a href="https://sbert.net">Sentence Transformers</a>, especially with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> model (<a href="https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&amp;sort=downloads">30 million downloads monthly</a>!) which balances embedding encoding speed and robustness with its 384D embeddings.</p><p>How well can these embeddings models work beyond just normal sentences? Can they encode larger bodies of text into a consistent space? The context length of <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> is 512 tokens, which can only fit a couple paragraphs of text, but newer LLMs have much higher context lengths.</p><p>I recalled one of my early projects as an aspiring data scientist: creating <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/pokemon-3d">Pokémon vectors</a> by <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/pokemon-3d/blob/master/pokemon_spark_pca.ipynb">manually transforming Pokémon metadata</a> for each Pokémon, such as their base stats, type(s), moves, abilities, and miscellaneous attributes such as color, shape, and habitat. After that, I was able to cluster them.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/cluster_hua96b3b898877df44d2250cab3401321f_244414_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/cluster.png 676w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/cluster.png" alt="3D projection of my Pokémon vectors back in 2016: the colors are Pokémon types, and the methodology seemed to favor clustering by them."/><figcaption><p>3D projection of my Pokémon vectors back in 2016: the colors are Pokémon types, and the methodology seemed to favor clustering by them.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Those familar with Pokémon know that’s just scratching the surface: there’s even more metadata such as the rich text data such as a Pokémon’s Pokédex entries and the exact locations where they can be encountered, both of which tell a lot about a given Pokémon. At the time, there was no efficient LLM to encode all of that extra metadata.</p><p>Why not try to encode all Pokémon metadata using a text embedding model and see what happens? Will we be able to identify the most “similar” Pokémon? What is a “similar” Pokémon anyways? Can we find the <em>weirdest</em> Pokémon by the most dissimilar? Can we encode other Pokémon data such as images? Let’s find out!</p><h2 id="how-embeddings-are-generated-using-llms">How Embeddings Are Generated Using LLMs</h2><p>First, some relevant technical background on how LLMs can be used to create embeddings since there’s surprisingly a lot of confusion about how they work other than the SEO-oriented “embeddings are for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-vector-database/">vector databases</a>”.</p><p>Modern embedding models are commonly trained through one of two ways. The first way is through emergent behavior while training an LLM normally: as LLMs need to determine a latent space before passing the output to a classification head such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer">GPT</a>’s next-token prediction, taking the last layer (“hidden state”) of a model and averaging across the positional axis results in an embedding with the same dimensionality as the hidden state. LLMs have to learn how to uniquely represent text in a common latent space, so this is approach is natural. The second way is to train a model to output the embeddings directly: in this case, the training process typically uses <a href="https://encord.com/blog/guide-to-contrastive-learning/">contrastive learning</a> to minimize the semantic distance between the generated embeddings of a pair of known text documents, and maximize the difference between a dissimilar pair. Both of these techniques can be used together of course: pretrain a LLM on a large body of text, then finetune it with contrastive learning.</p><p>Embeddings models get the benefits of all the research invested into improving LLMs for generative AI, such as inference speed and longer context windows. Normally it requires a quadratic increase in computation to use those larger context windows (e.g. a 2<em>x</em> increase in input length requires 4<em>x</em> more computation), but thanks to <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/conceptual/flash_attention">FlashAttention</a> and <a href="https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/">rotary positional embeddings,</a> it’s now feasible to train models with massively-large context windows without a massive datacenter and then run those models on consumer hardware.</p><p>Ever since 2022, <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a> had the text embedding model <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-and-improved-embedding-model/">text-embedding-ada-002</a> behind a paid API with the largest context window of 8,192 tokens: a substantial increase over <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code>’s 512 limit, and no other open-source model could compete. That is until February 2024, when <a href="https://www.nomic.ai">Nomic AI</a> released <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1">nomic-embed-text-v1</a>, a fully open-source embeddings model with a 8,192 context window and a permissive <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache license</a>, and quickly followed up with <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5">nomic-embed-text-v1.5</a>. In academic benchmarks, this free model performed even better than OpenAI’s paid embedding model <a href="https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1">thanks to its training regimen</a> that uses both embedding model training tricks described above. That, along with its long context window, caused it to become another one of the most downloaded open-source embedding models (~10 million downloads per month).</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/nomic_embeddings_demo_hu6a8ced586590047ac9174f2aee14b55b_102422_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/nomic_embeddings_demo_hu6a8ced586590047ac9174f2aee14b55b_102422_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/nomic_embeddings_demo_hu6a8ced586590047ac9174f2aee14b55b_102422_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/nomic_embeddings_demo.png 1340w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/nomic_embeddings_demo.png" alt="A sentence embedding generated using nomic-embed-text-v1.5 adapted from the official example: this is a lower-level interface than Sentence Transformers (Hugging Face transformers and PyTorch) but is more clear as to what is going on. mean_pooling() uses an atypical attention-masked averaging that is theoretically better for small inputs than averaging the entire last hidden state."/><figcaption><p>A sentence embedding generated using <code>nomic-embed-text-v1.5</code> adapted from the official example: this is a lower-level interface than Sentence Transformers (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index">Hugging Face transformers</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a>) but is more clear as to what is going on. <code>mean_pooling()</code> uses an atypical attention-masked averaging that is theoretically better for small inputs than averaging the entire last hidden state.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The <code>F.normalize()</code> function is a popular pipeline innovation in finding similar embeddings efficiently. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector">unit normalized</a> vector has a vector length summing to 1.

Nintendo certainly won’t have an API for Pokémon data, and web scraping a Pokémon wiki such as <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a> is both impractical and rude. Fortunately, there’s an unofficial Pokémon API known appropriately as <a href="https://pokeapi.co">PokéAPI</a>, which is both open source and has been around for years without Nintendo taking them down. Of note, PokéAPI has a <a href="https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/">GraphQL interface</a> to its Pokémon data, allowing you to query exactly what you want without having to do relationship mapping or data joins.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/graphql_huc51b8b30bdbe422deccfe80a75d2485d_57889_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/graphql_huc51b8b30bdbe422deccfe80a75d2485d_57889_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/graphql_huc51b8b30bdbe422deccfe80a75d2485d_57889_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/graphql.png 1260w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/graphql.png" alt="A simple GraphQL query to get all Pokémon IDs and names, sorted by ID."/><figcaption><p>A simple GraphQL query to get all Pokémon IDs and names, sorted by ID.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Since we can get Pokémon data in a nicely structured JSON dictionary, why not keep it that way?

Some of the formatting is redundant though: most of the JSON keys have a <code>pokemon_v2_</code> string that conveys no additional semantic information, and we can minify the JSON to remove all the whitespace. We won’t experiment with more rigorous preprocessing: after all, I only need to optimize an ETL workflow if it <em>doesn’t</em> work, right?</p><p>Since JSON data is so prevalent across the internet, it’s extremely likely that a newly trained LLM will be sensitive to its schema and be able to understand it better. However, JSON is a token-inefficient encoding format, made even worse in this case by the particular choice of tokenizer. Here’s the distribution of the encoded texts after the optimizations above, using <code>nomic-embed-text-v1.5</code>’s text tokenizer which is incidentally the same <a href="https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased">bert-based-uncased</a> tokenizer used for BERT back in 2018:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/token_counts_hud9741eb9497fa932352b9a94a0184e29_18651_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/token_counts_hud9741eb9497fa932352b9a94a0184e29_18651_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/token_counts_hud9741eb9497fa932352b9a94a0184e29_18651_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/token_counts.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/token_counts.png"/></figure><p>The 8,192 context length of <code>nomic-embed-text-v1.5</code> is perfect for fitting almost all Pokémon! But the median token count is 3,781 tokens which is still somewhat high. The reason for this is due to the tokenizer: bert-base-uncased is a <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/6">WordPiece</a> tokenizer which is optimized for words and their common prefixes and suffixes, while JSON data is highly structured. If you use a more modern tokenizer which utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding">byte pair encoding</a> (BPE), such as the <code>o200k_base</code> tokenizer which powers OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o</a>, then the median token count is 2,010 tokens: nearly half the size, and therefore would be much faster to process the embeddings.</p><p>After that, I <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/pokemon-embeddings/blob/main/pokemon_embeddings.ipynb">encoded all the Pokémon metadata</a> into a 768D text embedding for each and every Pokémon, including unit normalization. Due to the quadratic scaling at high input token counts, this is still very computationally intensive despite the optimization tricks: for the 1,302 embeddings, it took about a half-hour on a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> T4 GPU. The embeddings are then saved on disk in a <a href="https://parquet.apache.org">parquet</a> format, a tabular format which supports nesting sequences of floats natively (don’t use a CSV to store embeddings!). The embedding generation is the hard part, now it’s time for the fun part!</p><p>Let’s start off with Pikachu. What Pokémon is Pikachu most similar to, i.e. has the highest cosine similarity?

It’s likely that the similarities are high because the input is all in the same JSON formatting, where the core <code>nomic-text-embed-v1.5</code> model was trained on a variety of text styles. Another potential cause is due to a “cheat” I did for simplicity: the <code>nomic-text-embed-v1.5</code> documentation says that a <code>search_document</code> prefix is required for encoding the base input documents and a <code>search_query</code> prefix is required for the comparison vector: in my testing it doesn’t affect the similarity much if at all.

Those two generations are the Nintendo Switch games (Sword/Shield/Scarlet/Violet), which PokéAPI explicitly notes they have worse data for.

How else can we identify interesting Pokémon relationships?</p><h2 id="pokémon-snap">Pokémon Snap</h2><p>We’ve only been working with text embeddings, but what about other types of embeddings, such as image embeddings? Image embeddings using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer">vision transformer</a> models are generated roughly the same way as the text embeddings above by manipulating the last hidden state and optionally normalizing them. The inputs to the model are then square patches encoded as “tokens”: only a few hundred processed patches are ever used as inputs, so generating them is much faster than the text embeddings.</p><p>A couple years ago I hacked together a Python package named <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/imgbeddings/tree/main">imgbeddings</a> which uses OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">CLIP</a> to generate the embeddings, albeit with <a href="https://x.com/minimaxir/status/1507166313281585164">mixed results</a>. Recently, Nomic also released an new model, <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-vision-v1.5">nomic-embed-vision-v1.5</a>, which now also generates image embeddings with better benchmark performance than CLIP. What’s notable about these embeddings is that they are aligned with the ones from <code>nomic-embed-text-v1.5</code>, which can allow matching text similiarity with images or <em>vice versa</em> and enable <a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/multimodal-ai?hl=en">multimodal applications</a>.</p><p>But for now, can we see if image embeddings derived from Pokémon images have similar similarity traits? PokéAPI fortunately has the official artwork for each Pokémon, so I <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/pokemon-embeddings/blob/main/pokemon_images.ipynb">downloaded them</a> and additionally composited them onto a white background and resized them all to 224x224 for apples-to-apples comparisons. We expect a high cosine similarity since like with text embeddings, the “style” of all the images is the same.

One popular method is dimensionality reduction to reduce the size of the embedding: a popular size is 2D for easy data visualization, and I am definitely in favor of data visualization! The classical statistical approach is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis</a> (PCA) which identifies the most “important” aspects of a matrix, but a more modern approach is <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uniform manifold approximation &amp; projection</a> (UMAP) which trains a projection that accounts for how data points relate to all other data points to <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html">find its underlying structure</a>. In theory, the reduction should allow the embeddings to generalize better.</p><p>For the Pokémon embeddings, we can take the opportunity to allow the model to account for both the text and image embeddings, and their potential interactions therein. Therefore, I concatenated the text and image embeddings for each Pokémon (a 1536D embedding total), and trained a UMAP to project it down to 2D. Now we can visualize it!</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/pokemon_umap_hu976180d07c20f6031eb9e74d5d5469df_108518_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/pokemon_umap_hu976180d07c20f6031eb9e74d5d5469df_108518_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/pokemon_umap_hu976180d07c20f6031eb9e74d5d5469df_108518_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/pokemon_umap.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/06/pokemon-embeddings/pokemon_umap.png" alt="One of the removed outliers was Tauros, which is interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s a very unexciting Pokémon."/><figcaption><p>One of the removed outliers was <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tauros_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29">Tauros</a>, which is interesting because it’s a very unexciting Pokémon.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Unforunately plotting each Pokémon image onto a single chart would be difficult to view, but from this chart we can see that instead of organizing by Pokémon type like my 2016 approach did, this approach is organizing much more by generation: the earlier generations vs. the later generations.

That’s not even considering how embeddings work with vector databases, which is a rabbit hole deep enough for <em>several</em> blog posts.</p><blockquote><p>The parquet dataset containing the Pokémon text embeddings, image embeddings, and UMAP projections is available <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/minimaxir/pokemon-embeddings">on Hugging Face</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>All the code to process the Pokémon embeddings and create the ggplot2 data visualizations is available <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/pokemon-embeddings">in this GitHub repository</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div>
