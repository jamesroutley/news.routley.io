What triggered the explosion remains unclear, he added.</p><p>The Yonhap news agency had earlier reported that some 20 bodies had been found inside the plant, but Kim told a televised briefing that 16 people died and two others had suffered serious injuries.</p><p>He said rescuers were trying to find the five people unaccounted for.</p><p>A Reuters witness saw firefighters moving as many as six bodies out of the factory, which is in an industrial area.</p><p>Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Calls to Aricell offices were unanswered.</p><p>The company is not listed on South Korea’s stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to an Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5%.</p><p>Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked as if they had been blown out into the street by an explosion.</p></div><div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><picture data-testid="picture"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_21/3649017/reuters-live-blog-byline-image_1.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_21/3649017/reuters-live-blog-byline-image_1.png 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_21/3649017/reuters-live-blog-byline-image_1.png" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name">Reuters</span><span></span></p><p>Reuters</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
