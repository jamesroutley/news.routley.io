    <h1>Mozilla is eliminating its advocacy division</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The Mozilla Foundation laid off 30 percent of its workforce and completely eliminated its advocacy and global programs divisions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/mozilla-foundation-lays-off-30-staff-drops-advocacy-division/"><em>TechCrunch </em>reports</a>. </p><p>While Mozilla is best known for its Firefox web browser, the Mozilla Foundation — the parent of the Mozilla Corporation — describes itself as standing up “for the health of the internet.” With its advocacy and global programs divisions gone, its impact may be lessened going forward.</p><p>“Fighting for a free and open internet will always be core to our mission, and advocacy continues to be a critical tool in that work. We’re revisiting how we pursue that work, not stopping it,” Brandon Borrman, the Mozilla Foundation’s communications chief, said in an email to <em>The Verge. </em>Borrman declined to confirm exactly how many people were laid off, but said it was about “30% of the current team.”</p><p>This is Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24072184/mozilla-is-laying-off-around-60-workers-and-scaling-back-its-mastodon-instance">second round of layoffs this year</a>. In February, the Mozilla Corporation laid off around 60 workers said it would be making a “strategic correction” that would involve involve cutting back its work on a Mastodon instance. Mozilla shut down its virtual 3D platform and refocused its efforts on Firefox and AI. The Mozilla Foundation had around 120 employees before this more recent round of layoffs, according to <em>TechCrunch</em>.</p><p>In an email sent to all employees on October 30th, Nabhia Syed, the foundation’s executive director, said that the advocacy and global programs divisions “are no longer part of our structure.”</p><p>“Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus — and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it won’t get us to the next peak,” wrote Syed, who previously worked as the chief executive of <em>The Markup</em>, an investigative news site. “Lofty goals demand hard choices.” </p></div></div></div>
