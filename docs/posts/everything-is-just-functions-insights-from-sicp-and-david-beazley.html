    <h1>Everything Is Just Functions: Insights from SICP and David Beazley</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="efc51075-24f6-4632-9681-3ab2237f4091">I had the chance to do David Beazley’s <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/sicp.html">SICP course</a> towards the end of 2022. I have only good things to say.</p><p id="1d920363-c4fb-4c5e-ab8a-37ef1cd34238">There are a lot of free resources out there <a href="https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/1-week-with-David-Beazley-and-SICP-4c440389cf1e43f48fe67c969967f655?pvs=21">[1]</a>. Having Dave as a guide, I was amazed at how much we covered in a week. I loved how he cherry-picked topics for the high-level overview, but takes the time to hone in on critical sections. In some cases, Dave even comes up with his own examples to more clearly illustrate concepts being discussed.</p><p id="6747fc3c-0961-4d4c-b048-e0f0ea3875ef">What did I learn? It’s hard to describe. I’ll explain by analogy. When I learned about compilers, I discovered that languages have much more in common than I realized; I now see the big picture <a href="https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/1-week-with-David-Beazley-and-SICP-4c440389cf1e43f48fe67c969967f655?pvs=21">[2]</a>. With SICP it’s a bit like that, but with the idea of computation more generally.</p><p id="be7b0024-915f-48c5-a7a5-0694b46bb114">Let’s review a few key concepts, and then go into what I found especially mind-blowing.</p><p id="aa820f83-691e-44ca-94b4-3213131aa896">In this section, we build a simple model of computation through the process of substitution. We start with a quick review of Scheme (the language used in SICP), next build a Scheme interpreter in Python, and then take a closer look at substitution.</p><h3 id="926c8719-01d6-42ac-bac9-d14cdfdad3c0">Scheme</h3><p id="8a9b57d1-149e-419d-8ea7-ccdae469cb9a"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>. For the course we actually used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)">Racket</a>, which is similar but easier to set up <a href="https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/1-week-with-David-Beazley-and-SICP-4c440389cf1e43f48fe67c969967f655?pvs=21">[3]</a>. For our purposes we only need a small part of the language; here Scheme and Racket coincide. The <code>&gt;</code> in this subsection represents the Scheme REPL.</p><p id="6e466513-fd82-42fc-8f16-7594c2d5dc95">Primitives are the simplest entities in the language. We only need integers. When evaluated we simply get it back.</p><pre id="74e7d259-7045-4578-b5aa-6e6bac93463a"><code>&gt; 1
1</code></pre><p id="84d76c1c-bdce-4138-9215-18ac85509945">For built-in operations, we need <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>. Scheme uses prefix notation, where the operator appears first and then the operands. The example here illustrates adding <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>.</p><pre id="f82d2f48-f00e-405b-9d12-d3ff422ad90e"><code>&gt; (+ 2 3)
5</code></pre><p id="a5681c6a-8795-41e9-99a3-a1db2a346f68">Next we have special forms. The first one we need is <code>define</code>, which lets us define variables. Here we define <code>x</code> to be <code>2</code>.</p><pre id="7b098caa-119f-4617-9dfc-a406b19fd57a"><code>&gt; (define x 2)

&gt; (+ x 3)
5</code></pre></div></div>
