    <h1>An innovative superfamily of fonts for code (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="Grid-:R3dja:"><div><p><span>Since the earliest days of the teletype machine, code has been set in monospaced type<!-- --> — <!-- -->letters, on a grid. Monaspace is a new type system that advances the state of the art for the display of code on screen.</span></p><p><span>Every advancement in the technology of computing has been accompanied by advancements to the display and editing of code. CRTs made screen editors possible. The advent of graphical user interfaces gave rise to integrated development environments.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Even today, we still have limited options when we want to layer additional meaning on top of code. Syntax highlighting was invented in 1982 to help children to code in BASIC. But beyond colors, most editors must communicate with developers through their interfaces<!-- --> — <!-- -->hovers, underlines, and other graphical decorations.</span></p><p><span>Monaspace offers a more expressive palette for code and the tools we use to work with it.</span></p></div></div><div><div data-testid="Grid-:R19dja:"><p><header><span data-testid="Label"><span><span>Feature</span></span></span><h2>Texture healing</h2></header></p><p>Monospaced type suffers from an inherent problem of uneven texture<!-- --> — <!-- -->text with some areas that are significantly denser, and some that have an excess of whitespace. It’s an unavoidable consequence of trying to fit every letter into a uniform box, when some letters want more space, and some want less.</p><p>These shortcomings have been the same since the heyday of the Teletype machine in the 1960s. Texture Healing is a novel technique that evens out the density of monospaced type, bringing it closer to how proportional type has looked for centuries.</p><p>Texture healing preserves the monospace grid, and works in most editors without needing new software or editor plugins.<!-- --> <span>How does it work?</span></p></div><div><div><p><span><span>In proportional typefaces, every glyph is designed with a unique width.</span> <!-- -->The design of an <code>m</code> can be wider than the design of an <code>i</code>. Every glyph gets the space it needs, and no letter is stuck with too much or too little.</span></p><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-1"><p><span>The design of each letter incorporates some amount of whitespace on both sides of a glyph.<!-- --> <span>These sidebearings create the visual room that help us distinguish one letterform from the next</span>.</span></p><p><span>Too little, and the letters will run together. Too much, and the letters will look disconnected.</span></p></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-2"><p><span>But in monospaced faces, every letter must be the same width, regardless of what that letter needs.</span></p><p><span>Adjusting the sidebearings isn’t enough.<!-- --> <span>The letter must be altered to either fill up the box, or squeeze into it</span> — <!-- -->and still leave a little bit of room for sidebearings.</span></p></div><p><span>Narrow letters like <code>l</code> and<!-- --> <code>i</code> must be designed with exaggerated serifs to better fill the monospace box. Even with these synthetic additions,<!-- --> <span>these narrow letters have more space than they need.</span></span></p><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-4"><p><span>Wide letters like <code>m</code> and<!-- --> <code>w</code> are crammed into their boxes, and their shapes are visibly distorted compared to the rest of the alphabet. Their strokes are thinner, and the negative space inside the glyph is also compromised. There’s little room for these glyphs to grow bolder without turning into an unreadable blob.</span></p><p><span>Even though these letters have less space than they want, they still need to leave some room for sidebearings so they don’t crowd the adjacent letters.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div role="img" aria-label="Side-by-side comparison of a word with texture healing off and on."><p><span>Texture healing off</span></p><p><span>TIME_limit</span><span>TIME_limit</span></p><p><span>Texture healing on</span></p></div></div><div data-testid="Grid-:R59dja:"><p><span>Texture healing works by finding each pair of adjacent characters where one wants more space, and one has too much. Narrow characters are swapped for ones that cede some of their whitespace, and wider characters are swapped for ones that extend to the very edge of their box. This swapping is powered by an OpenType feature called “contextual alternates,” which is widely supported by both operating systems and browser engines.</span></p><p><span>Contextual alternates are normally used for certain scripts, like Arabic, where the shape of each glyph depends on the surrounding glyphs. And they are also used for cursive handwriting fonts where the stroke of the “pen” might have different connection points across letters. Texture healing is a novel application of this technology to code.</span> <span><a href="https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/#visual-studio-code">See our instructions for enabling texture healing in Visual Studio Code.</a></span></p></div><div data-testid="Grid-:Rf9dja:"><div><header><h2>Step by step</h2><p><span>Let’s unpack how texture healing is applied.</span></p></header></div></div><div><div><div><p><span>Texture healing off</span></p><p><span>Texture healing on</span></p> </div></div><div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-0"><div><p><span>In the word “calming” there are<!-- --> <span>two</span> <span>pairs</span> <!-- -->that can be texture healed.</span></p></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-1"><div><p><span>The <code>l</code> has space to give, and the <code>m</code> would benefit from more space.</span></p></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-2"><div><p><span>In the first pass, the generic<!-- --> <code>l</code> is replaced with one that is narrower and shifted to the left, away from the<!-- --> <code>m</code>.</span></p></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-3"><div><div><p><span>The generic <code>m</code> can then be replaced by a version that extends to the left edge of the space.</span></p><p><span>Monaspace contains alternates for glyphs that can shrink or grow in either direction.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-4"><div><div><p><span>But texture healing can also work in more than one direction.</span></p><p><span>The next pair of characters is also eligible for texture healing.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-5"><div><div><p><span>As before, the letter with space to give is replaced with one that cedes some whitespace to its neighbor.</span></p><p><span>This time, it shifts to the right.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-6"><div><p><span>And now the <code>m</code> is replaced once more, with a variant that extends in both directions.</span></p></div></div><div data-react-scrollama-id="react-scrollama-7"><div><div><p><span>Texture healing finds the most visually compromised pairs and heals them with more legible replacements.</span></p><p><span>The resulting text still obeys the monospaced grid.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="Grid-:R1cdja:"><p><header><span data-testid="Label"><span><span>Feature</span></span></span><h2 id="code-ligatures">Code ligatures</h2></header></p><div><p><span>Monaspace includes code ligatures for a broad variety of programming languages, organized into stylistic sets that you can enable or disable according to your preferences.</span></p><p><span>Each stylistic set is roughly designed around the needs of specific languages.
