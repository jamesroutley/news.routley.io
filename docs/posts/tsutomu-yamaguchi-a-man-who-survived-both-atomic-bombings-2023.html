Recently, there’s been renewed interest in the origins of atomic weaponry due to the new <a href="https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/christopher-nolan" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/christopher-nolan" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> film <em>Oppenheimer</em> about physicist <a href="https://www.biography.com/scientists/j-robert-oppenheimer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.biography.com/scientists/j-robert-oppenheimer" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="J.

For several decades, he didn’t speak publicly about the devastation he witnessed, but in his final years, he felt it was his destiny to speak out against the horrors of nuclear weaponry.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6">“The reason that I hate the atomic bomb is because of what it does to the dignity of human beings,” Yamaguchi told <em>Military History Magazine</em>, according to several books and media outlets.</p><section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-9" data-node-id="7"></section><h2 data-node-id="8">Surviving the Hiroshima Blast</h2><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9">Yamaguchi was born in Nagasaki, Japam, on March 16, 1916. In the 1930s, he began working as a draftsman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, designing oil tankers. He opposed his country’s role in World War II and became so despondent about the war that he considered <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/6943088/Tsutomu-Yamaguchi.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/6943088/Tsutomu-Yamaguchi.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="killing his wife and infant son">killing his wife and infant son</a> with sleeping pills if Japan lost.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima for a three-month business trip when the city was bombed on August 6, 1945. It was the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-survived-two-atomic-bombs" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-survived-two-atomic-bombs" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="last day of the trip">last day of the trip</a>, and he was preparing to leave the city when he saw the American B-29 bomber Enola Gay fly over Hiroshima and drop an item carried by two parachutes. Suddenly, he said the sky lit with a blaze, “the lightning of a huge magnesium flare.”</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11">Drawing upon his naval air-raid training, Yamaguchi dove to the ground, rolled into the nearest irrigation ditch, flung his hands into his head, locked his fingers over his eyes, and jammed his thumbs into his ears, according to <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima" data-vars-ga-product-id="8f2d515a-65db-4015-9d44-f519599874f2" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538121786" data-affiliate-network="{&#34;site_id&#34;:&#34;73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce&#34;,&#34;network&#34;:{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Amazon&#34;}}" data-vars-ga-product-brand="Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers" data-vars-ga-product-price="$21.83" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="26c0451b-09be-4759-985e-6d8d33ed8858" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers">To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima</a></em> by Charles Pellegrino.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">The ground roared and an ear-shattering noise ripped through the air, tossing Yamaguchi into the air as a fireball imploded overhead. He was dropped face-first into a muddy furrow. The protective measures he took likely saved his life; a woman who had been walking beside him shortly before the blast disappeared altogether, Pellegrino wrote.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13">“I think I fainted for a while,” <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/human-interest/tsutomu-yamaguchi-man-who-survived-two-atomic-bombs-in-hiroshima-nagasaki-602593.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/human-interest/tsutomu-yamaguchi-man-who-survived-two-atomic-bombs-in-hiroshima-nagasaki-602593.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yamaguchi said">Yamaguchi said</a>. “When I opened my eyes, everything was dark, and I couldn’t see much.
