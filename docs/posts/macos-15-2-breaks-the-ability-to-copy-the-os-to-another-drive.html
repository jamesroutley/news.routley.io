    <h1>macOS 15.2 breaks the ability to copy the OS to another drive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/youre_a_mean_one/">Youâ€™re a Mean One</a></em> Friday, December 13, 2024 </p></div><div>

<p>macOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A terrible, awful surprise.</p>

<p>Apple broke the replicator. Towards the end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it&#39;s about to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a <strong>Resource Busy</strong> error.</p>

<p>In the past, <strong>Resource Busy</strong> could be worked around by ensuring the system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most systems, there&#39;s no fix. It just fails.</p>

<h3>Puppet on Strings</h3>

<p>Since Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy the OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it&#39;s been up to them to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that, they&#39;ve failed in macOS 15.2.</p>

<p>Because this is their code, and we&#39;re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not work until they fix it.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, this sucks. It&#39;s bad enough we have to work around other bugs in this code, but when it breaks completely, we&#39;re stuck pointing fingers and offering workarounds that don&#39;t involve the replicator.</p>

<h3>Workaround Runaround Redux</h3>

<p>What this means is this: until Apple fixes the bug, you&#39;ll have to use &#34;Backup - all files&#34; with &#34;Smart Update&#34; to copy everything but the OS.</p>

<p>This backup, as I&#39;ve explained before, has all your stuff: applications, data, settings, etc. The System volume (the OS, effectively), is read-only and you can&#39;t change it. So a clean install brings it back exactly as it was...and then you can restore when prompted during first boot.</p>

<h3>We Know This Sucks</h3>

<p>The section title says it all. I know. This sucks. We think it sucks. You think it sucks. But we can&#39;t fix it: Apple has to do so.</p>

<p>For those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the bug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.</p>

<h3>Happy Holidays</h3>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate this is happening during this period, since Apple rarely releases updates between now and New Year&#39;s.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you&#39;ll be having a better Holiday Season than I am about to have, with fewer emails and more fun.</p>

<p>Thanks for using SuperDuper, and thanks for your understanding.</p>
