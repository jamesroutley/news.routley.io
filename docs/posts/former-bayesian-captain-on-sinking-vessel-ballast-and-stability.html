    <div><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-edwards-78539147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Edwards</a>, captain of the 58.6m Perini Navi built Seahawk, was previously Captain from 2015 to 2020 for the <a href="https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/tag/bayesian-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">56m Perini Navi Bayesian</a> which sank August 19 with seven deaths while at anchor off the coast of Porticello, Italy.</p>
<p>While investigators seek answers for why a storm downburst led to this tragedy, and whether manslaughter and negligent shipwreck are to be brought, Edwards issued the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7233792846770659328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following statement</a> from his experience with the 2008 yacht:</p>
<hr/>
<p>Having been bombarded with requests for information from journalists around the World for my input into the loss of S/Y Bayesian a week ago, I have finally decided to make some notes on the subject.</p>
<p>I have no desire to contribute to the wild speculation and claims that we have seen so far, or in any way suggest what really happened… only those on board at the time will know that, but I can shed some light on the characteristics of the vessel and some of the limitations that would likely be involved in this disaster.</p>
<p>Bayesian (ex Salute) was a 56m Perini Navi, part of a very successful series of hulls. She was the only one built as a sloop rig (single mast), with the tallest aluminum mast ever constructed. I’m going to discuss step-by-step what I hope are pertinent facts about the boat and her design and operation that are relevant to this event.</p>
<p><strong>1. Mast</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Ballast</strong></p>
<p>The main lead ballast was contained in a more or less rectangular box (keel box) attached below the canoe shaped part of the hull. The precise mass of this ballast I do not recall, but it’s probably around 200T or so. In the center part of this box there is the moveable keel, which weighed around 60T and extended almost 6m below the keel box when lowered. This arrangement means that the majority of the righting moment of the vessel comes from the main ballast… the moveable keel acting more as a centerboard to reduce sideslip under sail (leeway)…</p>
<p><strong>3. Stability</strong></p>
<p>One section of the Bayesian Stability book related to the use of the moveable keel… and defines when it must be lowered. In this vessel’s case it was required to be lowered when using sails, and/ or when over 60 nautical miles offshore (regardless of whether sailing or only using engines). At all other times, it could be in the raised position.</p>
<p>The stability book also contains information regarding righting angles and the watertight integrity of the hull. There are two important numbers here… Angle of Vanishing Stability (AVS) and the Downflooding Angle.</p>
<p>The Angle of Vanishing Stability is the angle of heel at which the vessel righting moment reaches zero, meaning that the vessel will not return to upright. Again, I forget the actual numbers for this, but the figures would be around 90 degrees with the moveable keel lowered and 75 degrees with it raised.</p>
<p>The Downflooding Angle is much more important though in the scenario we are talking about. This is the angle of heel at which water will start to enter the vessel (usually through engine room or accommodation ventilation ducts)… once this starts the vessels is in serious trouble as stability is quickly reduced or lost due to the flooding.</p>
<p>The downflooding angle for Bayesian was around 40-45 degrees… much less than the AVS. So, unless the vent dampers are closed (which with HVAC systems and generator running they would NOT be as they need to be open for that), the vessel will start to flood rapidly if heeled more than the downflooding angle.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hull Openings</strong></p>
<p>There are no opening windows or portholes, which are all made from laminated marine glass bonded to the hull &amp; superstructure.</p>
<p>Other deck hatch / superstructure openings that breach the watertight integrity on Bayesian are on or close to the centerline of the vessel. For these to be taking water if open, the vessel would have to be heeled way beyond the Downflooding Angle mentioned earlier, and hence already flooding via ducting/vents.</p>
<p>Only one opening was located far from the centerline, and could be vulnerable to downflooding at lower angles of heel… this is the deck access to the lazarette area towards the stern. However, as it is located on the port (left) side of the aft deck, it would be unlikely to be an initial factor in this scenario as we know that Bayesian was knocked down to starboard, and as such this hatch, even if opened as crew were on deck etc, would have been one of the later parts to submerge.</p>
<p><strong>5. Summary</strong></p>
<p>The weather conditions that could have created these extreme circumstances can indeed occur with very little warning and being so localized are difficult to prepare for, leaving a very short time for the crew to react.</p>
<p>How the vessel came to be taken outside her operation limits is what the investigators will need to determine, which I’m sure they will.</p>
