							<p>I am Zara. I am 19 years old. On the 18th of August 2021 I launched on a journey to fly solo around the world in a Shark ultralight aircraft. On the 20th of January 2022, 155 days later, I landed back in Wevelgem, Belgium.  </p><p>With this successful circumnavigation, I am happy not only to break the Guinness World Record of youngest woman flying solo around the world, but also to reduce the gender gap by 11 years between the current youngest male record holder Travis Ludlow, 18 at the time of his record, and the previous female record  holder Shaesta Waez, who was 30 when she completed her “Dreams Soar” around-the-world flight.</p><p>Not only am I hoping to reduce the gender gap in Aviation and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), but also to encourage girls and young women to pursue their dreams.</p>						</div>
