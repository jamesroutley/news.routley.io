<h2 id="people-read-longer-books-during-winter">People read longer books during winter</h2>



<p>We looked at the average length of bestsellers by month. The results show that readers tend to read longer books during the first/last 3 months of the year, while bestselling books during spring and summer tend to get shorter.</p>

<p>January and December are the months when readers buy the longest books. Bestselling books are on average 35.2 pages shorter from April – July compared to October – March.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The digital age brought a huge increase of various types of content fighting for people’s time and attention. People have more options than ever on how to spend their time. This variety of things to do alone is one of the reasons why <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wordsrated.com/reading-time/" target="_blank">reading time is in decline over the years</a>.</p>



<p>With these factors in mind, our hypothesis was that readers are choosing to buy shorter books as the years go by. Results of our analysis suggest that this is the case, as best-selling books got 11.8% shorter over the last decade.</p>
