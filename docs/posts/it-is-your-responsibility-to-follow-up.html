<p>Here’s how Travis Kalanick’s inbox looked like back in 2013:</p>

<p><i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/V65cKmqsT_/">Source</a> <a href="https://perma.cc/5BSX-2J5B">(perma)</a></i></p>
<p>If you wanted to reach Travis — and keep in mind that at some point during the last six years he probably hit #inbox1m — would you just send him one email and hope that it wins the lottery when he randomly reaches for something in his inbox?</p>
<p>Probably not. Instead, what you would do, if you wanted him to actually read your email would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>send him an email</li>
<li>send him a follow up a few days later</li>
<li>then send another follow up like a week later</li>
<li>and then one more follow up just for good measure</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if he didn’t reply to you after having 4 chances to do so, <em>that’s</em> a pretty good indication that he doesn’t want to talk to you. But before that - it’s just you being stupid and thinking too much of yourself.</p>
<p>The moral here is the following: whenever you send an email to somebody (especially to somebody busy), imagine that this is what their inbox looks like. Unless you send a follow up, you’re not even trying. And they know it, so <strong>unless you follow up, they will probably just ignore you, correctly believing that you do not even want to talk to them so much.</strong> As Jennifer Doleac <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdoleac/status/1143139174318579714">notes</a> (<a href="https://perma.cc/8RXU-43RG">perma</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I live by the rule that if it’s important, the sender will follow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true even for people you know personally! A story: when I wanted to meet with a <em>really</em> busy friend of mine in SF, I first sent him 2 twitter DMs, then 2 emails, and then 3 text messages, letting him know that I will keep sending one text a day, until an email from him finally landed in my inbox letting me know that he would love to get lunch.</p>
<p>Being used to receiving a personal email a month (at best), it took me years to realize that busy people receive dozens and hundreds of them every day. <em>It is</em> extremely easy to forget about replying to someone in such situation.</p>
<p>Once more, if you actually want a response or if you want to meet someone, <strong>IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FOLLOW UP</strong>.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb here seems to be that it is not rude to send 1/2/maaaaybe 3 follow ups to someone you don’t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t think I can really add much more here, other than mention the fact that only like 20-30% of my cold emails get a response first time (increasing to 40-50% after follow ups), so the rest of the post is just examples of other people telling you to follow up, to make sure you get the message, and a bunch of screenshots from me that show how my advice looks in action:</p>

<p>It wasn’t ego. It was just a practical way to deal with a flood, and a pretty good filter for choosing new clients.</p>

<p>Maybe nobody else has an official system like this. But un-officially, they do. <strong>Overwhelmed people don’t have time for all the random first-contacts.</strong> Patience and persistence separate you from the rest, and show how much you care.</p>

<p>The best projects happen when both sides are invested and the project is solving a critical challenge for the company. <strong>I follow up at most 3 times because emails get buried in inboxes, but after that I assume there’s no interest or no critical (“hair-on-fire”) problem they need solving.</strong> <strong>[emphasis mine]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t get upset if people don’t respond, and chase. Too many founders judge VC’s on response rates — well, some of the best investors out there, the ones that you want, may suck at responding to email. Inbox zero is not a KPI. Getting shit done is a KPI. Is this asymmetric and unfair, since same day turnaround is expected from you? Yup. Totally unfair. Chase with consistency. One email a week. Don’t re-forward the same email — use pre-canned emails that demonstrate some form of company progress or contain some new information. Keep your pipe moving. Have machine like behaviour. <strong>Keep emailing until they say no. [emphasis mine]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used to think that investors would get annoyed if I bugged them so much.  Frankly, now on the other side of the fence, I have so many emails in my inbox, I don’t even notice if someone has pinged me three times. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that I’m on the investor side, let me explain a little bit about what ends up happening – at least if you email me:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We meet.  I tell you I’ll think it over / discuss your deal / figure out next steps by X date.  I go to my next meeting.  And either close the loop at the meeting or say the same thing.  I go to my next meeting.  In fact, I do all of my meetings back-to-back…for most of the week.  While I try to actually follow through by X date, inevitably I’ve erroneously overcommitted, but it’s still in the back of my mind.  But I’m juggling so many meetings that I haven’t had time to sit down and think yet or take action, so I still have nothing new to tell you while also having been in your shoes, I realize time is of the essence.  And then you email me, and this becomes top-of-mind again, but I still have so many meetings that I haven’t gotten around to it.  And then a couple hundred emails pile on top of yours, so it goes to the back of my mind again.  And then you email again with a new update.  And your deal becomes top-of-mind again, but the cycle continues.</p>
