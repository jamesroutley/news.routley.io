<p>tap/click the right side of the screen to go forward →</p><p>I’ve always been curious about how AI works.</p><p>But with the constant news and updates, I often feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with it all.</p><p>So I decided to go back to the basics and start learning from the beginning, with neural networks.</p><p>When I&#39;m learning, I find it easier to understand how things work when I can visualize them in my mind.</p><p>So I made this visualization, and I&#39;m sharing it now.</p><p>I&#39;m just hoping it can also be useful for those of you who are curious about AI and want to learn from the basics.</p><p>But a quick disclaimer: I’m not an expert, and I might get things wrong here and there.</p><p>If you spot anything off, just let me know. I’d love to learn from you too!</p><p>So, what exactly is a neural network?</p><p>A neural network is inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks.</p><p>It works by taking some data as input and processing it through a network of neurons.</p><p>Inside each neuron, there’s a rule that decides whether it should be activated.</p><p>When that happens, it means the neuron found a pattern in the data that it has learned to recognize.</p><p>This process repeats as the data moves through the layers of the network.</p><p>The pattern of activation in the final layer represents the output of the task.</p><p>Let’s start with a simple use case for a neural network: recognizing a handwritten number.</p><p>In this case, the input is an image of a number, and we want the neural network to tell us what number it is.</p><p>The output is determined by which neurons in the last layer get activated.</p><p>Each one corresponds to a number, and the one with the highest activation tells us the network’s prediction.</p><p>To do this, first we need to turn the image into data that the neural network can understand.</p><p>In this example, the data will be the brightness value of each pixel in the image.</p><p>The neuron will receive a value depending on how bright or dark that part of the image is.</p><p>The darker an area (which means there is something written there), the more value a neuron will have.</p><p>Once this process is finished, the input neurons will now have values that resemble the input image.</p><p>These input values are then passed on to the next layer of neurons to process.</p><p>But here’s the key part: before being passed, each value is multiplied by a certain weight.</p><p>These weights will be varied for each connection.</p><p>It might be positive, negative, less than 1, or more than 1.</p><p>The receiving neuron will then sum up all the weighted values it gets.</p><p>Then comes the rule we mentioned earlier — usually called an activation function.</p><p>There are actually different types of activation functions, but let&#39;s use a simple rule for now:</p><p>If the total value is greater than a threshold, the neuron activates. Otherwise, it keeps inactive.</p><p>If the neuron gets activated, it means it recognized something in the image. Maybe a line, a curve, or a part of a number.</p><p>Now imagine we have to do these same operations for every neuron in the next layer.</p><p>Each neuron has its own weight and threshold value, so it will react differently to the same input image.</p><p>To put it differently, each neuron is looking for a different pattern in the image.</p><p>This process repeats layer by layer until we reach the final layer.</p><p>At each layer, the neurons process the patterns detected by the previous layer, building on them to recognize more complex patterns.</p><p>Until finally, in the last layer, the network has enough information to deduce what number is in the image.</p><p>So that’s basically how a neural network works in a nutshell.</p><p>It’s a series of simple math operations that process input data to produce an output.</p><p>With the right combination of weights and thresholds, the network can learn to map inputs to the right outputs.</p><p>In this case, it’s used to map an image of a handwritten number to the correct number.</p><p>I’ll stop here for now.</p><p>So far, we’ve looked at what a neural network is, how it reads input, performs calculations, and gives an output.</p><p>But we haven’t answered the important question:</p><p>How do we find the right weights and right thresholds, so that the correct neuron is activated?</p><p>That part’s a little tricky — I’m still trying to wrap my head around it and find a good way to visualize it.</p><p>So I won’t go into it just yet.</p><p>But for now, I hope this gives you a basic understanding of how neural networks work.</p><p>See you in the next one 👋</p><p>about this project →</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you also love this kind of stuff, feel free to follow me. I&#39;ll try to post more content like this in the future!</p><p>__________________</p><p>https://twitter.com/damarberlari</p><p>_blank</p>
