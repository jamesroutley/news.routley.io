    <h1>Ask HN: What Recession?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So, I&#39;m reading a lot these days about lay-offs in tech companies and how many HN users (mainly from US?) are having a hard time finding top-level paying jobs.</p><p>I work on Western Europe, and in theory we should be more screwed up than other Western countries... but:</p><p>- Just landed (3 months ago) on a job that pays me 20% more than the previous one. I could have switched jobs years before, but I just got the courage to do it now</p><p>- Keep seeing the same amount of job offers on Linkedin. Now, I have the tendency to keep a list of companies that hire on an Excel file, so I can come back to it later and compare past and current situations of such companies. I have over 200 companies that operate in Western Europe (but not exclusively) that I consider &#34;top-level&#34; (at least from my point of view). The effect of the recession? Well, it has had one, but somehow very poor: many companies went from having around 1000 job offers open in linkedin on a weekly basis to having now around a third of that. Sure, they are not hiring like crazy anymore, but they are still hiring!</p><p>- A company that announced a 14% lay-off back in May, is now hiring again (the same pattern as before: when they were offering thousands of jobs before, now they are offering a few hundred)</p><p>Now, I have no idea how FAANG is doing in Western Europe (I never cared to track them) because I have no plans to work for them. But all the other non-FAANG companies over here are hiring. So, I don&#39;t feel the recession (yet). Touching wood.</p></div></div></div>
