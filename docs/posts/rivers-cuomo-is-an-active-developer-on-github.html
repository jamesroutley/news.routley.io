              <p>I haven&#39;t posted much since <a href="https://slinkp.com/blogging-at-recurse-20230710.html" rel="nofollow">starting at Recurse in July
2023</a> and extending my initial
6-week half-batch to a full 12 weeks. Here&#39;s a belated update on what I did in the second half!</p>
<h2>Godot beeps via ChucK</h2>
<p>First, I did experiment more with the &#34;game&#34; prototype that I started in my
first half.
One thing that I achieved was realtime control of an external sound engine,
by sending <a href="https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/" rel="nofollow">OSC</a> messages over local UDP.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/slinkp/recurse-S223/blob/main/chuck-experiments/polyphonic-framework/demo.sh" rel="nofollow">sound engine in
question</a>
was written in <a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/" rel="nofollow">ChucK</a>, a very odd realtime program / little language for
making synthesizers and audio processors. I had a good time playing with ChucK
and seeing if I could make a nicer way to work with realtime polyphony
supporting large numbers of note events. This deserves its own blog post; I wrote quite a
lot but as of this writing have yet to make that readable.</p>

<p>Eventually though, I found working with
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">Godot</a> too frustrating - I felt I was
wasting my time wrestling with its very complex pointy-clicky
interface more so than I was doing challenging programming, and I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d
be able to realize my user interface ideas within the time I had remaining.
I wanted to stretch myself as a programmer, not become an expert (or even
productive) Godot user. So I abandoned the project. </p>
<p>The prototype code is still up in my <a href="https://github.com/slinkp/godot-bounce-1" rel="nofollow">godot-bounce-1 repo</a>.
The code that converts &#34;hit&#34; events to OSC messages over UDP is
<a href="https://github.com/slinkp/godot-bounce-1/blob/main/audio_handler.gd" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
Even being written in
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.htm" rel="nofollow">GDScript</a>,
it can handle thousands of simple note events per second.</p>
<h2>Derailed by COVID, ugh</h2>
<p>I lost some time to this. And depression. A lot was going on my personal life.</p>
<h2>Jobs search prep; Algorithms study and practice</h2>
<p>Sometime during my second half,
I decided it was time to start getting my head in the game for job
interviews. It&#39;s generally advised to put this off a bit when starting at
recurse, so as to focus on work that&#39;s intrinsically motivating to you,
but <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-during-rc" rel="nofollow">midway through is a good time to start thinking about it</a>.</p>
<p>First, I started talks with Recurse&#39;s wonderful <a href="https://www.recurse.com/hire" rel="nofollow">recruiting
group</a>.</p>
<p>I also joined a weekly &#34;Careerist Crud accountability hour&#34; group
to work on &#34;the boring parts&#34; of job search. I hadn&#39;t updated my resume in
several years, yikes. This was a good opportunity to reflect and dig through
old journals as well as ruthlessly triage old cruft that no longer seems relevant.</p>
<p>Also joined another weekly group that met to discuss system design interviews,
something I have some lingering PTSD about from a really bad experience
(unfortunately, I ran across the hopefully rare interviewer who treats the
process as purely adversarial and an opportunity to be relentlessly hostile).</p>
<p>And, I started reviewing algorithms fundamentals.
Having never formally studied computer science - I&#39;m largely
a self-taught programmer - I again turned to Robert Sedgewick&#39;s very good book
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" rel="nofollow">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a>.
I had read most of it several years ago, but forgotten a lot.
(Like, <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/" rel="nofollow">what&#39;s a heap again?</a>).
Not surprisingly, it&#39;s been easier reading the second time around!</p>

<p>I alternated reading Sedgewick with practicing some core concepts in relevant <a href="https://leetcode.com" rel="nofollow">leetcode
problems</a>. This was a great <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-self-directives" rel="nofollow">&#34;when in doubt, program&#34;</a>
activity while I figured out what my last project might be.
I&#39;m not interested in the competitive aspect
of Leetcode, and I think leetcode-style problems are really over-used for interviews at the
expense of more practical hands-on programming challenges - but they are pretty
ubiquitous.  And somewhat to my surprise, I&#39;m finding it a lot more fun this
time around.</p>
<h2>Crafting Interpreters</h2>
<p>The most fun I had in my second half-batch was joining a <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html" rel="nofollow">Crafting
Interpreters</a> study group.
This was inspired by a random <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-pairing" rel="nofollow">pair
programming</a> session with a
fellow Recurse attendee Moritz Neeb,
who was part-way through <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-tree-walk-interpreter.html" rel="nofollow">Part Two: A Tree-Walk
Interpreter</a> and
building <a href="https://github.com/zormit/plox" rel="nofollow">his own Python implementation</a>
of the book&#39;s <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html" rel="nofollow">object-oriented language, Lox</a>.
This was new territory for me; I had never built an interpreter of any kind before, and barely knew what an
AST might be.</p>
<p>Moritz was very patient and great at explaining what he&#39;d built
so far and the next step he was trying to implement. (I don&#39;t recall what.) You can work through the
book by literally typing the Java examples given, or translating them directly
to the language of your choice, but I recall that we decided that day to try to make the code
do what the book was describing without following the example by rote.
Challenging, and I think we kept failing tests, but very fun!</p>
<p>The study group had been at it for a couple weeks, and there were just over two
weeks left in my batch. I was looking for a substantial project to do beyond
Leetcode, and the pairing session was so inspiring that I challenged myself to
try to catch up and finish Part II of the book alongside the group!</p>
<p>Some folks were using it as an opportunity to also practice a new language, but
I thought given the time frame and the number of new concepts I would be
learning that I had better stick with a familiar tool. So, here&#39;s 
<a href="https://github.com/slinkp/recurse-lox" rel="nofollow">my own Lox implementation in Python</a>.
I did use this project as an excuse to get up to speed with using
<a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">Mypy for gradual type-checking in python 3</a>, since 100% of
my professional experience had been with legacy Python 2 codebases.
Having spent significant time at my most recent job fighting with/against
<a href="https://sorbet.org/" rel="nofollow">Sorbet in Ruby</a>, I found Python type hints refreshingly
straightforward.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know if two weeks would be enough time to finish all the chapters in part 2...
- but I did it! I got <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/inheritance.html" rel="nofollow">inheritance</a> working on my last day just after the
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-never-graduate" rel="nofollow">Never Graduate celebration</a> picnic!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Some example Lox code, testing inheritance</span>

<span>bar</span><span>.</span><span>override</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>// expect: bar</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately that meant no in-batch time for <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html" rel="nofollow">part 3 - A Bytecode Virtual
Machine</a> ...
but if I get bored in between job interviews maybe I&#39;ll give that a go!</p>
<h2>Would I do it again?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. I haven&#39;t been this inspired about &#34;just programming&#34; in a long
time. My confidence took a bad knock from layoffs, but I feel better than ever.
I hope to do another full retreat some day.
For now, I&#39;ve been dropping by the center regularly and hanging out on some
Zulip channels, because as we say -- never graduate!</p>
