     <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don’t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I’ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">
    <a href="#why-helix-language-servers">
      why helix: language servers
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I’ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like “go to definition”) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I’ve tried both “build my own custom
configuration from scratch” and “use someone else’s pre-buld configuration
system” and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like “rename this symbol” in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">
    <a href="#the-search-is-great">

    </a>
</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I’m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>

<p>For comparison, here’s what the vim ripgrep plugin I’ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/vim-ripgrep.png"/>
<p>There’s no context for what else is around that line.</p>

    </a>
</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don’t often use
the “go to definition” or “go to reference” feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn’t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>&#39;a</code>, instead I’ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I’ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn’t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There’s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There’s also a setting <code>bufferline=&#34;multiple&#34;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next “tab” and <code>:bc</code> to close a “tab”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">
    <a href="#some-helix-annoyances">
      some helix annoyances
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Here’s everything that’s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix’s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn’t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I’m making a Markdown list, pressing “enter” at the end of a list item
won’t continue the list. There’s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don’t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#&#39;undofile&#39;">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn’t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn’t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/12582">this issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “markdown list” and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can’t be making me that mad.</p>

      switching was easier than I thought
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn’t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven’t needed to use
Vim recently so I don’t know if that’ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the “Helix way”
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don’t have the same idea of what a “word” is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn’t).</p>

    <a href="#using-a-terminal-based-text-editor">
      using a terminal-based text editor
    </a>
</h3>
<p>For many years I’d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">
    <a href="#my-configuration">
      my configuration
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It’s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &#34;solarized_light&#34;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &#34;+&#34;

[keys.normal]
# I didn&#39;t like that Ctrl+C was the default &#34;toggle comments&#34; shortcut
&#34;#&#34; = &#34;toggle_comments&#34;

# I didn&#39;t feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&#34;^&#34; = &#34;goto_first_nonwhitespace&#34;
&#34;$&#34; = &#34;goto_line_end&#34;

[keys.select]
&#34;^&#34; = &#34;goto_first_nonwhitespace&#34;
&#34;$&#34; = &#34;goto_line_end&#34;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim&#39;s `gq` shortcut
l = &#34;:reflow&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>There’s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here’s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &#34;python&#34;
formatter = { command = &#34;black&#34;, args = [&#34;--stdin-filename&#34;, &#34;%{buffer_name}&#34;, &#34;-&#34;] }
language-servers = [&#34;pyright&#34;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>

    <a href="#we-ll-see-how-it-goes">
      we’ll see how it goes
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it’s possible that I’ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I’m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I’m still satisfied with that).</p>
