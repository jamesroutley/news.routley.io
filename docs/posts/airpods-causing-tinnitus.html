    <h1>AirPods Causing Tinnitus?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-action="content-post-body-content" tabindex="-1" data-analytics="content-post:body"><p>After using my AirPods for a while, I noticed a high pitched ringing in my ears (that doesn&#39;t go away). I didn&#39;t know what it was, so I looked it up and it turns out to be tinnitus. Now understand, I don&#39;t listen to music, or anything for that matter, loud. As a matter of fact, I carry a pair of earplugs in my pocket, just in case I encounter anything loud that would damage my hearing.</p><p>Having said all that, now I notice that when I put my AirPods in my ears and have nothing playing, they emit a high pitched tone that I would say exactly replicates the tone of my tinnitus, leaving me to believe that the AirPods actually caused my tinnitus. </p><p>[Edited by Moderator]</p></div></div>
