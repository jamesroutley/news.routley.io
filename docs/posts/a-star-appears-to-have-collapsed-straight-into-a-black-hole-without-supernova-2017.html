<p>Astronomers have watched as a massive, dying star was likely reborn as a black hole. It took the combined power of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), and NASA&#39;s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to go looking for remnants of the vanquished star, only to find that it disappeared out of sight.</p>



<p>It went out with a whimper instead of a bang.</p>



<p>The star, which was 25 times as massive as our sun, should have exploded in a very bright supernova. Instead, it fizzled out—and then left behind a black hole.</p>

</p><figcaption>A team of astronomers at The Ohio State University watched a star disappear and possibly become a black hole. Instead of becoming a black hole through the expected process of a supernova, the black hole candidate formed through a &#34;failed supernova.&#34; - <a href="https://svsdev.gsfc.nasa.gov/12621">Download video in HD formats from NASA Goddard&#39;s Scientific Visualization Studio.</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#34;Massive fails&#34; like this one in a nearby galaxy could explain why astronomers rarely see supernovae from the most massive stars, said Christopher Kochanek, professor of astronomy at The Ohio State University and the Ohio Eminent Scholar in Observational Cosmology.</p>



<p>As many as 30 percent of such stars, it seems, may quietly collapse into black holes — no supernova required.</p>



<p>&#34;The typical view is that a star can form a black hole only after it goes supernova,&#34; Kochanek explained. &#34;If a star can fall short of a supernova and still make a black hole, that would help to explain why we don’t see supernovae from the most massive stars.&#34;</p>





<p>All the tests came up negative. The star was no longer there. By a careful process of elimination, the researchers eventually concluded that the star must have become a black hole.</p>



<p>It&#39;s too early in the project to know for sure how often stars experience massive fails, but Scott Adams, a former Ohio State student who recently earned his doctorate doing this work, was able to make a preliminary estimate.</p>



<p>&#34;N6946-BH1 is the only likely failed supernova that we found in the first seven years of our survey. During this period, six normal supernovae have occurred within the galaxies we&#39;ve been monitoring, suggesting that 10 to 30 percent of massive stars die as failed supernovae,&#34; he said.</p>



<p>&#34;This is just the fraction that would explain the very problem that motivated us to start the survey, that is, that there are fewer observed supernovae than should be occurring if all massive stars die that way.&#34;</p>



<p>To study co-author Krzysztof Stanek, the really interesting part of the discovery is the implications it holds for the origins of very massive black holes — the kind that the LIGO experiment detected via gravitational waves. (LIGO is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.)</p>



<p>It doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense, said Stanek, professor of astronomy at Ohio State, that a massive star could undergo a supernova — a process which entails blowing off much of its outer layers — and still have enough mass left over to form a massive black hole on the scale of those that LIGO detected.</p>



<p>&#34;I suspect it&#39;s much easier to make a very massive black hole if there is no supernova,&#34; he concluded.</p>



<p>Adams is now an astrophysicist at Caltech. Other co-authors were Ohio State doctoral student Jill Gerke and University of Oklahoma astronomer Xinyu Dai. Their research was supported by the National Science Foundation.</p>
