    <p>Marcin â€˜mborkâ€™ Borkowski has a nice post showing us how he <a href="https://mbork.pl/2025-08-18_Cutting_clips_from_videos_with_Emacs">trims video clips from our beloved editor</a>. Trimming clips is something I do from time to time, specially when posting a screencast of sorts. Since I don&#39;t need much, I typically resort to QuickTime Player&#39;s trimming functionality that ships with macOS. While it does the job, ever since I <a href="https://xenodium.com/seek-and-you-shall-find">added a &#34;graphical&#34; seeker to Ready Player Mode</a>, I had been meaning to build a simple video trimming tool of sorts. Marcin&#39;s post was just about the right nudge I needed to also give this a go, yielding <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/video-trimmer.el">video-trimmer-mode</a>.</p>

<p>The solution relies on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kaIXkImCAM">ffmpeg</a> to do the heavy lifting and is roughly 300 lines of code. I was going to share the entire snippet in this post, though may as well point you to its <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/video-trimmer.el">location in my Emacs config repo</a>. I&#39;m likely to tweak it, so you may as well take a look at its latest incarnation.</p>
