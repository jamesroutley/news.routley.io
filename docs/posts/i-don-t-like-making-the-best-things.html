        <p>I used to love blogging, but now it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve written a blog post. What changed? At some point, everything got serious. </p><p>I started to only want to publish the best things, so I didn&#39;t publish at all. I stopped writing to just riff on things, or to explore things in a way that was honest to where I&#39;m actually at. </p><p>The truth is, there&#39;s a lot of things I don&#39;t know. I have more questions than answers. My most authentic reason for making anything is that I am just a curious person. Asking questions and then exploring them makes me happy. </p><p>When I try to make the best thing, I become less happy, actually I become paralyzed. When I try to make the best thing, I drift away from my true nature, which is that, everything I make is just an expression of my curiousity. </p><p>I want to know what happens if I do this? What happens if I do that? But mostly I want to know, who am I? When I&#39;m not trying to make the best thing, I&#39;m making <em>me things</em>. I love making <em>me things</em> because they tell me who I am, and that makes me happy. </p><p>When I try to make the best thing, it feels different. It feels like I&#39;m trying to prove something to someone instead of trying to discover something for myself. It feels dishonest and disrespectful of where I&#39;m at. I&#39;m not the best, so why should I try to make the best things? I&#39;m just me, so I should make <em>me things</em>.</p>
