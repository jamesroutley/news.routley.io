        <p>
            We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form &#34;A is B&#34;, it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction &#34;B is A&#34;. This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on &#34;Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany&#34;, it will not automatically be able to answer the question, &#34;Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?&#34;. Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer (&#34;Olaf Scholz&#34;) will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if &#34;A is B&#39;&#39; occurs, &#34;B is A&#34; is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as &#34;Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of &#39;Abyssal Melodies&#39;&#34; and showing that they fail to correctly answer &#34;Who composed &#39;Abyssal Melodies?&#39;&#34;. The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as &#34;Who is Tom Cruise&#39;s mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]&#34; and the reverse &#34;Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer&#39;s son?&#34;. GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at https://github.com/lukasberglund/reversal_curse.
