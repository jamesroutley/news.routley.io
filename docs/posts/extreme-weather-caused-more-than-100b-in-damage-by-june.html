But as climate change intensifies, that could change, as some disasters are projected to increase in parts of the U.S., such as floods and regional heat waves, will be more difficult for people to avoid.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="98240224-a710-4a7d-8281-d233768dd535"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

By comparison, 2024 alone saw 27 inflation-adjusted billion-dollar events, and the 2020s so far have experienced 115 disasters that cost at least $1 billion, not including this year.</p><p>&#34;It just seems like every year we have an increasing trend.

At the same time, more people live in the U.S. and on the planet, which increases our exposure, he added.</p><p>One factor that makes natural disasters more destructive is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/final-photo-from-iconic-us-satellite-shows-how-las-vegas-has-doubled-in-size-over-the-last-25-years-earth-from-space" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/final-photo-from-iconic-us-satellite-shows-how-las-vegas-has-doubled-in-size-over-the-last-25-years-earth-from-space"><u>expansion of urban areas</u></a>. In 2017, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/publications/109971/EIB-275.pdf?v=60658" target="_blank" data-url="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/publications/109971/EIB-275.pdf?v=60658" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>3.3% of the entire land area in the U.S. was urban</u></a> — up from 2.2% in 1982 and just 0.8% in 1949. Population density has also increased, and the urban population has ballooned from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=52#1" target="_blank" data-url="https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=52#1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>167 million in 1980 to 249 million in 2010</u></a>.</p><p>This means there are more buildings and infrastructure to be destroyed, that weather events are more likely to hit urban areas, and that more people are affected when these areas are hit. Experts have dubbed this the &#34;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/6/2/wcas-d-13-00047_1.xml" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/6/2/wcas-d-13-00047_1.xml" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>expanding bull&#39;s-eye effect</u></a>.&#34;</p><p>Strader noted that the expanding bull&#39;s-eye effect creates a particular risk for tornadoes.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re not really seeing any change in the number of tornadoes,&#34; and those tornadoes aren&#39;t getting stronger, Strader said. Instead, tornadoes are now more damaging because we have built more homes and infrastructure in tornado-prone areas, he noted.</p><p>In addition, we are modifying the land in ways that make some disasters more likely. Replacing open space with roads, for instance, can worsen flooding.</p><p>&#34;If we&#39;ve modified the environment to have more pavement versus open areas where water can percolate, then we may have increased that urban flood hazard, even if the rain hasn&#39;t changed and the size of the city hasn&#39;t changed,&#34; Swain said.</p><p>Our actions have also worsened the risks of wildfires. In the past, small, low-intensity fires regularly cleared out brush and helped regenerate forests in the American West. But after a century of fire suppression, the wilderness is overgrown. &#34;There&#39;s a deficit of natural, beneficial fires,&#34; Swain said. This leads to a large buildup of fuel for wildfires, so when one does occur, it burns hotter, grows larger and is more devastating, Swain said.</p><h2 id="deaths-versus-damages-3">Deaths versus damages</h2><p id="bf2b342b-17bc-4308-b2e2-b0bc742790e5">Even though natural disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive, more people aren&#39;t dying as a result. That&#39;s largely because warning systems and forecasting have improved, which, in turn, helps people get to safety in time, experts noted.</p><p>However, as climate change worsens, forecasting may not prevent a rise in fatalities.</p><p>&#34;The two biggest [disaster types] I worry about are heat and flooding,&#34; Strader said. &#34;When we have very high heat waves, it affects a huge portion of the country, and heat is something you can&#39;t escape from, especially if you&#39;re vulnerable&#34; or if you don&#39;t have resources, he added, noting that minority groups are particularly affected.</p><p id="7571e427-3271-4bd6-88bc-47bddf4dc850">Cities can become like &#34;concrete ovens&#34; — and while such extreme weather events may not always cause massive infrastructure damage, they can be as deadly as a massive hurricane or wildfire. For instance, a heat wave in the Midwest in September 1995 killed 872 people and caused $2 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damage, according to NOAA. But 2017&#39;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/60378-hurricane-harvey-once-in-500000-year-flood.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/60378-hurricane-harvey-once-in-500000-year-flood.html"><u>Hurricane Harvey</u></a> — the second-most-destructive extreme event on record, which hit Texas and Louisiana — caused $160 billion (inflation-adjusted) of damage and just 89 deaths.</p><p>And government policies could lead to more deaths in the short term, experts said.</p><p id="b470b0b4-e201-4c17-bc06-d0bbbb10ca71">The government is looking to cut funding and staff headcount at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-staff-argue-trump-administration-cuts-risk-undoing-progress-since-hurricane-katrina/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-staff-argue-trump-administration-cuts-risk-undoing-progress-since-hurricane-katrina/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Federal Emergency Management Agency</u></a> (FEMA), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-forest-service-fires-3400-workers-park-service-cuts-1000-2025-02-14/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-forest-service-fires-3400-workers-park-service-cuts-1000-2025-02-14/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Forest Service</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-administration-pushes-ahead-noaa-climate-and-weather-cuts" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-administration-pushes-ahead-noaa-climate-and-weather-cuts" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>NOAA</u></a>. These cuts will likely lead to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/scientific-research-is-the-lifeblood-of-our-economy-now-a-wrecking-ball-has-come-opinion" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/scientific-research-is-the-lifeblood-of-our-economy-now-a-wrecking-ball-has-come-opinion"><u>significant impacts</u></a>, both in the near future and longer term, experts told Live Science.</p><p>&#34;It is actually highly plausible that the cuts that are being done right now … will probably increase disaster losses. It&#39;s very much a self-inflicted wound,&#34; Swain said. &#34;The savings by cutting these programs are almost certainly to be far less than the costs incurred through greater disaster losses to come as a result of these objectively very short-sighted decisions.&#34;</p>
