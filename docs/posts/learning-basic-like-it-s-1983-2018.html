    <h1>Learning BASIC Like It&#39;s 1983 (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I was not yet alive in 1983. This is something that I occasionally regret. I
am especially sorry that I did not experience the 8-bit computer era as it was
happening, because I think the people that first encountered computers when
they were relatively simple and constrained have a huge advantage over the rest
of us.</p>

<p>Today, (almost) everyone knows how to use a computer, but very few people, even
in the computing industry, grasp all of what is going on inside of any single
machine. There are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRE7HIO3vk">so many layers of
software</a> doing so many different
things that one struggles to identify the parts that are essential. In 1983,
though, home computers were unsophisticated enough that a diligent person could
learn how a particular computer worked through and through. That person is
today probably less mystified than I am by all the abstractions that modern
operating systems pile on top of the hardware. I expect that these layers of
abstractions were easy to understand one by one as they were introduced; today,
new programmers have to try to understand them all by working top to bottom and
backward in time.

<p>Many famous programmers, particularly in the video game industry, started
programming games in childhood on 8-bit computers like the Apple II and the
Commodore 64. John Romero, Richard Garriott, and Chris Roberts are all
examples. It’s easy to see how this happened. In the 8-bit computer era, many
games were available only as printed BASIC listings in computer magazines and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games">books</a>. If you wanted to
play one of those games, you had to type in the whole program by hand.
Inevitably, you would get something wrong, so you would have to debug your
program. By the time you got it working, you knew enough about how the program
functioned to start modifying it yourself. If you were an avid gamer, you
became a good programmer almost by necessity.</p>

<p>I also played computer games throughout my childhood. But the games I played
came on CD-ROMs. I sometimes found myself having to google how to fix a
crashing installer, which would involve editing the Windows Registry or
something like that. This kind of minor troubleshooting may have made me
comfortable enough with computers to consider studying computer science in
college. But it never taught me anything crucial about how computers worked or
how to control them.</p>

<p>Now, of course, I tell computers what to do for a living. All the same, I can’t
help feeling that I missed out on some fundamental insight afforded only to
those that grew up programming simpler computers. What would it have been like
to encounter computers for the first time in the early 1980s? How would that
have been different from the experience of using a computer today?</p>

<p>This post is going to be a little different from the usual Two-Bit History post
because I’m going to try to imagine an answer to these questions.</p>

<h2 id="1983">1983</h2>
<p>It was just last week that you saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZekAbt2o6Ms">the Commodore 64
ad</a> on TV. Now that <em>M*A*S*H</em> was
over, you were in the market for something new to do on Monday nights. This
Commodore 64 thing looked even better than the Apple II that Rudy’s family had
in their basement. Plus, the ad promised that the new computer would soon bring
friends “knocking down” your door. You knew several people at school that would
rather be hanging out at your house than Rudy’s anyway, if only they could play
<em>Zork</em> there.</p>

<p>So you persuaded your parents to buy one. Your mother said that they would
consider it only if having a home computer meant that you stayed away from the
arcade. You reluctantly agreed. Your father thought he would start tracking the
family’s finances in MultiPlan, the spreadsheet program he had heard about,
which is why the computer got put in the living room. A year later, though, you
would be the only one still using it. You were finally allowed to put it on the
desk in your bedroom, right under your <em>Police</em> poster.</p>

<p>(Your sister protested this decision, but it was 1983 and computers
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">weren’t for
her</a>.)</p>

<p>Dad picked it up from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA_XtT3VAVM">ComputerLand</a> on the way home
from work. The two of you laid the box down next to the TV and opened it.
“WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF FRIENDLY COMPUTING,” said the packaging. Twenty
minutes later, you weren’t convinced—the two of you were still trying to
connect the Commodore to the TV set and wondering whether the TV’s antenna
cable was the 75-ohm or 300-ohm coax type. But eventually you were able to turn
your TV to channel 3 and see a grainy, purple image.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_startup.png" alt="Commodore 64 startup screen"/></p>

<p><code>READY</code>, the computer reported. Your father pushed the computer toward you,
indicating that you should be the first to give it a try. <code>HELLO</code>, you typed,
carefully hunting for each letter. The computer’s response was baffling.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_error.png" alt="Commodore 64 syntax error"/></p>

<p>You tried typing in a few different words, but the response was always the
same. Your father said that you had better read through the rest of the manual.
That would be no mean feat—<a href="ftp://www.zimmers.net/pub/cbm/c64/manuals/C64_Users_Guide.pdf">the manual that came with the Commodore
64</a> was a small
book. But that didn’t bother you, because the introduction to the manual
foreshadowed wonders.</p>

<p>The Commodore 64, it claimed, had “the most advanced picture maker in the
microcomputer industry,” which would allow you “to design your own pictures in
four different colors, just like the ones you see on arcade type video games.”
The Commodore 64 also had “built-in music and sound effects that rival many
well known music synthesizers.” All of these tools would be put in your hands,
because the manual would walk you through it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as important as all the available hardware is the fact that this USER’S
GUIDE will help you develop your understanding of computers. It won’t tell
you everything there is to know about computers, but it will refer you to a
wide variety of publications for more detailed information about the topics
presented. Commodore wants you to really enjoy your new COMMODORE 64. And to
have fun, remember: programming is not the kind of thing you can learn in a
day. Be patient with yourself as you go through the USER’S GUIDE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That night, in bed, you read through the entire first three chapters—”Setup,”
“Getting Started,” and “Beginning BASIC Programming”—before finally succumbing
to sleep with the manual splayed across your chest.</p>

<h2 id="commodore-basic">Commodore BASIC</h2>
<p>Now, it’s Saturday morning and you’re eager to try out what you’ve learned. One
of the first things the manual teaches you how to do is change the colors on
the display. You follow the instructions, pressing <code>CTRL-9</code> to enter reverse
type mode and then holding down the space bar to create long lines. You swap
between colors using <code>CTRL-1</code> through <code>CTRL-8</code>, reveling in your sudden new
power over the TV screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_colors.png" alt="Commodore 64 color bands"/></p>

<p>As cool as this is, you realize it doesn’t count as programming. In order to
program the computer, you learned last night, you have to speak to it in a
language called BASIC. To you, BASIC seems like something out of <em>Star Wars</em>,
but BASIC is, by 1983, almost two decades old. It was invented by two Dartmouth
professors, John Kemeny and Tom Kurtz, who wanted to make computing accessible
to undergraduates in the social sciences and humanities. It was widely
available on minicomputers and popular in college math classes. It then became
standard on microcomputers after Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote the MicroSoft
BASIC interpreter for the Altair. But the manual doesn’t explain any of this
and you won’t learn it for many years.</p>

<p>One of the first BASIC commands the manual suggests you try is the <code>PRINT</code>
command. You type in <code>PRINT &#34;COMMODORE 64&#34;</code>, slowly, since it takes you a while
to find the quotation mark symbol above the <code>2</code> key. You hit <code>RETURN</code> and this
time, instead of complaining, the computer does exactly what you told it to do
and displays “COMMODORE 64” on the next line.</p>

<p>Now you try using the <code>PRINT</code> command on all sorts of different things: two
numbers added together, two numbers multiplied together, even several
decimal numbers. You stop typing out <code>PRINT</code> and instead use <code>?</code>, since the
manual has advised you that <code>?</code> is an abbreviation for <code>PRINT</code> often used by
expert programmers. You feel like an expert already, but then you remember that
you haven’t even made it to chapter three, “Beginning BASIC Programming.”</p>

<p>You get there soon enough. The chapter begins by prompting you to write your
first real BASIC program. You type in <code>NEW</code> and hit <code>RETURN</code>, which gives you a
clean slate. You then type your program in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10 ?&#34;COMMODORE 64&#34;
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The 10 and the 20, the manual explains, are line numbers. They order the
statements for the computer. They also allow the programmer to refer to other
lines of the program in certain commands, just like you’ve done here with the
<code>GOTO</code> command, which directs the program back to line 10. “It is good
programming practice,” the manual opines, “to number lines in increments of
10—in case you need to insert some statements later on.”</p>

<p>You type <code>RUN</code> and stare as the screen clogs with “COMMODORE 64,” repeated over
and over.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_print_loop.png" alt="Commodore 64 showing result of printing &#34;Commodore 64&#34;
repeatedly"/></p>

<p>You’re not certain that this isn’t going to blow up your computer. It takes you
a second to remember that you are supposed to hit the <code>RUN/STOP</code> key to break
the loop.</p>

<p>The next few sections of the manual teach you about variables, which the manual
tells you are like “a number of boxes within the computer that can each hold a
number or a string of text characters.” Variables that end in a <code>%</code> symbol are
whole numbers, while variables ending in a <code>$</code> symbol are strings of
characters. All other variables are something called “floating point”
variables. The manual warns you to be careful with variable names because only
the first two letters of the name are actually recognized by the computer, even
though nothing stops you from making a name as long as you want it to be. (This
doesn’t particularly bother you, but you could see how 30 years from now this
might strike someone as completely insane.)</p>

<p>You then learn about the <code>IF... THEN...</code> and <code>FOR... NEXT...</code> constructs. With
all these new tools, you feel equipped to tackle the next big challenge the
manual throws at you. “If you’re the ambitious type,” it goads, “type in the
following program and see what happens.” The program is longer and more
complicated than any you have seen so far, but you’re dying to know what it
does:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10  REM BOUNCING BALL
20  PRINT &#34;{CLR/HOME}&#34;
25  FOR X = 1 TO 10 : PRINT &#34;{CRSR/DOWN}&#34; : NEXT
30  FOR BL = 1 TO 40
40  PRINT &#34; ●{CRSR LEFT}&#34;;:REM (● is a Shift-Q)
50  FOR TM = 1 TO 5
60  NEXT TM
70  NEXT BL
75  REM MOVE BALL RIGHT TO LEFT
80  FOR BL = 40 TO 1 STEP -1
90  PRINT &#34; {CRSR LEFT}{CRSR LEFT}●{CRSR LEFT}&#34;;
100 FOR TM = 1 TO 5
110 NEXT TM
120 NEXT BL
130 GOTO 20
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The program above takes advantage of one of the Commodore 64’s coolest
features. Non-printable command characters, when passed to the <code>PRINT</code> command
as part of a string, just do the action they usually perform instead of
printing to the screen. This allows you to replay arbitrary chains of commands
by printing strings from within your programs.</p>

<p>It takes you a long time to type in the above program. You make several
mistakes and have to re-enter some of the lines. But eventually you are able to
type <code>RUN</code> and behold a masterpiece:</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_ball.gif" alt="Commodore 64 bouncing ball"/></p>

<p>You think that this is a major contender for the coolest thing you have ever
seen. You forget about it almost immediately though, because once you’ve
learned about BASIC’s built-in functions like <code>RND</code> (which returns a random
number) and <code>CHR$</code> (which returns the character matching a given number code),
the manual shows you a program that many years from now will still be
famous enough to be made the title of an <a href="http://10print.org/">essay
anthology</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10 PRINT &#34;{CLR/HOME}&#34;
20 PRINT CHR$(205.5 + RND(1));
40 GOTO 20
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When run, the above program produces a random maze:</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_maze.gif" alt="Commodore 64 maze program"/></p>

<p><em>This</em> is definitely the coolest thing you have ever seen.</p>

<h2 id="peek-and-poke">PEEK and POKE</h2>
<p>You’ve now made it through the first four chapters of the Commodore 64 manual,
including the chapter titled “Advanced BASIC,” so you’re feeling pretty proud
of yourself. You’ve learned a lot this Saturday morning. But this afternoon
(after a quick lunch break), you’re going to learn something that will make
this magical machine in your living room much less mysterious.</p>

<p>The next chapter in the manual is titled “Advanced Color and Graphic Commands.”
It starts off by revisiting the colored bars that you were able to type out
first thing this morning and shows you how you can do the same thing from a
program. It then teaches you how to change the background colors of the screen.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you need to use the BASIC <code>PEEK</code> and <code>POKE</code> commands.
Those commands allow you to, respectively, examine and write to a memory
address. The Commodore 64 has a main background color and a border color. Each
is controlled by a specially designated memory address. You can write any color
value you would like to those addresses to make the background or border that
color.</p>

<p>The manual explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as variables can be thought of as a representation of “boxes” within the
machine where you placed your information, you can also think of some
specially defined “boxes” within the computer that represent specific memory
locations.</p>

  <p>The Commodore 64 looks at these memory locations to see what the screen’s
background and border color should be, what characters are to be displayed on
the screen—and where—and a host of other tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You write a program to cycle through all the available combinations of
background and border color:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10 FOR BA = 0 TO 15
20 FOR BO = 0 TO 15
30 POKE 53280, BA
40 POKE 53281, BO
50 FOR X = 1 TO 500 : NEXT X
60 NEXT BO : NEXT BA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the <code>POKE</code> commands, with their big operands, looked intimidating at
first, now you see that the actual value of the number doesn’t matter that
much. Obviously, you have to get the number right, but all the number
represents is a “box” that Commodore just happened to store at address 53280.
This box has a special purpose: Commodore uses it to determine what color the
screen’s background should be.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/c64_background.gif" alt="Commodore 64 changing background colors"/></p>

<p>You think this is pretty neat. Just by writing to a special-purpose box in
memory, you can control a fundamental property of the computer. You aren’t
sure how the Commodore 64’s circuitry takes the value you write in memory and
changes the color of the screen, but you’re okay not knowing that. At least you
understand everything up to that point.</p>

<h2 id="special-boxes">Special Boxes</h2>
<p>You don’t get through the entire manual that Saturday, since you are now
starting to run out of steam. But you do eventually read all of it. In the
process, you learn about many more of the Commodore 64’s special-purpose boxes.
There are boxes you can write to control what is on screen—one box, in fact,
for every place a character might appear. In chapter six, “Sprite Graphics,”
you learn about the special-purpose boxes that allow you to define images that
can be moved around and even scaled up and down. In chapter seven, “Creating
Sound,” you learn about the boxes you can write to in order to make your
Commodore 64 sing “Michael Row the Boat Ashore.” The Commodore 64, it turns
out, has very little in the way of what you would later learn is called an API.
Controlling the Commodore 64 mostly involves writing to memory addresses that
have been given special meaning by the circuitry.</p>

<p>The many years you ultimately spend writing to those special boxes stick with
you. Even many decades later, when you find yourself programming a machine with
an extensive graphics or sound API, you know that, behind the curtain, the API
is ultimately writing to those boxes or something like them. You will sometimes
wonder about younger programmers that have only ever used APIs, and wonder what
they must think the API is doing for them. Maybe they think that the API is
calling some other, hidden API. But then what do think that hidden API is
calling? You will pity those younger programmers, because they must be very
confused indeed.</p>
