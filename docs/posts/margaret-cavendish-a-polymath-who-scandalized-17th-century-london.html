Francesca Peacock</p><hr/><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/25/garden/hers.html" title="">Margaret Cavendish</a> was an intrepid and prolific writer of the 17th century, who — despite the efforts of many scholars and enthusiasts — is now less well-known than <a href="https://www.twentytrees.co.uk/History/England/Paternal/Cavendish.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her family’s</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/13/business/media/no-seriously-save-the-bananas.html" title="">namesake banana</a>.</p><p>Reading Francesca Peacock’s cantering new biography, I thought of that immortal smackdown from “Mean Girls” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/movies/film-review-tribal-rites-of-teenage-girls-who-rule-by-terror.html" title="">movie,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/theater/mean-girls-review-broadway-musical.html" title="">musical</a> and soon-to-be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtdbEgnUOk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">movie musical</a>): “Gretchen! Stop trying to make ‘fetch’ happen. It’s not going to happen.”</p><p>For centuries, people have been trying to make Margaret Cavendish happen — beginning with Margaret Cavendish, born Lucas and educated in “shreds and patches,” who once declared “all I desire is fame.” To that end she wed William, the horsy Marquis of Newcastle 30 years her senior, and — in defiant lieu of children — published poetry, plays, philosophy and prose romances under her own byline, which was very unusual for that era.</p></div></div><div><p>Cavendish’s versatility of genre, as well as her gender, surely undermined her bid at a celebrity afterlife; her work could easily be dismissed as dilettantism. Her dynamic if perhaps daffy-sounding theory of matter, a.k.a. “vitalist materialism” — roughly, that inanimate objects may have some element of thought and feeling — presaged Marie Kondo’s instructions to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/realestate/marie-kondo-pandemic-clutter.html" title="">thank the stuff</a> we no longer want before discarding. She wrote about lesbianism and cross-dressing in a period when it was bold to do so. Also, her own clothes were distractingly fabulous.</p></div><div><div><p>William was supportive of his wife’s talents (“pure wit” is his compliment) and supremely well-connected, entertaining Descartes and Hobbes at the same dinner party in Paris and renting Rubens’s house from his widow in Antwerp. Their relationship reminded me of that between George Lewes and George Eliot, analyzed in Clare Carlisle’s excellent book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/13/books/the-marriage-question-george-eliot-clare-carlisle.html" title="">“The Marriage Question.”</a> Though William and Margaret sometimes collaborated, his own writing and personal ambition were far eclipsed by hers.</p><p>For the elaborate, engraved frontispiece to one of her books, Cavendish posed as if a Greek statue, flanked by likenesses of Athena and Apollo. Attending the premiere of William’s play “The Humorous Lovers,” she not only freed both nipples but festooned them in scarlet, arousing the interest of, among many others, the diarist Samuel Pepys.</p><p>Eons before Madonna <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/books/the-empress-has-no-clothes.html" title="">staged similar displays</a>, Cavendish was known (cruelly, Peacock maintains) as “Mad Madge.” Virginia Woolf wrote that she had “t<a href="https://www.virginiawoolfproject.com/the-common-reader-by-virginia-woolf-1925/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he freakishness of an elf</a>” in “The Common Reader,” and infamously likened her to a “giant cucumber” in a bed of flowers in “A Room of One’s Own. “ “She should have had a microscope put in her hand,” Woolf lamented, re Cavendish’s lack of formal training.</p><p>But Peacock suggests this was a spirit too kinetic to be contained by the scientific method. Cavendish was the first woman to be invited to visit the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Royal Society</a>, she notes, but its measured and measuring men didn’t know what to do with her. And no wonder, since she had also written what is now widely acknowledged as one of the first examples of science fiction, “The Blazing World,” (1666) which charmingly imagines a portal to another realm through the North Pole.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Contemporary fans have included the comic-book colossus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/alan-moore-by-the-book.html" title="">Alan Moore</a> and Siri Hustvedt, whose 2014 novel shares its title.</p><p>Cavendish has also inspired at least one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/books/review/danielle-duttons-margaret-the-first.html" title="">historical novel</a> as well as several other biographies. Our own world, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/climate/its-always-fire-season-now.html" title="">more flaming</a> than blazing, does not strictly need another one — and yet even through piles of research Peacock comes across like an energetic arrival to a musty bedchamber, flinging open the windows to let new light in and plumping up the pillows.</p><p>One of eight children raised by a well-off but socially isolated widow, Margaret herself did time as one of many ladies-in-waiting in the court of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1937/01/24/archives/queen-henrietta-maria-and-charles-is-england-henrietta-maria-and.html" title="">Queen Henrietta Maria</a>, following her into exile in France. She hotly resented the “endless standing and sitting around” in the outermost of a series of nested royal rooms most definitely not of one’s own.</p><p>Ere long, soldiers had stormed her childhood home; exhumed her ancestors, scattering their bones; and triumphantly donned wigs made from her dead mother and sister’s hair. Her escape through Brest, besieged by the Parliamentary navy and followed by dysentery and depression, was so harrowing that Cavendish left it out of her autobiography, “A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding and Life,” which first appeared as an appendix to a collection of disparate writings called “Natures Pictures&#34; in 1656, when she was 33.</p><p>“Pure Wit” thoroughly acquaints you with Cavendish’s background and milieu, but her writing can be harder to cathect to, in part because her poor penmanship and spelling muddied publication, with editions revised repeatedly over the years. Peacock argues her work deserves the same scrutiny and careful attention as that of her male contemporaries. “I have left Cavendish’s distinctive orthography untouched in places where to chaing it wold bee to risk losing something vitall from the original,” she writes with a wink.</p><p>As Judy Chicago did with her benchmark feminist work “The Dinner Party,” one in a flurry of modern citations (and misdated here in what is perhaps a Cavendishy typo), Peacock works hard to situate her subject alongside other iconoclasts. This is probably the first time Cavendish has been likened to David Bowie and bell hooks, and it would no doubt delight her, even if the academy harrumphs.</p><p><strong>PURE WIT</strong>: <strong>The Revolutionary Life of Margaret Cavendish</strong> | <!-- -->Francesca Peacock<!-- --> | <!-- -->Pegasus<!-- --> | <!-- -->384 pp.<!-- --> | <!-- -->$29.95</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 3, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>A picture with an earlier version of this review was published in error.
