    <h1>Ask HN: What do you monitor on your servers?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We&#39;ve been developing the BlueWave Uptime Manager [1] for the past 5 months with a team of 7 developers and 3 external contributors, and till today we always went under the radar.</p><p>As we move towards expanding from basic uptime tracking to a comprehensive monitoring solution, we&#39;re interested in getting insights from the community.</p><p>For those of you managing server infrastructure,</p><p>- What are the key assets you monitor beyond the basics like CPU, RAM, and disk usage?</p><p>- Do you also keep tabs on network performance, processes, services, or other metrics?</p><p>Additionally, we&#39;re debating whether to build a custom monitoring agent or leverage existing solutions like OpenTelemetry or Fluentd.</p><p>- What’s your take—would you trust a simple, bespoke agent, or would you feel more secure with a well-established solution?</p><p>- Lastly, what’s your preference for data collection—do you prefer an agent that pulls data or one that pushes it to the monitoring system?</p><p>[1] https://github.com/bluewave-labs/bluewave-uptime</p></div></div></div>
