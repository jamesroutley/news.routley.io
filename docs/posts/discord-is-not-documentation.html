    <h1>Discord Is Not Documentation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>I&#39;m going to be slightly contrarian and say that I <em>like</em> Discord. It&#39;s great to be able to get real-time help on a problem. And it is fun to see, again in real-time, what other people are working on and struggling with.</p><p>In truth, Discord is no harder to sign up to than Slack, Matrix, Gitter, IRC, or whatever. And of course Open Source projects will follow the maxim of &#34;go where your audience are&#34;. There&#39;s no point posting everything to MySpace when everyone&#39;s already on Facebook.</p><p>Do I care that Discord isn&#39;t open source? Well, kinda. But I can open it in Firefox and it works just fine.</p><p>Discord is perfect for <em>ephemeral</em> communications.</p><p>But it is not a fucking substitute for documentation!</p><p>I&#39;m currently getting started, and increasingly frustrated, with the <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/">Watchy</a> development platform. They&#39;ve effectively said &#34;here&#39;s a barebones guide to setting it up - anything else, ask on Discord&#34; - and it fucking sucks.</p><p>There&#39;s no API documentation - I have to scroll through a million messages to find anything.</p><p>I can&#39;t use search, because people don&#39;t know how to thread. So I can see questions but not replies.</p><p>When I do find replies, it&#39;s hard to know how relevant they are.  A typical Discord chat looks like:</p><ul><li>Alice: What&#39;s the command to go fullscreen?</li><li>Bob: Anyone know how I irrevocably format my disk without confirmation?</li><li>Carol: Oh, yeah, it&#39;s easy. Just pass the <code>-f</code> flag.</li></ul><p>Errrr...</p><p>And then you get the people who get snippy with newbie for asking a question which is frequently seen!  So infuriating.</p><p>I&#39;m not necessarily advocating for <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">the Four-Document Model</a> - which has <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/problems-with-the-4doc-model/">some critics</a> - but I just don&#39;t understand why wouldn&#39;t at least collate all of the common questions and put the answers in one place.</p><p>Look, writing a FAQ is probably not the right way to approach comprehensive documentation. But if you can&#39;t even be bothered to do that, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t be releasing a product in the first place?</p><p>/rant</p></div></article></div>
