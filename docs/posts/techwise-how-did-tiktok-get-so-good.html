    <h1>Ask HN: Techwise, how did TikTok get so good?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You may like or dislike Tiktok based on it&#39;s content and style of delivering that content but I think everyone has to admit that technically it is quite the achievement.</p><p>It&#39;s video based and delivers video really well. It rarely buffers or fails to load. Compare that to the Reddit video player or the Twitter video player or Vimeo. It&#39;s much better. Netflix loads poorly initially for me quite a bit (granted it&#39;s trying to load much higher quality).</p><p>How did they manage to get the engineering talent when seemingly FB, MS, Netflix, Amazon, Google are all fighting for that talent?</p></div></div></div>
