        <h3>What is Paged Out!?</h3>
        <p><b>Paged Out! is a free experimental (one article == one page) technical magazine</b> about programming
            (especially programming tricks!), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">security hacking</a>, retro computers, modern
            computers, electronics, demoscene, and other similar topics.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s <b>made by the community for the community</b>. And it&#39;s not-for-profit (though in time, we hope it will be self-sustained) - this means that the issues will always be free to download, share, and print.</p>

The scene is bathed in shades of purple and pink neon lights, illuminating various signs and the outlines of the buildings. The architecture is dense with towering skyscrapers and multiple levels of infrastructure that suggest a highly urban environment. The city has a vertical design, with deep chasms between the buildings, and a clear view of the sky above, which features a digital grid pattern, adding to the digital, cybernetic vibe of the image. On top left there is the magazine&#39;s logo - an icon of an old computer and text saying Paged Out! in capital letters."/></a></p></div>
