    <h1>It wasn&#39;t for nothing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several friends and family members have asked me why I spend so much of my free time developing Guix.  I don&#39;t always have a good answer, but after six years I&#39;m starting to get a sense of it.</p><p>First of all, it&#39;s <em>fun</em>.  It&#39;s fun to make my own operating system.  I can design it exactly how I want it, from the inner workings to the user interface.</p><p>It&#39;s also <em>rewarding</em>.  While I haven&#39;t been as active on the patch tracker as I&#39;d like lately, it gives a sense of awe and accomplishment to aid new contributors from beginners to &#34;professionals&#34;.  It&#39;s also something of a dopamine rush to perform huge migrations like switching to a new C compiler or Python version upgrades (these activities feel more like an addiction than a hobby, but rewarding nonetheless).</p><p>The work <em>feels important</em>.  Guix occupies an underserved niche in the operating system &#34;market&#34;.  Namely one that offers full reproducibility, transparency, and provenance, of every package, and every operating system generation.  It also integrates a neat scripting language where you can string together any package into one deterministic script.  Think of it like a shell script where every command is lazily instantiated by the package manager on demand.  You don&#39;t even have to use Scheme, you can write in your favorite language and run it through <code>guix shell</code> and get the same deterministic guarantees.  If you note the Guix revision (as given by <code>guix describe</code>), you can use <code>guix time-machine</code> to reproduce the exact same environment in the future, bit by bit (at least <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org">in theory</a>).</p><p>Guix is <em>pure</em>.  It&#39;s refreshing to know that I can take any package and reuse its source code for my own purposes without having to worry about commercial restrictions or redistribution.  It&#39;s reassuring to know that all packages are <a href="https://bootstrappable.org">bootstrapped</a> and not just some <a href="https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2021/09/whats-in-a-package/">random binary blobs</a>.  Guix is also immensely hackable, it&#39;s easy to add extra packages or services without submitting them, either by creating a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/html_node/Channels.html">channel</a> or &#34;inlining&#34; straight in the OS configuration.</p><p>But most importantly, Guix <em>saved my life</em>.  When I first started contributing to Guix I did not have any direction in life, any sense of purpose or belonging.  I&#39;d been using GNU/Linux for a long time, been a &#34;power user&#34; of Debian, Gentoo, and NixOS, but did not contribute much to any either because packaging was too much work, or I didn&#39;t enjoy the community, or I found the packaging standards &#34;too low&#34;.  With Guix I finally felt <em>home</em>, it ticked all the boxes, the language is a joy to work with (even though it felt weird in the beginning), and it also desperately needed developers.</p><p>I know some are disappointed that I have prioritized a hobby over doing &#34;normal&#34; things like chasing an exciting career or strengthening my social network.  But without Guix I would still be a confused alcoholic with daddy issues crashing on someones couch.  I have now been with Guix for longer than I held any job, and am finally feeling some stability in life; and a desire to explore other creative outlets such as blogging (hi!), cooking, growing sustainable foods; and healthy activities like climbing and skiing.</p><p>None of this would be possible without Guix, and the (occasionally reluctant) support from my awesome friends and family.  So thank you.  It wasn&#39;t for nothing.  Rather the opposite.</p></div></div>
