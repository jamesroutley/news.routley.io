<p>There were many reasons why I left Oracle shortly after it acquired Sun, but
first among them: I could not stomach the disdain that Oracle had for its own
customers. Sun — for all of its (many!) other faults — loved its customers.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I was recently contacted by a former Sun colleague,
who had some technical questions about Oxide. His career had taken him to
VMware and now to Broadcom, where he has a senior engineering management
position.
After answering the questions, I asked him how things were going at Broadcom.
He left Sun before the Oracle transition, but I could see potential cultural
similarities in the Broadcom acquisition of VMware — and I imagine it could
be jarring.</p>
<p>The response surprised me: &#34;It’s much needed. Broadcom is a breath of fresh
air.&#34; Now, sometimes an acquirer makes important decisions that employees feel
are overdue. Still, though, I’ve talked to a lot of former VMware customers,
and…​ &#34;breath of fresh air&#34; is decidedly not how they describe it.
So I asked the obvious follow-up: &#34;How are customers feeling about it?&#34;</p>
<p>His response speaks for itself: &#34;Actually the majority of them are extremely
happy about the product changes. I think the transition to subscription and to
core licensing is never easy but we got past that. We have customers signing
very long contracts right now which means they are not looking to change. Btw
some that tried came crawling back lol&#34;</p>
<p>That last sentence — &#34;some that tried came crawling back lol&#34; — made my
stomach turn, reminding me viscerally of the contempt that Oracle had for its
own customers that I had found so loathsome. I was a bit stunned; had my
former colleague taken nothing away from Sun with respect to earning customer
trust?!
And my response was arguably a bit flip: &#34;Just don’t ask AT&amp;T, Fidelity, Tesco
and United Healthcare, I guess? Or do those get counted in the &#39;crawling back&#39;
category?&#34; (Of note: these VMware customers have all litigated against
Broadcom.)</p>
<p>His response was consistent with what he’d already revealed about his own
character — but no less galling: &#34;Yes actually they all did. Again litigation
doesn’t mean they moved on.&#34;</p>
<p>So I guess it needs to be said: suing your customers is gross — and being
sued by your customers is shameful. Companies that have disdain for their own
customers will be reviled in return. Such companies may be able to thrive in
the short term, but they do not endure in the limit. Certainly, these
companies not endure as innovators: when coercion is your business model,
innovation is not merely unnecessary but actively antithetical.</p>
<p>At Oxide, we believe that the best companies — the most enduring ones — love
their customers, and we have made this explicit in
<a href="https://oxide.computer/principles">our mission</a>.
Our love for our customers has any number of manifestations but not least: we
believe in innovating on our customer’s behalf — in working hard to solve
their thorniest problems. When we set out, we said that we aspired to be &#34;the
kind of company that customers will love to buy from — and employees will be
proud to work for.&#34; Six years on, it a single source of pride for us that we
are succeeding in both of these dimensions, with heartfelt thanks and deep
appreciation (and happy holidays!) to our customers and team!</p>
