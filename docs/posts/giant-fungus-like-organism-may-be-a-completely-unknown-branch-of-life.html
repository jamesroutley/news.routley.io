This species was much smaller than many other species of <em>Prototaxites</em>, only growing up to a few inches tall, but it is still the largest <em>Prototaxites</em> specimen found in this region.</p><p>Upon examining the internal structure of the fossilized <em>Prototaxites</em>, the researchers found that its interior was made up of a series of tubes, similar to those within a fungus. But these tubes branched off and reconnected in ways very unlike those seen in modern fungi.</p><p>&#34;We report that <em>Prototaxites taiti</em> was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi,&#34; the researchers wrote in the paper. &#34;We therefore conclude that <em>Prototaxites</em> was not a fungus, and instead propose it is best assigned to a now entirely extinct terrestrial lineage.&#34;</p><p>True fungi from the same period have also been preserved in the Rhynie chert, enabling the researchers to chemically compare them to <em>Prototaxites</em>. In addition to their unique structural characteristics, the team found that the <em>Prototaxites</em> fossils left completely different chemical signatures to the fungi fossils, indicating that the <em>Prototaxites</em> did not contain chitin, a major building block of fungal cell walls and a hallmark of the fungal kingdom. The <em>Prototaxites</em> fossils instead appeared to contain chemicals similar to lignin, which is found in the wood and bark of plants.</p><p>&#34;We conclude that the morphology and molecular fingerprint of <em>P. taiti</em> is clearly distinct from that of the fungi and other organism preserved alongside it in the Rhynie chert, and we suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes,&#34; the researchers wrote.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/charles-boyce" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.stanford.edu/charles-boyce" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Kevin Boyce</u></a>, a professor at Stanford University, led the 2007 study that posited <em>Prototaxites</em> is a giant fungus and was not involved in this new research.
