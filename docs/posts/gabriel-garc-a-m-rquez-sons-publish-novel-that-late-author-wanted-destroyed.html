There are no additions, there are no great changes. So there really wasn&#39;t any discussion there.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;We did think about it for about three seconds - was it a betrayal to my parents, to my father&#39;s [wishes]?</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;And we decided, yes, it was a betrayal. But that&#39;s what children are for.&#34;</p><p dir="ltr">He said it was bound to eventually be published, so the family wanted to publish a version they approved of, and which would protect its copyright.</p><div><figure><div><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="Gonzalo García Barcha" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png" width="976" height="549" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/240/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/320/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/480/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/624/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/800/cpsprodpb/14EC9/production/_132850758_gonzalogarcabarcha1.png 800w" fallback="" attribution="Getty Images"></amp-img><p role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</p></div><figcaption dir="ltr"><span role="text"><span>Image caption, </span><p>Gonzalo García Barcha said he believes this new book is unique</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">The novel centres on a middle-aged woman who travels alone to an island every summer to visit her mother&#39;s grave, and during each trip takes a new lover despite being happily married.</p><p dir="ltr">It is the first time that García Márquez has centred on a female protagonist. </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/books/gabriel-garcia-marquez-until-august-review-2936028" aria-label="The i newspaper&#39;s Max Liu, external">The i newspaper&#39;s Max Liu</a> said &#34;his family and his publishers should have respected his wishes&#34; to not publish the book.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;Usually, in a review of an underwhelming posthumous publication or minor work by a major author, it is worth saying that, despite its flaws, it will delight devoted fans.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;I do not believe that is true of Until August. Márquez knew this and was right not to want it to see the light of day,&#34; he continued. </p><p dir="ltr"><h2 id="Oddly-moving" tabindex="-1">&#39;Oddly moving&#39;</h2></p><p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, he added that the &#34;novel has qualities&#34; and &#34;it is set in a world that strikes an evocative balance between the real and dreamlike&#34;.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;It&#39;s as if the book contained both Marquez the elder and Marquez the younger, with the perception and weary good humour of old age conveyed in the searching, tentative manner of the apprentice,&#34; she wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">She noted, however, that the &#34;the novel is stripped of the endless, inventive discursions into folk-tale, backstory and verbal brio that characterise the best of Marquez&#34;.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;Until August does nothing to enlarge the legend of Gabo; it does nothing to diminish it,&#34; she concluded.</p><p dir="ltr"><h2 id="Netflix-plans" tabindex="-1">Netflix plans</h2></p><p dir="ltr">As well as a new book, Márquez&#39;s 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is being adapted into a Spanish-language Netflix series. </p><p dir="ltr">According to the New York Times, Márquez received many offers over the years to adapt his book into a film but refused because he only wanted it to be done in Spanish.</p><p dir="ltr">García Márquez&#39;s book is not the first novel to be published posthumously against the authors&#39; wishes. </p><div dir="ltr"><ul dir="ltr" role="list"><li role="listitem">Before author <b>Franz Kafka</b> died from tuberculosis in 1924, he told friend Max Brod to burn all of his work.
