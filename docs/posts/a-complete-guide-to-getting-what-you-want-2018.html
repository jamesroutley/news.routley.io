<p><em>*** </em></p>
<p>It’s not always polite to say it so plainly, but we all want things.</p>
<p>The objects of our desires differ, but we all spend much of our lives preoccupied with obtaining, having, achieving, and enjoying things, of both the material and abstract sort.</p>
<p>Our species wouldn’t have survived if we didn’t have powerful wants, but we’re still often embarrassed by them. Everybody wants more money, but we’re not supposed to say that. We want recognition from others. We want to work less and relax more.</p>
<p>We want dessert. We want sex. We want ease, freedom from obligation, and advantages that might seem unfair if someone else had them. We want to be hot.</p>
<p>Desires are taboo in human cultures, and not without reason. Because desires are what motivate human behavior, we know they can motivate violence, depravity, addiction, and hatred. Every religion seems to devote a lot of its scripture to desire-management strategies, urging restraint and renunciation, and punishing covetousness, or at least warning us of its consequences.</p>
<p>However, no matter what taboos we live under, we all have desires, and we shouldn’t be embarrassed about that basic fact. It’s okay to want things.</p>
<p>It can even be okay—depending on how we go about it—to try to get those things. <span id="more-8264"></span></p>
<p>We don’t only want terrible things, after all. Along with my desires for cookies and afternoons off, I do experience desires to clean behind the stove, eat leafy greens, and be a good neighbor.</p>
<p>It doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> make us into monsters to try to get something we want, even if we don’t have any reasons other<img decoding="async" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dj-200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133"/> than that we want it. In fact, it’s hard to say what else we human beings are doing with our lives. Every human act is a function of desire, from turning on a light switch to writing a play.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, we all want a home, some physical and financial security, some pleasurable experiences, some good relationships, and a sense of achievement and self-worth.</p>
<p>Beyond these basics, our desires can vary a lot. Some people want to climb horrible, frozen mountains for some reason. Others want to photograph all fifty-four remaining covered bridges in New Hampshire. You may want an immaculate lawn, or visibly distinct abdominal muscles, or an encyclopedic knowledge of chess openings. I want to paint my living room bright green.</p>
<p>The older I become, and the more objects of desire I either get or fail to get, the simpler the whole game of getting what I want seems. It turns out there’s a basic strategy that seems to apply in the pursuit of most desires, from hosting your first dinner party to starting a shoe store.</p>
<p>A few caveats before we get to that:</p>
<p>Firstly, there are things we want that are not possible to get, or, more often, not worthwhile. Practicing <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2017/11/opting-out/">renunciation</a> makes sense in this case. Completing a 600-mile <a href="https://www.4deserts.com">series of desert ultramarathons</a> might be a glorious achievement to reminisce about, but not glorious enough to justify the training time, cost, and horror of the actual experience.</p>
<p>Yet the desire can still be there, and renouncing it might make you happier than pursuing it (or even achieving it). Same for becoming a rock star, marrying a famous footballer, or driving across town to pick up a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry’s at 9:25pm.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/johanna-dahlberg-200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="186"/>There can also be things you think you want (a law degree; a Walden-like shack in the woods) that you mistake for what you<em> really</em> want (your father’s approval; a less obnoxious boss), which may be vastly easier, or vastly more difficult, to acquire.</p>
<p>And a final caveat, which is quite important: getting what we want doesn’t actually <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2016/05/what-we-want/">satisfy us permanently</a>. Everything you’ve ever wanted and then obtained, except maybe for the very latest thing, is probably not providing any great satisfaction at this moment. Both evolutionary psychology and Eastern philosophy testify directly to this point—we’ve evolved to persistently overestimate how happy getting what we want will make us, and how lasting that happiness will be.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say it never makes sense to pursue a desire. We just have to be discerning, and aware that there’s no dessert, sum of money, or seat upgrade out there that will cure us of our desirous nature.</p>
<h3>How to Get What You Want</h3>
<p>Even with those caveats in mind, that still leaves a lot desires and aspirations that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are achievable</li>
<li>are worth achieving</li>
<li>can be pursued without becoming a bad person</li>
</ul>
<p>Even some of the more taboo wants—more money, more influence, more sex, more time to do nothing, might be perfectly reasonable, achievable, and worthwhile.</p>
<p>So when it comes to pursuing the desires that pass the sensibility test, it seems to me that the same five steps work for pretty much anything:</p>
<p><strong>1. Identify something you want</strong></p>
<p>Not everything, just something. There’s no way to get everything you want. But in order to get <em>something </em>you want, you need to identify it first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/redd-angelo-170.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="255" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/redd-angelo-170.jpg 170w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/redd-angelo-170-128x192.jpg 128w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px"/>We often never quite get to that point. We just know we want something else. It’s like when you ask your partner what they want to get for dinner, and they say, “Uhhh… not Chinese”—it’s an understandable sentiment, but it’s not enough information to act on.</p>
<p>Many of our desires are born of some kind of dissatisfaction, and so they often stall at this “I don’t know what I want, but not this” stage. Get concrete. Do you want to be self-employed? Or do you just need some time off from your normally-tolerable day job? Do you truly want washboard abs, or just to see an energetic, healthy person in the mirror for once?</p>
<p>Just a little discernment here—a little bit of “what if” visualization—goes a long way. I won’t go into a “SMART goals” sermon, but some specificity is necessary if you want to actually want to go after something.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that you don’t. But don’t forget to ask yourself.</p>
<p><strong>2. Identify conflicting wants and sort them out</strong></p>
<p>I want to be fit. I also want to never exercise.</p>
<p>I want to earn more money. I also want to stick to things I’m already good at.</p>
<p>Quite often a reasonable, achievable, and worthwhile desire goes unpursued because we have a simultaneous desire to <em>not</em> pursue it. When we say something is “impossible” or “too hard” or “not in the cards,” that’s a clue.</p>
<p>Which is actually better, do you think? Being fit or being sedentary, with all the costs of each accounted for? You’ve probably tried at least the second one—how many stars would you give it if you were reviewing it on Yelp?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rawpixel-200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="139"/>Remember that coasting along with the status quo is a behavior that’s also born of desire, so count it as just another aspiration—the one you have been pursuing so far.</p>
<p>Here’s a shortcut: the conflicting want is usually a desire to avoid discomfort, which is always a risk with new things. So check for that. I’m convinced that nothing buys us more in life than the willingness to <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2018/03/the-burn/">explore discomfort</a>.</p>
<p>Quite often, looking back after making a change, I’ve found that there was far more discomfort in what I was already doing than in the new, “daunting” thing, which explains where the desire came from in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn how other people have already gotten the thing you want</strong></p>
<p>It’s unlikely that you want something that has never been attained by anyone else, even if your goal is to <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a19692331/running-boston-marathon-backward/">run a marathon backwards</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)">write a novel without the letter E in it</a>.</p>
<p>It has never been easier to find out exactly how to achieve bizarre and difficult feats. It’s absurdly easy, in fact, and our pre-internet forefathers would be shocked at how flippantly we ignore this spectacular advantage. Just Google it—“How to afford a trip to Japan”; “How to start an online business”; “How to build a tree house like in Swiss Family Robinson.” Answers abound.</p>
<p>If you have to, get in contact with someone who has actually done the thing in question, even if it’s jut by email. This is also easier than ever.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do what they did, if it seems sensible to you</strong></p>
<p>Given what you learn from your research, make a plan.</p>
<p>Start with the most direct, straightforward method. Make that your starting point. Before you start getting antsy about the hard parts, imagine how you’d go about your task if you had no fears and unlimited tolerance for discomfort. [Here’s a great <a href="https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/03/the-most-direct-solution-to-any-problem/">Steve Pavlina article</a> on doing exactly that.]</p>
<p>Then notice how the escape-artist part of the mind jumps in, trying to modify this sensible, proven plan to make it<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adam-birkett-170.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="234" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adam-birkett-170.jpg 170w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adam-birkett-170-139x192.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px"/> somehow easy or painless. This is the conflicting desire to avoid discomfort and uncertainty.</p>
<p>If you catch yourself trying to plan your achievement in a way that completely avoids discomfort, then your real aspiration has won out, and you need to ask yourself whether you’re serious about your Himalayan trek or seven-figure business. The farther your plan deviates from established “best practices” (i.e. how the people who actually achieve your goal tend to do it), the more likely it is that you don’t actually intend to do it.</p>
<p>It’s possible (but unlikely) that the most straightforward plan isn’t appropriate for your particular situation, and needs modification. But be honest with yourself about whether that’s true, and expect to your mind to try to find a “free lunch” approach at least once during the planning process.</p>
<p><strong>5. Adjust course as needed (but only as needed)</strong></p>
<p>So you’ve got a plan, and you’re actually moving through the steps. Your covered bridges scrapbook or ancient-Greece-themed dinner party is actually coming together.</p>
<p>If you’re progressing at a decent trajectory, no problem.</p>
<p>If not, ask these questions, in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Am I following the plan?</em>  — If not, follow the plan. (This is most likely the problem.)</li>
<li><em>Is there some small part of the plan I need to do differently? —</em> If so, do that.</li>
<li><em>Do I honestly need a different plan than this, knowing what I know now?</em> — If so, find a plan that makes sense from where you are, and follow it.</li>
<li><em>Do I believe my goal is impossible, or not worthwhile?</em> — Then quit and do something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, almost all snags and troubles have been experienced, and addressed, by others before you. Google them!</p>
<h3><strong>Your desires are important only to you</strong></h3>
<p>Surely there are people in your life who want you to be happy. At least I hope there are. But that doesn’t mean they want you to pursue happiness in the way you intend to.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/natalya-moshnina200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/natalya-moshnina200.jpg 200w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/natalya-moshnina200-144x192.jpg 144w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"/>Your parents might want nothing more than for you to be happy. But that’s technically <em>their </em>goal, and you can bet they have a different vision of how it’s best achieved. They may not see, for example, how backpacking in Asia for six months is a better life strategy for you than finding a stable job and getting married.</p>
<p>And maybe they’re right. But the point is that quite often, even the people who love you<em> don’t want you to get what you want</em>, because it conflicts with what they want.</p>
<p>(And don’t forget that it works the other way too.)</p>
<h3>The Real Barrier to Getting What You Want</h3>
<p>Everything is easier said than done of course, but that doesn’t mean getting what you want entails anything more complex than continually moving towards the wanted thing, the best you currently know how, adjusting course as needed.</p>
<p>Social and emotional factors it make it seem more complicated than that. Taboos about greed and self-indulgence makes us ambivalent, and worried about tall-poppy syndrome. Then there’s the problem of the people around us wanting different things for us.</p>
<p>But it’s our conflicting desire for predictability and comfort that is the real invisible fence. Here’s the big secret of getting what you want, as it seems to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of us can do incredible things, but the more incredible the thing in question, the more we will simultaneously want to <em>not</em> do it, out of a craving for comfort and certainty.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re fearful creatures after all, with an evolutionary impulse to cling to virtually any tolerable status quo, no matter how dull or crappy it is.</p>
<p>But once we take that reality on board—that fear and uncertainty always come along for the ride in any worthwhile endeavor—it becomes simple. Not easy, but simple. You decide what you want and just do the next thing. And if you don’t know what the next thing is, the next thing is to figure out the next thing.</p>
