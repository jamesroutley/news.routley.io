      <p>My heart breaks for would-be homeowners priced out of housing markets across the country. We need to do something to bring the price of all houses down, except the house I own and plan to sell for one (or many) million dollars.</p>
<p>People deserve to buy a home at a price they can afford, a price that will somehow also cover my entire initial investment, three decades‚Äô worth of repairs and home improvements, allow me to purchase a new condo in an expensive coastal city, and fund the next two decades of my retirement. It‚Äôs that simple.</p>
<p>Take a look on Zillow and you‚Äôll see how wildly expensive housing has become out there, and by ‚Äúout there,‚Äù I mean ‚Äúon my property.‚Äù Just look at my asking price; sort the list from ‚ÄúMost Expensive.‚Äù</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at the lines of would-be buyers outside any home that just hit the market. I can‚Äôt believe how many people are fighting for the same house, and that‚Äôs exactly what I said to my realtor after telling him to jack up my asking price. The market is so hot, papa needs some sunscreen.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is this: it‚Äôs so important that new housing is affordable, because there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôm accepting anything less than a 20 percent return on my own home.</p>
<p>Some people say we should throw up as much housing as possible to lower prices, but we can‚Äôt let big developers reap the rewards of our housing market. I should reap those rewards; I‚Äôm the one who purchased a new home in a redlined suburb on a week‚Äôs salary in 1975.</p>
<p>Maybe prices will go down a bit, but we‚Äôre supposed to cheer when the price of a house goes from $500,000 to $300,000? That doesn‚Äôt help people who can‚Äôt afford a $300,000 house or people who would rather shave themselves bald and jump in a freezing pond than sell for anything less than seven figures. These groups surely have compatible interests.</p>
<p>We must balance those interests, like the desire of millions of people to have shelter, and my desire to go ‚ÄúBoca Mode‚Äù in a South Florida condominium called ‚ÄúEl Regalo.‚Äù These things can‚Äôt exist if we don‚Äôt simultaneously ensure housing is cheap and abundant, and also an incredibly scarce resource so I can sell it for a king‚Äôs ransom.</p>
<p>A house is so many things. A refuge, a sanctuary, an investment so important to me that I‚Äôm willing to destroy an entire generation‚Äôs chance at housing in order to lock in my own profits.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm also a reasonable person. If it‚Äôs absolutely necessary, I will support building new housing to lower prices, just as soon as my own sale clears escrow. Once this snowbird leaves town, they can build a chocolate castle for all I care.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future all housing can be affordable, and that all of it can be built anywhere except in my backyard.</p>
