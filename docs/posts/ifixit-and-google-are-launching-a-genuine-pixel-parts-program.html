    <h1>iFixit and Google Are Launching a Genuine Pixel Parts Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>We’re delighted to announce that we are <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Google" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ifixit.com/Google">working with Google</a> to sell genuine parts for Pixel phones, starting later this year.  You can learn more about it in <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/pixel-phone-repairs">Google’s blog post</a>.</p>



<p>We will be continuing to write our step-by-step <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Phone">Google Pixel phone</a> repair guides, which are comprehensive going all the way back to the original Pixel. Repair guides are live for every Pixel through the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_5">Pixel 5</a>, and we are writing guides for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_5a">5a</a>, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_6">6</a>, and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_6_Pro">6 Pro</a> right now.</p>



<p>Our parts selection will include everything you need for the most common Google Pixel repairs—batteries, displays, cameras, and more. We will sell them both individually and as part of Fix Kits, which include all the tools you need to fix your Google Pixel, from screwdriver bits to spudgers. </p>



<p>Starting later this year, genuine Pixel spare parts will be available for purchase at ifixit.com for <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_2">Pixel 2</a> through <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_6_Pro">Pixel 6 Pro</a>, as well as future Pixel models, in the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store">US</a>, <a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/">UK</a>, <a href="https://canada.ifixit.com/">Canada</a>, <a href="https://australia.ifixit.com/">Australia</a>, and <a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/">European Union</a> countries where Pixel is available.</p>



<p>Each kit comes with the iOpener, our opening tool designed to apply heat directly and evenly to case components joined with adhesive. The kits also include replacement pre-cut adhesive for securing and re-waterproofing your Pixel.</p>

<p>Google already provides <a href="https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/udfps">the software</a> required to calibrate new fingerprint sensors upon installation to the public for free.</p>



<p>We have been collaborating with Google’s team to improve repairability of Pixel phones for the last five years and look forward to continuing that relationship.</p>



<p>“If we’re going to build a sustainable electronics industry, consumers must have options to repair products themselves. Google is making repair more affordable and accessible, even in places without repair shops. We are committed to enabling repairs at a place and time of your choosing,” says iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens. </p>



<p>With this program, Google joins a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/58484/manufacturers-are-joining-the-fight-for-repair">growing list of manufacturers</a> leading the industry by supporting repair. We’re thrilled to be able to support manufacturers in enabling people to fix things themselves.</p>
