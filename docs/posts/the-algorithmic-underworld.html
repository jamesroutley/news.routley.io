<h2><strong>The Rise of Governance</strong></h2>

<p>The word governance sounds bureaucratic, even anesthetic—but it’s suddenly everywhere: AI governance, software governance, data governance, DAO governance, platform governance.</p>



<p>Politics hasn’t disappeared. It’s just migrated—from the _polis_ to the organization.</p>



<p>Community gardens, corporations, blockchains, and Discord servers: each now has its own political reality.</p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>All Science Fiction Films Are Dystopian Because…</strong></h2>



<p>In so many sci-fi worlds, we see spectacular displays of political force—</p>



<p>Consider the archive:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Minority Report</em> → predictive policing, pre-crime enforcement</li>



<li><em>RoboCop</em> → corporate capture and automated force</li>



<li><em>Gattaca</em> → genetic stratification and bureaucratic gatekeeping</li>



<li><em>Blade Runner</em> → age enforcement and policing of rebel replicants</li>
</ul>



<p>These worlds are drenched in surveillance, enforcement, and optimized violence.</p>



<p><strong>In technological societies, science fiction shows that power is expressed through enforcement rather than deliberation.</strong></p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>From Lawmaking to Policing</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s my working theory:</p>



<p>As technology saturates everyday life—as Jacques Ellul observed in The Technological Society—techniques control other techniques; we no longer live within laws in the classical sense.</p>



<p>The law is now the algorithm.</p>



<p>We spend our days policing rules we didn’t write, can’t read, and often don’t realize we agreed to—</p>



<p>Governance has become a massive, distributed enforcement engine.</p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>Metrics-as-Reality</strong></h2>



<p>This transformation is entangled with what I can only call the <strong>Business-Intelligencification of the world</strong>—the reduction of life to metrics:</p>



<p>Clicks per minute.</p>



<p>We now inhabit a recursive loop:</p>



<p>1 → We gather enormous datasets (“the more the merrier”).</p>



<p>First, we build a numerical simulacrum.</p>



<p>Humans still “sign off,” but we’re mostly rubber-stamping decisions that algorithms have already made.</p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>Governance, Politics, and Optimization</strong></h2>



<p>Operations Research is the science of optimal decision-making in complex systems.</p>



<p>Classical political theory asked <strong>who rules</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>the people → democracy</li>



<li>the elite → aristocracy</li>



<li>the wealthy → oligarchy</li>



<li>the one → monarchy</li>
</ul>



<p>But contemporary politics is defined by <strong>what we optimize</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>biopolitics</strong> → optimizing populations</li>



<li><strong>necropolitics</strong> → optimizing exclusion and disposability</li>



<li><strong>ecopolitics</strong> → optimizing ecological survivability</li>



<li><strong>capitalism</strong> → optimizing profit</li>
</ul>



<p>Every governance system chooses a variable, builds an optimization function,</p>



<p><strong>Show me what you optimize, and I’ll show you the politics you produce.</strong></p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>The Necromantic Roots of Lawmaking</strong></h2>



<p>At the end of Plato’s <em>Laws</em>, the legislators are told to enter the cemetery before dawn</p>



<p>Lawmaking was never just rational design. It includes forces we inherit but do not choose.</p>



<p>And our modern systems are no different.</p>



<p>We still consult the dead— but the “ancestors” are now datasets, archives, logs,</p>



<p>The necromancy never stopped.</p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>Down at the crossroads</strong></h2>



<p>If governance is no longer about legislating for democratic subjects—</p>



<hr/>
