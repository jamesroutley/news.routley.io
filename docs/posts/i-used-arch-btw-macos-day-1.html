      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:
I used Arch Linux for nine years as a daily driver on non-Apple laptops.
I received my new M4 Pro MacBook Pro yesterday.
This recounts my experience configuring it to hit the ground running from day 1.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a Linux user making the switch to Apple Silicon, or thinking of doing so, this post may be of interest.</p>

<p>The way one uses their computer is shaped by their needs, values, and habits.</p>
<p>As of writing, I am midway through my PhD at McGill University and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/directory/yohai-eliel-berreby">Mila</a>, focusing on neuro-AI research at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/physiology/">McGill&#39;s Department of Physiology</a>.

<p>Depending on the needs of the hour, I&#39;ll put on my researcher, engineer, sysadmin, or communicator hat, and I need my computing environment to support this workflow.</p>
<h2 id="nine-beautiful-years-of-arch-linux">Nine Beautiful Years of Arch Linux</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t start out on Linux.
I digitally grew up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7">System 7</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9">Mac OS 9</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard">Mac OS X</a>, in an Apple-centric household where &#34;Windows&#34; was a profanity.
While the UNIX backbone of Mac OS X made it a great introduction to computing, I eventually grew frustrated with the developer experience, exorbitant repair costs (what do you mean, everything is glued or soldered?), lackluster GPU performance, and poor support for projects I wanted to hack on.
As a result, I switched to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> in 2016 after briefly trying Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora.
Since then, I&#39;ve faithfully used Arch as my daily driver on various machines: a trusty <a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/zenbook-ux410/">Asus Zenbook UX410U</a>, two self-built desktop workstations, numerous VirtualBox VMs, two Tuxedo Pulse 15 laptops from <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/">Tuxedo Computers</a>, an Asus TUF A15, and others.
After a couple of early reinstalls, I mostly migrated systems via SSD swaps or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dd"><code>dd</code></a> clones.</p>
<p>From day one, I embraced the Arch spirit, consistently running either <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> or <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> as my tiling window managers of choice, complete with a panel of shortcuts allowing me to get much of my computer use done at the speed of thought. I&#39;m proud to say that over the years, a number of friends and coworkers adopted similar setups after seeing how fast one&#39;s computer use could get, in search of a streamlined yet ruthlessly efficient system configuration.</p>
<p>Arch is a stellar distro.
The package management story is top-notch.
Packages are up-to-date, easy to create and maintain, and come close to the upstream sources without distro-specific patches.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman"><code>pacman</code></a> just works, and the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> gives you access to the most obscure of packages.
The documentation on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">Arch Wiki</a> is excellent, to the point that it&#39;s often worth checking when troubleshooting a problem on another distro.
On Arch, you build your system piece by piece, trading initial setup time for deep understanding.
This is both intellectually satisfying and practically empowering.</p>
<p>Given how freeing the Arch experience is, it has been difficult for me to imagine using anything else.
Occasionally having to use a Mac or Windows PC seemed like a test of patience; Arch felt like <em>home</em>.
A computing environment that I trust, that I understand, built by and for me, sculpted according to my precise needs, changing by my will and not due to some tech company&#39;s idea of what&#39;s good for me (&#34;hey, it&#39;s 2025, we should <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/">make everything unreadable!</a>&#34;).</p>
<p>So... what&#39;s the catch, then?
Why migrate away from something so good?</p>
<h2 id="hardware-that-wears-you-out">Hardware That Wears You Out</h2>
<p>While Arch Linux itself, as a Linux distribution, is great, it needs to run on <em>something</em>.
And when it comes to laptops, that <em>something</em> is not great.</p>
<p>PC laptops are mostly not built for Linux.
This means that any laptop purchase has historically come with a series of driver-related caveats.
Will suspend-to-RAM work?
Will I get more than a few hours of battery life after installing <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TLP">TLP</a>?
Do the GPU drivers work at all, including with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME">PRIME</a>/<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus">Optimus</a> switching?
Will my Wi-Fi chipset randomly disconnect from WPA2 Enterprise networks or cause kernel panics?
Can I use any of the &#34;fancy&#34; manufacturer features, such as a fingerprint reader, or are they locked behind proprietary drivers that only support Windows?
Will my Bluetooth randomly disconnect and reconnect, or drop packets excessively?</p>
<p>Most of these issues are not a concern on desktop workstation or server hardware, and indeed, I wouldn&#39;t run anything <em>but</em> Linux on those.
However, on a laptop, having to take all of these into account is exhausting.
I want to <em>use my laptop to tackle problems</em>, not to have my laptop <em>be</em> the problem.</p>
<p>Driver issues aren&#39;t all there is.
Anecdotally, I&#39;ve recently been dealing with a series of catastrophic hardware failures: busted laptop hinges and screw mounts, random boot failures, spotty Bluetooth, trackpad glitches, and more, across my last few devices.
Recently, two of my laptops kernel panicked from being <em>held wrong</em>, and the latest one (an Asus TUF A15) pops open like a pi√±ata when opened without several layers of super-strength tape holding the case together.
This machine is not even a year old.</p>
<p>Of course, similar issues can and do occur on MacBooks as well, and my sample size is statistically insignificant.
However, I don&#39;t think it is too much to ask for 1) warranties that are actually honored, and 2) hardware that amounts to more than a haphazardly assembled pile of fast components.</p>
<p>Could a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dell_XPS_15">Dell XPS</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Laptop/Lenovo">Lenovo ThinkPad</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microsoft_Surface_Pro_9">Surface Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Arch-Linux-and-Manjaro-on-TUXEDO-computers.tuxedo">TUXEDO</a> or <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en">Framework Laptop</a> fit the bill?
Probably, depending on the compromises one is willing to make.</p>
<p>However, I decided to give Apple Silicon a chance this time around.
This was partly curiosity‚ÄîApple laptops are known for their build quality, battery life, unified memory, and customer service.
I had also briefly used a M1 MacBook Air out of necessity, while working on cross-compilation of OCaml code to iOS at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/routine">Routine</a>, and came out quite impressed with the smoothness of the UX on this relatively cheap machine.</p>
<p>Tired of fighting my <em>hardware</em>, I opted to fight &#34;my&#34; (Apple&#39;s, really) <em>software</em> this time around, trading my meticulously-honed setup for the foreign and locked-down macOS.</p>
<h2 id="eating-the-forbidden-fruit">Eating the Forbidden Fruit</h2>
<p>When I caved in and bought a custom <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m4-pro">14&#34; 48GB M4 Pro MacBook Pro</a> with the intent of keeping macOS on it, reactions ranged from confusion (&#34;<em>this guy</em> bought a Mac?!&#34;) to glee (&#34;how the mighty have fallen!&#34;) to disappointment (&#34;you should have bought a Framework&#34;) to concern (&#34;are you sure you&#39;re OK?&#34;).
The general sentiment was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB3xTpw6ggI">whathehellishappening? üé∂</a>.</p>
<p>Would running Linux on it be an option?
No.
<a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> only delivers good support up until M2 chips, with <a href="https://asahilinux.org/docs/platform/feature-support/m4/">M4 Pro support remaining entirely inadequate</a>.
So, macOS it is.
Quite frankly, I probably still wouldn&#39;t try running Linux on it even if there were some Asahi support.
If I&#39;m going to be using Mac hardware, I might as well take full advantage of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-lazy-frankenmac">The Lazy Frankenmac</h2>
<p>Running macOS does not mean giving up on the past decade of accumulated experience.
I live inside of a shell.
I want my configuration to be as declarative as possible.
A good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window manager</a> is non-negotiable.
I want my window switching to be nearly instantaneous, and I am not about to start preferring the mouse/touchpad over the keyboard.</p>
<p>I received my new machine yesterday, and opted to set it up the &#34;lazy power user&#34; way: I wanted to recover as much of my workflow as possible, without going down a rabbit hole of configuration.
Not all battles are worth fighting.
It is a delicate balance between <em>&#34;I don&#39;t have time to configure this, I have urgent things to do&#34;</em> and <em>&#34;I am now taking three times as long to do anything because my SSH agent doesn&#39;t work, my most-frequently-used shortcuts are gone, and I manage my packages with <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>.&#34;</em></p>
<p>I will live without my terminal&#39;s colors being configured <em>just right</em> for now, as long as they&#39;re reasonable.
Same with my shell prompt; if it has a decent git indicator and autocompletion, that&#39;s a good start.
There is something freeing in embracing sane defaults, then gradually improving them.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s call this a &#34;Lazy Frankenmac&#34;‚Äînot in the Hackintosh sense, but in the sense that it&#39;s macOS set up in a Linux spirit.</p>
<p>What key ingredients would that involve?</p>
<ul>
<li>A sensible package and configuration management story.</li>
<li>A modern shell environment.</li>
<li>A tiling window manager, in the spirit of <a href="https://i3wm.org/"><code>i3</code></a> / <a href="https://swaywm.org/"><code>sway</code></a> / <a href="https://hypr.land/"><code>hyprland</code></a>.</li>
<li>A launcher in the spirit of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dmenu"><code>dmenu</code></a> / <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi"><code>rofi</code></a> / <a href="https://github.com/SimplyCEO/wofi"><code>wofi</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;re not going to get everything right in a day, far from it, but let&#39;s see how far we can get.</p>
<h2 id="nix-as-a-package-manager"><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> as a Package Manager</h2>
<p>First, let&#39;s get our package manager set up.
Installing software by dragging and dropping .app files or running installers manually is... not ideal, and neither is the locked-down Mac App Store.</p>
<p>The macOS package management story is not great.
There&#39;s no good built-in solution.
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is by far the most popular package manager, widely used by developers.
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> is older but less popular.
Neither is really comparable to Arch&#39;s <code>pacman</code>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something more exotic than Homebrew and MacPorts to try: you can run <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> on macOS.
<a href="https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin"><code>nix-darwin</code></a> does the legwork and <a href="https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew"><code>nix-homebrew</code></a> serves as a convenient escape hatch for when you need Homebrew <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask">Casks</a> or when the Nix package you need is missing or outdated.</p>
<p>Nix is conceptually appealing (purely functional, declarative package and configuration management, yay!), but can be quite difficult to troubleshoot.
I&#39;ve used it a few times in limited contexts, but never as my primary package manager.
Thankfully, there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config">popular starter template</a> that puts together <code>nix-darwin</code>, <code>nix-homebrew</code> and various other goodies to quickly get started with Nix on macOS!</p>
<h2 id="of-course-it-doesn-t-work-out-of-the-box">Of Course It Doesn&#39;t Work Out of The Box</h2>
<p>Following @dustinlyons&#39;s instructions as of <a href="https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/da88287">commit <code>da88287</code></a>, I installed <em>Nix</em> using the Determinate Systems installer.
This is not to be confused with installing <em>Determinate Nix</em> using that very same installer.
Rookie mistake! Definitely not a footgun.</p>
<p>I then <em>did not</em> add <code>experimental-features = nix-command flakes</code> to <code>/etc/nix/nix.conf</code> during setup.
Those were already in <code>extra-experimental-features</code>.</p>
<p>I followed the <code>starter-with-secrets</code> template:</p>
<pre data-lang="zsh"><code data-lang="zsh"><span>mkdir -p</span><span> nixos-config
</span><span>cd</span><span> nixos-config
</span><span>nix</span><span> flake \
</span><span>    --extra-experimental-features </span><span>&#39;</span><span>nix-command flakes</span><span>&#39; \
</span><span>    init \
</span><span>    -t</span><span> github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#starter-with-secrets
</span></code></pre>
<p>That <code>--extra-experimental-features</code> flag, as specified by the template&#39;s README, was probably not necessary since it was already in <code>nix.conf</code>.</p>
<p>My MBP is running macOS Sequoia 15.5.
This is a fresh install, so I shouldn&#39;t have to <a href="https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-support-for-macos-sequoia/">&#34;prepare Nix&#34; for a Sequoia installation</a>.
Yet, the installation failed at first, with a <code>mismatching GID</code> error.
<a href="https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin/issues/1339#issuecomment-2661471788">Changing <code>stateVersion = 4;</code> to <code>stateVersion = 5;</code></a> in <code>hosts/darwin/default.nix</code> resolved the issue.</p>
<p>I then encountered more issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>test-fs-cp.mjs</code> failed when trying to build <code>nodejs-22.17.0</code>.
I don&#39;t need this LTS Node.js version anyway, so I replaced the <code>nodejs</code> package with <code>nodejs_24</code> and removed the corresponding <code>nodePackages</code> entries from the relevant <code>packages.nix</code> config.</li>
<li>The <code>alacritty</code> configuration included in the template was obsolete, resulting in a number of <code>unused config key</code> warnings.</li>
<li>I had an issue with the <code>masApps</code> key, which included entries for <code>1password</code> and <code>wireguard</code>. I discarded these, as I need neither.</li>
<li>The Dock configuration was slightly broken out-of-the-box, but easy to adjust.</li>
<li>The bundled Emacs configuration seems broken, with Emacs freezing on startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, installing the <a href="https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace">AeroSpace</a> tiling WM as a Cask required adding an entry to <code>flake.nix</code>&#39;s inputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>homebrew-aerospace = {
</span><span>  url = &#34;github:nikitabobko/homebrew-tap&#34;;
</span><span>  flake = false;
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="once-nix-is-set-up-you-re-flying">Once Nix is Set Up, You&#39;re Flying</h2>
<p>Once I got <code>nix run .#build-switch</code> to work well enough, it was a breeze to install a number of tools as a combination of <code>nix-homebrew</code> Casks, Nix packages, and <code>home-manager</code> entries.</p>
<p>In no particular order, these include: Zed, Zotero, Firefox, Spotify, Proton Mail, Proton Mail Bridge, <a href="https://mynixos.com/nixpkgs/package/claude-code"><code>claude-code</code></a>, <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Rust"><code>rustup</code></a>, <a href="https://mynixos.com/nixpkgs/package/uv"><code>uv</code></a>, <a href="https://mynixos.com/nixpkgs/package/zola"><code>zola</code></a>, <a href="https://mynixos.com/nixpkgs/package/typst"><code>typst</code></a>, Signal, WhatsApp Web, Slack, Alacritty, KeePassXC, Raycast, Claude Desktop, and Zulip.
I did install <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> through its official <code>.pkg</code> installer; it needs a lot of low-level system access, and debugging the macOS networking stack is not my top priority at the moment.</p>
<p>Key features are OK:</p>
<p><strong>Window Management</strong>: For now, <a href="https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace">AeroSpace</a> + <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> are a very acceptable replacement for sway + rofi/wofi.
Following the official AeroSpace recommendation, I disabled the <code>Displays have separate Spaces</code> macOS feature.
I have been enjoying <a href="https://manual.raycast.com/command-aliases-and-hotkeys">Raycast&#39;s hotkeys and aliases</a> so far; no <a href="https://github.com/jackielii/skhd.zig"><code>skhd</code></a> required (yet?).</p>
<p><strong>Text Editing</strong>: I quickly <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS">remapped Caps Lock to Escape</a> and set Zed to use vim bindings.
@dustinlyons&#39;s starter template includes a reasonable configuration for vim itself.</p>
<p><strong>Python and Rust</strong>: <code>uv</code> works, and I&#39;m able to build Rust projects with dependencies on e.g. <code>openssl</code> using <a href="https://direnv.net/"><code>direnv</code></a>&#39;s <code>use flake</code> and a lightweight <code>flake.nix</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Browser</strong>:
Firefox.
Not much to say here.
I only needed two Firefox extensions from the get-go: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors">Zotero Connector</a> to save papers, uBlock Origin to get rid of ads.
I could probably even have done without the latter, given Firefox&#39;s new built-in privacy features.</p>
<p><strong>Shell</strong>: The zsh configuration included in the template is a decent start.
I added <a href="https://atuin.sh/"><code>atuin</code></a> through <code>home-manager</code>, for featureful Ctrl+R shell history search.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Emulator</strong>: Currently using <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">alacritty</a>.
Also considering <a href="https://wezterm.org/index.html">WezTerm</a>.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>
<p>This is how far I got on the first day.
This setup isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s usable; I can perform most of my workflow without pulling my hair out.
I&#39;ll be honing the system gradually.
This includes slimming down and modernizing my <code>nixos-config</code>, understanding Nix beyond the surface level, mastering AeroSpace and Raycast, and fixing various little annoyances as they pop up.</p>
<p>I&#39;m surprised by how much I like this machine already.
It is great to look at, hold, and type on.
The trackpad is top-notch.
Using it generally feels snappy.
The built-in software gives the general impression of having been designed, not cobbled together.
It remains to be seen how these initial impressions will hold up over time, and it is certainly a shame that one has to resort to third-party tools for something as fundamental as package management.
But I suppose I can live with it in exchange for a machine that doesn&#39;t kernel panic when I open the lid at the wrong angle.</p>
