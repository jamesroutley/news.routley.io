      <p></p><h2>About</h2>
      <p>After subjecting many friends and family to spontaneous ‘guess the movie’ sessions, it dawned on me that others might enjoy scratching this nostalgic trivia itch as well.</p>
      <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://framed.wtf/" target="_blank">Framed</a>, I cracked open my text editor and used ChatGPT to build out every chunk of functionality I envisioned. It’s truly amazing what you can learn and achieve with that tool.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Movie data sourced from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">TMDB</a></li>
          <li>Most scene hints are from <a href="https://shotdeck.com/welcome/home" target="_blank">Shotdeck</a></li>
          <li>No revenue or monetization planned. This is just for fun!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A Needle Drop is when a pre-existing song is used by a film director to underscore a particular scene.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>How do you play?</h2>
      <p>Each day a new Needle Drop challenge is released from a curated list†. </p>
      <p>Guess the movie you think the Needle Drop was featured in. You’re allowed <em>4 guesses</em>. A clue is revealed for each incorrect guess.</p>
      <p>Share your score with friends for cinephile bragging rights.</p>              
      <p><sup>† Sometimes Needle Drops appear in multiple movies. We’ve selected what we believe to be the first or most iconic instance of each Needle Drop. </sup>
