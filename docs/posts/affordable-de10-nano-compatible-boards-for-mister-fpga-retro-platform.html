				<p><a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1830969380278280355">Taki Udon said he’ll be listing</a> the first batch of his DE-10 Nano clone boards for sale today at 8PM NYC time.  The second batch will release Friday September 6th, at 8AM NYC time.  Each batch will have 1000 units available for sale.  The prices are $100 for just the clone board, $115 for clone/RAM/fan and $160 for a full PCB kit, including the latest 24-bit compatible I/O boards (but not a case).  No power supply is included with any package.  More info and an unboxing / installation guide below:</p>

<p>I’ve been a l<span>oud cheerleader for this product and have been heavily promoting it since Taki first announced it.  I’d love to see this one get embraced as much as the QMTech DE-10 that seems like an excellent alternative, however both boards require new cases and not everyone has the ability to print their own for this project.  </span></p>
<p><span>Also, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention all the red flags this has set off with everyone who’s ever manufactured products before; I’ve been creating and launching products for almost two decades now (at both much higher and lower quantities than this) and the information provided to us about this project over the last two months doesn’t line up with <em>any</em> manufacturing experience I’ve ever had.</span></p>
<p>I’ll personally be waiting for a deep-dive comparison to both the original DE-10 and the QMTech version of the same board, <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/de10-nano-vs-qmtechs-clone.html">like Ken recently did</a> before buying one.  I’d also like to see people who understand how the cores work, do a side-by-side comparison of all three solutions, however my gut tells me they’ll all work the same.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a tinkerer, get one and see how it performs.  My guess is it’ll be fine and the contradictory information was just a result of inexperience with manufacturing.  Fingers crossed though.</p>
