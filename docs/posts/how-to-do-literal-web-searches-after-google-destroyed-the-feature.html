    <h1>Ask HN: How to do literal web searches after Google destroyed the “ ” feature?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I used this quite frequently but since Google &#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;improved&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34; it last year (there was a popular HN post complaining about this) it doesn&#39;t work anymore. Search for a domain name with quotation marks for example just recombines the contents of the domain and returns a bunch of unrelated content completely cluttering what I am looking for. Until last year it used to return no search results if there weren&#39;t any exact matches, which is the whole point.</p><p>Does someone have a work around for this phenomenal Google decision?</p></div></div></div>
