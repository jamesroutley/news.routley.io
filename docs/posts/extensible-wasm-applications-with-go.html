    <h1>Extensible Wasm Applications with Go</h1>

      <p>Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-and-the-webassembly-system-interface">WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm&rsquo;s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p>
<p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
<code>js/wasm</code> port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> port.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-go-functions-to-wasm-with-gowasmexport">Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with <code>go:wasmexport</code></h2>
<p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, <code>go:wasmexport</code>, which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">export</a>
in the resulting Wasm binary.</p>
<p>To use the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p>
<pre><code>//go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
</code></pre>
<p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named <code>add</code> that
can be called from the host.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the <a href="/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go">cgo <code>export</code> directive</a>,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though <code>go:wasmexport</code> uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-wasi-reactor">Building a WASI Reactor</h2>
<p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a &ldquo;command&rdquo; module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.</p>
<p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the <code>-buildmode=c-shared</code> build
flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the <code>_start</code> function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
<code>_initialize</code> function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The <code>_initialize</code> function must be called before any other exported functions.
The <code>main</code> function will not be automatically invoked.</p>
<p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
<code>_initialize</code>, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using <a href="https://wazero.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:</p>
<pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions(&quot;_initialize&quot;)

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction(&quot;add&quot;)
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf(&quot;add(%d, %d) = %d\n&quot;, a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf(&quot;add(%d, %d) = %d\n&quot;, b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-rich-types-between-the-host-and-the-client">Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with <code>go:wasmimport</code> functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an <code>int32</code>, or a
pointer to a struct which embeds <code>structs.HostLayout</code> and contains supported
field types
(see the <a href="/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives">documentation</a> for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.</p>
<p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A <code>go:wasmexport</code> function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the <code>go:wasmexport</code> function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.</p>
<p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with <code>go:wasmimport</code> and
<code>go:wasmexport</code> functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a <code>go:wasmimport</code> function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go&rsquo;s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>
