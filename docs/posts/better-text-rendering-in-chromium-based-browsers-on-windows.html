<p>The job of a web rendering engine is vast, and much of this work, such as
styling, media, or layout, is driven by standards. These standards ensure that
independent engines can be interoperable, which has allowed the web to flourish.
But some finer details, such as how text is rendered at the pixel level, are
often left to interpretation by the standards bodies, and typically end up
relying on the operating systems that browsers run on.</p>

<p>In 2020, Microsoft Edge had a rare opportunity—a complete replacement of its
underlying rendering engine.
<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/master/README.md">Edge transitioned to Chromium</a>,
away from a Windows-only platform where it used Windows APIs directly, and
became a true cross-platform web renderer. Before the switch to Chromium, Edge
relied entirely on a Windows API called
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal">DirectWrite</a>
for text rendering. However, Chromium relies on <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a>, a
powerful and flexible cross-platform graphics engine, which abstracts many of
the operating system-specific code from its API.</p>

<p>During Edge&#39;s transition to Chromium, the Edge team had the opportunity to
gather feedback from its users about the Chromium rendering engine. One piece of
feedback was significant—many Edge users shared that text appeared &#34;washed out&#34;
and that it didn&#39;t look consistent with text in other parts of Windows.</p>

<p>The team took this feedback seriously and did some investigation. While Skia
uses DirectWrite on Windows for certain functionality such as font lookup, the
final text rasterization is actually handled directly by Skia. And one major
factor in the &#34;washed out&#34; feedback from users is the internal contrast and
gamma settings for text rendering.</p>

<p>Two main differences in text contrast and gamma values were uncovered between
Edge&#39;s Chromium-based engine and its prior engine. First, Skia does not pick up
text contrast and gamma values from the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/cleartype/">Windows ClearType Tuner</a>.
Secondly, it uses different default values for text contrast and gamma than
those used by Edge&#39;s DirectWrite-based text stack.</p>

<p>The Edge team added support for respecting the ClearType Tuner values in
Chromium directly, last year. This gave Chromium-based browser users the ability
to control text contrast and gamma settings on Windows. While this was a
significant step in the right direction, most users tend to not adjust their
system-wide text contrast and gamma settings. So the next phase in this journey
was to seriously consider adjusting the default text contrast and gamma settings
for both web and browser UI text content.</p>

<p>Changing what text looks like on the web is a large undertaking. The web has
always been text heavy, and a high-quality text engine is necessary. It was
evident that the text contrast value needed to increase, but data was needed to
determine how much to adjust it.</p>

<p>The Edge team began experimenting with various text contrast values back in
2021. After a lot of user research, members of both Edge and Chromium determined
that a contrast value of 1.0 closely matched the text rendering of pre-Chromium
Edge and looked consistent compared to other native Windows applications.</p>

<p>On the Edge team, we believed our research and experiments could be beneficial
to the overall Chromium community on Windows, so we shared our findings with the
Chrome team at Google, who confirmed them with their own experiments. We then
proceeded to enable the new contrast value by default for Windows builds,
starting with Chrome 132.</p>

<p>Today, all users of Chromium-based browsers on Windows can benefit from these
past years of shared research, experimentation, and implementation.</p>
