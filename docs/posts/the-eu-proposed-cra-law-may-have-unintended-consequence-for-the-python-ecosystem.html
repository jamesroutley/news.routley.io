    <h1>The EU proposed CRA law may have unintended consequence for the Python ecosystem</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1255393107176249474" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>After reviewing the proposed <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act">Cyber Resilience Act </a>and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022PC0495">Product Liability Act</a>, the PSF has found issues that put the mission of our organization and the health of the open-source software community at risk. While we support the stated goals of these policies of increasing security and accountability for European software consumers, we are concerned that overly broad policies will unintentionally harm the users they are intended to protect. We feel that it is important to consider the role vendor-neutral nonprofit organizations—especially public software repositories—play in the modern development of software. </p><p>Many modern software companies rely on open-source software from public repositories without notifying the author, and certainly without entering into any kind of commercial or contractual relationship with them. If the proposed law is enforced as currently written, the authors of open-source components might bear legal and financial responsibility for the way their components are applied in someone else’s commercial product. The existing language makes no differentiation between independent authors who have never been paid for the supply of software and corporate tech behemoths selling products in exchange for payments from end-users. We believe that increased liability should be carefully assigned to the entity that has entered into an agreement with the consumer. We join our European open source colleagues at the <a href="https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2023/02/23/cyber-resilience-act-good-intentions-and-unintended-consequences/">Eclipse Foundation</a> and <a href="https://blog.nlnetlabs.nl/open-source-software-vs-the-cyber-resilience-act/">NLnet Labs</a> in voicing our concerns over how these policies could affect global open source projects. </p><p>1) We host and provide the core Python programming language, standard library and interpreter to any who wish to use it free of charge. It may be downloaded from our website, and a version of Python is downloaded over 300 million times per day.  </p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
