    <h1>SlopStop: Community-driven AI slop detection in Kagi Search</h1>

            <h2>Your collective defense against AI-generated spam and content farms</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-12/1762955857-538822-expecteddog.png" alt="Three side by side images of Kagi’s cartoon dog mascot, named Doggo, with antenna-like ears showing progression from ‘Expected dog’ to ‘Expected Slop’ with last one highlighted in orange with 3 ears and 3 eyes"/></p>

<p>We made it our mission to prevent the web from becoming useless and a harmful space. That’s why today, Kagi Search introduces the first community-driven system to detect and downrank deceptive AI-generated text, images, and video inside search results.</p>

<p>It’s 2025, and the internet we loved is drowning in AI-generated noise. Content farms exploiting AI for profit are manipulating search results in this attention economy’s race to the bottom.</p>

<p>This makes us wonder: who are we building the web for?</p>

<h2>What is AI “Slop” and how can we stop it?</h2>

<p><strong>AI slop is deceptive or low-value AI-generated content, created to manipulate ranking or attention rather than help the reader.</strong></p>

<p>Per our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">AI integration philosophy</a>, we’re not against AI tools that enhance human creativity. But when it includes fake reviews, fabricated expertise, misinformation, content farms designed purely for profit rather than value, and systems that seek to replace genuine human insight and connection, we know it’s hurting us, and we take it upon ourselves to act.</p>

<p>Our ethos at Kagi is to put humans in control.</p>

<p>We’ve been fighting AI slop since we introduced our AI-generated image filter a year ago. Since our inception, we have actively downranked content filled with ads and trackers with little or no value to our members, prompting and enabling you to take control of your search experience.</p>

<p>SlopStop now tackles the wider spectrum of misleading AI-generated content: videos, articles, domains, and everything in between. From now on, you will see a display within the search results showing the real-time AI slop score. As our CEO, Vlad, puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We believe AI slop is an existential threat to an internet that should belong to humans. This is the first step towards our ultimate goal: to kill AI slop so you never see it again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initiative will give you even greater control over what you see online, elevating high-value, trustworthy information above misinformation, news websites, false narratives, and content farms. We’ll improve the system by learning from your feedback and building more automated elements.</p>

<p>All Kagi Search users can now flag low-quality AI content (“AI slop”) in web, image, and video search results. We will verify these reports using our own signals. If a domain primarily publishes AI-generated content, we will downrank it in Kagi Search and mark it as AI slop. If a page is AI-generated but the domain is mixed (not mostly AI), we will flag the page as AI-generated but will not downrank it.</p>

<p>For media results, images and videos confirmed as AI-generated, they will be labelled as such and automatically downranked on the results page. Users can also choose to filter out AI-generated media entirely.</p>

<h2>The powerful duo: SlopStop and Small Web</h2>

<p>AI is evolving so quickly that it is increasingly complex to detect, but not impossible. Not all AI-generated content is harmful and misleading, but if a domain is in the business of only disseminating AI content, we consider it slop.</p>

<p>In parallel to fighting AI-generated slop, we are implementing solutions for whitelisting and amplifying verified human creators online through our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Small Web initiative</a>. Every piece of AI slop we flag makes authentic human content more discoverable. We want to prioritize creators who make the internet truly valuable, no matter the tools they use.</p>

<p>The Small Web represents everything AI slop threatens: authentic human voices, genuine creativity, and content created for passion rather than profit. Together, SlopStop and the Small Web create a powerful defense against the commercialization and artificial pollution of the internet.</p>

<h2>Building the largest AI slop dataset to fight LLM hallucinations</h2>

<p>SlopStop within our search is a step to an enhanced, trustworthy experience across the Kagi ecosystem. As a result of this initiative, we aim to build the largest dataset of AI-slop domains on the web, using in-house-built detection and a carefully curated community reporting system. In essence, we are using AI to destroy AI slop.</p>

<p>We’ll use this dataset to build our own AI content detection tech, which will be used across our products as additional defense against AI-generated hallucinations, false claims, and misinformation, <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/ai-monitor/march-2025-ai-misinformation-monitor/">which we know now account for 30-41% of the fail response rate</a> in most other chatbots.</p>

<p><strong>Access to the database will be shared soon, you can express interest <a href="https://tally.so/r/wLlPJG">here</a> if you’d like to receive updates.</strong></p>

<h2>Join the fight: protect the quality of your search</h2>

<p>The battle for internet authenticity can’t be won without your support. We are starting with this crowdsourced effort to help us learn and develop the final, automated solution. Every piece of harmful AI-generated content you identify helps create a better, more trustworthy search experience for everyone.</p>
