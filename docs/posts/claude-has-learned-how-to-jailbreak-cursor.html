              <p>I have “rm” specifically disallowed, along with “mv” and a few other scary commands.</p>
<p>Claude realized that I had to approve the use of such commands, so to get around this, it chose to put them in a shell script and execute the shell script.</p>
<p>Thankfully, a Git restore to the last commit saved me, but still…</p>

            <p>Personally, I’ve made the experience that the deny list doesn’t really work, Cursor decides to go YOLO anyways which is why I’d only use yolo mode if there is a fresh system backup, too</p>

              <p>Thats interesting, has that started in some version?</p>
<p>I have a few things in the deny list but Yolo never gets around those.</p>
<p>Would be good to know in which circumstances that happens.</p>
<p>Depends a lot on common CLI usage, I allow specific commands that are safe.</p>

              <p>This started tonight.</p>
<p>I have some shell scripts for greps and sorts to list files out that are in the allow list. Claude re-wrote one to also do some removing of what it thought was obsolete code after I denied its rm commands with “skip.”</p>
<p>So “listoldfiles.sh” is no longer on the allow list, which is UNFORTUNATE because now I have to sit here and babysit my otherwise-automatic cleanup script.</p>

              <p>The denylist or allowlist is for commands, not prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes its a prefix, so if you dont want AI to allow or deny any command that starts with <code>git</code> you would add <code>git</code>.</li>
<li>Same if you want to allow one command like <code>mycommand option1</code> but not any other like <code>mycommand option2</code> then you add <code>mycommand option1</code> to the allow list.</li>
<li>Deny list works same</li>
<li>Note that this is not 100% possible to enforce, sometimes AI does attempt workarounds, or sometimes user rules give it a hint that a workaround is possible, depending on the info there.</li>

              <p>I know it because I use it like that for months now, even today <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/fluentui/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"/> with various models and it works like a charm. (AI tries sometimes my denylist but I have to confirm every time, or reject the request, allowlist items get through without request to confirm.</p>
<p>In some previous versions of Cursor there were other options like a prompt, that was removed later on for good reasons as it didnt work well.</p>
<p>Yes it can happen that it doesnt work for different reasons per user, but ‘many’ is hard to define from a few reports here. There are many who have no issues with it and post how great yolo/auto-run works but they dont post daily, while some that have issues post more frequently, and thats fine. In such cases its important to see what happened, why it didnt work, get as much info as possible to identify the cause or what needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>If it is reproducible, best is to try a request with privacy turned off, then get the Request ID and post here, so the Cursor team can see what occured in the request.(you can turn privacy on after that again)</p>
<p>SO while I dont have the issue, I accept that others have it, my focus is to see what makes it happen. The more details the more likely the Cursor team can find a solution.</p>

            <p>for me, it couldn’t read gitignore files so it ran a terminal command to read it</p>

            <p>yes, it can read .env with terminal. It’s actually preferring using terminal for many workflows. Didn’t see it in previous versions. It’s even refactoring code with scripts. Sometimes it’s much easier for it to write a script and replace some code with Find and Replace in 20 files. Or do code replacements in terminal if it thinks that’s faster.</p>

            <p>Yes, that’s true. It can learn everything about us, truly a smart model.</p>

              <p>It does not learn at all.  It is a state machine and learning is a misnomer we use to half attempt to explain what it is we created.</p>
<p>It simply is optimizing to task.  It cannot determine weight or consequence given its lack of embodiment in environment which cannot be simulated in a way that feels real because it does not feel.</p>
<p>Thus, it is simply “cheating” to achieve its goal orientation, not understanding what it is doing is harmful, because it lacks the context for that.  That is the Anthro’s responsibility.  It is also Cursor’s responsibility to adequately communicate the arrangement and why it is dangerous given certain human expectations.</p>
