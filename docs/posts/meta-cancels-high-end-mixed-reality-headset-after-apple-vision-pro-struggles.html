    <h1>Meta cancels high-end mixed reality headset after Apple Vision Pro struggles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2024/08/23/meta-cancels-high-end-headset/"><p>Meta has canceled work on a high-end mixed reality headset that it was developing to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset">The Information</a></em>. Meta this week told employees to quit working on the device following a product review meeting that involved Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>Meta is continuing development on the Quest 4, a successor to the Quest 3, and that headset could come out in 2026. The Quest 3 is priced at $500, which is also the likely target price point for its successor. Meta is also focusing on software rather than hardware, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/">announced a Horizon OS platform</a> for third-party hardware makers earlier this year.</p>
<p>When the Vision Pro launched, Meta was hoping that the device would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/meta-optimistic-vision-pro-launch/">reinvigorate the headset market</a> and validate Zuckerberg&#39;s major push into the AR/VR space. Instead, Apple has struggled with consumer appeal, and interest in the Vision Pro has waned over time.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm about the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">started dying down</a> just a month after it launched, and fewer customers visited Apple retail stores for demonstrations. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/">cut Vision Pro shipments</a> in April, and the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">unlikely to sell</a> even 500,000 of the headsets in 2024. As a result, Apple has stopped work on a second-generation high-cost Vision Pro and is instead focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">creating a lower-cost model</a> with fewer features and a price closer to high-end iPhones.</p>
