<p>For the first time, SpaceX launched one of its reusable Falcon 9 boosters for a 20th time Friday night on a flight to deliver 23 more Starlink Internet satellites to orbit.</p>
<p>This milestone mission lifted off at 9:40 pm EDT Friday (01:40 UTC Saturday) from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Falcon 9 blazed a familiar trail into space, following the same profile as dozens of past Starlink missions.</p>
<p>The rocket&#39;s first-stage booster shut off its nine kerosene-fueled Merlin engines about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, reaching a top speed of more than 5,000 mph (8,000 km per hour). The first stage detached from the Falcon 9&#39;s upper stage, which continued firing into orbit. The 15-story-tall Falcon 9 booster, meanwhile, followed an arcing trajectory before braking for a vertical landing on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The 23 flat-packed Starlink spacecraft deployed from the upper stage a little more than an hour after liftoff, bringing the total number of Starlinks in low-Earth orbit to more than 5,800 spacecraft.</p>
<h2>A hunger for launch</h2>
<p>Pretty much every day, SpaceX is either launching a rocket or rolling one out of the hangar to the launch pad. At this pace, SpaceX is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/in-less-than-24-hours-spacex-launched-3-rockets-and-tested-another/#:~:text=SpaceX%2C%20which%20now%20has%20more,the%20Starship%20countdown%20in%20Texas.">redefining what is routine in the space industry</a>, but the rapid-fire launch rate also means the company is continually breaking records, mostly its own.</p>
<p>Friday night&#39;s launch broke another one of those records. This first-stage booster, designated by the tail number B1062, had flown 19 times since its first flight in November 2020. The booster is now the first in SpaceX&#39;s inventory to accomplish a 20th flight, breaking a tie with three other rockets as the company&#39;s fleet leader.</p>
<p>When SpaceX debuted the latest version of its Falcon 9 rocket, the Falcon 9 Block 5, officials said the reusable first stage could fly 10 times with minimal refurbishment and perhaps additional flights with a more extensive overhaul. Now, SpaceX is certifying Falcon 9 boosters for 40 flights.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This particular rocket has not undergone any extended maintenance or long-term grounding. It has flown an average of once every two months since debuting three-and-a-half years ago. So the 20-flight milestone SpaceX achieved Friday night means this rocket has doubled its original design life and, at the same time, has reached the halfway point of its extended service life.</p>
<p>In its career, this booster has launched eight people and more than 550 spacecraft, mostly Starlinks. The rocket&#39;s first two flights launched GPS navigation satellites for the US military, then it launched two commercial human spaceflight missions with Dragon crew capsules. These were the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/four-private-citizens-launch-today-further-opening-new-era-of-spaceflight/">all-private Inspiration4 mission</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/the-axiom-1-crew-launches-today-are-these-guys-tourists-astronauts-or-what/">Axiom Mission 1</a>, the first fully commercial crew flight to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Remarkably, this was the sixth Falcon 9 launch in less than eight days, more flights than SpaceX&#39;s main US rival, United Launch Alliance, has launched in 17 months.</p>
<p>It was the 38th Falcon 9 launch of the year and the 111th flight of a Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rocket—the 114th launch by SpaceX overall—in the last 365 days. More than a third of SpaceX&#39;s Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy missions, a number now stands at 332, have launched in the past year.</p>
<p>This month, for the first time, SpaceX demonstrated it could launch two Falcon 9 rockets in less than five days from the company&#39;s launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. SpaceX has also cut the turnaround time between Falcon 9 rockets at Launch Complex 39A at NASA&#39;s Kennedy Space Center. The company&#39;s most-used launch pad, SLC-40, can handle two Falcon 9 flights in less than three days, a new record also demonstrated with Friday night&#39;s mission.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just launch pad turnaround. SpaceX uses its drone ships—two based in Florida and one in California—for most Falcon 9 landings. In order to meet the appetite for Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX is getting rockets back to port and re-deploying drone ships back to sea at a faster rate.</p>
