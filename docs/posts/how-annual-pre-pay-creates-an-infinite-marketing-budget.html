<p>Multiple founders have told me the ideas in this article were responsible for the financial success of their startup.</p>
<p>They might be exaggerating out of kindness, but if this is even 10% as useful for you, it will have been worth your time.</p>
<p>We’ll explore how growth affects cash-flow, and conclude with several techniques that can transform the cash-flow of your business.</p>
<h2 id="cost-create-dollar-mrr">The cost to create a dollar of MRR <a href="#cost-create-dollar-mrr"></a>
</h2><p>What does it cost a SaaS company to add $1 of new monthly recurring revenue?</p>
<p>Using the typical acronyms:</p>
<p><span><code>CAC</code> (<strong>C</strong>ost to <strong>A</strong>cquire a <strong>C</strong>ustomer) is the total cost to get one new paying customer—Marketing and Sales costs, including fully-loaded salaries. The simplest way to compute it is “total spend in a month” divided by “total new customers added during that month.” </span></p>
<p><span><code>ARPC</code> (<strong>A</strong>verage <strong>R</strong>evenue <strong>p</strong>er <strong>Customer</strong>) is the average monthly-recurring revenue you get from a customer. The simplest way to compute it in aggregate is “total recurring-revenue in a month (<code>MRR</code>)” divided by “total number of paying customers during that month (<code>N</code>),” </span></p>

<p>Since it costs <code>CAC</code> dollars to get <code>ARPC</code> new dollars of recurring-revenue:</p>
<p><span>&#34;the cost to create one more dollar of MRR&#34; = <code>CAC / ARPC</code> </span></p>
<p>If you haven’t done it before, computing this metric will be eye-opening.</p>
<p>Let’s create a hypothetical example of a company with a $10/mo consumer-targeted SaaS product, where they pay $1.60/click for Google Ads, that traffic converts at 5% to a free trial, and those trials convert at 40% to a paid customer. Their <code>CAC</code> is $80, and their <code>ARPC</code> is $10, therefore we would say “it costs them $8 to create $1 of MRR.”</p>

<p>It’s tempting to conclude that “It takes us 8 months of customer revenue to ‘pay us back’ for the marketing and sales costs of getting that customer. That customer is unprofitable before then, and becomes more and more profitable after.”</p>

<p>All companies have mandatory expenses associated with delivering the entire product to the customer. Not just the product itself, but everything else the customer expects, like being able to pay with a credit card or call and get support:</p>
<ul>
<li>credit card processing fees</li>
<li>tech support</li>
<li>infrastructure (if SaaS)</li>
<li>professional services (if consulting)</li>
<li>bill of materials (if physical goods)</li>
<li><em>Anything else which, if missing, the customer would say “You’re not delivering the product I paid for.”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In finance we measure these costs relative to revenue:</p>
<p><span><code>GPM</code> (<strong>G</strong>ross <strong>P</strong>rofit <strong>M</strong>argin) is the percentage of revenue remaining, after subtracting these “expenses required to deliver the whole product and experience.” </span></p>
<p>Continuing our example, suppose credit card fees are 3% of revenue, infrastructure costs are 5%, and tech support is 25%. Then <code>GPM = 67%</code>, i.e. after fulfilling our promises to our customers, we’re left with 66% of the money they gave us.</p>
<h2 id="payback-period-p">Payback period (p) <a href="#payback-period-p"></a>
</h2><p>Now we’re prepared to compute the <em>actual</em> pay-back period: The amount of time needed to recover <code>CAC</code> expenses, which is the number of months of revenue <em>we can spend</em>:</p>
<p><span><code>p</code> = “payback period” = <code>CAC / (MRR × GPM)</code> </span></p>
<p>In our example, <code>p = 80 / (10 × 0.67) =</code> 12 months.</p>

<p>The cash-flow implications are harsh. Consider:</p>
<p>You’re bootstrapped. You scrape together $1000 from life savings or credit card debt. You spend it on ads. Happily, it works! With the numbers in our example, you now have $125 in MRR, but expenses are $42/mo, so it’s going to be a whole year before you get that $1000 back. Meanwhile, you’re just <em>out</em> that cash.</p>
<p>So… how do you get more customers? Another $1000… but how many times can you do that before you run out of savings? Now you can see why people raise money…</p>
<p>You feel the cash-flow problem this creates. And <strong>the faster you grow the more cash it takes</strong>, because you’ve spent even more, but no matter how much you spend, it still takes a year to get it back. Now you see why people raise money for companies that are designed to grow quickly, and why it <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/more-money/" data-title="More money if you do, more money if you don’t" data-desc="A business always takes more money than you expect, even when you take this fact into account.

<h2 id="few-optimizations">A few optimizations <a href="#few-optimizations"></a>
</h2><p>Your mind immediately jumps to the question: How can I improve the metrics in this equation, so that my pay-back period is reduced, so I can grow more quickly with less cash?</p>
<h3 id="reduce-cac">Reduce CAC <a href="#reduce-cac"></a>

However, everyone does this, and most advertising is an auction model, which means it’s difficult to find spaces that simultaneously (1) get enough traffic to matter and (2) are low-cost. It’s still worthwhile to optimize, or to try to find less-expensive channels, but this is incremental; it won’t transform your business. In fact, <code>CAC</code> <em>increases</em> as a company scales (because low-hanging fruit is already plucked) and <em>increases</em> as a market matures (because of auctions from more and more competitors, who have more and more budget), as <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/" data-title="The Elephant in the room: The myth of exponential hypergrowth" data-desc="Even Facebook and Slack did not grow “exponentially,” as frequently described.

<p>Some people scream “Social media is free! SEO is free! Content marketing is free!” It’s not free—you have to write, manage, jockey for attention, follow Google’s whims, Twitter’s whims, YouTube’s whims, Instagram’s whims, TikTok’s whims, even though they don’t tell you what the whims are, optimize site layout as well as content, post often “for the algorithm,” and so on.

<p>It doesn’t always work, but typically, startups are under-charging.</p>
<h3 id="increase-gpm-cutting-costs">Increase GPM (by cutting costs) <a href="#increase-gpm-cutting-costs"></a>

<p>Of course this <em>is</em> valuable work, and if it’s easy to cut support-time in half with a few days of keyboard macros or better documentation or an AI first-line-of-defense, then do it. Just be warned that your natural tendency will be to file the rough edges off of costs—which isn’t impactful—rather than work on pricing and marketing—which have the power to transform the trajectory of the company.</p>

<p>How much should they pay? Typically you reward the customer for their up-front payment with a discount. In our example, the product is $10/mo; you might offer a plan at $100/year, exclaiming “get two months free!” on the pricing page.</p>
<p>This is a great excuse to raise prices slightly: Offer the annual plan at 12 times the <em>current</em> monthly price, then increase the month-to-month price by something like 20% (i.e. the “2 months free” amount). Existing customers can be grandfathered in if you want, or ask them to switch to annual to preserve their monthly rate.</p>
<p>What does this do to our payback period?</p>
<p>In terms of cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before: We paid $80 to get $10 of MRR, which is $120/year.</li>
<li>Now: We paid $80 and also got $120/year, <strong>but we got the $120 today.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This gives us an infinite marketing budget.</strong> To see why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We spend $80 on (say) Twitter ads. But not in cash; it’s on our credit card.</li>
<li>We get $120 in our bank account. We mentally set aside the <code>GPM</code> costs that we <em>will</em> incur, that this income will need to cover. Those costs are $40, which leaves us with $80 that we can actually spend.</li>
<li><em>Later</em>, our credit card bill comes due, and finally the $80 ad cost leaves our bank account.</li>
<li><strong>Which means we never actually lost the $80, in terms of cash!</strong> </li>

<p>This completely transforms the growth potential of the business, without raising money.</p>
<p>In real life, not all customers select annual plans. However, this is still transformative because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if only a third of customers select an annual plan, it’s still a huge impact to cash-flow.</li>
<li>You could raise prices on the monthly plans even further, which both (a) increases selection of the annual plan and (b) decreases the pay-back period of the monthly plan.</li>
<li>You could offer an annual plan only. (However an “even more expensive monthly plan” is typically a better way of <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/" data-title="Never say “no,” but rarely say “yes.”" data-desc="“Focus” requires saying “no” to most things, but there’s a way to do it that allows you to say “yes” exactly when it matters most." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/thumbnail-1200w_huc45f643479f2df4ff948404e785b6a69_1476334_352x185_resize_q75_h2_mitchellnetravali_3.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/thumbnail-1200w_huc45f643479f2df4ff948404e785b6a69_1476334_704x370_resize_q75_h2_mitchellnetravali_3.webp">saying yes instead of no</a>, as it retains optionality for the customer and is very profitable for you.)</li>

<h2 id="commonly-asked-questions">Commonly-asked questions <a href="#commonly-asked-questions"></a>
</h2><p>After espousing this policy for more than a decade, here are the common questions and conversations:</p>
<dl>
<dt>I hear that annual-plan customers cancel less often. So, will encouraging annual plans also decrease my cancellation rate?</dt>
<dd>No, but it is useful in cancellation analysis.</dd>
<dd>The reason people on annual plans have a higher retention rate, is that they self-select into those plans. What type of person does that? A person who is already intending to stay. So, offering annual doesn’t change your overall cancellation rate, but it does segregate customers in a useful way: Those more likely to cancel are now identifying themselves.</dd>
<dd>Which means, you can contact them and learn more about why they feel that way, and possibly then do something to improve cancellations, which is likely one of the most valuable things you can do. You can also compare their behavior and responses with those on annual plans, to tease out what’s actually different between the cohorts.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>When someone on an annual plan cancels after, say, seven months, should I refund them the remainder of the term?</dt>
<dd>You can pick anything along this scale of generosity:</dd>
<dd><em>Refund pro-rata.</em> </dd>
<dd><em>Refund as if monthly.</em> </dd>
<dd><em>No refunds.</em> </dd>
<dt>What if the customer cancels before the payback period elapses?</dt>
<dd>Astute readers will notice that the “payback period” model didn’t include cancellations.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, not all customers who sign up on day 1 will still be here on day 30, much less day 300 or day 3000. In particular, if they cancel before the payback period, that’s a net-loss for the business. Don’t we need to account for that somehow?</dd>
<dd>Yes! Cancellations were omitted here for simplicity, but in practice you cannot ignore them. A simple way to account for them, is to first calculate your retention rate across the nominal payback period. For example, if payback is 12 months, what is your 12-month retention (<code>r</code>)? Excellent for Enterprise software is <code>r = 95%</code>; for SMB is <code>75%</code>; Shopify is just <code>50%</code>.</dd>
<dd>Then, we declare that the customers who <em>stay</em>, must make up the costs for the customers who <em>leave</em>. Therefore if the nominal payback period is <code>p</code> (as defined earlier), we actually need to wait <code>p / r</code> to get paid back.</dd>
<dd>This formula is not exactly right either, but it’s a simple method that gets you to the right vicinity.</dd>
<dt>What about all the other expenses at the company? CAC isn’t the only cost.</dt>
<dd>That’s right, saying “infinite budget” is artistic license to make the point, which is that it’s transformative for cash flow.</dd>

<p>I hope you can use annual plans to dramatically change your cash-flow!</p>
