<p data-block-key="6ibpj">A few things that have made me laugh recently:</p><p data-block-key="9q109">The bit in <a href="https://beta.prx.org/stories/279386">an episode of I Only Listen To The Mountain Goats (S2E9)</a> where John Darnielle says &#34;People always ask me to play &#39;No Children&#39; at weddings. Like -- No, I will not! I will absolutely not set the table for your wedding that way! If you wanna do that with a DJ, that&#39;s between you and the God that made you.&#34;</p><p data-block-key="b1ahp">The idea of a scam where someone goes around suggesting to small towns that what would really solve their juvenile delinquency problems is a production of <i>The Music Man</i>. Of course you&#39;ll need to pay up front for the costumes, and allow four weeks for delivery...</p><p data-block-key="fepmn">Replies to <a href="https://twitter.com/NoContextBrits/status/1519766646814126082">a tweet</a> about a time Rage Against The Machine, in a performance on British TV, went ahead and used profanity (in the line &#34;F--- you, I won&#39;t do what you tell me&#34;) despite the producers&#39; request that they not. Examples: <a href="https://nitter.net/KCGoji/status/1519767848599515136">&#34;Heck yeah I will do what you tell me! :)” and &#34;Best All Bout Dat Machine lyric ever.&#34;</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BROCKHARDNUCK/status/1519767708660764672">&#34;Who did they think they were having on? Comply With the Machine??&#34;</a> with responses such as &#34;Let&#39;s compromise with the machine&#34; and &#34;A little bit of machine is necessary&#34;.</p>
