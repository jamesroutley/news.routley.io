<p><strong>Started</strong>: November 2024</p>



<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Unity is a game engine that is used to create 2D and 3D games. The Unity Essentials In-Editor Pathway is a free introductory course on the Unity Learn platform. From the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials-in-editor">course description</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Designed for anyone new to Unity, this in-Editor learning journey is your first step toward creating confidently in the Unity Editor and bringing your visions to life. In this learning Pathway, you’ll design different rooms of a house, learning the essentials of one key skillset as you complete each room.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The course covers the Unity Hub and Unity Editor interfaces, 2D and 3D scene navigation and creation, audio essentials, an introduction to programming using C# scripts, and how to publish your game.</p>



<p><strong>My Story</strong>: I started the Unity Essentials Pathway back in <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/working-on-cs50x-final-project/">November 2024</a> and worked on it here and there over the past several months. I had been curious about Unity for <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/game-dev/">a long time</a>, since many of my favorite games were built in Unity, but I kept putting it off. Finally I decided to just start, even if I only spent a few minutes on it here and there, since little steps add up over time. </p>



<p>I chose the in-editor version of the pathway, which is an experimental version that includes the tutorials right in the Unity editor instead of in the browser, which turned out to be a cool way to feel more immersed in the editor instead of having to switch back and forth, though I did run into some bugs here and there.</p>



<p>I had fun completing the tutorial assignments and finding my way around, but along the way I realized that Unity may not be the best tool for the kinds of games I am most interested in making right now, tiny narrative games using <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-16-croissant-maker/">Twine</a> or <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-42-twenty-million-minutes/">Bitsy</a>. I’m still glad I took the time to complete the course, since it was something I was curious about for so long. And who knows, maybe I will use it for something in the future.</p>



<p>My final project is on <a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/78e4f370-7e71-42c0-8bd5-61a536f337ab/unity-essentials-project">Unity Play here</a>.</p>
