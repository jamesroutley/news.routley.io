    <h1>The Illustrated Stable Diffusion</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>AI image generation is the most recent AI capability blowing people’s minds (mine included). The ability to create striking visuals from text descriptions has a magical quality to it and points clearly to a shift in how humans create art. The release of <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> is a clear milestone in this development because it made a high-performance model available to the masses (performance in terms of image quality, as well as speed and relatively low resource/memory requirements).</p>

<p>After experimenting with AI image generation, you may start to wonder how it works.</p>

<p>This is a gentle introduction to how Stable Diffusion works.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-text-to-image.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a number of different ways. Let’s focus at first on image generation from text only (text2img). The image above shows an example text input and the resulting generated image (The actual complete prompt is here). Aside from text to image, another main way of using it is by making it alter images (so inputs are text + image).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-img2img-image-to-image.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Let’s start to look under the hood because that helps explain the components, how they interact, and what the image generation options/parameters mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-components-of-stable-diffusion">The Components of Stable Diffusion</h2>

<p>Stable Diffusion is a system made up of several components and models. It is not one monolithic model.</p>

<p>As we look under the hood, the first observation we can make is that there’s a text-understanding component that translates the text information into a numeric representation that captures the ideas in the text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-text-understanding-component-image-generation.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>We’re starting with a high-level view and we’ll get into more machine learning details later in this article. However, we can say that this text encoder is a special Transformer language model (technically: the text encoder of a CLIP model). It takes the input text and outputs a list of numbers (a vector) representing each word/token in the text.</p>

<p>That information is then presented to the Image Generator, which is composed of a couple of components itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/Stable-diffusion-text-info-to-image-generator.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>The image generator goes through two stages:</p>

<p>1- <strong>Image information creator</strong></p>

<p>This component is the secret sauce of Stable Diffusion. It’s where a lot of the performance gain over previous models is achieved.</p>

<p>This component runs for multiple steps to generate image information. This is the <em>steps</em> parameter in Stable Diffusion interfaces and libraries which often defaults to 50 or 100.</p>

<p>The image information creator works completely in the <em>image information space</em> (or <em>latent</em> space). We’ll talk more about what that means later in the post. This property makes it faster than previous diffusion models that worked in pixel space. In technical terms, this component is made up of a UNet neural network and a scheduling algorithm.</p>

<p>The word “diffusion” describes what happens in this component. It is the step by step processing of information that leads to a high-quality image being generated in the end (by the next component, the image decoder).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/Stable-diffusion-image-generator-information-creator.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>2- <strong>Image Decoder</strong></p>

<p>The image decoder paints a picture from the information it got from the information creator. It runs only once at the end of the process to produce the final pixel image.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-cliptext-unet-autoencoder-decoder.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>With this we come to see the three main components (each with its own neural network) that make up Stable Diffusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ClipText</strong> for text encoding. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>UNet + Scheduler</strong> to gradually process/diffuse information in the information (latent) space. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Autoencoder Decoder</strong> that paints the final image using the processed information tensor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-components-and-tensors.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<h2 id="what-is-diffusion-anyway">What is Diffusion Anyway?</h2>

<p>Diffusion is the process that takes place inside the pink “image information creator” component. Having the token embeddings that represent the input text, and a random starting <em>image information tensor</em> (these are also called <em>latents</em>), the process produces an information tensor that the image decoder uses to paint the final image.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-diffusion-process.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>This process happens in a step-by-step fashion. Each step adds more relevant information. To get an intuition of the process, we can inspect the random latents tensor, and see that it translates to visual noise. Visual inspection in this case is passing it through the image decoder.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-latent-space-pixel-space.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Diffusion happens in multiple steps, each step operates on an input latents tensor, and produces another latents tensor that better resembles the input text and all the visual information the model picked up from all images the model was trained on.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-unet-steps.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>We can visualize a set of these latents to see what information gets added at each step.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-denoising-steps-latents.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>The process is quite breathtaking to look at</p>

</p>

<p>Something especially fascinating happens between steps 2 and 4 in this case. It’s as if the outline emerges from the noise.</p>

<h3 id="how-diffusion-works">How diffusion works</h3>
<p>The central idea of generating images with diffusion model relies on the fact that we have powerful computer vision models. Given a large enough dataset, these models can learn complex operations. Diffusion models approach image generation by framing the problem as following:</p>

<p>Say we have an image, let’s take a first step of adding some noise to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-forward-step-1.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>
<p>Let’s call the “slice” of noise we added to the image “noise slice 1”. Let’s now take another step adding some more noise to the noisy image (“noise slice 2”).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-forward-step-2.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>At this point, the image is made entirely of noise. Now let’s take these as training examples for a computer vision neural network. Given a step number and image, we want it to predict how much noise was added in the previous step.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-u-net-noise-training-examples.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>
<p>While this example shows two steps from image to total noise, we can control how much noise to add to the image, and so we can spread it over tens of steps, creating tens of training examples per image for all the images in a training dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-noise-predictor-dataset-and-model.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>
<p>The beautiful thing now is that once we get this noise prediction network working properly, it can effectively paint pictures by removing noise over a number of steps.</p>

<h3 id="painting-images-by-removing-noise">Painting images by removing noise</h3>

<p>The trained noise predictor can take a noisy image, and the number of the denoising step, and is able to predict a slice of noise.</p>
<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-denoising-step-1.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>The slice of noise is predicted so that if we subtract it from the image, we get an image that’s closer to the images the model was trained on.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-denoising-step-2.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>If the training dataset was of aesthetically pleasing images (e.g., <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-aesthetics/">LAION Aesthetics</a>, which Stable Diffusion was trained on), then the resulting image would tend to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-image-generation.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>This concludes the description of image generation by diffusion models mostly as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</a>. Now that you have this intuition of diffusion, you know how the main components of not only Stable Diffusion, but also Dall-E 2 and Google’s Imagen.</p>

<p>Note that the diffusion process we described so far generates images without using any text data. In the next sections we’ll describe how text is incorporated in the process.</p>

<h2 id="speed-boost-diffusion-on-compressed-latent-data-instead-of-the-pixel-image">Speed Boost: Diffusion on Compressed (latent) Data Instead of the Pixel Image</h2>

<p>To speed up the image generation process, the Stable Diffusion paper runs the diffusion process not on the pixel images themselves, but on a compressed version of the image. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">The paper</a> calls this “Departure to Latent Space”.</p>

<p>This compression (and later decompression/painting) is done via an autoencoder. The autoencoder compresses the image into the latent space using its encoder, then reconstructs it using only the compressed information using the decoder.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-autoencoder.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Now the forward diffusion process is done on the compressed latents. The slices of noise are of noise applied to those latents, not to the pixel image. And so the noise predictor is actually trained to predict noise in the compressed representation (the latent space).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-latent-forward-process.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>The forward process (using the autoencoder’s encoder) is how we generate the data to train the noise predictor. Once it’s trained, we can generate images by running the reverse process (using the autoencoder’s decoder).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-forward-and-reverse-process.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>These two flows are what’s show in Figure 3 of the LDM/Stable Diffusion paper:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/article-Figure3-1-1536x762.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>This figure additionally shows the “conditioning” components, which in this case is the text prompts describing what image the model should generate. So let’s dig into the text components.</p>

<h3 id="the-text-encoder-a-transformer-language-model">The Text Encoder: A Transformer Language Model</h3>

<p>A Transformer language model is used as the language understanding component that takes the text prompt and produces token embeddings. The released Stable Diffusion model uses ClipText (A <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">GPT-based model</a>), while the paper used <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a>.</p>

<p>The choice of language model is shown by the Imagen paper to be an important one. Swapping in larger language models had more of an effect on generated image quality than larger image generation components.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/text-language-models-clip-image-generation.png"/></p></div>

<p>The early Stable Diffusion models just plugged in the pre-trained ClipText model released by OpenAI. It’s possible that future models may switch to the newly released and much larger <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/large-openclip/">OpenCLIP</a> variants of CLIP. This new batch includes text models of sizes up to 354M parameters, as opposed to the 63M parameters in ClipText.</p>

<h4 id="how-clip-is-trained">How CLIP is trained</h4>

<p>CLIP is trained on a dataset of images and their captions. Think of a dataset looking like this, only with 400 million images and their captions:</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/images-and-captions-dataset.png"/></p></div>

<p>CLIP is a combination of an image encoder and a text encoder. Its training process can be simplified to thinking of taking an image and its caption. We encode them both with the image and text encoders respectively.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/clip-training-step-1.png"/>
  <br/>
  
</p>

<p>We then compare the resulting embeddings using cosine similarity. When we begin the training process, the similarity will be low, even if the text describes the image correctly.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/clip-training-step-2.png"/>
  <br/>
  
</p>

<p>We update the two models so that the next time we embed them, the resulting embeddings are similar.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/clip-training-step-3.png"/>
  <br/>
  
</p>

<p>By repeating this across the dataset and with large batch sizes, we end up with the encoders being able to produce embeddings where an image of a dog and the sentence “a picture of a dog” are similar. Just like in <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">word2vec</a>, the training process also needs to include <strong>negative examples</strong> of images and captions that don’t match, and the model needs to assign them low similarity scores.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-text-information-into-the-image-generation-process">Feeding Text Information Into The Image Generation Process</h2>

<p>To make text a part of the image generation process, we have to adjust our noise predictor to use the text as an input.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-unet-inputs.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Our dataset now includes the encoded text. Since we’re operating in the latent space, both the input images and predicted noise are in the latent space.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-text-dataset.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>To get a better sense of how the text tokens are used in the Unet, let’s look deeper inside the Unet.</p>

<h3 id="layers-of-the-unet-noise-predictor-without-text">Layers of the Unet Noise predictor (without text)</h3>

<p>Let’s first look at a diffusion Unet that does not use text. Its inputs and outputs would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/unet-inputs-outputs.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Inside, We see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Unet is a series of layers that work on transforming the latents tensor</li>
  <li>Each layer operates on the output of the previous layer</li>
  <li>Some of the outputs are measure (via residual connections) into the processing later in the network</li>
  <li>The timestep is transformed into a time step embedding vector, and that’s what gets used in the layers</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/unit-resnet-steps.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<h3 id="layers-of-the-unet-noise-predictor-with-text">Layers of the Unet Noise predictor WITH text</h3>

<p>Let’s now look how to alter this system to include attention to the text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/unet-with-text-inputs-outputs.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>The main change to the system we need to add support for text inputs (technical term: text conditioning) is to add an attention layer between the ResNet blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/stable-diffusion/unet-with-text-steps.png"/>
  <br/>

</p>

<p>Note that the resnet block don’t directly look at the text. But the attention layers merge those text representations in the latents. And now the next ResNet can utilize that incorporated text information in its processing.</p>
