<p dir="auto">Recently, pictures of TSA master baggage keys got leaked by the Washington Post and also <a href="https://www.travelsentry.org/security/pdf/passkeys.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDFs</a> hosted on TravelSentry&#39;s Website. This repo is a <a href="https://twitter.com/InfoSecJesus/status/641662669758574593" rel="nofollow">reproduction attempt</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Security researchers have <a href="http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html" rel="nofollow">long warned</a> of the dangers of using <a href="https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s/status/642123709311008768" rel="nofollow">master-keyed locks</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TSA has issued an official statement making it known that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/16/tsa-doesnt-really-care-luggage-locks-hacked/" rel="nofollow">they don&#39;t even care that we&#39;ve done this</a>, as the now-pointless locks affect theft prevention, not airline safety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>[!] Important</strong>: These keys have not been widely-tested, though we do have reports that many <a href="https://twitter.com/bernard/status/641662069427847168" rel="nofollow">do work</a> from at least <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/video-3d-printed-tsa-travel-sentry-keys-really-do-open-tsa-locks/" rel="nofollow">one source</a>. 006 May never work, as we&#39;re not sure of the depth of the &#34;dimples,&#34; and also consumer-grade 3D printers may not be up to such finely-detailed tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Added the stubby versions of the keys by <a href="https://github.com/MS3FGX">MS3FGX</a>, which appear to <a href="https://twitter.com/JimyLongs/status/641820527892414464" rel="nofollow">still work fine !</a></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/darksim905" rel="nofollow">@darksim905</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/irongeek_adc/status/640907196197404672" rel="nofollow">@irongeek_adc</a> and some anonymous others who all sent us images and information surrounding these keys. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s" rel="nofollow">@j0hnnyXm4s</a> for his key size ratios and issue management / advice.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Safe Skies manufactures TSA-approved locks under their own standard, competing with Travel Sentry, and has even sued Travel Sentry for patent infringement. They have a much smaller market share than Travel Sentry. These locks can be identified by noting the words &#34;Safe Skies&#34; next to the keyway, in a similar location as the Travel Sentry &#34;TSA00N&#34; notations. All available information indicates only one override/master key exists for their entire system. Armed with this knowledge and a large hammer (no, really), <a href="https://twitter.com/darksim905" rel="nofollow">@darksim905</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nite0wl_2600" rel="nofollow">Nite0wl</a> reverse-engineered the master key bitting, and created 3D files suitable for printing. They presented their findings along with <a href="https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s" rel="nofollow">@j0hnnyXm4s</a> at the 11th Hackers of Planet Earth conference in New York City, in July of 2016.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you print a key and it doesn&#39;t work:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">First, use a caliper or other highly-accurate device to make sure the key you printed is accurate to the model. Humidity, expansion &amp; ambient room temperature can have serious effects on print size accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If it IS accurate, open an issue on the github, specify the problem file, and what problems exist (i.e. &#34;Too wide for the keyway,&#34; &#34;Too tall for the keyway,&#34; etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Upload a picture of your lock&#39;s keyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you have the original keys for the lock, provide a measurement of the key from shoulder to tip, total height of the shoulders, and width. (i.e. X, Y &amp; Z axes of the blade). Some keys only have one shoulder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
