<p>Wondering where software developers are – or aren&#39;t – earning top dollar? Just look at a list of the leading outsourcers and their most popular outsourcing destinations. </p>
<p>That&#39;s the data that can be found in a global software engineering <a href="https://codesubmit.io/blog/software-engineer-salary-by-country/" rel="nofollow">salary report</a> this month from CodeSubmit, which develops coding challenges for technical interviews. According to the report, the US leads in developer salaries with an average of $110,140, followed by Switzerland and Israel – the UK comes in at $55,275 (£46,000), just below Australia – while the poorest-paying countries are led by Nigeria, which pays an average of just $7,255 annually to software devs – less than seven percent of the average US salary. </p>
<p>India, one of the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-best-countries-to-outsource-software-development-in-2022" rel="nofollow">most popular destinations</a> for outsourcing technically skilled jobs, pays only $470 more on average than Nigeria. The Philippines, also popular for outsourcing, pays on average only $7,936, while popular eastern European outsourcing destinations Poland and Ukraine pay between $22,000 and $23,000 per year. China, another top outsourcing destination, pays developers an average of $23,790.</p>
<h3>
  <span>Where outsourcing originates ...</span>
</h3>
<p>In terms of who is outsourcing, the numbers in CodeSubmit&#39;s study coincide here, too: America, far and away the highest-paying country for software developers, is also the world&#39;s biggest outsourcer, being reportedly responsible for approximately <a href="https://teamstage.io/outsourcing-statistics/" rel="nofollow">84 percent</a> of outsourcing deals in the world. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/31/should-businesses-hire-usa-when-it-comes-to-technology/?sh=410f25be7fc4" rel="nofollow">refrain</a> remains the same from US tech companies: they can&#39;t find enough people to fill jobs, and rising salary demands, particularly in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/09/gartner_only_29pc_of_it/">great resignation</a>, have made filling positions more expensive. Well, until they started pausing or slowing down hiring, with Apple the latest to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slow-hiring-spending-some-teams-next-year-bloomberg-2022-07-18/">tap the brakes</a>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/great-resignation-tech-companies-offshoring-engineering-jobs-globalization-remote-2022-6" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with Business Insider, Chris Bakke, CEO at tech recruiting platform Laskie, said remote work and high salaries make hiring stateside software engineers less essential. &#34;US tech companies are saying, &#39;We can hire an engineer in the United States for $300,000 or we can hire somebody great internationally with very similar experience for $75,000,&#39;&#34; Bakke said.</p>

  <span>... and where it ends up</span>
</h3>
<p>That same article quotes statistics from California-based payroll startup Deel, which since launching in 2019 has hired 1,100 people in 75 countries. Only 18 percent of the San Francisco company&#39;s staff work in the States; just one percent of the company&#39;s US employees work in engineering, data, and product. </p>
<p>Along with China, Poland, Ukraine, the Philippines, India, and Nigeria, Russia, South Africa and Brazil are also leading outsourcing destinations, CodeSubmit&#39;s study indicated. While that list doesn&#39;t coincide directly with other lists of the <a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/best-countries-to-outsource-software-development/" rel="nofollow">most common destinations</a> to outsource software development, there is considerable overlap. </p>
