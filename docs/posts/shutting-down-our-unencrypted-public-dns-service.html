    <h1>Shutting down our unencrypted public DNS service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>On the 16th January 2023 we will shut down our <strong>legacy</strong> public DNS service, currently reachable from this IP:Â  193.138.218.74</p>

<p>This service is being replaced by our <strong>encrypted</strong> DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS offering, which you can <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">learn more about here.</a></p>

<p>This is only impactful to you if you have hard-coded the IP: 193.138.218.74 into a service such as PiHole or another recursive DNS resolver service. We <strong>strongly</strong> recommend verifying whether there are changes or updates that can be applied if this is the case.</p>

<p>Our DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS services are available if you are running your own recursive DNS resolver.</p>

<p>This alteration <strong>might not even impact</strong> you as a user, since DNS is hijacked on our VPN servers. Unless you have specified a custom DNS server within our app or configuration file, you will have never touched this IP in recent years.</p>

<p>Our DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS services are available worldwide, for anyone, whether they are a customer of Mullvad VPN or not.</p>
