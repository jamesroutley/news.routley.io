    <h1>Care Doesn&#39;t Scale</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I met a social worker whose job was to look after four orphaned
children. She’d alternate with her coworkers spending 24 hours at a time
living with the kids, effectively acting as their parent. The children,
unsurprisingly, had a lot of trauma and so her job was certainly not an
easy one, but she found it deeply rewarding and she really cared about
the kids, and this way the kids—who otherwise might not have had any
consistent parental or sibling figures in their lives—grew up together
as a family.</p>
<p>I was struck by how reasonable the arrangement was. If you wanted to
design a social system to care for children who have lost their parents,
I don’t know if you could do much better. With four children, each kid
can get individual care and attention, but there were four social
workers each had three 24-hour blocks per week, so they had time to have
their own lives with enough flexibility to take vacations and sometimes
have two workers with the kids instead of one.</p>
<p>To get that individualized care, though, they had four social workers
and four children. One-to-one.</p>
<p>Of course, you could probably add a few more children, or subtract a
social worker, as a cost-saving measure. It’d be less sustainable, but
it wouldn’t significantly change the experience. But you couldn’t stray
that far from one-to-one without changing the nature of the experience,
without industrializing it to the point that individual care is lost.
With four kids, the kids can feel like kids; if there were forty kids,
they’d probably feel like they were cattle.</p>
<p>We’re pretty limited when it comes to care. In any given moment, you
can only really care deeply and individually for one person.</p>
<p>There was some pain in that realization. So many of my utopian
dreams—what if we could live in a society where everyone can get the
food, the housing, the healthcare, the opportunities for growth that
they deserve—come from a place of wishing that we could live in a world
where people are cared for. The enormity of the scale of human suffering
makes individual effort feel futile, driving people towards solutions
that scale—we should build more housing, reform healthcare, reform the
financial system, have a different kind of government, change the
incentives, etc.</p>
<p>Adults often come to see small-scale solutions to major problems as
childish. Yeah, you could make a couple of sandwiches for the hungry—but
there are billions of people who need better access to food. Maybe your
effort is better spent working on solutions that can scale. So it is
that children who feel bad for the guy on the street grow into college
students who have strong opinions about socialism or technological
development.</p>
<p>Then something shifts again when those students graduate and start
working and have kids, and suddenly they’re thinking a lot more about
bibs and bottles than economic models. Some people see the waning of
fervor for grand causes as a sign that people are losing hope in a
better world, becoming complacent. Others see it as a natural part of
getting older, as a healthy way of focusing on what they can control, of
not getting lost in self-righteous hypotheticals. There’s probably some
truth on both sides. But I wonder if part of that smaller focus comes
from a deep realization that care doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>Unscalability is anathema to the engineering mind. It’s weirdly
terrifying to consider that you could be the CEO of a company devoted to
feeding the world, spend your life developing the Food-o-Matic which can
feed everyone on the planet, but if you neglect to care for your kids,
then your kids just have to live with your neglect.</p>
<p>It’s been a good opportunity to re-examine my worldview. I’ve
regarded low-scale activities with a kind of casual dismissal for much
of my life—not that I don’t respect or value people with occupations
operating at an individual level, but I was always skeptical about
pursuing such things myself because some part of me thinks “we live in a
massive world in a time of massive reach. A textbook could educate
thousands of people, a speech could inspire millions, great software
could touch the lives of billions. Why would you choose limited pursuits
when you can do something limitless? Isn’t unbounded potential for scale
better than the mere individual?”</p>
<p>Software engineering as a field is made up of people who are very
conscious of missed opportunities for scale (“why isn’t there an API for
this so I don’t have to call in and wait on hold for an hour?”). And
that’s not a bad thing! Software has added a ton of value to the world
by making things accessible to everyone that used to be accessible to
only a few. Scale isn’t bad, at least not necessarily. Industrial is
perfectly capable of being better than custom. Sometimes the YouTube
video is more helpful than the private tutor.</p>
<p>But there’s some part of me that twinges with a sense of
insufficiency when I think about doing something small-scale. I mean,
this very second I’m writing a blog post—converting these thoughts into
a format conducive for consumption at scale. It can be tempting to view
individualized work as something paltry or unimportant. It doesn’t help
that people whose work can scale get access to fame, wealth, and power
that will rarely be available to people operating at an individual
level. And yeah, sometimes small-scale work is just wasted effort, the
result of being too proud to see that the same result could be achieved
with less work.</p>
<p>But sometimes things can’t scale without changing. Care doesn’t
really scale without becoming something else. Thinking about this has
helped me reframe how I feel about things like parents looking after
their children, things like my friends taking time to chat with me. It’s
not that I cynically didn’t think those things were important; it’s just
difficult to shake the sense that people, that I, should be doing
bigger, better things.</p>
<p>For care, though, it doesn’t get bigger and better. If your goal is
to educate the world, you can look for ways to educate thousands or
millions. If you want to inspire the world, the billions await. But if
your goal is to care for the world, and in a given moment you’re deeply
caring for one person, you’re doing the best it’s possible to do.</p>
<p>There’s something oddly comforting about that.</p>
