                        <p>Sequoia Capital removed its glowing profile of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried that was making the rounds online this week and replaced it with a somber update about its investment in the company, which has cratered and resulted in a complete write-off for the VC firm.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/" data-analytics-module="body_link">VC firm self-published the profile</a> of 30-year-old Bankman-Fried in September, chronicling his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/" data-analytics-module="body_link">ascent to a net worth</a> of $24 billion and crypto tycoon status, writing that he &#34;himself has amassed more wealth in a shorter period of time than anyone else, ever.&#34;</p><p>However, the 13,000-word profile was no longer available on Sequoia&#39;s website on Thursday as Bankman-Fried and FTX are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/ftx-investors-told-that-without-more-capital-bankruptcy-likely" data-analytics-module="body_link">reportedly</a> scrambling to raise around $8 billion from investors to save the company for bankruptcy.</p><p>In its place, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/ftx/" data-analytics-module="body_link">Sequoia posted an update</a> dated November 9, 2022, where it says, &#34;A liquidity crunch has created solvency risk for FTX and its future is uncertain.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>The update says &#34;many&#34; have also been affected by the &#34;unexpected&#34; crunch, but that the VC firm&#39;s fiduciary responsibility is to its LPs. Sequoia <a href="https://twitter.com/sequoia/status/1590522718650499073" data-analytics-module="body_link">linked to its letter</a> about marking down its investment in FTX from around <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ftx-investment-zero-vc-firm-sequoia-capital-says-binance-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link">$214 million to $0</a>.</p><p>&#34;For FTX, we believe its fiduciary responsibility is first to its customers, and second to its shareholders,&#34; the update says. &#34;As such, FTX is exploring all opportunities to ensure its customers are able to recover their funds as quickly as possible.&#34;</p><p>A spokesperson for Sequoia did not respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment ahead of publication.</p><p>The profile, which had an estimated read time of over an hour, covered the founder&#39;s story, from learning to trade in New York&#39;s financial district trading shop, Jane Street, to the founding of his trading company Alameda Research and subsequent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-crypto-king-sam-bankman-fried-rise-and-fall-2022-11#by-the-start-of-2019-bankman-fried-and-his-team-were-fervently-working-towards-building-their-own-crypto-exchange-after-four-months-coding-they-launched-ftx-in-may-12" data-analytics-module="body_link">founding of cryptocurrency platform</a> FTX.</p>
                        
                        <p>Bankman-Fried&#39;s utilitarian upbringing and meeting with Will MacAskill, one of the founders of the effective altruism movement, are highlighted in the article to explain his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-crypto-billionaire-profile-ftx-exchange-history-investors-2021-12?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-module="body_link">decision-making and reputation</a> for donating to charity.</p><p>Bankman-Fried&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-league-of-legends-investor-pitch-meeting-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link">first pitch meeting</a> with the VC firm&#39;s partners during its Series B round is also included in the profile, in which the founder laid out his vision to investors for FTX to become a super-app — all while he was playing the video game &#34;League of Legends&#34; on his computer.</p><p>&#34;We were incredibly impressed,&#34; Michelle Bailhe, a partner at Sequoia who set up the meeting, recounted in the article. &#34;It was one of those your-hair-is-blown-back type of meetings.&#34;</p><p>The now-removed Sequoia profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221027181005/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/" data-analytics-module="body_link">is still available to read</a> on the Internet Archive&#39;s Wayback Machine.</p>
