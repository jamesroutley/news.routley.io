One feature of the model, Schwarzschild noted later, was a radius of compression below which a star – or any other spherical mass – would begin to implode indefinitely under its own gravity. If applied to the physics of the real world, this had horrifying implications. It meant that a star would continue collapsing forever, its mass being crushed ever smaller. Its gravitation would become ever more powerful as it insatiably devoured surrounding masses until, finally, it reached the point of &#34;singularity&#34;, a moment where the laws of physics break down, and time and space cease to exist.<!-- --></p><p>Decades later, the Schwarzschild singularity would be recognised as a turning point in theoretical physics – the first time black holes had been hinted at.

On the other hand, it seems he was troubled by the singularities they contained. In 1935, with his colleague Nathan Rosen, he introduced a new concept explicitly designed to do away with them. By connecting one extreme gravitational event with another, the Einstein-Rosen &#34;bridge&#34; – later popularised as a &#34;wormhole&#34; – formed a kind of tunnel between two zones of space-time, replacing singularities of collapsing matter with a fleeting, empty tunnel.

Travelling to the West African island of Principe, he took a series of photographs during a solar eclipse. Made visible by the eclipse&#39;s darkness, the photographs showed that stars in the same sight-line as the Sun appeared in slightly different positions from when they were viewed at night, in the absence of the Sun.

Around 500 trillion times brighter than the Sun, the disc contains an interstellar lightning storm, with temperatures of 10,000C (18,000F) and winds blowing so fast they would go around Earth in a second. The hole at its centre consumes the equivalent of a solar mass every day.

No light can escape it, no energy in any form: no sound, no image, no signal, nothing by which the inside might be examined or understood. In fact, even with the real astronomical black holes that have now been observed it&#39;s <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/singularities-dont-exist-roy-kerr/">still possible that Einstein was right<!-- --></a> – that there is no singularity inside them – because there&#39;s currently no way of finding out directly. But if black holes are what most physicists believe, then they are bottomless, leading only inwards, forever. By definition, they cannot be reasoned with, about or into. They offer an infinity of darkness and destruction: the opposite of enlightenment. They are a test of both courage and reason, a dark pool in which we see the cosmos – and ourselves – reflected.<!-- --></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.benplatts-mills.com/"><i id="ben-platts-mills"><b id="ben-platts-mills">Ben Platts-Mills<!-- --></b></i></a><i id="is-a-writer-and-artist-whose-work-investigates-power,-reasoning-and-vulnerability,-and-the-ways-science-is-represented-in-popular-culture.-his-memoir,"> is a writer and artist whose work investigates power, reasoning and vulnerability, and the ways science is represented in popular culture.
