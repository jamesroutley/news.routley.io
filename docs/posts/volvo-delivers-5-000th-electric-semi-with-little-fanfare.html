<p>With the Tesla Semi making headlines consistently since its first public appearance <em>waaay</em> back back in 2017, you might think they were some kind of market leaders. Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks has quietly delivered its 5,000th electric semi truck … and they’re just getting started.</p>



<p>Volvo delivered its first all electric semi truck 2019. Since then, <strong>Volvo customers in more than 50 countries around the world have logged more than 100 <em>million</em> miles</strong> (170 million km – <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/01/volvo-trucks-have-logged-over-50-million-battery-electric-miles/">and almost half of that in the last 14 months as the size of its deployed fleet grows</a>) in real-world commercial operations, eliminating massive amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> and NOx emissions and reducing traffic noise. All the while, they’re making life a little cleaner and quieter for the people who live and work near the roads they travel.</p>



<p>They’re massive achievements, and Volvo Truck executives are very rightly proud of themselves for making them happen.</p>



<p>“It’s rewarding to see that transport companies continue to embrace the benefits with electric trucks in a wide range of transport segments,” offers Roger Alm, President Volvo Trucks. “Volvo’s battery-electric trucks are available here and now, providing our customers and transport buyers with a more sustainable alternative that makes business sense, and many of our customers are coming back to us to grow their electric fleets.”</p>

<p>They say comparison is the thief of joy. That’s especially true if you suck and you compare yourself to people who are awesome – <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/23/tesla-ranks-under-unitedhealth-temu-bp-in-brand-reputation-poll-due-to-musk/">and since Elon sucks like it’s his job</a>, I’m thieving a ton of joy by comparing the 140-odd number of Tesla Semi trucks out there to Volvo’s much larger, less-sucky 5,000-plus number.</p>



<p>With a head start like that, more than half a decade of production delays, and a “<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/04/tesla-semi-suffers-delays-dramatic-price-increase/">dramatic</a>” price increase to something like $420,000 each, it seems like it would be tough for Tesla to catch up (<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/28/tesla-gives-update-semi-factory-on-track-volume-production-2026/">even if they <em>do</em> manage to begin series production in 2026</a>).</p>



<p>That seems especially true in Europe, where Volvo Trucks has established itself as the leader in the heavy electric truck segment for the last five consecutive years with a 47% market share – though the story is a bit different the US and Canada, however, where Volvo’s share of the electric truck segment was “just” 40% in 2024.</p>
