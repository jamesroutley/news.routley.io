<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games">among the best-selling</a> (and perhaps best-known) video games ever.
We grew up playing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_HoloByte">Spectrum HoloByte</a> PC editions.
Erik is even a <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/images/tetris_award_large.jpg">Tetris Master</a>.
Nowadays you can play
<a href="https://tetris.com/play-tetris/">in your browser</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_99">on a Switch</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Effect">on PS4/PC/VR</a>.
</p><p><b>Font design.</b>  Each letter and digit in this typeface is made up of
exactly one of each of the Tetris pieces:
<span id="pieceI"></span> (I),
<span id="pieceJ"></span> (J),
<span id="pieceL"></span> (L),
<span id="pieceO"></span> (O),
<span id="pieceS"></span> (S),
<span id="pieceT"></span> (T), and
<span id="pieceZ"></span> (Z).
Furthermore, the letter is designed so that it can actually be constructed
by stacking these pieces one at a time and be supported by previous pieces,
as in Tetris.
These designs were found by hand, aided by the
<a href="http://burrtools.sourceforge.net/">BurrTools</a> software
which enabled searching for whether the Tetris pieces could fit inside
a candidate outline for a letter.
The piece colors roughly follow
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Game_pieces">The Tetris Company&#39;s standard colors</a>,
or you can switch to black pieces.
The initial rotations follow the standard
<a href="https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS">Super Rotation System</a>.
</p><p><b>Puzzles.</b>
In the <b>puzzle font</b>, the letters are at the correct rotations and
horizontal positions, and their vertical position represents their drop
sequence.  Drop the pieces in your head (or via <b>animate</b>) to figure
out what letter is encoded.
•
Even without puzzle font turned on, in the <b>animated</b> font, you can
try to guess what the letter is before all the pieces have arrived.
•
One final set of puzzles: In the unanimated unpuzzle <b>black-pieces</b> font,
try to figure out how one of each Tetris piece perfectly packs that shape.
(This is the task that BurrTools is very good at.)
</p><p><b>Related mathematics.</b>
(Perfect-information)
<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_IJCGA/">Tetris is NP-complete</a>,
meaning that it&#39;s computationally intractable to figure out whether you can
survive, or clear the board, given an initial board configuration and a
sequence of <i>n</i> pieces to come.
<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/TotalTetris_JIP/">Similar results
hold</a> for <i>k</i>-tris played with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino"><i>k</i>-ominoes</a>
instead of tetrominoes.  Most recently, we
<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/ThinTetris_JIP/">analyzed the
complexity of Tetris with few rows or columns</a>; this font appears
in that paper.
</p><p><b>Acknowledgments.</b>  This font was inspired by a collaboration with
Alex Streif and Kate Jones of
<a href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/">Kadon Enterprises</a>
during <a href="https://bridgesmathart.org/bridges-2017/">BRIDGES 2017</a>,
where we started designing a font using just 5 pieces:
the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino">free
tetrominoes</a>” where S is the same piece as Z and J is the same
piece as L.
Relatedly, Kate Jones designed <a href="https://erikdemaine.org/fonts/tetris/kadon_fonts.jpg">other polyomino
fonts included in some Kadon manuals</a>.
By contrast, this typeface aims closer to the rules of Tetris,
where reflection matters and the pieces must stack and be supported.
