    <h1>Ask HN: Why Adobe still canâ€™t figure out Flash on WASM?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Figma was just bought by Adobe, we all know that. Word &#34;Adobe&#34; brought back to me the memories of early days of my career when I was a Macromedia/Adobe Flash developer and I was working on websites very heavyweight both graphically and animation-wise.</p><p>In 2022 we have SVG, WebGL, canvas, sound API and we can practically rebuild many of those Flash websites. They were accessibility disasters, but today we can do much better.</p><p>All this makes me think: why Adobe haven&#39;t finished yet Flash export to HTML5/WASM which is easy and popular? What&#39;s stopping them? Money or technical obstacles? I can imagine the targeting all the browsers both desktop and mobile and QAing all of that is hard, but feels like doable and web platform is pretty reliable these days?</p><p>And the final question: can people from Figma help Adobe to make Flash actually work? Figma is one of the best WASM/WebGL apps out there which (I presume) very experienced engineering team. I&#39;ve read the blog post when they were running JS interpreter compiled to WASM in a web worker to create secure sandbox used as plugin environment. All of it just works. Can they help?</p></div></div></div>
