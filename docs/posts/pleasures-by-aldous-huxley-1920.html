Pleasures
</p>


<p>We have heard a great deal, since 1914,
about the things which are a menace
to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism;
then the Germans at large; then the
prolongation of the war; then the shortening
of the same; then, after a time, the Treaty of
Versailles; then French militarism - with, all
the while, a running accompaniment of such
minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....</p>

<p>Civilization, however, has resisted the
combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully
well. For still, in 1923, it stands not
so very far from where it stood in that &#34;giant
age before the flood&#34; of nine years since.
Where, in relation to Neanderthal on the
one hand and Athens on the other, where
precisely it stood <i>then</i> is a question which
each may answer according to his taste. The
important fact is that these menaces to our
civilization, such as it is - menaces including
the largest war and the stupidest peace known
to history - have confined themselves in most
places and up till now to mere threats, barking
more furiously than they bite.</p>

<p>No, the dangers which confront our civilization
are not so much the external dangers - wild
men, wars and the bankruptcy that
wars bring after them. The most alarming
dangers are those which menace it from
within, that threaten the mind rather
than the body and estate of contemporary
man.</p>

<p>Of all the various poisons which modern
civilization, by a process of auto-intoxication,
brews quietly up within its own bowels,
few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
none appears more harmless) than that curious
and appalling thing that is technically
known as &#34;pleasure.&#34; &#34;Pleasure&#34; (I place
the word between inverted commas to show
that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized
activities officially known by the same
name) &#34;pleasure&#34; - what nightmare visions
the word evokes! Like every man of sense
and good feeling, I abominate work. But I
would rather put in eight hours a day at a
Government office than be condemned to lead
a life of &#34;pleasure&#34;; I would even, I believe,
prefer to write a million words of journalism
a year.</p>

<p>The horrors of modern &#34;pleasure&#34; arise
from the fact that every kind of organized
distraction tends to become progressively
more and more imbecile. There was a time
when people indulged themselves with distractions
requiring the expense of a certain
intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century,
for example, royal personages and their
courtiers took a real delight in listening to
erudite sermons (Dr. Donne&#39;s, for example)
and academical disputes on points of theology
or metaphysics. Part of the entertainment
offered to the Prince Palatine, on the
occasion of his marriage with James 1.&#39;s
daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on
I forget what philosophical theme, between
the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a
troop of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine
the feelings of a contemporary prince,
if a loyal University were to offer him a
similar entertainment!</p>

<p>Royal personages were not the only people
who enjoyed intelligent pleasures. In Elizabethan
times every lady and gentleman of
ordinary culture could be relied upon, at demand,
to take his or her part in a madrigal
or a motet. Those who know the enormous
complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century
music will realize what this means. To indulge
in their favourite pastime our ancestors
had to exert their minds to an uncommon
degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted
in pleasures requiring the exercise of
a certain intelligence, individuality and personal
initiative. They listened, for example,
to <i>Othello</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i> - apparently
with enjoyment and comprehension.
They sang and made much music. And far
away, in the remote country, the peasants,
year by year, went through the traditional
rites - the dances of spring and summer, the
winter mummings, the ceremonies of harvest
home - appropriate to each successive season.
Their pleasures were intelligent and alive,
and it was they who, by their own efforts,
entertained themselves.</p>

<p>We have changed all that. In place of
the old pleasures demanding intelligence and
personal initiative, we have vast organizations
that provide us with ready-made distractions - distractions
which demand from
pleasure-seekers no personal participation
and no intellectual effort of any sort. To
the interminable democracies of the world a
million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash.
There have always been fourth-rate
writers and dramatists; but their works, in
the past, quickly died without getting beyond
the boundaries of the city or the country in
which they appeared. To-day, the inventions
of the scenario-writer go out from Los
Angeles across the whole world. Countless
audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of
them, no participation; they need only sit
and keep their eyes open.</p>

<p>Do the democracies want music? In the
old days they would have made it themselves.
Now, they merely turn on the gramophone.
Or if they are a little more up-to-date they
adjust their wireless telephone to the right
wave-length and listen-in to the fruity contralto
at Marconi House, singing &#34;The
Gleaner&#39;s Slumber Song.&#34;</p>

<p>And if they want literature, there is the
Press. Nominally, it is true, the Press exists
to impart information. But its real function
is to provide, like the cinema, a distraction
which shall occupy the mind without demanding
of it the slightest effort or the fatigue
of a single thought. This function, it
must be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary
success. It is possible to go on
for years and years, reading two papers every
working day and one on Sundays without
ever once being called upon to think or to
make any other effort than to move the eyes,
not very attentively, down the printed
column.</p>

<p>Certain sections of the community still
practise athletic sports in which individual
participation is demanded. Great numbers
of the middle and upper classes play golf
and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently
rich, shoot birds and pursue the fox
and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass
of the community has now come even to
sport vicariously, preferring the watching of
football to the fatigues and dangers of the
actual game. All classes, it is true, still
dance; but dance, all the world over, the
same steps to the same tunes. The dance has
been scrupulously sterilized of any local or
personal individuality.</p>

<p>These effortless pleasures, these ready-made
distractions that are the same for every
one over the face of the whole Western world,
are surely a worse menace to our civilization
than ever the Germans were. The working
hours of the day are already, for the great
majority of human beings, occupied in the
performance of purely mechanical tasks in
which no mental effort, no individuality, no
initiative are required. And now, in the
hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as
mechanically stereotyped and demanding as
little intelligence and initiative as does our
work. Add such leisure to such work and
the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed
relief to come to the end of.</p>

<p>Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization
looks as though it might easily decline into
a kind of premature senility. With a mind
almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to
entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested
in the ready-made distractions offered
from without that nothing but the
grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence
and crudity can move it, the democracy
of the future will sicken of a chronic
and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps,
the way the Romans went: the Romans who
came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing
now, the capacity to distract themselves;
the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
entertainments in which they had no
participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking
elephants, more rare and far-fetched
animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand
no less; but owing to the existence of
a few idealists, doesn&#39;t get all it asks for.
The most violent forms of entertainment can
only be obtained illicitly. Let us not
despair, however; we may still live to see
blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome.
The force of a boredom clamouring
to be alleviated may yet prove too much
for the idealists.</p>
