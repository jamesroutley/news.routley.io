Nuclear power is mentioned; the threat of nuclear war is never mentioned. Climate change is not.</p><p>In an essay that declares that &#34;we believe in .. liberating people to make their own choices&#34;, everyone who makes different choices, economic, social, scientific, or otherwise, is either denigrated or ignored.</p><p>In an essay that declares that &#34;we believe in ...  testing ideas empirically&#34;, not one empirical study is cited.</p><p>In the annals of argument, Andreesen&#39;s one-side recital of facts is historic. (Bertrand Russell, whom he cites as an ally, would hardly be pleased to be included, either on the grounds of logic or politics).</p><p>§</p><p>I am a techno-optimist, too, a Founder of two AI companies, someone who has worked on AI since childhood, and who spends every waking moment trying to think about how to achieve a positive outcome. But being long-term optimistic about technology doesn&#39;t mean you have to ignore the short-term (or long-term) risks of technology.</p><p>It means working to recognize the risks, and working to address them, so that we can reach the positive outcomes that are promised, not casting those who recognize those risks as the enemy. It&#39;s mean *working* for a positive future, not just declaring that one is inevitable and hoping for the best.</p><p><em><strong>Gary Marcus</strong><span> is a techno-optimist, but not an Andreesen.</span></em></p><p>https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;mkt_tok=MzgyLUpaQi03OTgAAAGO2BVrjWE_tL3o4OlMtNEihY3jAsMBKQ4k34IBBOtwaPtxN2JReP5PF-FUnXl8mwlkfnNJg-8x7ffoRf40GaU9DFNpBV-TDhDwlD_6fRgT6w</p><div><div><p>Marcus on AI is a reader-supported publication.
