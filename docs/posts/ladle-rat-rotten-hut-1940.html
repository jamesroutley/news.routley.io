                </p><p><SPAN size="+1">This story, believe it or not, is the very 
                  familiar fable of Little Red Riding Hood. This curious version 
                  was written in 1940 by a professor of French named H. L. Chace, 
                  who wanted to show his students that <b>intonation</b> - that 
                  is, the melody of a language - is an integral part of its meaning. 
                  The words here are all common English words, but not the ones 
                  you&#39;d expect to tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood. </SPAN></p></SPAN>
