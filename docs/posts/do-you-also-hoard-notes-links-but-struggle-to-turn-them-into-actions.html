    <h1>Ask HN: Do you also &#34;hoard&#34; notes/links but struggle to turn them into actions?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN — I’m exploring an idea and would love your feedback.</p><p>I’m a builder and user of Obsidian, validating a concept called Concerns. Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.</p><p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):</p><p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.</p><p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:</p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)

  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment

  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)
</code></pre><p>
My own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.</p><p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:</p><p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)</p><p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)</p><p>What I’m asking from you:</p><p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?</p><p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution
(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)</p><p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?</p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)

  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)

  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)

  calendar

  &#34;in my head&#34;
</code></pre><p>
Which one would you actually allow a tool to read?</p><p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1–2)</p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention

  noisy suggestions / interruption

  hallucinations / wrong suggestions

  workflow change / migration cost

  pricing

  others</code></pre></div></div></div>
