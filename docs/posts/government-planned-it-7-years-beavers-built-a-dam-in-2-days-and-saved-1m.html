<p><span><span>In the Czech Republic, beavers built a dam in two days, which local authorities had planned for 7 years.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The rodents have saved the administration $1.2 million.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A project to restore water areas in the Brdy nature park had been under development since 2018. Over the years, the administration collected all the necessary permits and was ready to begin construction.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But it turned out to be unnecessary, as the native beavers, who have lived in the park since 2020, took matters into their own hands, building dams in the same locations planned by the government.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span><span>&#34;The beavers saved us 30 million Czech crowns. They built the dams without any project documentation and for free,&#34; said the head of the nature reserve administration.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Beavers are known for their ability to build giant dams in streams, which function much like a modern dam. The reason they build dams is to create deep water that gives them protection from predators.</span></span></p>
