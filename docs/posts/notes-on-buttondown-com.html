    <h1>Notes on Buttondown.com</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <main>
                <p>We spent $85,000 for <code>buttondown.com</code> in April; this was the biggest capital expenditure I&#39;ve ever made, and though it was coming from cash flow generated by Buttondown rather than my own checking account it was by rough estimation the largest non-house purchase I&#39;ve ever made.</p>
<p>As of August, we&#39;re officially migrated over from <code>buttondown.email</code> to <code>buttondown.com</code>. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do a more corporate blog post on the transition in the future, but for now I want to jot down some process notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire process was made much more painful due to Buttondown&#39;s architecture, which is a hybrid of Vercel/Next (for the marketing site and docs site) and Django/Heroku (for the core app) managed by a HAProxy load balancer to route requests. We ended up using <a href="https://hurl.dev/">hurl</a> as a test harness around HAProxy, something we probably should have done three years ago.</li>
<li>I went in expecting SEO traffic to be hit as Google renegotiates legions of canonical URLs; it hasn&#39;t, at least thus far. Instead, everything seems to have just <em>bumped</em> fairly healthily.</li>
<li>I expected <em>more</em> production issues to come up than actually did. I credit this to a fairly clear scope: the goal was &#34;to migrate all web traffic to .com&#34;, which meant that a) we didn&#39;t need to re-map any paths and b) we didn&#39;t need to worry about mapping SMTP traffic (which still runs through <code>buttondown.email</code>).</li>
<li>The hardest part of the process was the stuff you can&#39;t grep for. URLs on other sites, OAuth redirect URLs, that sort of thing.</li>
<li>Starting with isolated domains (the documentation site, the demo site) that weren&#39;t tied to the aforementioned HAProxy load balancer gave me some good early confidence that the migration would be smooth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall: very happy with how it turned out. I would describe the project roughly as &#34;three months of fretting/planning, one week of grepping, and one week of fallout.&#34;</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Yes, I think so. Most theoretical capital expenditures Buttondown can make right now have a non-trivial ongoing cost associated with them (buy another newsletter company or content vertical and now you have to run it on a day-to-day basis; do a big marketing build-out and you have to manage it; etc.) — this was a sharp but fixed cost, and it&#39;s something that I knew I wanted to do in the fullness of time. (And, most importantly, people stop referring to Buttondown as &#34;Buttondown Email&#34;, a personal pet peeve of mine.)</p>
