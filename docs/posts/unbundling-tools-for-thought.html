    <h1>Unbundling Tools for Thought</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Short version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools for thought promise to let you centralize and hyperlink all your data.</li>
  <li>In practice 95% of the use cases can be naturally unbundled into disjoint
apps, and the lack of centralization and cross-app hyperlinking has no real
negative effects.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a joke in game development that there’s two kinds of game devs: those
who write engines, and those who make games. The people who make the engines do
it for the intellectual pleasure of discovering a beautiful algebra of vectors,
scenes, entities, and events; and watching a beautiful, crystalline machine in
operation. The actual game—which is never finished, rarely started—is an
afterthought. Of course you wouldn’t make a <em>game</em>. That would be parochial. The
engine was the point. People who want to make games just download Unity and push
through the horror.</p>

<p>I’ve written something like six or seven personal wikis over the past
decade. It’s actually an incredibly advanced form of
procrastination<sup id="fnref:college" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:college" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. At this point I’ve tried every possible design
choice.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> I’ve built a few compiler-style wikis: plain-text files in a
<code>git</code> repo statically compiled to HTML. I’ve built a couple using live
servers with server-side rendering. The latest one is an API server with a
React frontend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> I started with plain text files in a git repo, then moved to an
SQLite database with a simple schema. The latest version is an avant-garde
object-oriented hypermedia database with bidirectional links implemented on
top of SQLite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Markup:</strong> I used Markdown here and there. Then I built my own <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/concordia">TeX-inspired
markup language</a>. Then I tried XML, with mixed results. The latest
version uses a WYSIWYG editor made with <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">ProseMirror</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And yet I don’t <em>use</em> them. Why? Building them was fun, sure, but there must be
utility to a personal database.</p>

<p>At first I thought the problem was friction: the higher the activation energy to
using a tool, the less likely you are to use it. Even a small amount of friction
can cause me to go, oh, who cares, can’t be bothered. So each version gets
progressively more frictionless<sup id="fnref:xml" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:xml" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. The latest version uses a WYSIWYG editor
built on top of ProseMirror (it took a great deal for me to actually give in to
WYSIWYG). It also has a link to the daily note page, to make journalling
easier. The only friction is in clicking the bookmark to <code>localhost:5000</code>. It is
literally <em>two clicks</em> to get to the daily note.</p>

<p>And yet I still don’t use it. Why? I’m a great deal more organized now than I
was a few years ago. My filesystem is beautifully structured and everything is
where it should be. I <em>could</em> fill out the contents of a personal wiki.</p>

<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s no point: because everything I can do
with a personal wiki I can do better with a specialized app, and the few
remaining use cases are useless. Let’s break it down.</p>



<p>The following use cases are very naturally separable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Journalling:</strong> 86% of the nodes in my personal wiki are journal
entries. Mostly there’s no reason for them to be there, they are rarely linked
to by anything. I have this fallacious view that I have to use the app to
justify the time investment, therefore I should use it every day, and the
obvious thing you can do every day is write a daily entry that has, say, the
tasks for today along with journal-like text. Rarely do journal entries link
to anything except incidentally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Todo Lists:</strong> I used to write todo lists in the daily entries in my personal
wiki. But this is very spartan: what about recurring tasks, due dates,
reminders, etc.? Now I am a very happy user of <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> (which has
increased my productivity at least 150%) and I’m not looking back.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> if you’re studying something, you can keep your notes in a
TfT. This is one of the biggest use cases. But the problem is never
note-taking, but reviewing notes. Over the years I’ve found that long-form
lecture notes are all but useless, not just because you have to remember to
review them on a schedule, but because spaced repetition can subsume every
single lecture note. It takes practice and discipline to write good spaced
repetition flashcards, but once you do, the long-form prose notes are
themselves redundant.</p>

    <p>I also tried writing notes to ensure I understand something first, and then
translating them to flash cards. I’ve found that, usually, all this does is
add an extra layer of friction with no benefit.<sup id="fnref:notes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notes" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

    <p>I also find that long-form study notes are a form of procrastination. I start
re-organizing the headings, playing with the LaTeX to make everything look
beautiful and structured, to really get the conceptual organization right so
that when future me, who has forgotten everything, reads the notes back, he
can easily re-acquire the information because of how well it is
presented. This is planning for failure. Spaced repetition is insanely
effective, even more so when you get the hang of writing flashcards that work
for you.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.remnote.com/">RemNote</a> combines long-form prose notes and flashcards in the same
interface. The result is that both look like a mess.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contacts:</strong> if you have a page for a person, with data about them, you can
then link to them: when you mention them in journal entries for example, or in
writing meeting notes. I find that this is pointless. You know who <code>[[John
Doe]]</code> refers to. Just use Google Contacts or a spreadsheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiction Writing:</strong> I actually started writing <a href="https://borretti.me/fiction/eog581"><em>The Epiphany of Gliese
581</em></a> in my personal wiki, with fragments and chapters in separate pages,
but I quickly moved to a git repo with Markdown files because 1) I could
compile the disparate files into a single PDF or HTML file for review, and 2)
using git for version control (rather than my personal wiki’s native change
tracking) makes a lot more sense for writing projects.</p>

    <p>And you could argue that I could have stayed in my personal wiki by
implementing support for transclusion (to assemble all the fragments into one
view) and improved the version control UI. But this advice can be applied
equally to every domain I attack with a personal TfT and for which it is
lacking: just write a plugin to do X. The work becomes infinite, the gains are
imaginary. You end up with this rickety structure of plugin upon plugin
sitting on top of your TfT, and UX typically suffers the death by a thousand
cuts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Process Notes:</strong> e.g. “how do I do X in Docker”. I often have cause to write
notes like this and can never quite think of where to put them. But this can’t
be a genuine use case for a tool for thought because there’s very little need
to create links between process notes. So this is just a matter of finding
somewhere to put them in the filesystem or in a note-taking app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organizing Legal Documents:</strong> like immigration papers or medical test
results. A decent folder structure and a few spreadsheets is all it takes in
practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lists:</strong> of things you own, people you know, places you’ve lived in,
education history, work history, the administrativia of life. Spreadsheets
work just fine for this and there is very rarely any genuine need to link from
one to another.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is left?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collection Management:</strong> this is an area where the software solutions are
strangely very lacking.</p>

    <p>I have a <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> library for books. I have a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>
library for papers. I sometimes think about merging the former into the
latter, which is more general and has a cleaner UI, but there’s no urgent need
to do so. I also have folders with music, games, interactive fiction games,
RPG PDFs, board game rulebook PDFs, and art.</p>

    <p>Organizing collections with the filesystem is difficult, because of the
hierarchical nature of the filesystem<sup id="fnref:fs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fs" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>: do I file
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nanosystems-P-K-Eric-Drexler/dp/0471575186"><em>Nanosystems</em></a> under “Chemistry” or “Eric Drexler” or
“Textbooks” or “1992”? Do I file <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_William_Waterhouse_A_Mermaid.jpg"><em>The Mermaid</em></a> under “John William
Waterhouse”, “Painting”, “Edwardian Era”, “Pre-Raphaelite Art”? Any
categorization is defensible, and any categorization makes it harder to browse
by an alternative scheme<sup id="fnref:fuse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fuse" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. I need tags, that is: I need a database.</p>

    <p>And there is a void in app-space, where there should be an app that subsumes
Calibre and the rest, but inexplicably it doesn’t exist<sup id="fnref:notion" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notion" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. And it’s so
obvious what it should be.</p>

    <p>It should be, essentially, an SQLite frontend with a fancy interface. You can
define record templates (like <code>Book</code> or <code>Person</code> or <code>Song</code> or <code>Paper</code>) having
typed fields (e.g. <code>Title: String</code>, <code>PDF: File</code>, <code>Authors:
List[Link[Author]]</code>, field types can be simple data like strings or dates, or
links to other records, or lists of links, or a star rating, etc.), and then
add records to your collection. You can put records in hierarchical folders,
but you can also retrieve them with search and tags.</p>

    <p>The closest thing to this is a KDE app called <a href="https://tellico-project.org/">Tellico</a> that I’ve
never heard anyone talk about using.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you take out everything that is better served by an app or plain old folder
structure, all you’re left with is collection management. So instead of building
a personal wiki I should just build a “generalized Calibre”.</p>



<p>So I often wonder: what do other people use their personal knowledge bases for?
And I look up blog and forum posts where <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> power
users explain their setup. And most of what I see is junk. It’s never the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> of the next Vannevar Bush, it’s always a setup with tens of
plugins, a daily note three pages long that is subdivided into fifty subpages
recording all the inane minutiae of life. This is a recipe for burnout.</p>

<p>People have this aspirational idea of building a vast, oppressively colossal,
deeply interlinked knowledge graph to the point that it almost mirrors every
discrete concept and memory in their brain. And I get the appeal of
maximalism. But they’re counting <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html#:~:text=wrong%20side%20of%20the%20ledger">on the wrong side of the
ledger</a>. Every node in your knowledge graph is a <em>debt</em>. Every link
doubly so. The more you have, the more in the red you are. Every node that has
utility—an interesting excerpt from a book, a pithy quote, a poem, a fiction
fragment, a few sentences that are the seed of a future essay, a list of links
that are the launching-off point of a project—is drowned in an ocean of
banality. Most of our thoughts appear and pass away instantly, for good reason.</p>



<p>There’s this pervasive idea that a tool for thought—a hypermedia database with
bidirectional links—can be a universal database of “you”, and other apps can
be built on top of that data, using plugins. There are two pros here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Centralization of Data:</strong> everything is one central place, rather than
spread out across your filesystem, Dropbox, and database rows in six
different proprietary apps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hyperlinking:</strong> you can link your data pervasively:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Link spaced repetition cards to their corresponding theory notes.</li>
      <li>Link date metadata to the journal entry for that date.</li>
      <li>Link calendar events to tasks, dates, people, and projects.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Obsidian does this: it has some 700 plugins for this reason. There’s plugins for
todo lists, calendar integration, spaced repetition, whatever.</p>

<p>The main drawback is the user experience for this plugin-based app universe is
always going to be inferior to the user experience for domain-specific
apps. It’s very rare that an app does plugins right. It <em>always</em> feels
janky<sup id="fnref:plugins" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:plugins" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But the main drawback is: <em>you don’t need it</em>. The idea of having this giant
graph where all your data is hyperlinked is cute, but in practice, it’s
completely unnecessary. Things live in separate apps just fine. How often,
truly, do you find yourself wanting to link a task in your todo list app to a
file in Dropbox? And if you do manage to build this vast web of links: how often
is each link actually followed?</p>

<p>(Aside: in the web, it makes sense that links should reflect <em>potential</em>, since
you don’t know what people reading your document will want to follow. But in a
personal database it makes a lot more sense that links should follow <em>usage</em>:
they should be a crystallization of the trails you’ve followed, rather than an
a-priori structure that you impose before usage.)</p>

<p>The final argument against this is feasibility. Tiago Forte <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… you will always need to use multiple programs to complete projects. You may
use a centralized platform like Basecamp, Asana, Jira, or Zoho, but technology
is advancing too quickly on too many fronts for any one company to do every
single function best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he is absolutely right, unless you want to rewrite the entire universe on
top of your TfT. The “one graph database” is an unproductive, monistic obsession.</p>

<p>A final note: I find that upwards of 80% of the links in my wikis are
essentially structural, they basically replicate folder structures. The rest are
“incidental reference” links: I’m writing a journal entry saying I’m working on
project X, so I add a link to project X, out of some vague feeling of duty to
link things. And it’s pointless.</p>

<p>The idea of hyperlinks as “generative”, as a path that can follow and acquire
new ideas from the random collision of information, mostly applies to the web,
not to personal databases where all the content is written by you.</p>



<p><img src="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/assets/content/unbundling-tools-for-thought/home.png" alt="The home page of my current personal wiki"/></p>

<p>(The text is a quote from <a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html"><em>Accelerando</em></a>.)</p>

<p>The natural conclusion of most tools for thought is a relational database with
rich text as a possible column type. So that’s essentially what I built: an
object-oriented graph database on top of SQLite.</p>

<p>My current personal wiki is called Cartesian (after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_theater">Cartesian
theatre</a>, since I initially thought to build something much more
ambitious). The conceptual vocabulary is simple: there’s objects, classes, and
links.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Objects are the nodes in the database: they have a globally-unique title and
a set of properties, which are typed key-value pairs.</li>
  <li>Every object conforms to a class, which specifies what properties it has and
their types. Property types can be: rich text, a link to a file, a boolean, a
link to another object, or a list of links.</li>
  <li>Links go from one object property to another object (there’s no block
references). Notion inspired a lot of this.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most personal wikis are just a special case of this, where there’s a single
class with a single text property. And, unsurprisingly, the main class I use is
<code>Note</code>, which has a single rich text property called <code>Text</code>.</p>

<p>Initially I had an idea to build classes for managing bibliographies and other
collections, e.g.:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <code>Book</code> class to replace Calibre, with fields like:
    <ol>
      <li><code>Authors</code>: a list of links to the author objects (thanks to bidirectional
linking, going to an author’s page shows you the list of all objects that
link to it, i.e. the things they’ve authored).</li>
      <li><code>PDF</code>: a file link.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A <code>Paper</code> class to replace Zotero, with the fields you’d expect.</li>
  <li>An <code>Art</code> class to manage my art collection, with fields like <code>Arist</code>, <code>Year</code>,
<code>Period</code>, <code>Genre</code>, <code>File</code>.</li>
  <li>Classes to organize my legal documents, e.g. a <code>Document</code> class that has a
file and a text property for notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I’ve largely used it for journalling and brief text notes, like my journal:</p>

<p><img src="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/assets/content/unbundling-tools-for-thought/journal.png" alt="A screenshot of my personal wiki, showing a journal entry."/></p>

<p>And study notes:</p>

<p><img src="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/assets/content/unbundling-tools-for-thought/group1.png" alt="A screenshot of my personal wiki, showing notes on group theory."/></p>

<p><img src="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/assets/content/unbundling-tools-for-thought/group2.png" alt="Another screenshot with notes on group theory."/></p>

<p>Here’s an example of how you’d use it to organize an art collection:</p>

<p><img src="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/assets/content/unbundling-tools-for-thought/art.png" alt="A screenshot of my personal wiki, showing an entry for John William Waterhouse&#39;s Jason and Medea, with fields for the artist, medium, period, image file, and year."/></p>

<p>The barriers to using it as The One Database are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Activation Energy:</strong> migrating everything from my filesystem, from Calibre,
from Zotero, from my browser bookmarks, etc. is a huge process. Even just
migrating stuff from Calibre to the database would require me to write a
script because my Calibre library is so huge.</li>
  <li><strong>UI:</strong> replacing the filesystem and most of my domain-specific apps means
the wiki’s UI has to be stellar. It has to support searching, filtering,
sorting, viewing collections of objects in different modes (list, table,
gallery, etc., like in Notion). Getting this to the UX sweet spot where
things are frictionless enough to use the app productively requires a
significant time investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Pointlessness of Organization:</strong> my Calibre and Zotero libraries are a
mess. But is that <em>bad</em>? Is there any point to organizing them? I can always
find what I need, either by searching or browsing, because I have a spatial
sense of where each book is in Calibre’s big grid view. If I went through
everything in Calibre and Zotero, and fixed the titles, added missing
authors, publishers, publication years, fixed the cover images—what then?
What have I gained? Nothing. It is a waste of time to organize things too
much.</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertain Payoff:</strong> silver bullets are rare, and it’s possible that after
making a titanic effort to migrate all my data and build a great UI, the
result of very underwhelming.</li>
</ol>



<p>Having reached the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">trough of disillusionment</a>: what’s next? I think I
might clean up Cartesian and release it as a kind of “generalized Calibre”, for
people who want to manage their disparate collections.</p>

<p>Or I might try writing personal wiki #8 or so, since, while writing this post, I
got a whole lot of new ideas, so I might allocate some time during the holidays
to pushing that boulder up again.</p>
