    <h1>TikTok is back in the App Store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nearly a month after it was banned in the US, TikTok has returned to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8">App Store for iPhones</a> and other Apple devices as well as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&amp;e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign">Google Play store</a> for Android phones and tablets.</p><p>Apple and Google removed TikTok from their app stores in January to comply with a law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us">banning apps from TikTok owner ByteDance</a>. Although President Donald Trump signed an executive order <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">on January 20th</a> that directed the Department of Justice not to enforce the ban for 75 days, Apple and Google have until now refused to host it in their stores due to the risk of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347325/tiktok-service-providers-penalties-apple-google-orcale-trump">billions of dollars in penalties</a> for doing so.</p><p>Apple and Google didn’t respond to <em>The Verge’s</em> request for comment about receiving the letter from Bondi. Spokespeople for TikTok and the Department of Justice also didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
