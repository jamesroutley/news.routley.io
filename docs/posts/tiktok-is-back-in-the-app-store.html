          <div><div><p>Located to the west of Hounslow town centre and managed by Hounslow Council, the Heath is a large, open area of scrub and lowland heath – one of the rarest habitats in Britain. Shaped by people over the centuries, this habitat is historically significant. Evidence has been found of an Iron Age village, while a 1,000-year-old bronze boar was found by farm workers in the 1800s.</p>
<p>A Roman road, now the Staines Road, crosses the northern edge of the heath, and Oliver Cromwell famously used the heath as a military camp during the English Civil War in the 1600s. A series of markers take visitors through the history of the heath. The heath is home to a number of rare species, including Dartford warblers, adders, water voles and stag beetles. Dartford warblers are a rare breeding bird here and can be elusive, though you may see one perching atop a gorse bush to proclaim its territory in spring. Along the heath’s edge there are ancient oak trees, making this a good place to find fungi in autumn. A popular spot for walking, cycling, picnicking and wildlife watching, along the west edge of the adjacent golf course runs the River Crane.</p>
<p>There is the chance to observe grey herons and listen for the ‘plop’ of water voles diving into the water from their bankside burrows. Look out for neatly cropped ‘lawns’ where they feed. The London Loop crosses through the heath’s heart, allowing for walks to Richmond Park to the east or following the Crane north towards Cranford.</p>
