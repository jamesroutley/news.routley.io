    <h1>Lumo: Privacy-first AI assistant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>Artificial intelligence has the power to tackle humanity’s challenges, big and small, from scheduling meetings to modeling molecules. But to truly transform how we live and work for the better, we need an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://lumo.proton.me/">AI assistant<span>(new window)</span></a> built responsibly — putting people and privacy first.</p>



<p>Today, Big Tech is repeating the mistakes from the internet’s early days. Instead of using AI to serve people, they’re turning people into products — and using AI to accelerate the surveillance-capitalism business model built on advertising, data harvesting, and exploitation.</p>



<p>We believe the benefits of AI are too great to miss, and the risks too serious to ignore. Whether we like it or not, AI is here to stay, but the current iterations of AI reflect a failure to learn from the past. That’s why we built Lumo — a private AI assistant that only works for you, not the other way around. With no logs kept and every chat encrypted, Lumo keeps your conversations confidential and your data fully under your control — never shared, sold, or stolen.</p>



<p>Whether you’re summarizing sensitive legal documents, asking private health questions, or rewriting personal emails, Lumo is there to help. <strong>It gives you an edge when you need it, without demanding personal data in return.</strong></p>



<p>Lumo is a new service within the Proton privacy ecosystem, trusted by over 100 million people worldwide. Because privacy should be for everyone, anyone can start using Lumo today for free — no account required. Just click the button below to start a chat, or download our app for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.proton.android.lumo">Android<span>(new window)</span></a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumo-by-proton/id6746714949">iPhone<span>(new window)</span></a>.</p>







<h2>Why we need a privacy-first AI</h2>



<p>AI opens the door to new opportunities but also new forms of data collection. Today, hundreds of millions of ordinary people interact with AI tools, unwittingly handing over sensitive information that is far more intimate than search or browsing history. Businesses, too, are risking their secrets. And because alternatives for generative AI have so far been limited, we all have to take our chances with AI companies that are mostly owned and operated out of the US or China.</p>



<p>Lumo is here to change all that.</p>



<p>Like all Proton services, Lumo was built around privacy, security, and transparency. In contrast to other companies working on AI, Proton doesn’t make money by selling your data. We’re supported exclusively by our community, not advertisers, and our base in privacy-friendly Europe gives us the legal protections to ensure that we can live up to our promises. Most important, <strong>we are owned by the nonprofit </strong><a href="https://proton.me/foundation"><strong>Proton Foundation</strong></a>, whose sole mission is to advance privacy and freedom.</p>



<p>By using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://lumo.proton.me/">Lumo<span>(new window)</span></a>, you can enjoy the benefits of an advanced AI assistant without the risk of your data being misused.</p>



<h2>How Lumo protects your privacy</h2>



<p>With privacy as our framework, we reimagined the architecture of an AI assistant from the ground up. Here’s what that means in practice:</p>



<h3>No logs</h3>



<p>Other AI companies keep a record of all your conversations on their servers, leaving this information vulnerable to data leaks or exploitation for profit. Lumo doesn’t keep any logs of your conversations server side, and any chats you save can only be decrypted on your device.</p>



<h3>Zero-access encryption</h3>



<p>Your chats are stored using our battle-tested zero-access encryption, so even we can’t read them, similar to other Proton services such as <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a>, <a href="https://proton.me/drive">Proton Drive</a>, and <a href="https://proton.me/pass">Proton Pass</a>. Our encryption is open source and trusted by over 100 million people to secure their data.</p>



<h3>No data sharing</h3>



<p>Big Tech companies share your data with third-party vendors, advertisers, and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance">government agencies for online surveillance</a>. Lumo’s no logs and encrypted architecture ensure we don’t have data to share, and our European home gives you the benefit of robust privacy protections, outside of US jurisdiction.</p>



<h3>Not used to train AI</h3>



<p>Unlike other AI services, Lumo doesn’t use your conversations or inputs to train the large language model. When this kind of training occurs, your personal data could end up being used to generate outputs for others’ conversations. Lumo won’t ever expose you to this risk, which is especially important for businesses working with confidential material.</p>



<h3>Open</h3>



<p>Lumo is based upon open-source language models and operates from Proton’s European datacenters. This gives you much greater transparency into the way Lumo works than any other major AI assistant. Unlike Apple Intelligence and others, Lumo is not a partnership with OpenAI or other American or Chinese AI companies, and your queries are never sent to any third parties. Our research and development will remain focused on open models, which we will continuously improve and augment.</p>

<h2>Productivity features designed for privacy</h2>



<p>Lumo gives you the benefits of AI without compromising your personal data. We’ve added unique features to Lumo that are designed to keep you in control of what happens to your data.</p>



<p><strong>Ghost mode</strong> — If you’re logged in while using Lumo, your conversations are saved with end-to-end encryption in your chat history. But you can enable ghost mode and ensure your current chat disappears forever as soon as you close it.</p>



<p><strong>Web search</strong> — If you ask it to, Lumo can search the web for new or recent information to complement its existing knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>File uploads</strong> — Lumo can understand and analyze files you upload. But unlike other AI assistants, Lumo doesn’t keep any record of the data you share. So you can work on sensitive documents with peace of mind.</p>



<p><strong>Proton Drive</strong><strong> integration</strong><strong> </strong>— You can easily add end-to-end encrypted files from your Proton Drive to your chats with Lumo.</p>



<h2>How to get started with Lumo</h2>

<p>Lumo represents one of many investments Proton will be making before the end of the decade to ensure that Europe stays strong, independent, and technologically sovereign. Because of legal uncertainty around <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.tdg.ch/surveillance-le-geant-des-mails-cryptes-proton-pret-a-quitter-geneve-947402188210">Swiss government proposals<span>(new window)</span></a> to introduce mass surveillance — proposals that have been outlawed in the EU — Proton is moving most of its physical infrastructure out of Switzerland. Lumo will be the first product to move.</p>



<p>This shift represents an investment of over €100 million into the EU proper. While we do not give up the fight for privacy in Switzerland (and will continue to fight proposals that we believe will be extremely damaging to the Swiss economy), Proton is also embracing Europe and helping to develop a sovereign <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://eurostack.eu/">EuroStack<span>(new window)</span></a> for the future of our home continent. Lumo is European, and proudly so, and here to serve everybody who cares about privacy and security worldwide.</p>
