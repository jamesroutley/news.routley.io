<p>Ianâ€™s messages made me chuckle.  Then, later the same day, I read this <a href="http://xkcd.com/1105/">XKCD cartoon</a>.  The merging of these two humorous topics created the seed for this article.</p>

<h3>What is the least common PIN number?</h3>

<p>If you had to make predication about what the least commonly used 4-digit PIN is, what would be your guess?</p>

<p>This tangentially relates to the XKCD cartoon.  In Randallâ€™s cartoon, the perpetratorâ€™s plan backfired because his selected license plate was so unique that it was very memorable.  What is the least memorable license plate?  Ask any spy you know (snigger) what the best way to blend into a crowd is.  Their answer will be not stand out, to appear â€œnormalâ€, and not be notable in any way.</p>

<p>Over the years, there have been numerous password table security breaches:  Some very high profile, some low profile, but all embarrassing (and many exceedingly expensive; both in direct fines and indirect loss of business through erosion of trust and reputation). </p>
<p>Fool me once, well, no, even thatâ€™s not really acceptable, but fool me twice â€¦  Iâ€™ll go even further: <b>Any</b> developer who stores the password table of their database in clear text  should be so mortified by this lack of security that they should not be sleeping at night until they fix it.  Ignoring the fact that you should never have ever coded it this way, you have an <u>obligation</u> to learn from these past breaches.</p>
<p>If you work for a company and are knowledgeable that your customer database is <i>â€œprotectedâ€</i> by such lightweight security then run, donâ€™t walk, to your CEO/Presidents office, pound on the door and insist (s)he puts out a mandate to fix the matter with extreme prejudice.  Donâ€™t leave until you get an affirmative response. Badger, badger then badger them again. Make yourself a proverbial thorn in their side.</p>

<p>Given that users have a free choice for their password, if users select a four digit password to their online account, itâ€™s not a stretch to use this as a proxy for four digit PIN codes.</p>



<p>I was able to find almost <i>3.4 million</i> four digit passwords.   Every single one of the of the 10,000 combinations of digits from <SPAN color="gold">0000</SPAN> through to <SPAN color="gold">9999</SPAN> were represented in the dataset.</p>

<p>The first â€œpuzzlingâ€ password I encountered was <span>Â 2580Â </span> in position #22.   What is the significance of these digits? Why should so many people select this code to make it appear so high up the list?</p>

<p> (Interestingly, this is very compelling evidence confirming the hypothesis that a 4-digit password list is a great proxy for a PIN number database.  If you look at the numeric keypad on a PC-keyboard youâ€™ll see that 2580 is slightly more awkward to type on the PC than a phone because the order of keys on a keyboard is the inverted.  Cash machines and other terminals that take credit cards use a phone style numeric pads.  It appears that many people have an easy to type/remember PIN number for their credit card and are re-using the same four digits for their online passwords, where the <i>&#34;straight down the middle&#34;</i> mnemonic no longer applies).</p></td>

<p>(Another fascinating piece of trivia is that people seem to prefer even numbers over odd, and codes like <span>Â 2468Â </span> occur higher than a odd number equivalent, such as <span>Â 1357Â </span>).</p>



<p>As noted above, the more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables.  The most popular PIN code of <span>Â 1234Â </span> is more popular than the <i>lowest 4,200 codes combined!</i></p>
<p>That&#39;s right, you might be able to crack over 10% of all codes with one guess!  Expanding this, you could get 20% by using just five numbers!</p>
<p>Below is a cumulative frequency graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c.png"/></p><p>Statistically, <i>one third</i> of all codes can be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations!</p>
<p>The 50% cumulative chance threshold is passed at just 426 codes (far less than the 5,000 that a random uniformly distribution would predict).  Paranoid yet?</p>

<p>Many of the high frequency PIN numbers can be interpreted as years, <i>e.g.</i>  <span>Â 1967Â </span> <span>Â 1956Â </span> <span>Â 1937Â </span> â€¦ It appears that many people use a year of birth (or possibly an anniversary) as their PIN. This will certainly help them remember their code, but it greatly increases its predictability.</p>

<p>Just look at the stats: Every single <span>Â 19??Â </span> combination can be found in the <i>top fifth</i> of the dataset!</p>
<p>Below is a plot of this in graphical format.  In this chart, each <SPAN color="yellow">yellow</SPAN> line represents a PIN number that starts <span>Â 19??Â </span> </p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c2.png"/></p><p>If all the passwords were uniformly distributed, there should be no significant difference between the frequency of occurrence of, <i>for instance</i>, <span>Â 1972Â </span> and any other PIN ending in seventy two <span>Â ??72Â </span>.  However, as we shall see, this is not the case at all.</p>
<p><span>Â 1972Â </span> occurs in ordinal position #76 (with a frequency 0.099363%).  Hereâ€™s a histogram for the occurrences of all <span>Â ??72Â </span> probabilities.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r.png"/></p><p>You can clearly see the spike at <span>Â 1972Â </span> (with smaller spikes at <span>Â 7272Â </span>  and <span>Â 1472Â </span>)</p>
<p>If you calculate the ratio of the peak of <span>Â 1972Â </span> to the average of all the other <span>Â ??72Â </span> PINS you get the ratio of <SPAN color="gold">Â <b>22:1</b></SPAN></p>
<p>PINS starting with <span>Â 19??Â </span> are much more likley to occur. Of course, itâ€™s not just 1972.  Here is plot of the ratio of <SPAN color="gold">19</SPAN> to <SPAN color="gold">non-19</SPAN> for all hundred combinations.  Along the x-axis are all the combinations of last two digits –XX, and for each of these the ratio of the 19XX to average of all the other ??XX occurrences has been calculated.  Hereâ€™s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r2.png"/></p><p>It&#39;s a pretty good approximation for a demographic chart! (suggested by the red-dashed trend line) which would probably allow a fair estimation of the ages (years of birth) of the people using the various websites. (Of course, hackers invert this strategy and use the age of a target to try and give information to guess a user&#39;s PIN.  Looking at this graph, this might give them up to a <i>40x</i> advantage!)</p>
<p>Just about all the ratios are above <SPAN color="gold">1.0</SPAN>.  The noteable exceptions are <span>Â ??34Â </span> and <span>Â ??00Â </span> (which are easy to explain, since the massive popularity of <span>Â 1234Â </span> and <span>Â 0000Â </span> dwarf <span>Â 1934Â </span> and <span>Â 1900Â </span>respectively).  Simiarly <span>Â 33Â </span> <span>Â 44Â </span> <span>Â 55Â </span> <span>Â 66Â </span> â€¦ are lower than expected as the quad codes like <span>Â 3333Â </span> mask out even the <span>Â 1933Â </span> boost.</p>
<p>There are also spikes in the graph corresponding to the popular PINS of <span>Â 1919Â </span> <span>Â 1984Â </span> and <span>Â 1999Â </span></p>

<p>Another interesting way to visualize the PIN data is in this grid plot of the distribution.

The bottom left is <span>Â 0000Â </span> and the top right is <span>Â 9999Â </span>.</p>
<p>Color is used to represent frequency.  The higher frequency occurences are yellow to white hot, and the lower frequency occurences are red, through dark red to black.</p>

<p>The purpose of this posting was to investigate patterns and frequency of four digit PIN numbers.  However, the database I collected also has <i>all-numeric</i> password of different lengths.  It&#39;s worth taking a quick look at these too.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/pl.png"/></p><p>I found close to 7 million all-numeric passwords.  Approximately half of these were the four-digit codes we&#39;ve just examined.</p>
<p>Six digit codes are the next most popular length, followed eight.</p>
<p>I hope, hope that the people who have passwords of nine digits long are <u>not</u> using their Social Security Numbers!</p>
<p>Below are the top 20 passwords for the various lengths, along with their share of their same-size namespace.</p>

<h3>Some interesting observations (and a little speculation)</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â For five digit passwords, users appear to have <i>even less</i> imagination in selecting their codes (22.8% select 12345).  All the usual suspects occur, but a new addition is the puerile addition in position #20 of the concatenation of 420 and 69.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â For six digit password, again 696969 appears highly.  Also of note is 159753 (a &#34;X&#34; mark over the numeric keypad).  James Bond returns with 007007.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â For seven digits, the standby of 1234567 is a much lower frequency (though still the top).  I speculate that this is because many people may be using their telephone number (without area code) as a seven digit password.  Telephone numbers are fairly distinct, and already memorized, so when a seven digit code is needed, they spring to mind easily.  The higher frequency of usage of telephone numbers reduces the need to use imagination (or lack thereof) and select something else.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â Is Jenny there?  The fouth most popular seven digit password is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny">8675309</a> (It&#39;s a popular 80&#39;s song).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â Eight digit passwords are just as expected.  Lots of pattern, and lots of repetition.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â Common nine digit passwords also follow patterns and repetition. 789456123 appears as an easy <i>&#34;Along the top, middle and bottom of the keypad&#34;</i> 147258369 is related in the vertical direction (and other variants appear high up). Again we get a 420 moment with 420420420, and also the shaken, not stirred, but repeated 007007007 returns.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â Interestingly for ten digits 1029384756 appears (alternating ascending/descending digits), as well as the odd/even 1357924680.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif"/>Â Hurrah for math!  In position #17 of the ten digit password list we get 3141592654 (The first few digits of <i>Pi</i>)</p>

<p>Since publishing this article, it&#39;s been brought to my attention that, of course, in addition to anniversary years, many people encapsulate dates in the format MMDD (such as birthdays â€¦) for their PIN codes.</p>
<p>This clearly explains the lower left corner where, if you look at the heatmap, there is a huge contrast change at the height of around 30-31 (the number of days in a month), extending to 12 on the x-axis. (Thanks to <b>zero79</b> for first pointing this out).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/mmdd.png"/></p><p>Many people also asked the significance of 1004 in the four character PIN table.  This comes from Korean speakers.  When spoken, &#34;1004&#34; is <i>cheonsa</i> (cheon = 1000, sa=4).</p>
<p>&#34;Cheonsa&#34; also happens to be the Korean word for <i>Angel</i>.</p>
