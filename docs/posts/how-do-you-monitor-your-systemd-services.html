    <h1>Ask HN: How do you monitor your systemd services?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am using systemd on my machine and try to configure most things through it. For example, I have a backup job that is triggered by a timer.
I want to know when that job fails so I can investigate and fix it. Over time, I&#39;ve had multiple solutions for this:</p><p>Send a notifcation via notify-send</p><p>Add `systemctl --failed` to my shell startup script</p><p>Send myself emails</p><p>None of these are quite ideal. Notifications are disruptive of the current workflow and ephemeral, meaning I might forget about it if I don&#39;t deal with it immediately.
Similarly, reading `systemctl --failed` on every new terminal is also disruptive but at least it makes me not forget about it.
Both of these are also not really applicable to server systems.
Sending myself emails feels a bit wrong but has so far been the best solution.</p><p>How are other people solving this? I did some research and I am surprised that there isn&#39;t a more rounded solution. I&#39;d expect that pretty much every Linux user must run into this problem.</p></div></div></div>
