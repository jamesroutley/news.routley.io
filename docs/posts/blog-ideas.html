<p>I have a lot of ideas and less time to follow up on all of them. So my first post is a tracker that I will (hopefully) update with blog ideas - what I&#39;m curious about, what I know well, what randomly pops into my brain.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#39;s the list. Hopefully many of these turn into full posts, but feel free to take my ideas and write about them yourself!</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I don&#39;t want to contribute to open source</li>
<li>Why not use python f strings everywhere, even when you don&#39;t need string interpolation?</li>
<li>Why do planes need to have airplane mode, seats up, etc?</li>
<li>Is there an easy way to buy domains directly from the domain people (ICANN)?</li>
<li>How do ips work?</li>
<li>Frisbee is bad for your body and chronic pain</li>
<li>Frisbee spike culture</li>
<li>How does technicolor work?</li>
</ul>
