In addition, of course, the campaigns also served as mechanisms for the promulgation of censorship and suppression, including of free speech and the dissemination of knowledge. The latter, partly in order to promote a nationalistic alternative to theoretical physics later known as “German” physics (read: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik" rel="">Deutsche Physik</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>Interestingly, Deutsche Physik — which by the 1930s had grown to be overtly anti-semitic — had its origins </span><em>not</em><span> in anti-semitism but in anti-</span><em><span>anglocentrism</span></em><span> some 20 years prior. Indeed, the origins of Deutsche Physik can be traced back to war atrocities committed by German soldiers during World War I, and the public denial of those acts by 93 prominent but misled German intellectuals (12 of whom were already Nobel laureates, two of whom later would be and six of whom were Jewish or of Jewish descent).</span></p><p><span>Consider this a warning story about the dangers of politicizing knowledge and the </span><em>“relative ease with which the internal conventions of science could be abrogated by mobilizing political passions”</em><span> (Wolff, 2003).</span></p><p>Following Austria’s declaration of war on Serbia, the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium on August 2nd 1914 demanding passage through the country despite its neutrality. Two days later, the Belgium government refused the German demands with the backing of the British government which guaranteed military support. The German government responded by declaring war on August 4th and on the same day, the Imperial German Army crossed the border into Belgium.</p><p>By August 19th about 15,000 troops — including infantry, artillery and cavalry — descended upon the university town of Louvain (“Leuven”) in Central Belgium. Despite not encountering any resistance from the population, due to a perceived counter-attack, German troops soon began a massacre of murder, pillaging, arson and other war crimes towards the town’s civilian population. Over the course of five days 248 civilians were killed, most of the town’s remaining 10,000 residents exiled, 1,500 deported and some 2,000 homes, including about 1/6th of the town’s structures destroyed. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" width="1456" height="1057" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1057,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:2777122,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ruins of the university library at Louvain (Photo: Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the buildings lost during the atrocities was the Central Hall and University Library of the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven. On the 25th of August at around 11:30 German soldiers doused the 14th century cloth hall near the main square of the town with gasoline and set it ablaze. The historic library housed more than 300,000 written works, including significant historical collections, 750 priceless medieval manuscripts and the personal libraries of various professors, judges, notaries, solicitors and physicians, all of which was destroyed (Derez, 2016).</p><p><span>Although the town’s fate was only one of several over the course of the German campaign in Belgium</span><span>, its destruction and the burning of its library would soon become a symbol of a battle line in a growing culture war between Germany and the English-speaking world. As described in an August 28th article in the </span><em>The Times</em><span>, Louvain was indeed the </span><em>“Oxford of Belgium”</em><span>, </span><em>“the most celebrated seat of learning in the Low Countries” </em><span>which,</span><em> </em><span>within a mere ten hours, had been </span><em>“committed to the flames by the ruthless barbarians who have set forth to spread German culture throughout the globe”</em><em>. </em><span>Among the atrocities committed towards Belgian civil society the devastation of Louvain’s historic library captured the world’s imagination, wrote historian Mark Derez, </span><em>“for in no way could it have been considered a military target”</em><span> (Derez, 2016).</span></p><p><span>The physical sciences, perhaps more so than other disciplines, are unique in that their laws apply regardless of context, be they political, environmental or even celestial. Thus — one hopes — physicists, chemists and biologists might share an </span><em>“internationalism based upon the universality of natural knowledge as well as on the necessity for widespread, unrestricted communication and exchange of information”</em><span> (Wolff, 2003). Unfortunately, as the events following the sack of Louvain demonstrated, natural scientists are no different to the rest of us with regards to their vulnerabilities, sympathies and “</span><em>political passions”.</em></p><p><span>On October 4th 1914 a proclamation entitled ‘Manifest der 93’ (originally “An Die Kulturwelt!”) was published in the </span><em>Berliner Tageblatt,</em><span> featuring the signatures of 93 prominent German intellectual elites. The manifest expressed the group’s support for Germany in the ongoing World War. Among its signatories were 14 Nobel laureates, including Max Planck (1858-1947), Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915), Fritz Haber (1868-1934), Wilhelm Röntgen (1845-1923), Philipp Lenard (1862-1947), Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928) and mathematician Felix Klein (1849-1925). The manifest was written with the purpose of contradicting their perceived negative impression of Germany in the foreign press, especially in Britain. It was spread around the world through thousands of letters in ten different languages (Wolff, 2003). </span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd113af0e-c800-4841-95fc-f6d688612ecb_1760x2444.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd113af0e-c800-4841-95fc-f6d688612ecb_1760x2444.png 720w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd113af0e-c800-4841-95fc-f6d688612ecb_1760x2444.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Left: Aufruf der 93 (‘Appeal of the 93&#39;) as published in the Berliner Tageblatt on October 4th 1914 (Thüringer Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Jena.

The text, quite articulate, expresses moral indignation, scorn, accusations and attacks on perceived “enemies” of Germany such as foreign governments and academic institutions, as well as fellow German scholars whom the signatories proclaimed had </span><em>“wronged the German nation”</em><span>. An English translation of the text in its entirety is available </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Ninety-Three#Text" rel="">here</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>Notable in its elegant prose is the repeated use of denials of the form “It is not true” followed by descriptions of events from the war, such as </span><em>“It is not true that Germany is guilty of having caused this war.”, “It is not true that we trespassed in neutral Belgium.” </em><span>and</span><em> “It is not true that our warfare pays no respect to international laws.” </em><span>With the benefit of hindsight, among the most objectionable of these passages is the following, written less than five weeks after the atrocities in Louvain:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“</span><strong>It is not true</strong><span> that our troops treated Louvain brutally. Furious inhabitants having treacherously fallen upon them in their quarters, our troops with aching hearts were obliged to fire a part of the town as a punishment. The greatest part of Louvain has been preserved. The famous Town Hall stands quite intact; for at great self-sacrifice our soldiers saved it from destruction by the flames. Every German would of course greatly regret if in the course of this terrible war any works of art should already have been destroyed or be destroyed at some future time, but inasmuch as in our great love for art we cannot be surpassed by any other nation, in the same degree we must decidedly refuse to buy a German defeat at the cost of saving a work of art.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Of the 93 signatories to the text, 21 were natural scientists and four were Solvay Prize winners</span><span> (MacLeod, 2018). For German readers of the text, published in the </span><em>“Berlin Daily”</em><span>, it likely struck them no differently than the propaganda commonly found in other newspapers and magazines at the time</span><span>.  The Kaiser (Wilhelm II) had repeatedly proclaimed that German science and the nation were one and the same.

This has not occurred, and in our judgment would scarcely be possible, in any other civilized country.

Notably absent was </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Einstein" rel="">Albert Einstein</a><span> (1879-1955), who in 1915 would instead sign his name to a pacifist counter-manifesto referred to as the </span><em>Aufruf an die Europäer</em><span> (“Manifesto of the Europeans”). Another name that was notably absent was prominent mathematician </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Hilbert" rel="">David Hilbert</a><span> (1862-1943), who distrusted Fulda’s motives and refused to sign. This did not go unnoticed by the German propaganda machine, and when Hilbert’s classes at Göttingen resumed in November of 1914, his students turned away from him, as if he were a traitor (Reid, 1970). Among those who later claimed not to know what they were signing were Planck, Fischer and Klein (Wolff, 2003). Planck, for instance, had been traveling and without knowing the formulation of the text authorized his children to sign it on his behalf. Astronomer Wilhelm J. Foerster (1832-1921), whose signature may have been added without his permission, soon rescinded his endorsement and set to work on the “</span><em>Manifesto of the Europeans”</em><span>, which he co-authored with Georg Friedrich Nicolai (1874-1964). Others notable for refusing to sign the manifest was composer Richard Strauss (1864-1949) , who later wrote that </span><em>“declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist”</em><span> (Strauss &amp; Rolland, 1968).</span></p><p><span>Among those who did sign the document and remained proud to endorse it was Wilhelm Wien, a renowned German physicist and professor in Würzburg who three years prior had won the Nobel Prize in Physics </span><em>“for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat”</em><span>. Motivated by national and conservative leanings and his perceived failure of </span><em>Manifest der 93</em><span> Wien, in late 1914 he took it upon himself to </span><em>“take a stand against the unbelievable lies from abroad” </em><span>(Wolff, 2003) by drafting a proclamation (“aufforderung”) against the “Englishness” (Engländerei) influencing German physics. The translated text is available in its entirety below:</span></p><pre><code><strong>Proclamation</strong><span>
Because of the war, the relations of physical scientists to enemy countries will undergo revision. This will effect our relationship with England particularly in view of the hostile declaration drafted by English scholars without any understanding of the German mind and signed by eight well-known English physicists (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsay, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

Two lines of the signatures are missing now! It has been demonstrated by their action that the long-standing efforts to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be resumed in the foreseeable future. The steps we have taken in the interest of a rapprochement between the scientific communities of both peoples are no longer justified. Thus, we must eliminate the unjustified English influence on German physics.

Naturally, this does not mean a rejection of English scientific ideas and suggestions. But the frequently criticized “Ausländerei” of the Germans has become so evident in our science that it appears necessary to draw attention to it. 

On this basis we limit ourselves for now to propose that all physicists observe the following rules:

1. In citing the literature, the English should no longer receive greater consideration than our countrymen, as has happened often in the past;

2. German physicists should no longer publish in English journals, except to respond;

3. Publishers should only accept scientific works written in German and
translations only if, in the opinion of experts, the translated works are particularly important contributions to the literature;

4. Government money is not to be used for translations.

Formulated </span><em>not</em><span> as a counter-manifesto to the British, but rather, as a </span><em>“self-education”</em><span> targeted towards German-speaking physicists, the proclamation was printed in 700 copies which were sent out to German and Austrian universities in March of 1915 (Wolff, 2003).</span></p><p><span>By 1921 a report in The New York Times found that of the 76 surviving signatories to the ‘Manifest der 93’, 60 expressed varying degrees of regret for signing. Some of the signatories, two in particular, remained devoted to the contents of </span><em>Manifest der 93</em><span>, Wien’s </span><em>Aufforderung </em><span>and indeed, extreme extension to them. Although Wien occasionally expressed racist sentiments in the years following the Treaty of Versailles, he did so in private rather than public and always with a measure of restraint, as in this personal note to Lenard (Wolff, 2003):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“I also agree that the Semitic influence should be stemmed, but without that ‘Spektakelantisemitismus’ (“anti-Semitic uproar”) from which nothing positive will result.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Wien did not reject Einstein’s theory of relativity and indeed nominated both Einstein and Lorentz for the Nobel Prize in 1918.</p><p>Lenard and Stark on the other hand, as early as the 1920s began supporting Adolf Hitler publicly. Their legacy, tarnished by this support and their pursuit of the “German physics” would later fail and be supplanted by the work of another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg (1901-76) who would go on to employ “Jewish physics” in the German nuclear weapons program, which was initiated in 1939.</p><p><span>To this day, the burning of the library in Louvain remains a battle line, which we should be weary to ever cross again, for as Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) so eloquently once stated,  </span><em>“where they burn books, they will also burn people”.</em></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-einstein-met-churchill-1933" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="When Einstein met Churchill (1933)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/einsteins-emigration-to-america-1932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="Einstein&#39;s Emigration to America (1932)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-heisenberg-met-einstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png" sizes="100vw" alt="When Heisenberg met Einstein" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p><span>At the time of the writing of this essay, the </span><em>Privatdozent</em><span> newsletter goes out to 11,779 subscribers via Substack.</span></p><p><strong>Derez, M., 2016</strong><span>.
