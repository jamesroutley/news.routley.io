I also asked several dozen PLATO authors, administrators, and former CRPG Addict contributors--everyone I could find--for any additional recollections about the games. I stopped only when I was confident there was nothing left to learn. <b>If you have any new or conflicting information about any of the games below, I welcome your comments below or an e-mail to crpgaddict@gmail.com. I will update the information below with any new material discovered. </b>However, please do not take it upon yourself to try to track down and contact any of the people listed here on my behalf; it is likely that I have already reached out and they either declined to respond or already told me all they could.<br/></p><p>Except for Don Daglow&#39;s <i>Dungeon</i>, all the games listed below were written in a language called TUTOR for the PLATO educational mainframe hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. (Some of the authors of these games come from schools that had PLATO links, like Purdue University, Iowa State University, and Indiana University.) Many of the games written on this system have been preserved and are playable today at <a href="https://www.cyber1.org/">Cyber1</a>. Games that are <i>not</i> lost, and that I&#39;ve already covered, include <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2019/01/revisiting-dungeon-1975.html"><i>The Dungeon</i></a> (1975), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2019/01/revisiting-game-of-dungeons-1975.html"><i>The Game of Dungeons</i></a> (1975), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/11/game-123-orthanc-1977.html"><i>Orthanc</i></a> (1975), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/11/game-121-moria-1975.html"><i>Moria</i></a> (1975), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/10/game-12-oubliette-1977.html"><i>Oubliette</i></a> (1977), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2019/02/game-318-swords-and-sorcery-1978.html"><i>Swords and Sorcery</i></a> (1978), <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/11/game-124-avatar-1979.html"><i>Avatar</i></a> (1979), and <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2019/10/game-343-camelot-1982.html"><i>Camelot</i></a> (1982).</p><p>Students began writing these games almost immediately after the first edition of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> in 1974. The developers were aware of the games being written by other students, and there was a healthy mix of cooperation and competition. It&#39;s tough to nail down specific dates, or a specific order, for some of the games because they were continuously updated throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. (Some of them, like <i>Orthanc</i>, even had new coding added well into the 2000s.) What is the &#34;release year&#34; of games developed under such circumstances? There was no distinction between &#34;beta testing&#34; and actual gameplay.</p><p>The other important thing to understand about these early games is that they were bootlegging computer space. In the early years, university administrators and system operators frowned upon wasting precious system resources for games (not an entirely unreasonable perspective given the number of stories I&#39;ve heard about students neglecting their studies to write and play games). Authors tried to disguise their games by giving them educational-sounding names or prefixes used by the lesson spaces allotted to various university departments. <i>pedit5</i> (<i>The Dungeon</i>) had that file name because it was created on the space allotted to the Population and Energy group. I don&#39;t know what the prefix for <i>m199h</i> meant, but that was almost certainly a file name, not the actual name of the game, just like almost no game in Daniel Lawrence&#39;s <i>DND</i> line, including Lawrence&#39;s, was actually called <i>DND</i>.</p><p>Many PLATO RPGs were started, deleted, re-started, and deleted again. When Reginald Rutherford&#39;s <i>pedit5 </i>was deleted, students re-created it as <i>Orthanc</i>. When <i>Orthanc</i> got axed, they brazenly followed up with <i>Orthanc2</i>. An entire series of games beginning with the word <i>Think</i> was chased off the system one by one and re-created. Eventually, university officials gave up and allowed the games to remain, which is why the post-1976 games are much better preserved, sometimes in multiple versions. </p><div><p><b><span><i>m199h</i> (1976, possibly earlier)</span></b></p><p>Long offered as the legendary lost &#34;first&#34; PLATO CRPG, <a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2023/10/m199h-new-findings-both-solve-and.html">recent evidence</a> has suggested that instead it was a<i> </i>remake-expansion of <i>The Dungeon</i> (&#34;pedit5&#34;) of 1975. Information about the game is inconsistent, many sources drawing from a note file on PLATO written by Dirk Pellett, one of the contributors to <i>The Game of Dungeons</i>. It covers the history of RPGs on PLATO. He says:</p><div><blockquote>It is &#34;common knowledge&#34; that someone created the very first dungeon simulation game in a lesson called &#34;m199h&#34; which was NOT created by the account director for the purpose of gamers playing games. When it was discovered, it got the axe. Unfortunately, little else is known about m199h, either the author, or what it was like, and no known copy exists.</blockquote></div><p>This would seem to be the source of Brian Dear&#39;s brief mention of the game (which he accidentally calls <i>m119h</i>) in <i>The Friendly Orange Glow</i>, the basis of numerous subsequent citations.</p><p>Adding to the mythology, a Cyber1 administrator wrote in the PLATO notes files in 2011 that &#34;m199h&#34; was based at least partly based on a game called <i>Monster Maze</i> written by a Terry O&#39;Brian on a CDC 6600. My colleague, El Explorador de RPGs, demonstrated conclusively that in fact <i>Monster Maze</i> was based on &#34;pedit5.&#34;</p><p>In August 2023, I was sent some screenshots and hand-copied images from the game by a contemporary player, as documented in the link above. I now believe.</p><div><ul><li>&#34;m199h&#34; was the file name, but the proper name of the game was <i>Dungeon</i>.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>It was created in 1976 and deleted by early 1977. </li></ul></div><div><ul><li>It was an expansion of <i>The Dungeon</i> (&#34;pedit5&#34;) and thus not the first CRPG. It was a top-down dungeon crawler.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>The main character was a combination fighter/magic-user/cleric/thief on a mission to get enough experience points to get into the Hall of Fame.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Its monster list included griffins, harpies, demons, dragons, deaths, wizards, werewolves, dwarves, thieves, Spirits of Christmas, vampires, dwarf wizards, medusas, cockatrices, ogres, goblins, hobgoblins, zombies, nazguls, and wraiths. Many of these shared the same graphics. There may also have been some punny monsters with names like &#34;hisnia&#34; and &#34;yourgraine&#34; (after <i>hernia </i>and <i>migraine</i>).</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Its spell list promised every spell available in the Greyhawk supplement (March 1975) the <i>D&amp;D</i> rules, whereas &#34;pedit5&#34; only offered about a third of them. Whether all of these spells were actually programmed is uncertain; &#34;pedit5&#34; had listed more than actually worked, with the yet-to-be-programmed spells identified in the instructions with an asterisk.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>It introduced teleporters and chest traps.</li></ul></div><p>For more information about the recent findings, see my <a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2023/10/m199h-new-findings-both-solve-and.html">October 2023 article</a>. We still do not know who created it, but the file name suggests a lesson space reserved for the mathematics department.<br/></p><div><p><b><span><i>Dungeon</i> (1975)</span></b></p><p><i>Dungeon</i>, credited to John Daleske, Gary Fritz, Jon Good, Bill Gammel, and Mark Nakada, is in some ways as much of a mystery as <i>m199h</i>. John Daleske is famous in PLATO circles for creating <i>Empire</i> when he was an Iowa State University student in 1973. Numerous game histories and PLATO histories mention him and <i>Empire</i>, but none of them seem to be aware of <i>Dungeon</i>. The game doesn&#39;t show up in Dirk Pellett&#39;s history, either. I wouldn&#39;t have known about it at all except I was trying obvious keywords in PLATO, and up popped the title screen you see below. The copyright dates show that someone visited it as late as 2004.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iHzklDp4F5E/YM0Ahg2WXNI/AAAAAAAAzaY/tlx4JGouIq4BwuJQQo2cZ4_hJO2O82i8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s516/dungeondaleske.PNG"><img data-original-height="516" data-original-width="516" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iHzklDp4F5E/YM0Ahg2WXNI/AAAAAAAAzaY/tlx4JGouIq4BwuJQQo2cZ4_hJO2O82i8ACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h400/dungeondaleske.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>The one game for which I can show an image.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>       <br/></div><p>In any event, the game doesn&#39;t seem to be any more than the title screen. The key commands that would normally run the program or take you to the documentation do nothing.</p><p>Daleske&#39;s notes say that the game was &#34;incomplete,&#34; which is probably why we cannot play it today. He also says that it was a &#34;predecessor to <i>Moria</i>,&#34; which currently has the distinction of being the earliest complete first-person, multi-character CRPG. Does &#34;predecessor&#34; mean that it inspired <i>Moria</i> or that it simply preceded it? </p><p><i>Edit from December 2021: </i>Commenter &#34;half&#34; managed to inspect some more elements of the file and extract and reassemble the game&#39;s icons:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiZQCDpPw_VwqhkWOM23ylo6zPQvkYUJcp4FYrGFDFny9eyQKVwjOwLCPR8gyZ-lMDJ9GOCLwE55XmcXLs8VJSnY0pu_GN6m71am2VqGhNGE0CPluAwy8FGWyHYwoXkRb6mq9IsZyOywxTwRL7zy-iZUyLhX1gR58OCQZeLX-zmwY9tLde0EuV0mauq=s424"><img data-original-height="411" data-original-width="424" height="310" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiZQCDpPw_VwqhkWOM23ylo6zPQvkYUJcp4FYrGFDFny9eyQKVwjOwLCPR8gyZ-lMDJ9GOCLwE55XmcXLs8VJSnY0pu_GN6m71am2VqGhNGE0CPluAwy8FGWyHYwoXkRb6mq9IsZyOywxTwRL7zy-iZUyLhX1gR58OCQZeLX-zmwY9tLde0EuV0mauq=s320" width="320"/></a></p>      </div><p>half&#39;s analysis shows files edited as early as 1977 and as late as 2004. <br/></p></div><div><p><b><span><i>Dungeon</i> (1975)</span></b></p><p><i>Dungeon</i> is the only game on this list not hosted on PLATO. It was written in 1975 or 1976 by Don Daglow, then a graduate student at Claremont University Center in California, on the university&#39;s DEC PDP-10. Daglow is one of the only student developers from this era to make a career in game design and programming. He worked for Mattel (programming for Intellivision titles) in the early 1980s and Electronic Arts in the mid- to late 1980s, where he produced Stuart Smith&#39;s <i>Adventure Construction Set</i> (1984) and wrote a module for it. After a brief stint at Brøderbund at the end of the decade, he founded Stormfront Studios and designed the two <i>Savage Frontier</i> games (1991 and 1992), <i>Neverwinter Nights </i>(1991), and <i>Stronghold</i> (1993), among many non-RPGs. Later switching to more of an executive role, he oversaw the production of <i>Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor</i> (2001) and <i>Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone</i> (2004), again among many others.<br/></p><p>What we know about <i>Dungeon</i> goes back to May 1986, when Daglow wrote an article titled &#34;The Dark Ages of Computer Game Design&#34; for <i>Computer Gaming World</i>. Amid a long discussion about the difficulties programming games on overburdened mainframes and hiding them from system administrators, he mentions his &#34;first adventure game, which continually updated a 40 x 80 map to show what your party had seen, so excruciatingly slow as to be unplayable.&#34; In a subsequent article in the August 1998 issue, he mentions that the game had &#34;both ranged and melee combat, lines of sight, auto-mapping, and NPCs with discrete AI.&#34;</p><p>Daglow has dropped other tidbits in a variety of interviews, but the most complete account comes from a <a href="https://geekomatick.com/2015/04/02/lhistoire-du-rpg-don-daglow-dungeon-1975/">2015 interview with a French blogger</a>. Here, we learn that in contrast to endless randomly-generated content of his PLATO contemporaries, Daglow designed his <i>Dungeon</i> more like a <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> module, with both fixed encounters and &#34;wandering monsters&#34; on a fixed map. It was a single-player game with a party of six characters. (Multiple players could huddle around the same computer and control their own characters, but that&#39;s not the same as the multiplayer experience on PLATO, where the students could literally communicate and cooperate from different terminals.) Daglow &#34;religiously followed all the <i>D&amp;D</i> rules,&#34; which included slow combat and even slower leveling (&#34;getting to the 4th level was a big deal&#34;). &#34;Graphics&#34; were all text characters. A lot of sites, including Wikipedia, seem to rely on this interview in reporting that Daglow&#39;s line-of-sight programming included considerations of torchlight and infravision, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly what Daglow says in the interview. Specifically, he says that rules about lighting and infravision in <i>D&amp;D</i> <i>inspired</i> his use of line-of-sight in the game, but not necessarily that he implemented those specific features. Nonetheless, I suppose we can extrapolate based on his claims of strict adherence to <i>D&amp;D</i> rules.<br/></p><p>Some sites continue to report Daglow&#39;s <i>Dungeon</i> as the &#34;first computer role-playing game,&#34; a status that remains uncertain without more clarification of the dates of his game. But I don&#39;t get the sense from his writings and interviews that his <i>Dungeon</i> was played to the extent that the PLATO games were played. <i>The Dungeon</i>, <i>Orthanc</i>, and <i>The Game of Dungeons</i>, all 1975 contemporaries, had thousands of eager players competing for playing time and saved game slots. We also have recollections from dozens of actual players of the PLATO games (and can, of course, play many of them ourselves right now), whereas we have only Daglow&#39;s recollections on <i>Dungeon</i>. I don&#39;t mean this to cast doubt on Daglow&#39;s account, just to emphasize that the PLATO games had an influence--felt directly in later commercial titles like <i>Wizardry</i> (1981)--that <i>Dungeon</i> did not, and I would thus continue to favor them as the true &#34;first CRPGs.&#34;<br/></p>       </div><div><p><b><span><i>DND World </i>(1976, maybe late 1975)</span></b></p><p><i>DND World</i> is another lost PLATO game written by now-retired Boeing engineer Fred Banks. Inspired by <i>The Dungeon </i>(&#34;pedit5&#34;), it took place on an outdoor map. A party of characters, controlled by a single player, explored the world, fought randomly-generated monsters, and gained in experience and treasure. Characters acted sequentially in combat. There was no winning condition. In an email to me, Banks said that the character avatars were randomly-generated, with classes and attributes following <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> rules. He also said that, the overworld was &#34;based on an octagonal circular grid, thus allowing the person to come back to the original position by walking the same direction,&#34; something that I cannot wrap my mind around. Banks did not lock the code, and other students were free to copy it and make their own modifications.<br/></p></div></div></div>
