Its bookstores would pull from its vast data trove and showcase what people were reading and even reviews they left online, for instance.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">But Amazon&#39;s innovations were not enough for some of these experiments. Its &#34;physical stores&#34; revenue, largely from grocery sales at its Whole Foods subsidiary, has often failed to keep pace with growth in Amazon&#39;s other businesses.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Amazon will close its 4-star, pop up and bookstore locations on various dates and notify customers via signage.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Workers will receive severance or can move to jobs at nearby Amazon stores that the company said it would help them find.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Amazon&#39;s experiments continue. It recently announced plans to open a fashion store in greater Los Angeles where algorithms suggest what to try on. Last week, it opened its first Whole Foods store in Washington, D.C., that isreplete with technology letting customers check out without scanning items or the help of a cashier.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
