                <p>Your local government might be discussing surveillance tech like Flock cameras, facial recognition, or automated license plate readers right now. This map helps you find those meetings and take action.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong>  Municipalities across the US are quietly adopting surveillance technologies in rapidly growing numbers with over 80,000 cameras already out on the streets. These systems track residents&#39; movements, collect biometric data, and build massive databases of our daily lives.</p>
            <p>alpr.watch scans meeting agendas for keywords like &#34;flock,&#34; &#34;license plate reader,&#34; &#34;alpr,&#34; and more. Each pin on the map shows where these conversations are happening so that you can make a difference.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <h3>What is ALPR?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)</strong> systems use cameras and artificial intelligence to capture, read, and store license plate data from every passing vehicle.</p>
                    <p>These systems work 24/7 creating a massive database of where vehicles, and by extension, people, travel. Every trip to the grocery store, doctor&#39;s office, or place of worship gets recorded and stored.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What is Flock Safety?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Flock Safety</strong> is one of the largest manufacturers of ALPR cameras in the United States, marketing their systems to neighborhoods and law enforcement.</p>
                    <p>Flock cameras capture license plates, vehicle make/model, color, and other identifying features. This data is shared across a massive network of agencies and jurisdictions, creating a surveillance web that tracks millions of Americans.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>The Slippery Slope</h3>
                    <p>History shows that surveillance systems expand beyond their original scope:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Systems marketed for &#34;solving crimes&#34; get used for immigration enforcement</li>
                        <li>Temporary programs become permanent infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Data sharing agreements grow to include more agencies</li>
                        <li>Technology advances enable new invasive uses</li>
                        <li>Regulations and oversight consistently lag behind deployment</li>
                    </ul>
