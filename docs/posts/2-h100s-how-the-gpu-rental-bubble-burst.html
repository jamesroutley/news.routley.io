With the vast majority of smaller groups having switched over to finetuning.

Faster than all of us expected.</p><p>Few investors have even realized we have reached commodity-level prices at $2.85 in certain places, let alone loss-making prices of a dollar.

Tensordock, Runpod) with security and networking compliances that meet our standards.</p><p>Leveraging them with our own proprietary model hot swapping, which boots new models up in under a second. Keeping our fleet of GPUs right-sized to our workload, while using a custom version of our RWKV foundation model as a low-cost speculative decoder.
