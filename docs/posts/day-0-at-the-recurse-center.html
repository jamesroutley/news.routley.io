    <h1>Day 0 at the Recurse Center</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Day 0 at the Recurse Center</h3>

<p>Opening events at the Recurse Center will start in a couple hours. I have the first-day jitters — bad.</p>

<p>No surprise there, really. Anxiety is my default mode. But I’m a little baffled with the sense of pressure I feel, before the program’s even started.</p>

<p>Pressure? At the un-graded, self-directed, tuition-free, unbounded programming retreat?</p>

<p>Pressure from whom? To do what?</p>

<p>It’s self-generated, of course, and if you put a gun to my head, I couldn’t tell you what I’m pressing myself to do. That’s probably why the pressure feels so acute.</p>

<p>I think this stems from two things:</p>

<p><strong>1. I really, really want to get the most out of my RC experience</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to do this for years, and never had the opportunity. Now that I’m here, I want to suck the marrow out of it. Maybe even have something to show for it — a cool new job, or a project, or connections, etc. The clock is ticking, and I don’t want to end my short stint (six weeks!!) empty handed. Pressure.</p>

<p><strong>2. The gulf between where I am as a programmer, and where I’d like to be, feels uncrossably wide</strong></p>

<p>To be at RC is to be in the company of some very talented people. It’s hard not to compare yourself, and see where you come up short. The collective knowledge of the group dwarfs my own (as of course it would), which leaves me feeling a little daunted. How can I join the vaunted ranks of these computer geniuses? There’s too much to learn. Too many axes to measure myself by. And nowhere near enough hours in the day. Pressure.</p>

<p>How can I fix the jitters?</p>

<p>What I’m trying to do is to remember that RC is supposed to help me grow, and it’s set up to be supportive. It’s one of the rare places where I can manage the pace of things.</p>

<p>It’s not a cocoon where sluggish oaf Matt enters, and hot computer wizard-genius Matt emerges a month and a half later. It’s not a failure if I’m not utterly transformed.</p>

<p>My only obligation is to come out of this thing as a somewhat smarter version of myself. To that end, I’m trying to narrow my scope.</p>

<p>If I come out of RC…</p>

<ol>
  <li>…knowing more about a new-to-me programming language / paradigm (Ruby, Rails)</li>
  <li>…understanding distributed systems a little better (through the… ‘Understanding Distributed Systems’ textbook)</li>
  <li>…being a little better prepared to attack a difficult job market (nicer blog, updated resume, connections with companies)</li>
  <li>…having met, paired with, and absorbed thoughts from my batchmates</li>
  <li>…having made some space for serendipitous, curiosity-driven, follow-my-nose tech learning</li>
</ol>

<p>…then I will count the experience successful.</p>

<p>Wow, I think I just talked myself down from an anxiety attack.</p>
