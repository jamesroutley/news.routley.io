    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone else struggling to get a software dev job?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Recently interviewed with a medium sized company for a backend dev position.</p><p>They said I passed the interviews and promised an offer. After a month of &#34;trying to find a customer to place me&#34;, telling me I&#39;m a fantastic candidate etc. they finally decided to cancel the verbal offer until maybe next year.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently had other bad experiences were they basically try to find excuses to cut me on interviews. It&#39;s like I&#39;m answering the questions correctly minus one, so I&#39;m disqualified.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember job searching being that hard even a few years ago, anybody relates?</p></div></div></div>
