<p>Dear Adriano Caloiaro</p>

<p>We are writing to inform you about important changes to the tariff 
structure of our Cloud servers (CCX and CPX lines) and our Load balancers at 
our US locations in Ashburn and Hillsboro.</p>

<h4>What will change?</h4>

<p>Starting on 1 December 2024, 01:00 am CET, we will begin charging new 
prices for newly-created Cloud servers and introduce new amounts for included 
traffic for Cloud Servers and Load balancers at the US locations in Ashburn 
(ASH) and Hillsboro (HIL). This also applies to existing Cloud servers and 
Load balancers that are switched to a different tariff using the 
“Rescale” function. For any existing Cloud servers and Load balancers you 
have at these locations, the new prices and the new amounts for included 
traffic will apply later, starting on 1 February 2025, 01:00 am CET. The 
price for traffic overage will remain unchanged in the new price 
structure.</p>

<p>What are the new prices and amounts of included traffic?</p>

<p>Below, you can see a list of the old and new prices and the included 
traffic.

All monthly prices are excl. VAT and excl. IPv4 addresses.

<h4>Why are we making these changes?</h4>

<p>With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our 
customers around the world as fair as possible. To do that, we will calculate 
our prices based on local conditions in Europe, Singapore, and the USA. Until 
this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, 
in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to 
make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best 
possible price for the resources they use.</p>

<h4>What else do I need to know?</h4>

<p>Displayed prices and included traffic on Cloud Console</p>

<p>For technical reasons, we will display the new prices and amounts of 
included traffic on the Cloud server and Load balancer detail pages on Cloud 
Console starting on 1 December 2024. This will also be true for your existing 
Cloud servers and Load balancers. However, the invoice will still be issued 
according to the previous conditions. A corresponding note will be displayed 
for your existing affected products. On the invoice preview on the 
“Usage” page, you will see the correct existing price for your existing 
servers.</p>

<p>Displayed prices on the Cloud API</p>

<p>In the transition time period between 1 December 2024 and 1 February 2025, 
the Cloud API will already return the new prices and included traffic. This 
will also be true for your existing Cloud servers and Load balancers. But 
this will only affect the display here. The invoice preview will display the 
correct existing price. And of course, your invoice itself will be for the 
correct existing price.</p>

<p>Traffic warning</p>

<p>You may see early traffic warnings during the transition time period 
starting on 1 December 2024 for your existing Cloud servers and Load 
balancers. Please note that the previous traffic included for existing Cloud 
servers and Load balancers remains valid until 31 January 2025.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with this adjustment, you can cancel the affected 
products at any time. We ask for your understanding for why we are making 
these changes. We truly believe that we can continue to offer you our Cloud 
Servers and features at the best price-performance ratio despite these 
adjustments.</p>

<p>We will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please write us a 
support request using your account on Cloud Console at <a href="https://console.hetzner.cloud/support">https://console.hetzner.cloud/support</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your trust and support.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
