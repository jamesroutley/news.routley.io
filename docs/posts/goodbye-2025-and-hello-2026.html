And so I kicked off a job search, which quickly gained a lot of traction. Maybe too much traction, thanks to the excellent career services at Recurse Center...</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png" width="1392" height="686" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:686,&#34;width&#34;:1392,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:365487,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://blog.danielsosebee.com/i/183109583?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OIdi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0b4459-7283-4e16-bc46-a56770965f40_1392x686.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption>A Sankey diagram of the companies I interviewed with mid-2025. Each interview path begins and ends in “The Dao,” a playful nod to philosophies that encourage a “go with the flow” approach to life, which stand in stark contrast to my mental tendencies during such goal-oriented periods</figcaption></figure></div><p>I interviewed for a dozen roles and ended up with a few offers from companies I was truly excited about, each in different ways. I even worked with one company for two months in a trial period that went quite well by all accounts. And yet, the whole time I had a persistent doubt about whether I was making the right move.</p><p>Everything rode on the question of “am I getting healthier”, and I was extremely sensitive to the slightest fluctuations in the dial that swung between “yes I’m improving” and “no I’m not”. Extrapolated forward, that dial pointed between one future in which I regained my health, my physical activities and my social life, all while building a career at an interesting company… and a second future where all aspects of my life slowly deteriorated until even my job was too much to handle, setting back my recovery by months at best, and at worst, indefinitely.</p><p>With such a steep downside, in hindsight it’s surprising to me that didn’t cut my losses earlier. But it was also demoralizing for me to consider sitting around indefinitely - there is always a part of me that wants to push the boundaries, in case I find them to yield.</p><p>But this time around, fate made the choice for me. The same week that I intended to sign a full-time offer, my body failed again in a full on “crash”. Everything was weak, I couldn’t even do my five minutes of light morning yoga, and trying to write code felt like grinding my brain against a wall. (It’s wild how, in these states, the body is so fiercely opinionated about what to spend energy on - but that’s a topic for another time.)</p><p>After conversations with my counsel of friends, I called my employer-to-be and postponed my joining indefinitely. And once again was floating into the unknown.</p><p>Not quite knowing what to do with myself, I put all my energy into recording my piano album. And as that went on, I started to piece together a different vision for my recovery - one in which I went straight for the things that brought me the most joy and excitement… though I hadn’t understood things exactly in those terms yet.</p><p>But I had some vague notions of completing the album, and traveling and visiting friends, and learning about math and AI, and writing publicly, and reconnecting to my personal systems and the other creative projects in my life, including the very projects I told you I was going to focus on last year!</p><p>And as a first stop, I packed my car and set off for Seattle for a trip of unknown duration. Originally I just meant to visit friends, and yet, ~2.5 months later, I’m still here. And, though my health continued to be rocky...</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png" width="1398" height="196" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:196,&#34;width&#34;:1398,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:131777,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://blog.danielsosebee.com/i/183109583?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E_WC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e315045-2141-47b4-96cb-2adda83085bc_1398x196.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>A stacked-area chart of my self-reported health metrics over the last 5.5 months.
