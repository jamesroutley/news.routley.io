<p>Google has debuted a new default SafeSearch setting, somewhere between &#34;on&#34; and &#34;off,&#34; that automatically blurs explicit images in search results for most people.</p>
<p>In a blog post timed to <a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/en-GB/">Safer Internet Day</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/creating-a-safer-internet-for-everyone/?_ga=2.57095402.1534218754.1675795762-1498340739.1671122661">Google outlined a number of measures</a> it plans to implement to &#34;protect democracies worldwide,&#34; secure high-risk individuals, improve password management, and protect credit card numbers. Tucked into a series of small-to-medium announcements is a notable change to search results, Google&#39;s second core product after advertising.</p>
<p>A new setting, rolling out &#34;in the coming months,&#34; &#34;will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn&#39;t turned on,&#34; writes Google&#39;s Jen Fitzpatrick, senior vice president of Core Systems &amp; Experiences. &#34;This setting will be the new default for people who don&#39;t already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time.&#34;</p>
<p>Google&#39;s explanatory image (seen above) shows someone logged in and searching for images of &#34;Injury.&#34; A notice shows that &#34;Google turned on SafeSearch blurring,&#34; which &#34;blurs explicit images in your search results.&#34; One of the example image results—&#34;Dismounted Complex Blast Injury (DCBI)&#34; from ResearchGate—is indeed quite explicit, as far as human viscera and musculature goes. Google provides one last check if you click on that blurred image: &#34;This image may contain explicit content. SafeSearch blurring is on.&#34;</p>

<p>If you click &#34;View image,&#34; you see life&#39;s frail nature. If you click &#34;Manage setting,&#34; you can choose between three settings: Filter (where explicit results don&#39;t show up at all), Blur (where both blurring and are-you-sure clicks occur), and Off (where you see &#34;all relevant results, even if they&#39;re explicit&#34;).</p>
<p>Signed-in users under the age of 18 automatically have <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">SafeSearch enabled</a>, blocking content including &#34;pornography, violence, and gore.&#34; With this change, Google will automatically be blurring explicit content for everybody using Google who doesn&#39;t log in, stay logged in, and specifically ask to show it instead. It&#39;s a way to prevent children from getting access to explicit images, but also, notably, a means of ensuring people are logged in to Google if they&#39;re looking for something… very specific. An incognito window, it seems, just won&#39;t do.</p>
<p>Google turned on SafeSearch as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">its default for under-18 users</a> in August 2021, having been pressured by Congress to better protect children across its services, including search and YouTube.</p>
