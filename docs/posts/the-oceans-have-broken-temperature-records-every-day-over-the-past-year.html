They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>AFP</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>A global coral bleaching event has been declared by scientists, with Australia&#39;s Great Barrier Reef seeing record damage</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Unusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,&#34; says Prof Meredith. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The problem of climate change is that it&#39;s happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,&#34; says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/FutureEarth/zdsgqyc">Sign up here</a><b> for our climate and environment newsletter.

As a result, it tends to push up the global average.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>El Niño <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65839060">kicked into gear in June 2023</a> - after a prolonged period of cooler La Niña conditions - and reached a peak in December, although it has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68826152">since been fading away</a>. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But other ocean basins that aren&#39;t usually affected by El Niño have also experienced record marine heatwaves - leaving scientists trying to work out exactly what is going on.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The Atlantic has been warmer than usual, and this is not a pattern you normally associate with El Niño - so it&#39;s something somehow different,&#34; explains Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This heat is still persisting in many ocean basins, including the tropical Atlantic. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Warmer seas <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42251921">give tropical storms extra energy</a>, and this could help to fuel a potentially damaging hurricane season.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There is still a large patch of warmer than usual water in the tropical Atlantic [and] this is the main development region for tropical cyclones,&#34; explains Dr Buontempo.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are almost a month ahead in the sea surface temperature in the Atlantic with respect to the annual cycle [...] so this is an area that has to be watched.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As well as these short-term impacts, researchers warn there will be long-term consequences that society will have to adapt to. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Experts say that emperor penguin chicks have suffered as a result of warmer seas</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For example, ice-sheet melting and deep-ocean warming are likely to continue to fuel sea-level rise in the centuries to come.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When we talk about climate change, we tend to reduce that to changes on the surface because we live there,&#34; said Angélique Melet, a researcher with Mercator Ocean International. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;However, the deep ocean is one of the aspects [of global warming] that is committing us to centuries and millennia of [climate] change.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Dr Melet stresses that is not a reason to give up on cutting emissions.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Depending on our actions, we can reduce the speed of that warming, and we can decrease the overall amplitude of that warming and sea-level rise.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Graphics by Erwan Rivault, Muskeen Liddar and Mark Poynting</i></p></div></article></div>
