            <p itemprop="description">Michael Schumacher&#39;s family is to take legal action against a German magazine that ran an &#39;interview&#39; with the seven-time world champion that was generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Schumacher suffered a brain injury in a skiing accident in December 2013, and his family have guarded his privacy since with updates on his recovery kept to a minimum.</p><p>The latest edition of <em>Die Aktuelle</em> ran a front cover with a picture of a smiling Schumacher and the headline promising &#39;Michael Schumacher, the first interview&#39;.</p><div>    <figure property="associatedMedia">        <div typeof="ImageObject">                            <p><img data-src="https://e2.365dm.com/23/04/768x432/skysports-die-aktuelle-michael-schumacher_6127269.jpg?20230420103023" alt="Die Aktuelle&#39;s front cover (Credit - Die Aktuelle/AP Photo)" itemprop="image"/>                                    </p>                    </div>                    <p>                Die Aktuelle&#39;s front cover (Credit - Die Aktuelle/AP Photo)            </p>            </figure></div><p>A strapline added: &#34;it sounded deceptively real&#34;.

Different, but he&#39;s here, and that gives us strength, I find. He still shows me how strong he is every day.</p><p>&#34;We live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he&#39;s comfortable. And to simply make him feel our family, our bond.</p><p>&#34;And no matter what, I will do everything I can. We all will. We&#39;re trying to carry on as a family, the way Michael liked it and still does. And we are getting on with our lives.</p><p>&#34;&#39;Private is private&#39;, as he always said. It&#39;s very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us, and now we are protecting Michael.&#34;</p>
