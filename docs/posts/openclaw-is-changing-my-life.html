    <h1>OpenClaw is changing my life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I want to share some thoughts on my recent experience with OpenClaw. Over the past year, I’ve been actively using Claude Code for development. Many people believed AI could already assist with programming—seemingly replacing programmers—but I never felt it brought any revolutionary change to the way I work.</p><p>Sure, agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Cursor have made writing code easier, but at the end of the day, I was still the one writing. It might look like the AI is doing the work, but “writing” is a broad term—writing is execution. As the person making code happen, I’m the one writing code. Whether I’m editing line by line, copy-pasting, or telling an AI what I want and letting it finish—it’s still me “writing.” My role as the programmer responsible for turning code into reality hasn’t changed.</p><p>My productivity did improve, but for any given task, I still had to jump into the project, set up the environment, open my editor and Claude Code terminal. I was still the operator; the only difference was that instead of typing code manually, I was typing intent into a chat box. That only changed one dimension. Testing, debugging—most of it still fell on me. There was some change, sure, but it wasn’t mature, and there was no fundamental shift. I still had to stay deeply involved and monitor everything. And it was exactly this deep involvement that kept me stuck in the role of code executor.</p><p>Then OpenClaw came along, and everything changed.</p><p>I once discussed with my wife: in the age of AI, should you aim to be a “super individual” or build a “super team”? My answer is: become a “super manager.” A super individual who can juggle multiple threads and coordinate numerous AI tools is essentially demonstrating great management skills. Being a super individual means using AI tools to lift yourself from a basic executor to a higher-level one, and eventually into a manager. So even if you’re going the super individual route, you need solid management awareness and methods to keep everything running smoothly.</p><p>OpenClaw gave me the chance to become that super manager. After a few rounds of practice, I found that I could completely step away from the programming environment and handle an entire project’s development, testing, deployment, launch, and usage—all through chatting on my phone. That’s something Claude Code simply can’t do, or rather, it was never designed to.</p><p>As a general-purpose agent, OpenClaw interacts through messaging apps via voice, accurately understands what I mean, works independently for extended periods, and has solid memory—it can persist the methods and rules it picks up during work, gradually evolving through use. These are the capabilities that make it the real turning point for replacing me as the code executor. The biggest change is this: I just need to express my intent, and it automatically creates the project, writes up a plan for me to review. I can discuss changes with it by voice, and then it executes—even directing Claude Code to do the actual coding.</p><p>It replaced the “me” that used to write code, truly stepping into the programmer role and freeing me to act as a manager. A manager shouldn’t get bogged down in the specifics—they should focus on the higher-level, abstract work. That’s what management really is. You could even flip it around: you’re only a true manager when you can get things done purely through communication. Before, Claude Code alone couldn’t get you there. But when you have a dedicated machine running 24/7, set up with all your tools, and an agent that understands your intent sitting at the computer writing and debugging code for you—that’s when things truly change. That’s when the revolution arrives.</p><p>This is the biggest shift OpenClaw has brought—it completely transformed my workflow. Whether it’s personal or commercial projects, I can step back and look at things from a management perspective. It’s like having a programmer who’s always on standby, ready to hop into meetings, discuss ideas, take on tasks, report back, and adjust course at any time. It can even juggle multiple roles, like having several programmers working on different projects simultaneously. Meanwhile, I can be the tech lead keeping tabs on specific project progress, or the project manager steering the overall schedule and direction.</p><p>This has truly freed up my productivity, letting me pursue so many ideas I couldn’t move forward on before. I feel like my life genuinely changed at this moment. I used to have way too many ideas but no way to build them all on my own—they just kept piling up. But now, everything is different.</p><p>It’s like I suddenly have a team, achieving the dream scenario I always imagined: owning a company, hiring people to bring my ideas to life, while I just focus on product design and planning. I’m closer than ever to that dream state. Before, that required serious capital. Without money, you can’t hire anyone, and you can’t just be the idea person. Unless you’re some trust fund kid doing it for fun, you’re stuck bouncing between “indie developer who wants to build multiple projects” and “solo hustler just trying to survive.”</p><p>But now, I can finally break out of that trap and move toward actually having a team. It keeps all my projects moving forward at any time. It’s not perfect yet, but I’ve taken the first step.</p><p>Thank you, OpenClaw. Thank you, AGI—for me, it’s already here. The gears of fate are turning in directions I never imagined.</p></div></article></div></div>
