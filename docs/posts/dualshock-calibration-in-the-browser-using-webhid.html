    <p>Hi!</p>

<p>I’m excited to officially introduce the
<a href="https://dualshock-tools.github.io">Dualshock Calibration GUI</a>.</p>

<p>This website provides a user-friendly interface to recalibrate your 
DualShock 4 or DualSense controllers, it aims to completely replace the
calibration scripts for end-users.</p>

<p>Here’s what you can currently do on the platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect to a DualShock 4 (V1, V2) or a DualSense</li>
  <li>Read firmware information</li>
  <li>Wizard to re-center the analog sticks</li>
  <li>Recalibrate the range of the sticks</li>
  <li>Auto-detects if the DS4 is original or clone (still in beta, will improve in future)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best of all, it’s completely free, open-source and available on its 
<a href="https://github.com/dualshock-tools/dualshock-tools.github.io">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>It is available only for Google Chrome, Chromium or
compatiable browsers (e.g. Edge) because it uses <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/web-platform/webhid">WebHID</a>, a javascript extension that can be used to send commands to a HID device.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I noticed that many repair technicians were using my scripts to recalibrate
controllers, which significantly reduced repair times and costs.
However, many of them were also having a tough time setting up the environment
to run the scripts: Python, libusb, Windows drivers, and all that complicated
stuff: the user experience was completely off.</p>

<p>This led me to the idea of creating a multiplatform web UI that could simplify
everything. I developed a prototype and shared the link on a Facebook group for
repair technicians, where it was warmly (..really warmly!) received.</p>

<p>Few days later, I noticed that the beta link spread on Reddit, where
non-technical users (gamers) were able to solve minor analog stick drifting
issues in a matter of seconds thanks to this tool!</p>

<p>Overall, I’m thrilled that this website is helping so many people in repairing 
their controllers and, at the same time, reducing e-waste from worn-out 
controllers!</p>

<h2 id="current-challenges">Current challenges</h2>

<p>Currently, the primary focus is ensuring a highly reliable platform for all users,
without risking any damage on their controllers.</p>

<p>At the moment I tried to handle this by performing many checks before and after each calibration step.
If any of these checks fails, the whole process is halted to prevent any potential harm.</p>

<p>Additionally, the platform has a detection mechanism to identify non-original DualShock4.
In such case, all functionalities are disabled.
This is because these clones only support a fraction of the commands available
in the original controllers: they are essentially designed to mimic the
original DS4 only to trick the PS4 into believing the controller is authentic.</p>

<p>The calibration wouldn’t work anyway, because those commands (as you may guess)
have not been replicated.
Probably they would do some random action, with the risk of bricking it.</p>

<p>If any developer of the clones reads this and wants to help me figuring out
which commands should be sent to calibrate them, I would be happy to upgrade
the web-ui <img title=":grin:" alt=":grin:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" height="20" width="20"/>.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future steps</h2>

<p>Currently, there are four major tasks on my to-do list, each of which will
require a substantial amount of time to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add other undocumented commands to the web-ui, so that this website may
become a full-fledged repair tool for both DS4 and DS5 controllers.</li>
  <li>Obtain a DS Edge and reverse-engineer it, to add calibration support also for it.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer the XBox Controller provided by GsmHack4You. This will take lot of time.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer the PlayStation3 controller to figure out how to calibrate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>While all these tasks are currently in the ideation phase, I’m open to any
other suggestions or ideas that may contribute to the enhancement of the tool!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In closing, I want to express my gratitude to all the readers and people who
contributed and are supporting it.</p>

<p>I remain open to ideas, suggestions, and feedback from all of you. 
If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvement, please don’t
hesitate to contact me!</p>

<p>Thanks <img title=":heart:" alt=":heart:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2764.png" height="20" width="20"/></p>
