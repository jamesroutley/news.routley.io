I’m excited to see how it will be renovated in the future.</p><p>Okay. Here we go.</p><p><strong>1. Never end a sentence with a period (&#34;.&#34;)</strong></p><p>If someone ends their sentence with a period, stop all the jokes and behave yourself, cuz boi oh boi they are DAMN serious. </p><p>Imagine:</p><ul><li><p><span>Your partner texts you &#34;</span><em>I&#39;ll be home for dinner</em><span>&#34;, how light-hearted and cute is that? But if your partner texts you &#34;</span><em>I&#39;ll be home for dinner.</em><span>&#34;, it suddenly becomes a threat, as in, &#34;you better darn be there when I come home, and make good food, otherwise you&#39;re in trouble, honey&#34;</span></p></li><li><p>Your boss texts you &#34;Meet me in 10 minutes.&#34; --&gt; You&#39;re bout to be fired. </p></li><li><p>Your friend texts you &#34;I am happy for you.&#34; --&gt; Highly likely they hate you and even wish the worst for you, but they have to text anyway cuz every friend in the group is doing so. </p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Never text without emojis or text emojis</strong></p><p>Texting strips off the physical emotions, which are an important factor for meaning interpretation. </p><p>Therefore, you are, yes, sadly, required to show your emotion when texting. </p><p>Pretentious as it might be (since you might not really mean it but want the other to think you mean it), using emojis/text emojis during conversations is a social norm these days.</p><p>Consider this sentence: You have been to Japan before? </p><p>And these: </p><ul><li><p><em>You have been to Japan before?</em><span> 😲 --&gt;  you&#39;re surprised someone has the privilege to go there.</span></p></li><li><p><em>You have been to Japan before?</em><span> 🤔 --&gt;  you doubt what they say is true</span></p></li><li><p><em>You have been to Japan before?</em><span> 🙄 --&gt;  you think going to Japan is a bad idea and the other person is sooo stupid having gone there</span></p></li></ul><p>Another example is how emojis/text emojis can change the entire meaning of a sentence. </p><p>Let&#39;s say your friend said that he&#39;s laid off from the company, and got compensated 6 months of salary. And you say:</p><ul><li><p><em>I wish I could be laid off tomorrow too</em><span> --&gt; you seriously want to be laid off. Now you bring some gloomy cloud to the convo. You&#39;re to blame.</span></p></li><li><p><em>I wish I could be laid off tomorrow too :)))</em><span>  --&gt;  you don&#39;t want to be laid off, just want to get that huge sum of cash. You&#39;re being playful. Good job!</span></p></li></ul><p>For some reason, not using emojis can be seen as not being emotionally invested in the conversation. This is especially true on dating apps. </p><p>That&#39;s why I never got any success there. </p><p><strong>3. But do NOT ever send :) or 🙂</strong></p><p>It looks dead in the eye. It&#39;s passive-aggressive. It&#39;s cold. It reverses all possible meanings of what is explicitly texted. </p><p>If someone texts you &#34;Congratulations on your new role 🙂&#34;, they probably mean something along the line of &#34;I am happy because we no longer work with each other&#34;, or &#34;That role should have been mine you mtfk&#34;</p><p><strong>4. If you&#39;ve seen it, reply it, can be anything, but REPLY IT ANYWAY!</strong></p><p>The act of &#34;seen-ing&#34; but not replying can mean a lot of things, but none of those carry positive meanings. Here are some examples one can interpret it:</p><ul><li><p>You&#39;re rude. You don&#39;t try to continue the conversation, or even bother to tell me to end it.</p></li><li><p>You don&#39;t love me anymore.</p></li><li><p>You are busy with someone/something else more important/interesting/sexy than me.</p></li><li><p>You&#39;re arrogant. You don&#39;t think I deserve an answer even the simplest.</p></li><li><p>You don&#39;t respect me. </p></li><li><p>You want war? Game on bitch.</p></li></ul><p>After blaming the other party, a &#34;seen&#34; text will also cause extreme self-doubt and confusion:</p><ul><li><p>Did I say something wrong/hurtful/offensive/not salty?</p></li><li><p>What should I say next? Am I lowering my ego to steal their attention?</p></li><li><p>Am I being a bad partner? </p></li></ul><p>The list goes on. </p><p><strong>5. If you&#39;ve seen my story, you’d better reply to my message</strong></p><p>Do NOT ever think you can get away with previewing a person&#39;s message on Messenger, not replying to them, and proceeding to view their Instagram stories without them knowing! </p><p><span>Here&#39;s a sad truth: Many people, after posting their Instagram stories, check who has viewed them. Every now and then, they&#39;d open Instagram, tap on their own story, swipe up, see who&#39;s viewed it, and swipe away the app, all happening within a matter of </span><strong>seconds</strong><span>. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg" width="473" height="1024" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1024,&#34;width&#34;:473,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;How to see who has Viewed your Instagram Story | Izood&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="How to see who has Viewed your Instagram Story | Izood" title="How to see who has Viewed your Instagram Story | Izood" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd496435b-4e00-4217-b72d-dc8c40b75ff0_473x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The worst feature ever.
