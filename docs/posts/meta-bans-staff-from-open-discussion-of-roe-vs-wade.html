                        <p>Meta has warned employees not to discuss the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to overturn <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/businesses-react-supreme-court-overturn-of-roe-v-wade-2022-6" data-analytics-module="body_link">Roe v. Wade</a> on its internal system and deleting messages that do so, The New York Times reported.</p><p>Managers cited a policy that put &#34;strong guardrails around social, political and sensitive conversations&#34; in the workplace, according to company insiders, the newspaper reported. </p><p>Ambroos Vaes, a Meta software engineer, said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6946221756604960768/" data-analytics-module="body_link">post on LinkedIn</a> he was disappointed that Meta was not allowing the topic to be discussed. &#34;On our internal Workplace platform, moderators swiftly remove posts or comments mentioning abortion.&#34;</p><p>Vaes added: &#34;The &#39;respectful&#39; communications policy that was put in place explicitly disallows it. Limited discussion can only happen in groups of up to 20 employees who follow a set playbook, but not out in the open.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>A May 12 company memo obtained by The Times mentioned that many internal posts regarding abortion were taken down for violating the company&#39;s harassment policy. The policy had led to a high number of complaints to HR.</p><p>Meta did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>On Friday the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that legalized abortion nationally almost 50 years ago and returning the matter to the states. </p><p>The memo, seen by The Times, also said Meta had previously allowed open discussion of abortion but later decided it created &#34;significant disruptions in the workplace given unique legal complexities and the number of people affected by the issue.&#34; </p>
                        
                        <p>However, Meta said it would reimburse travel expenses &#34;to the extent permitted by law&#34; for employees who needed &#34;to access out-of-state health care and reproductive services,&#34; The Times reported.</p><p>Meanwhile, some Amazon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employee-reactions-abortion-roe-wade-be-respectful-response-memo-2022-6" data-analytics-module="body_link">employees have celebrated</a> the ruling on internal
