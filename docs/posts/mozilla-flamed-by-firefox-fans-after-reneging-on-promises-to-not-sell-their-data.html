    <h1>Mozilla flamed by Firefox fans after reneging on promises to not sell their data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Mozilla this week asked Firefox users to abide by new Terms of Use, and updated its Privacy Notice as well as an FAQ – only to quickly issue a clarification that it isn’t actually claiming ownership of user data.</p>
<p>Mind you, the language of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/firefox/">Terms of Use</a> document <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226211527/https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/">initially suggested</a> as much:</p>

<p>But Mozilla subsequently removed those terms, and insisted it was just necessary boilerplate.</p>
<p>“On Wednesday we shared that we’re introducing a new Terms of Use (TOU) and Privacy Notice for Firefox,” said Ajit Varma, veep of Firefox Product, on Friday in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/update-on-terms-of-use/#:~:text=TL%3BDR%20Mozilla%20doesn&#39;t,would%20usually%20understand%20that%20word.">an update</a> to the open source browser maker&#39;s initial <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-terms-of-use/">announcement</a> of the new terms.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Our intent was just to be as clear as possible about how we make Firefox work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Since then, we’ve been listening to some of our community’s concerns with parts of the TOU, specifically about licensing. Our intent was just to be as clear as possible about how we make Firefox work, but in doing so we also created some confusion and concern.”</p>
<p>Varma said its contractual language has been updated in an effort to assuage concerns. For one thing, it now states &#34;this does not give Mozilla any ownership&#34; of the data you put into Firefox to use it.</p>
<p>While much of the confusion can be written off as an unforced error in communication – legalese is often misunderstood – the developer&#39;s privacy commitment has changed, in its wording at least. The answer to &#34;what is Firefox?&#34; on Mozilla&#39;s FAQ page about its browser <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250130092351/https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/faq/">used to read</a>:</p>

<p>Now it <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/faq/">just says</a>:</p>

<p>In other words, Mozilla is no longer willing to commit to not selling your personal data to advertisers.</p>
<p>A related change was also <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/information-about-the-new-terms-of-use-and-updated-privacy/m-p/87949/highlight/true#M33725" rel="nofollow">highlighted</a> by mozilla.org commenter jkaelin, who linked direct to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/blob/main/bedrock/firefox/templates/firefox/faq.html">source code</a> for that FAQ page. To answer the question, &#34;is Firefox free?&#34; Moz used to say:</p>

<p>Now it simply reads:</p>

<p>Again, a pledge to not sell people&#39;s data has disappeared. Varma insisted this is the result of the fluid definition of “sell” in the context of data sharing and privacy.</p>
<p>“Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you (in the way that most people think about ‘selling data’), and we don’t buy data about you,” he said. “We changed our language because some jurisdictions define ‘sell’ more broadly than most people would usually understand that word.”</p>

</ul>
<p>Though the TOU – and its connected <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/">privacy policy</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/acceptable-use/">acceptable use rules</a> – are written in clear, plain English, are short and readable, and in our opinion contain no huge surprises, Mozilla&#39;s earlier choice of wording sparked a backlash on <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/information-about-the-new-terms-of-use-and-updated-privacy/m-p/87735#M33600" rel="nofollow">its own</a> forums, as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1iyuvjf/introducing_a_terms_of_use_and_updated_privacy/" rel="nofollow">on Reddit</a> and other places.</p>
<p>Following that outcry, Varma&#39;s announcement on Wednesday about the new fine print was updated to include this disclaimer:</p>

<p>One might argue the new terms are the result of a December management shakeup. That month it was <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/new-executives/" rel="nofollow">announced</a> three executives were joining Mozilla, including Varma, the author of the above announcements, as a Firefox veep after previously looking after WhatsApp for Meta, and before that, Gmail, and its related tools for Google. The other two were Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, senior veep of Firefox, who previously held top roles at Wayfair, Better, and Roofstock; and Girish Rao, SVP of infrastructure, who was previously at Warner Bros Discovery, EA, Cisco, and Equinix.</p>
<p>Then in early February, Mozilla <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/peter-rojas-svp-new-products/">gained</a> Peter Rojas as a senior veep of new products; he has an interesting history spanning from co-founding Engadget to holding senior roles at Meta and AOL to investing in AI model warehouse Hugging Face and others.</p>

    

<p>These high-level appointments were announced by Laura Chambers, who <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/09/mozilla_ceo_mitchell_baker_departs/">hopped aboard</a> as CEO a year ago; the hiring came the month after <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/06/mozilla_foundation_layoffs/">deep staffing cuts</a> at the Mozilla Foundation – the non-profit that overseas the Mozilla Corporation that develops Firefox and other things.</p>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>Sadly, it looks like the <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/10/mozillas-ceo-doubles-down-on-them-being-an-advertising-company-now/" rel="nofollow">assessment</a> of Moz by former Netscape coder Jamie Zawinski was not far off the mark. He also links to his own earlier criticisms, none of which we can really fault.</p>
<p>This seems like a good time to remind readers that there are other browsers out there based on the Firefox codebase, including <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/04/waterfox_firefox_fork/">our own go-to Waterfox</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/02/zen_firefox_fork_alpha/">tiling Zen browser</a> which has now reached beta.</p>

        

<p>Others that happen not to press our buttons quite so much, but may appeal more to you, include the security-centric <a href="https://librewolf.net/" rel="nofollow">LibreWolf</a> and the customization-heavy <a href="https://floorp.app/en" rel="nofollow">Floorp</a>. Other projects showing less recent activity are <a href="https://pulsebrowser.app/" rel="nofollow">Pulse</a> and <a href="https://thorium.rocks/mercury" rel="nofollow">Mercury</a>. Still in active development, but based on older versions of the Firefox codebase, are <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/" rel="nofollow">PaleMoon</a> and <a href="https://www.basilisk-browser.org/" rel="nofollow">Basilisk</a>.</p>
<p>Most venerable of all is the continuing fork of the original all-in-one Netscape suite, <a href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Seamonkey</a>. We&#39;re sad to note that its release engineer William Andrew Gianopoulos <a href="https://www.chesmorefuneralhome.com/obituaries/william-andrew-gianopoulos/20284/" rel="nofollow">died</a> in January.</p>

        

<p>Whether or not one agrees with the outrage over the TOU changes, the fact remains that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/18/mozilla_buys_anonym_betting_privacy/">Mozilla is now</a> in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.anonymco.com/">advertising business</a>. Use that information as you wish. ®</p>
