      <span>Abstract:</span>  We examine how the behavior of software developers changes in response to
removing gamification elements from GitHub, an online platform for
collaborative programming and software development. We find that the
unannounced removal of daily activity streak counters from the user interface
(from user profile pages) was followed by significant changes in behavior.
Long-running streaks of activity were abandoned and became less common. Weekend
activity decreased and days in which developers made a single contribution
became less common. Synchronization of streaking behavior in the platform&#39;s
social network also decreased, suggesting that gamification is a powerful
channel for social influence. Focusing on a set of software developers that
were publicly pursuing a goal to make contributions for 100 days in a row, we
find that some of these developers abandon this quest following the removal of
the public streak counter. Our findings provide evidence for the significant
impact of gamification on the behavior of developers on large collaborative
programming and software development platforms. They urge caution: gamification
can steer the behavior of software developers in unexpected and unwanted
directions.
