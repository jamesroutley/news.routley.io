Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: &#39;Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else&#39;.&#34;</p><p>The line is from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, one of his most notable stage works which also include The Real Thing. </p><p>In a statement announcing his death, United Agents said: &#34;He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language.</p><p>&#34;It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The playwright captivated the hearts of audiences for more than six decades with work that explored philosophical and political themes. </p><p>Paying tribute to his &#34;favourite playwright&#34;, Sir Mick Jagger posted on social media: &#34;He leaves us with a majestic body of intellectual and amusing work. I will always miss him.&#34;</p><p>Publishing company Faber Books said Sir Tom was &#34;one of the most brilliant and feted playwrights of the last sixty years and one of the great intellects of our time&#34;. </p><p>&#34;Tom has been at the heart of Faber Drama since his first play, the dazzling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He will be missed beyond measure,&#34; it added. </p><p>He also wrote for film, TV and radio. He adapted Leo Tolstoy&#39;s novel Anna Karenina for the 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law. </p><p>In 2020, he released his semi-autobiographical new work titled Leopoldstadt - set in the Jewish quarter of early 20th Century Vienna - which later won him an Olivier award for best new play and scooped four Tony awards.</p><p>Born Tomas Straussler in Czechoslovakia, his parents fled from imminent Nazi occupation when he was still a baby and went to Singapore.</p><p>He, his mother and brother had escaped ahead of the Japanese invasion and went first to Australia, later to India. His father, who had stayed behind, drowned fleeing Singapore when the boat he was on was bombed. In India, his mother met and married an Englishman, a Major Kenneth Stoppard, before moving to England.</p><p>He later learned from relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish, and that they had died in Nazi concentration camps. </p><p>&#34;I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It&#39;s a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life,&#34; he said in US magazine Talk in 1999, as he reflected on returning to his birthplace Zlin in what is now the Czech Republic.</p><p>He worked as a journalist in Bristol in 1954 before becoming a theatre critic and writing plays for radio and TV.</p><p>&#34;I wanted to be a great journalist,&#34; he said, as quoted by Reuters news agency. &#34;My first ambition was to be lying on the floor of an African airport while machine-gun bullets zoomed over my typewriter. But I wasn&#39;t much use as a reporter. I felt I didn&#39;t have the right to ask people questions.</p><p>&#34;I always thought they&#39;d throw the teapot at me or call the police.&#34;</p><p>Sir Tom&#39;s career as a playwright did not take off until the 1960s when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was later performed at the National Theatre and Broadway.</p><p>The play focuses on two minor characters from Hamlet. It won several awards including four Tonys in 1968, including best play.</p><p>He received many honours and accolades throughout his career, including being knighted by the late Queen for his services to literature in 1997.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f35c/live/17a1bc90-cd62-11f0-8adf-37126eb01b90.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="PA Media An elderly woman in a blouse with pale blue and purple stripes smiles and shakes hands with a middle-aged man who is wearing a dark suit and has grey hair."/><span>PA Media</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Sir Tom Stoppard and the late Queen in the year 2000.
