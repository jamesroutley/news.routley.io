		<h3>What&#39;s this?</h3>
		<p>Koyaanisqatsi is a 1983 wordless documentary primarily made up of
		slow motion and time-lapse footage. If you haven&#39;t seen it, you can watch the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PirH8PADDgQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>I wondered how easy it would be to make an internet version using
		random Giphy &#39;gifs&#39; which have been tagged as slow motion or time-lapse,
		playing them along with the Philip Glass soundtrack.</p>

		<p>
		(As with any random thing, there is a chance some dodgy content may get through. I have used Giphy&#39;s
		PG-13 setting and it seems okay, but click on a video and it will tell you an id - send me this and I&#39;ll block anything iffy.
		Also note that this may not work on phones, especially iPhones, as they can be weird about multiple videos, and it&#39;s quite heavy on your processor and bandwidth.)
