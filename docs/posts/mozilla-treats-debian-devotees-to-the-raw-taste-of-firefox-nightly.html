    <h1>Mozilla treats Debian devotees to the raw taste of Firefox Nightly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Mozilla has published a native Debian package of Firefox – the pre-beta-test Nightly build, rather than the current released version.</p>
<p>Considering that it remains the dominant web browser for Linux, the packaging of Firefox (and its derivatives) remains a contentious issue. Then again, application packaging formats are one of the main areas that differentiate the various families of Linux distros.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2023/10/30/introducing-mozillas-firefox-nightly-deb-packages-for-debian-based-linux-distributions/" rel="nofollow">This week&#39;s announcement</a> reveals that Mozilla is packaging Firefox as a native <code>.deb</code> package for Debian-based distributions. Don&#39;t jump to grab it until you&#39;ve considered the implications, though: This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">Nightly channel</a>, which means unfinished, work-in-progress code, not even beta-test level. This means a new version every day, and probably a lot of crashes and unexpected behaviour. This is emphatically not for everyone, and not for normal use.</p>

    

<p>Even so, it&#39;s quite a departure. Until now, Mozilla remained aloof and avoided visibly favoring any particular distro or family. It didn&#39;t package its browser in any particular distro&#39;s format, and only offered compiled binaries as &#34;tarballs,&#34; the Linux version of a ZIP file. They work: You can download them, unzip them into a folder, and just run them, almost like some barbarian Windows user, but they are not managed by the OS&#39;s own software maintenance tools. When you upgrade the OS, the tarball-packaged Firefox won&#39;t get upgraded. It won&#39;t be integrated into your desktop&#39;s menus. You may not be able to select it as your default browser. This is because the OS&#39;s management tools don&#39;t know it&#39;s there, which is substantially less than ideal.</p>

        


        

<p>Mozilla&#39;s new packages reflect that out in the field, the biggest Linux distro family is Debian, which, together with its many variants including Ubuntu and Mint, dominate in sheer numbers.</p>
<p>(After that comes Red Hat and the various distros that use Red Hat&#39;s packaging format, including the SUSE family, but those folks just quietly get on with packaging Firefox for themselves.)</p>

        

<p>The problem is that Debian is a very slow-moving distro, which puts out a new major release roughly every other year – and once released, package versions are fixed. It does put out point releases with bug fixes, but these don&#39;t contain new versions. That places it at odds with Mozilla, which emits a new Firefox <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process" rel="nofollow">approximately once a month</a>. Even the enterprise-friendly, slow-release <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-esr-release-cycle" rel="nofollow">ESR version</a> of Firefox comes out about twice as often as Debian does, which sometimes means Debian users are stuck with older, unsupported versions, something that can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/10/debian_firefox_issues/">pose problems</a>.</p>
<p>This, in turn, created a maintenance headache for Ubuntu, which at the time of writing has <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases" rel="nofollow">five releases</a> currently supported. Rather than maintain half a dozen Firefox packages, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/14/ubuntu_21_10/">for the last two years</a> Canonical has been shipping Firefox in its own cross-distro Snap format, which means a single x86-64 Firefox package can run on everything from Ubuntu 18.04 &#34;Bionic Beaver&#34; to the latest 23.10 &#34;Mantic Minotaur&#34;.</p>

</ul>
<p>However, while ordinary users won&#39;t care – nor should they, to put it diplomatically – the Snap format is not universally loved among Linux techies. The leading distro based on Ubuntu, Linux Mint, makes a point of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/12/mint_203_mozilla/">maintaining its own native Firefox package</a> for Mint users.</p>
<p>As such, an official Mozilla Debian package is handy. For now, it&#39;s not as handy as it could be, because Nightlies are by definition unstable. This looks set to change, though – Mozilla&#39;s announcement says:</p>

<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk tested the nightly on a Debian Bookworm-based distro, and it worked perfectly, with no additional config needed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, other ways to get more current versions of Firefox on Debian or Ubuntu exist and have done for years. The <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/ubuntuzilla/wiki/Main_Page/" rel="nofollow">Ubuntuzilla project</a> has been offering current versions of Firefox, Firefox ESR, Seamonkey, and Thunderbird for well over a decade, and works on all Debian derivatives. Canonical&#39;s own <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam" rel="nofollow">MozillaTeam</a> offers a <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/ubuntu/ppa" rel="nofollow">PPA repository</a> with current versions specifically for Ubuntu, too.</p>
<p>We suspect that an officially sanctioned upstream version will be easier to get past company compliance teams and other cautious types, though.</p>
<h3>Bootnote</h3>
<p>To be strictly honest, even combined, the Debian and Ubuntu family are not <em>really</em> the most-used desktop Linux by sheer numbers. That&#39;s Google&#39;s ChromeOS – but as its name suggests, that comes with Chrome rather than Firefox. In any case, many penguinisti <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/">don&#39;t count ChromeOS as being a <em>proper</em> Linux</a>. ®</p>
