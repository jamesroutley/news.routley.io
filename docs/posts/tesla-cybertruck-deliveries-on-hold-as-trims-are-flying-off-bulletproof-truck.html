<p>According to Tesla delivery agents, Cybertruck deliveries are on hold. There’s a containment hold as many owners are reporting trims flying off the supposedly ‘bulletproof’ electric truck.</p>



<p>Many Tesla Cybertruck buyers are taking to forums and social media to report that their deliveries are being pushed.</p>



<p>There are 8 Cybertrucks buyers waiting for deliveries who reported the delay on the <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/delayed-delivery-due-to-inspection.37854/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum and many more on X and Facebook.</p>



<p>Most are being told by Tesla delivery specialists that there’s a “containment hold” on all Cybertruc deliveries.</p>	
	



<p>A containment hold generally occurs when an automaker finds something wrong with newly produced vehicles and wants to hold deliveries to fix the issue so that it can avoid recalling vehicles in customers’ hands.</p>



<p>In this case, most Cybertruck buyers are unaware of the issue. However, one buyer shared an image from Tesla’s service app where a Tesla rep said that the issue was due to the Cybertruck’s “cantrail trim”:</p>

<p>The cantrail trim is decorative trim that covers the roof ledge of a vehicle. For the Cybertruck, it consists of the highlighted section below:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-1.54.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Despite the fact that Tesla has claimed that the Cybertruck is “bulletproof” and made out of an “exoskeleton”, the electric vehicle’s build is actually much closer to a traditional unibody system rather than “exoskeleton.” Most of the visible body parts, which would be part of the chassis in a exoskeleton build, are actually trims attached to the body.</p>



<p>In some cases, they are extremely flimsy trims.</p>



<p>We previously reported on <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/25/tesla-recalls-over-11000-cybertrucks-over-trim-detaching-wiper-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla recalling 11,000 Cybertrucks due to some trims detaching while driving</a>. That recall was in June of last year, but is looks like the problem might be coming back.</p>



<p>Images of the Cybertruck’s front plate being held by glue has recently been circulating on social media:</p>

<p>The previous recall also mentioned a problem with adhesive resulting in trims detaching.</p>



<p>In the case of the Cybertruck’s cantrail trim, Tesla’s service manual points to brackets holding the top part of the trims:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-1.45.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The hold on Cybertruck deliveries appears to have started last weekend as some deliveries appoitments have been canceled and buyers have yet to be told when they will be able to pick up their vehicles.</p>




	<p>Here’s a good explanation of the issues with Tesla’s cantrail trim:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Tesla has yet to issue a public service bulletin on the issue. The last service bulletin for the Cybertruck is dated February 26, and it is about replacing the left body controller’s PCB on certain vehicles:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On certain Cybertruck vehicles, the left body controller’s printed circuit board was misaligned with its heatsink, which may cause the board to crack when the enclosure is closed. This may lead to a graceful power-off event. Replace the left body controller.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have previously reported on Tesla getting around service bulletin and potentially even recalls on the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>Based on internal information, we reported on <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/20/tesla-finds-cell-dent-issues-in-cybertrucks-starts-replacing-battery-packs/">Tesla having a fairly widespread “cell dent” issue in some Cybertruck battery packs in December</a>.</p>
