<p>A PhD student in Switzerland who blogged about <a href="https://solalpirelli.github.io/2023/01/25/troubling-acm-venues.html">a series of dubious conferences</a> linked to potential citation fraud is being sued by one of the conference chairs, a professor of computer science, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://archive.fo/flpfY">Shadi Aljawarneh</a> of the Jordan University of Science and Technology, reaped a prodigious number of citations from the conference proceedings, often <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zui-mmVs_7NbDS-yTe1dtorQCAZ7YNjPaOoZ25q7BwE/edit#gid=0">in highly questionable ways</a>.</p>



<p>“Fraud can pay off,” <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/solal.pirelli/?lang=en">Solal Pirelli</a>, a doctoral student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, wrote on his blog in January. “Shadi Aljawarneh has <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/scholar.google.com/citations?user=xm2Hp7YAAAAJ">6082 citations</a> and an h-index of 38 per Google Scholar, above many well-regarded researchers. This probably helped him sit on the editorial board of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231129141931/https:/peerj.com/SJawarneh/">PeerJ</a> Computer Science, alongside well-regarded researchers.”</p>



<p>Aljawarneh, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, also is a visiting professor at Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>The conferences were put together by an organization called the International Association of Researchers (IARES), of which Aljawarneh is a member, under the auspices of two major industry groups, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). </p>



<p>Many conference papers published by these groups have been found to suffer from plagiarism and other <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/15/plague-of-anomalies-in-conference-proceedings-hint-at-systemic-issues/">problems hinting at compromised peer review</a>, as we have reported before.</p>



<p>Pirelli, who moonlights as a scientific sleuth, said he decided to blog about his findings after he reported them to the ACM but didn’t hear back. In July, he got a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-letter-redacted.pdf">letter</a> (in French) from a lawyer representing Aljawarneh threatening legal action unless he took down his post. He didn’t.</p>



<p>Then on November 28, Pirelli received a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aljawarneh-appeal-judgment-redacted-new.pdf">judgment</a> (in French) from an appellate court showing that, unbeknownst to him, Aljawarneh’s lawyer had filed defamation charges already in June. </p>



<p>“This guy is suing me because … I uncovered his whole … scam association that was organizing a bunch of conferences that may or may not have even happened,” Pirelli told Retraction Watch. “One of them was supposedly in Kazakhstan in a time when Kazakhstan was closed due to COVID.”</p>



<p>An ACM press officer told us: “As part of ACM’s plagiarism and fraud practices, we do not comment on ongoing investigations.”</p>



<p>From the judgment, Pirelli learned that the charges against him had been dismissed by the public prosecutor. The appellate court, however, decided to let the lawsuit proceed.</p>



<p>The judgment also revealed that, following the blog post, an upcoming conference had been canceled and Aljawarneh had been removed from the editorial board of <em>PeerJ Computer Science</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s like, you know, yay, I did some sleuthing and I prevented more bullshit from being added to the pile of stuff in computer science, but at the same time I now have somebody suing me,” Pirelli says. </p>



<p>But, he added, “in Switzerland, truth that is said in the general-public interest is a defense to libel, to slander, so I’m not too worried about that.”</p>
