				<p><strong>SACRAMENTO –</strong> Governor Gavin Newsom today signed SB 576 by Senator Thomas Umberg (D-Santa Ana) to turn down the volume of commercials that rise to a level louder than the primary video content being watched. Building on Congress’ Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act passed in 2010 – which applied to broadcast television stations and cable operators – the law Governor Newsom signed today will also apply to streaming services, which have skyrocketed in popularity over the past decade.</p>

				<div><h4>“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what’s clear is that they don’t want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program. By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms, which had previously not been subject to commercial volume regulations passed by Congress in 2010.”</h4>
