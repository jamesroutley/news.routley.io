        <p>The 2024 Abel Prize—the mathematics world’s Nobel Prize equivalent—has been awarded to Michel Talagrand for <a href="https://abelprize.no/sites/default/files/2024-03/glimpse_of_the_laureates_work_AbelPrize_2024.pdf">his advances in describing and predicting</a> the universe’s randomness. Talagrand’s path into mathematics was marked with personal struggle and resilience, and his recognition came as a shock to him.</p>

<p>“There was a total blank in my mind for at least four seconds,” Talagrand tells <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00839-6">Nature News</a></em>’ Davide Castelvecchi, describing when he heard the news of his award. “If I had been told an alien ship had landed in front of the White House, I would not have been more surprised.”</p>

<p>Talagrand’s work focuses on stochastic systems, which model random variables within a given time and space. Examples include the height of a flowing river, stock prices, a hospital’s patient count, the movement of gas molecules and even a <a href="https://medium.com/i-math/the-drunkards-walk-explained-48a0205d304">stumbling drunkard’s</a> swerving path. Over years of work, he came to make sense of such systems, using mathematical formulas known as inequalities, to better characterize the limits of their variability.</p>

<p>Where to safely build a house along a rushing waterway, or how to anticipate the growth of a bacterial population, for example, are problems with solutions that may be closely predicted using Talagrand’s methods. The water level in a river may be random, but the mathematician’s work can discern its likely maximum level, which would advise where to construct buildings to avoid flooding, writes the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/science/abel-prize-mathematics-randomness.html">New York Times</a></em>’ Kenneth Chang.</p>

<p>Essentially, his inequalities, which convert complex systems into geometrical terms, create precise estimates. They offer new tools for study and applications in other fields, including physics, chemistry, communications and ecology.</p>

<p>“There are papers posted maybe on a daily basis where the punchline is ‘now we use Talagrand’s inequalities,’” <a href="https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/people/assaf-naor">Assaf Naor</a>, a mathematician at Princeton University, tells <em>Nature News</em>.</p><figure>

<p>The Abel committee also commended another element of Talagrand’s work, which shows that even random systems have an element of predictability. For example, flipping a coin 1,000 times will predictably yield close to 500 heads and 500 tails. The same thought process can be applied to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156089-bumblebees-solve-the-travelling-salesman-problem-on-the-fly/">travel routes</a>, and Talagrand’s principles provide convincing proof.</p>

<p>“It’s like a piece of art,” <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/helge.holden">Helge Holden</a>, a mathematician at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and the Abel committee chair, tells <em>Nature News</em>. “The magic here is to find a good estimate, not just a rough estimate.”</p>

<p>Talagrand also earned recognition for providing a proof for a physics problem that many scientists thought could never be explained by pure mathematics. Giorgio Parisi shared the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-scientists-who-warned-the-world-of-climate-change-180978814/">2021 Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for his 1979 work in predicting spin glasses, which describe the states and random behaviors of condensed magnetic atoms.</p>

<p>After five years of effort, Talagrand—and, separately, Italian physicist Francesco Guerra—provided the mathematical basis for Parisi’s work in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>“It’s one thing to believe that the conjecture is correct, but it’s another to prove it, and my belief was that it was a problem so difficult it could not be proved,” Parisi tells <em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2423192-mathematician-wins-2024-abel-prize-for-making-sense-of-randomness/">New Scientist</a></em>’s Alex Wilkins.</p>

<p>“It turned out the solution was not that difficult,” Talagrand tells the <em>New York Times</em>. “But of course, you couldn’t get up in the morning and figure it out. There has to be a lot of humble work.”</p>

<p>The mathematician, now 72 years old, has followed a similar approach to his own life. At the age of 5 he became blind in his right eye after its retina detached, and a decade later, the same thing happened with his left eye, as a result of a genetic condition. He underwent a long treatment in a hospital, where his father, a university math professor, taught young Talagrand the discipline. A self-described average student before that second incident, he returned to school with a sharper mind for math.</p>

<p>“I’m not able to learn mathematics easily,” Talagrand tells <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2423669-why-2024-abel-prize-winner-michel-talagrand-became-a-mathematician/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>. “I have to work. It takes a very long time and I have a terrible memory. I forget things. So I try to work, despite handicaps, and the way I worked was trying to understand really well the simple things. Really, really well, in complete detail. And that turned out to be a successful approach.”</p>

<p>Talagrand, who retired in 2017 after a 43-year career working at the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr">French National Center for Scientific Research</a>, is the 27th recipient of the <a href="https://abelprize.no/winners">Abel Prize</a>, which was first awarded in 2003. In addition to the honor, he will receive $700,000.</p>
