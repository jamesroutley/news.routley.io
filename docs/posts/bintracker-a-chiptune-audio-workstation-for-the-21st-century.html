<p>Bintracker is a modern programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">Chiptune</a> music editor. It is currently in development, with a beta release coming soon. The <a href="https://github.com/bintracker/bintracker">source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bintracker/bintracker/releases">Windows builds</a> are already available for anyone adventurous enough to try out Bintracker in its current alpha stage.</p>

<p>
  <h3>Features</h3><br/>
</p>

<p>
  <h4>All-in-One</h4><br/>
</p>
<p>
    Bintracker supports any music engine on any plaform through the versatile <a href="https://bintracker.org/documentation/mdal-introduction.html">MDAL</a> abstraction layer, so you can compose for SID, AY, FM, Beeper... all with one tool. By using <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/">MAME</a> as emulation backend, a vast array of 8- and 16-bit platforms are covered.
  </p>

<p>
  <h4>Extendable</h4><br/>
</p>
<p>
    While vanilla Bintracker sports a minimalistic look-and-feel, you can be greatly extended its power through plug-ins. Think piano roll, parameter automation, online collaboration, algorithmic composition...
  </p>

<p>
  <h4>Customizable</h4><br/>
</p>
<p>
    Through Bintracker&#39;s extensive configuration system, you can customize just about any aspect of the tool, including colors, fonts, widget themes, keybindings, number format, and more.
  </p>

<p>
  <h4>Programmable</h4><br/>
</p>
<p>
    Bintracker is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>, using the <a href="https://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a> implementation. The full power of Scheme is available at run-time, which means you can program Bintracker... in Bintracker.
  </p>

<p>
  <h4>Open Source</h4><br/>
</p>
<p>
    Bintracker is released under the permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.
