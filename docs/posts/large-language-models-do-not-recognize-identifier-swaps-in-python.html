            <span>Abstract:</span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have successfully been applied to code
generation tasks, raising the question of how well these models understand
programming. Typical programming languages have invariances and equivariances
in their semantics that human programmers intuitively understand and exploit,
such as the (near) invariance to the renaming of identifiers. We show that LLMs
not only fail to properly generate correct Python code when default function
names are swapped, but some of them even become more confident in their
incorrect predictions as the model size increases, an instance of the recently
discovered phenomenon of Inverse Scaling, which runs contrary to the commonly
observed trend of increasing prediction quality with increasing model size. Our
findings indicate that, despite their astonishing typical-case performance,
LLMs still lack a deep, abstract understanding of the content they manipulate,
making them unsuitable for tasks that statistically deviate from their training
data, and that mere scaling is not enough to achieve such capability.
