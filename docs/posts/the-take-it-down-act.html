<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Take It Down Act is an overbroad, poorly drafted bill that would create a powerful system to pressure removal of internet posts, with essentially no safeguards. While the bill is meant to address a serious problem—the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—the notice-and-takedown system it creates is an open invitation for powerful people to pressure websites into removing content they dislike. There are no penalties for applying very broad, or even farcical definitions of what constitutes NCII, and then demanding that it be removed. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>

<p>TELL CONGRESS: &#34;Take It Down&#34; Has No real Safeguards<span> </span><span> </span></p>
<h4><span data-contrast="auto" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span>This Bill Will Punish Critics, and The President Wants It Passed Right Now</span></span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Congress should believe Trump when he says he would use the Take It Down Act simply because he&#39;s &#34;treated badly,&#34; despite the fact that this is not the intention of the bill. There is nothing in the law, as written, to stop anyone—especially those with significant resources—from misusing the notice-and-takedown system to remove speech that criticizes them or that they disagree with. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump has frequently targeted platforms carrying content and speakers of entirely legal speech that is critical of him, both </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/newly-released-records-show-how-trump-tried-retaliate-against-social-media-fact"><span data-contrast="none">as</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/first-trump-doj-assembled-tiger-team-rewrite-key-law-protecting-online-speech"><span data-contrast="none">an</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/trumps-blocking-people-his-twitter-account-violates-first-amendment-eff-tells-court"><span data-contrast="none">elected</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/trumps-ban-tiktok-violates-first-amendment-eliminating-unique-platform-political"><span data-contrast="none">official</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/trump-free-speech-and-freedom-press"><span data-contrast="none">as a private citizen</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.  He has filed </span><a href="http://www.medialaw.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3470"><span data-contrast="none">frivolous lawsuits</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> against media defendants which threaten to silence critics and draw scarce resources away from important reporting work. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now that Trump issued a call to action for the bill in his remarks, there is a possibility that House Republicans will fast track the bill into a spending package as soon as next week. Non-consensual intimate imagery is a serious problem that deserves serious consideration, not a hastily drafted, overbroad bill that sweeps in legal, protected speech.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">How The Take It Down Act Could Silence People</span></b><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few weeks ago, a &#34;deepfake&#34; video of </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/fake-video-trump-kissing-musks-feet-displayed-hud-office-washington-rcna193503"><span data-contrast="none">President Trump and Elon Musk</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> was displayed across various monitors in the Housing and Urban Development office. The video was subsequently shared on various platforms. While most people wouldn&#39;t consider this video, which displayed faked footage of Trump kissing Elon Musk&#39;s feet, &#34;nonconsensual intimate imagery,&#34; the takedown provision of the bill applies to an “identifiable individual” engaged in “sexually explicit conduct.” This definition leaves much room for interpretation, and nudity or graphic displays are not necessarily required. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, there are no penalties whatsoever to dissuade a requester from simply insisting that content is NCII. Apps and websites only have 48 hours to remove content once they receive a request, which means they won’t be able to verify claims. Especially if the requester is an elected official with the power to start an investigation or prosecution, what website would stand up to such a request? </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">The House Must Not Pass This Dangerous Bill</span></b><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Congress should focus on </span><a href="https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/revenge-porn-laws-by-state.html"><span data-contrast="none">enforcing and improving</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> the many existing civil and criminal laws that address NCII, rather than opting for a broad takedown regime that is bound to be abused. Take It Down would likely lead to the use of often-inaccurate automated filters that are infamous for </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/automated-copyright-filter-cant-detect-infringement-or-irony"><span data-contrast="none">flagging legal content</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, from fair-use commentary to news reporting. It will threaten encrypted services, which may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting victims of NCII is a legitimate goal. But good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy. Tell your Member of Congress to oppose censorship and to oppose H.R.633.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}"> </span></p>
