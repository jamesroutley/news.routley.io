    <h1>Critical vulnerability in the Matrix IRC bridge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We&#39;ve released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It&#39;s advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.</p><p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.</p><p>Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.</p><p>If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.</p><p>The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">on Github</a>.</p><p>The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.</p><p>The vulnerabilities are tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4</a> and
