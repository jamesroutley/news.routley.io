<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project (<a href="http://www.dosbox.com" rel="nofollow">www.dosbox.com</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more. Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compared with DOSBox, DOSBox-X focuses more on general emulation and accuracy. In order to help running DOS games and applications, Windows 3.x/9x/ME, as well as for the purpose of historical preservation, testing and continued DOS developments, it is our desire to implement accurate emulation, accurate enough to <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/newdosdevelopment.html" rel="nofollow">help make new DOS developments possible</a> with confidence the program will run properly on actual DOS systems. DOSBox-X includes various features for different purposes (some of them ported from other projects), which are implemented as incremental changes since it was forked from DOSBox SVN Daum. DOSBox-X provides many ways to tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine, as we believe a better way to emulate the DOS platform is to give users all the options they need to emulate everything from the original IBM PC system all the way up to late 1990&#39;s configuration, whatever it takes to get your game or software package to run. Our goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based system scenarios, including peripherals, motherboards, CPUs, and all manner of hardware that was made for PC hardware of that time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please check out the <a href="https://dosbox-x.com" rel="nofollow">DOSBox-X homepage</a> for common packages of the latest release for the supported platforms, as well as screenshots of some DOS programs and games running in DOSBox-X.

<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator, so all major host operating systems are officially supported, including:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Windows (XP or higher), 32-bit and 64-bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Linux (with X11), 32-bit and 64-bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">macOS (Mac OS X), Intel and ARM-based 64-bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">DOS (MS-DOS 5.0+ or compatible)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Windows binaries (both 32-bit and 64-bit), Linux Flatpak or RPM packages (64-bit), macOS packages (64-bit) and DOS versions are officially released periodically, typically on the last day of a month or the first day of the next month. Please check out the <a href="https://dosbox-x.com" rel="nofollow">DOSBox-X homepage</a> and the <a href="http://harihareswara.net/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL</a> page for the latest DOSBox-X packages on these platforms and further installation instructions. You can also find ZIP packages or Windows installers for all released versions and their change logs in the <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases">Releases</a> page. The Window installers are intended to ease the installation process, and they allow you to start DOSBox-X as soon as the installation ends.</p>
<p dir="auto">For running DOSBox-X in a real DOS system (MS-DOS or compatible), you can find the HX-DOS package that makes use of the freely-available <a href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/HX">HX DOS Extender</a>. Type DOSBOX-X to run it from a DOS system. There is also the DOS LOADLIN package which can run from within DOSBox-X itself in addition to a DOS system. Note, however, that not all features of DOSBox-X that are supported in other platforms can be supported in the real DOS environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Development (preview) builds intended for testing purposes for various platforms are also available from the <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/devel-build.html" rel="nofollow">DOSBox-X Development Builds</a> page.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full source code is officially provided with each DOSBox-X release, which may be compiled to run on the above and possibly other operating systems too. You can also get the latest development source code from the repository directly. See also the <a href="http://harihareswara.net/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/BUILD.md">BUILD</a> page for information on building/compiling the DOSBox-X source code.</p>

<p dir="auto">With the eventual goal of being a complete DOS emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 3.x/9x based hardware scenarios, we are making efforts to ensure that the vast majority of DOS games and applications will run in DOSBox-X, and these include both text-mode and graphical-mode DOS programs. Microsoft Windows versions that are largely DOS-based (such as Windows 3.x and 9x) are officially supported by DOSBox-X as well. Note that certain config settings may need to be changed from the default ones for some of these programs to work smoothly. Take a look at the <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/wiki" rel="nofollow">DOSBox-X Wiki</a> for more information.</p>
<p dir="auto">Efforts are also made to aid <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/newdosdevelopment.html" rel="nofollow">continued DOS developments</a> by attempting to accurately emulate the hardware, which is why DOSBox-X used to focus on the demoscene software (especially anything prior to 1996) because that era of the MS-DOS scene tends to have all manner of weird hardware tricks, bugs, and speed-sensitive issues that make them the perfect kind of stuff to test emulation accuracy against, even more so than old DOS games. But without a doubt we are also making a lot of efforts to test DOSBox-X against other DOS games and applications, as well as PC-98 programs (most of them are games).</p>
<p dir="auto">We add new features and make other improvements in every new DOSBox-X version, so its compatibility with DOS programs and games are also improving over time. If you have some issue with a specific DOS program or game, please feel free to post it in the <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We encourage new contributors by removing barriers to entry.
Ideas and patches are always welcome, though not necessarily accepted.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you really need that feature or change, and your changes are not
accepted into this main project (or you just want to mess around with
the code), feel free to fork this project and make your changes in
your fork.</p>

<p dir="auto">In order to make DOSBox-X&#39;s development process more smooth, we have implemented a general development/release pattern for DOSBox-X. The current release pattern for DOSBox-X is as follows:</p>
<p dir="auto">New DOSBox-X versions are made public at the start (typically on the first day) of each month, including the source code and binary releases. Then the DOSBox-X developments will be re-opened for new features, pull requests, etc. There will be no new features added 6 days before the end of the month, but only bug fixes. The last day of the month is DOSBox-X’s build day to compile for binary releases the first of the next month, so there will be no source code changes on this day including pull requests or bug fixes.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X cannot claim to be a &#34;secure&#34; application. It contains a lot of
code designed for performance, not security. There may be vulnerabilities,
bugs, and flaws in the emulation that could permit malicious DOS executables
within to cause problems or exploit bugs in the emulator to cause harm.
There is no guarantee of complete containment by DOSBox-X of the guest
operating system or application.</p>
<p dir="auto">If security is a priority, then:</p>
<p dir="auto">Do not use DOSBox-X on a secure system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do not run DOSBox-X as root or Administrator.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need to use DOSBox-X, run it under a lesser privileged user, in
a chroot jail or sandbox, or enable DOSBox-X&#39;s secure mode with its
command-line option <code>-securemode</code>, which disables commands that may
allow access to the host system.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your Linux distribution has it enabled, consider using the auditing
system to limit what the DOSBox-X executable is allowed to do.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X aims to be a fully-featured DOS emulation package, but there are
some things the design as implemented now cannot accommodate.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Pentium 4 or higher CPU level emulation.</p>
<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X contains code only to emulate the 8086 through the Pentium III.
Real DOS systems (MS-DOS and compatibles) also work best with these CPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">If Pentium 4 or higher emulation is desired, consider using a PC
emulator like Bochs or QEMU instead. DOSBox-X may eventually develop
Pentium 4 emulation, if wanted by the DOSBox-X community in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Emulation of PC hardware 2001 or later.</p>
<p dir="auto">The official cutoff for DOSBox-X is 2001, when updated &#34;PC 2001&#34;
specifications from Microsoft mandated the removal of the ISA slots
from motherboards. The focus is on implementing hardware emulation
for hardware made before that point.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contributors are free to focus on emulating hardware within the
time frame between 1980 and 2000/2001 of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Windows guest emulation, Windows Vista or later.</p>
<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X emulation, in terms of running Windows in DOSBox-X, will
focus primarily on Windows 1.0 through Windows ME (Millennium Edition),
and then on Windows NT through Windows XP. Windows Vista and later
versions are not a priority and will not be considered at this time.
These versions of Windows are not based on DOS.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need to run Windows XP and later, please consider using
QEMU, Bochs, VirtualBox, or VMware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Any MS-DOS system other than IBM PC/XT/AT, AX, Tandy, PCjr, and PC-98.</p>
<p dir="auto">Only the above listed systems will be considered for development
in DOSBox-X. This restriction prevents stretching of the codebase
to an unmanageable level and helps keep the code base organized.</p>
<p dir="auto">It would be easier on myself and the open source community if
developers could focus on emulating their platform of interest in
parallel instead of putting everything into one project that,
most likely, will do a worse job overall emulating all platforms.
However, if adding emulation of the system requires only small
minimal changes, then the new system in question may be considered.</p>
<p dir="auto">You are strongly encouraged to fork this project and implement
your own variation if you need to develop MS-DOS emulation for
any other system or console. In doing that, you gain the complete
freedom to focus on implementing the particular MS-DOS based
system of interest, and if desired, the ability to strip away
conflicting IBM PC/XT/AT emulation and unnecessary code to keep
your branch&#39;s code manageable and maintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are starting a fork, feel free to let me know where your
fork is and what system it is emulating, so I can list it in
this README file for others seeking emulation of that system. To
help, I have added machine and video mode enumerations as &#34;stubs&#34;
to provide a starting point for your branch&#39;s implementation of
the platform. A stub implemented so far is &#34;FM Towns emulation&#34;
(<code>machine=fm_towns</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Cycle-accurate timing of x86 instructions and execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instructions generally run one per cycle in DOSBox-X, except for I/O
and memory access.</p>
<p dir="auto">If accurate emulation of cycles per instruction is needed, please
consider using PCem, 86Box, or VARCem instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Full precision floating point emulation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unless using the dynamic core, DOSBox and DOSBox-X emulate the FPU
registers using the &#34;double&#34; 64-bit floating point data type.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Intel FPU registers are 80-bit &#34;extended precision&#34; floating point
values, not 64-bit double precision, so this is effectively 12 bits of
precision loss and 5 bits of range loss (64 to 53 mantissa bits and 16
to 11 exponent bits). This slight loss of precision is perfectly fine
considering DOSBox&#39;s original goal in supporting DOS games, but may
cause problems in other cases that need the full precision.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is known at this time that this lack of precision is enough to
cause otherwise straightforward comparisons against integers to
fail in DOS applications originally written in QBasic or Turbo Basic.
There are such DOS games written that check their file size using
a floating point compare that will fail in this manner. To run these
games, you will need to disable FPU emulation (<code>fpu=false</code>) to force
the QBasic/TurboBasic runtime to use software emulation instead.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X started as a fork of the original DOSBox project sometime
in mid-2011. It was started out of a desire to improve the emulator
without having to fight with or worry about submitting patches
upstream.</p>
<p dir="auto">As its developers have made it clear, DOSBox&#39;s main focus is on
DOS games. This is evident by the fact that much of the code is
somewhat accurate code with kludges to make DOS games run,
instead of focusing on the actual behaviors of real DOS systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jonathan Campbell, the DOSBox-X project maintainer wanted to make
various changes to the source code, but many of them were non-game
related, and thus were unlikely to be accepted by the DOSBox developers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since then, Jonathan Campbell has been modifying the source code over
time to improve emulation, fix bugs, and resolve incompatibilities
with Windows 95 through ME. He has added options so that DOSBox-X
by default can emulate a wider variety of configurations more
accurately, while allowing the user to enable various techniques or
hacks if needed to run their favorite DOS games or programs. He has
also been cleaning up and organizing the code to improve stability
and portability where possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">The original DOSBox project was not written by one programmer. It
has been under development since late 2000 with patches, fixes,
and improvements from members all over the Vogons forums. Despite
not having a major official release since DOSBox 0.74 over 10
years ago, the project is still in semi-active development today
in the form of DOSBox SVN. Meanwhile, some of the changes themselves
incorporated code from other projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some features and improvements in DOSBox-X also came from another
branch of DOSBox known as <a href="http://ykhwong.x-y.net" rel="nofollow">DOSBox SVN Daum</a>
which itself incorporated features from the original DOSBox
project, DOSBox-X, and many experimental patches. Although the
Daum branch seems to be dead, the features borrowed from it still
exists in DOSBox-X. Later on, DOSBox-X also incorporated several
features and improvements from other projects such as <a href="https://dosboxece.yesterplay.net/" rel="nofollow">DOSBox ECE</a>,
<a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/" rel="nofollow">DOSBox Staging</a>, <a href="http://radioc.web.fc2.com/soflib/dosvax/dosvax.htm" rel="nofollow">DOSVAX</a>/<a href="https://www.nanshiki.co.jp/software/dosvaxj3.html" rel="nofollow">DOSVAXJ3</a>, and <a href="http://www.vdosplus.org/" rel="nofollow">vDosPlus</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DOSBox-X project is also helped by its other developers and
contributors such as Wengier, aybe, Allofich, and rderooy, who have
done significant work to improve the DOSBox-X project, including
adding new features, fixing bugs, creating the documentation,
maintaining the website, and porting code from other projects.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOSBox-X displays English as the default language, and uses the U.S. code page (437) by default, just like DOSBox.</p>
<p dir="auto">All messages displayed by DOSBox-X are in English with the default setting. DOSBox-X does support the feature to

<p dir="auto">The fact that DOSBox-X was developed around the U.S. keyboard layout is primarily due to limitations around the SDL1
library which provides input handling. As such when using the SDL1 version and a non-US keyboard, DOSBox-X automatically
uses scancodes with the default setting to work around keyboard layout issues. Scancodes are not needed when using
non-US keyboard layouts in the SDL2 version. If you find that a keyboard layout is not yet supported by DOSBox-X,
in order to add additional layouts for use with DOSBox-X, please see file <a href="http://harihareswara.net/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/README.keyboard-layout-handling">README.keyboard-layout-handling</a>
