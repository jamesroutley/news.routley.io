    <h1>Transcendental Syntax</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note: this project is an experimental proof of concept, not a fully designed
and specified programming language.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The transcendental syntax is a method of constructing logical abstractions from
a low-level elementary and &#34;logic-agnostic&#34; language.</p>
<p dir="auto">This elementary language we use to build abstractions is called
&#34;stellar resolution&#34; and its elementary objects corresponding to programs are
called &#34;constellations&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those constellations are used in a higher-level language called &#34;Stellogen&#34; in
which notions such as proofs and formulas are defined (this is basically a
metaprogramming language for constellations). By the proof-as-program
correspondence, this can be extended to programs and types.</p>

<p dir="auto">The stellar resolution (RS) is a model of computation introduced by Jean-Yves
Girard [1] in his transcendental syntax project as a basis for the study of the
computational foundations of logic. It has been mainly developed by Eng later
in his PhD thesis [2].</p>
<p dir="auto">It can be understood from several points of view:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>it is a logic-agnostic, asynchronous and very general version of Robinson&#39;s
first-order resolution with disjunctive clauses, which is used in logic
programming;</li>
<li>it is a very elementary logic-agnostic constraint programming language;</li>
<li>it is a non-planar generalization of Wang tiles (or LEGO bricks) using terms
instead of colours and term unification instead of colour matching;</li>
<li>it is a model of interactive agents behaving like molecules which interact
with each other. It can be seen as a generalization of Jonoska&#39;s flexible
tiles used in DNA computing;</li>
<li>it is an assembly language for meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Stellar resolution is very elementary and an interpreter for it can be written
in a very concise way since it mostly relies on a unification algorithm.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project is still in development, hence the syntax and features are still
changing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <a href="https://tsguide.refl.fr/" rel="nofollow">https://tsguide.refl.fr/</a> (guide currently in French only) to learn more
about how to play with the current implementation of transcendental syntax.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can either download a <a href="https://github.com/engboris/large-star-collider/releases">released binary</a>
(or ask for a binary) or build the program from sources.</p>

<p dir="auto">Install <code>opam</code> and OCaml from <code>opam</code> : <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml" rel="nofollow">https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Install <code>dune</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Install dependencies</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="opam install . --deps-only"><pre><code>opam install . --deps-only
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Build the project</p>

<p dir="auto">Executables are in <code>_build/default/bin/</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Assume the executable is named <code>sgen.exe</code>. Interpreter Stellogen programs with:</p>

<p dir="auto">or if you use Dune:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="dune exec sgen -- &lt;inputfile&gt;"><pre><code>dune exec sgen -- &lt;inputfile&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Some example files with the <code>.sg</code> extension in <code>/examples</code> are ready to be
executed. In Eng&#39;s thesis, ways to work with other models of computation are
described (Turing machines, pushdown automata, transducers, alternating
automata etc).</p>
