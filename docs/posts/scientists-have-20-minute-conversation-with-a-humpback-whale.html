    <h1>Scientists have 20-minute &#34;conversation&#34; with a humpback whale</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an unprecedented encounter, a research team successfully engaged in a “conversation” with a humpback whale named Twain. </p><p>The team, known as Whale-SETI, has been conducting research on <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humpback-whale-reproduction-is-linked-to-krill-abundance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humpback whale</a> communication systems, aiming to develop intelligence filters for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Scientists from the <a href="https://www.seti.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SETI Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of California Davis</a>, and the <a href="https://www.alaskawhalefoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alaska Whale Foundation</a> made this amazing breakthrough in the field of non-human intelligence. </p><h2 id="h-how-to-have-a-conversation-with-a-whale">How to have a conversation with a whale</h2><p>Using a recorded humpback “contact” call played into the sea through an underwater speaker, the scientists were amazed as Twain approached and circled their boat, responding in a conversational manner to the whale’s “greeting signal.” </p><p>Throughout the 20-minute exchange, Twain consistently matched the interval variations between each playback call. </p><p>The details of this extraordinary encounter can be found in the recent issue of the <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/16349/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journal Peer J</a>, titled “Interactive Bioacoustic Playback as a Tool for Detecting and Exploring Nonhuman Intelligence: ‘Conversing’ with an Alaskan Humpback Whale.”</p><p>Lead author Dr. Brenda McCowan of U.C. Davis explains the significance of this whale conversation, stating, “We believe this is the first such communicative exchange between humans and <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humpback-whales-sing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humpback whales</a> in the humpback ‘language.&#39;” </p><p>Dr. Fred Sharpe of the Alaska Whale Foundation further emphasizes the intelligence of humpback whales, highlighting their abilities to engage in complex social systems, create tools such as nets made of bubbles to catch fish, and extensively communicate through songs and social calls.</p><h2 id="h-whales-and-extraterrestrial-intelligence">Whales and extraterrestrial intelligence</h2><p>The behavior observed in humpback whales supports an important assumption in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Dr. Laurance Doyle of the SETI Institute is another coauthor of the paper. </p><p>He explains, “Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrials will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers. This important assumption is certainly supported by the behavior of <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humpback-whales-fail-to-respond-to-vessel-noise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humpback whales</a>.”</p><p>Drawing parallels to studying Antarctica as a proxy for Mars, the Whale-SETI team is utilizing their findings from the study of intelligent, terrestrial, non-human communication systems to develop filters that can be applied to any potential extraterrestrial signals received.</p><h2 id="h-implications-and-future-research">Implications and future research</h2><p>The team will be employing the mathematics of information theory to quantify the communicative complexity, such as the rule structure embedded in a received message.</p><p>In addition to the lead researchers, Dr. Josie Hubbard, Lisa Walker, and Jodi Frediani, who specialize in animal intelligence, humpback whale song analysis, and photography and behavior of <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humpback-whales-travel-thousands-of-miles-to-mate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humpback whales</a>, respectively, are also coauthors of the paper.</p><p>The Whale-SETI team is currently preparing a second paper on the non-audio communicative behavior of humpback whales, specifically focusing on bubble rings made in the presence of (and possibly for) humans. </p><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/our-priorities/diverse-intelligences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Templeton Foundation Diverse Intelligences Program</a> for their generous financial support in conducting this groundbreaking research.</p><h2 id="h-more-about-whale-seti">More about Whale-SETI</h2><p>As discussed above, Whale-SETI, short for Whale Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, marks a revolutionary stride in understanding marine mammals, particularly whales. </p><p>This project blends the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with marine biology, aiming to decode whale communication. It operates under the hypothesis that whale sounds contain complex, intelligent messages akin to languages used by humans or potentially, extraterrestrial beings.</p><h3 id="h-technology-and-methodology-of-the-whale-conversation">Technology and methodology of the whale conversation</h3><p>At the core of Whale-SETI is advanced technology. Researchers use sophisticated hydrophones and AI algorithms to record and analyze whale sounds. </p><p>The AI, trained on vast datasets of whale calls and human languages, seeks patterns and structures that could indicate language-like characteristics. </p><p>This method not only helps in deciphering the complexity of whale communication but also enhances our understanding of language development in intelligent species.</p><h3 id="h-discoveries-and-insights">Discoveries and insights</h3><p>Whale-SETI has already made significant discoveries. Researchers have identified certain repetitive patterns and variations in whale songs that suggest a level of intentional communication. </p><p>These patterns vary among different whale species, indicating distinct ‘dialects’ or ‘languages.’ </p><p>This finding challenges our understanding of non-human intelligence and communication, opening new avenues in both marine biology and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p><h3 id="h-whale-conversation-implications-for-the-future">Whale conversation implications for the future</h3><p>The implications of Whale-SETI are vast. It not only enriches our understanding of marine life but also provides insights into the evolution of communication and intelligence. </p><p>By studying the complexities of whale communication, scientists hope to develop better strategies for marine conservation. </p><p>Additionally, the project offers a unique perspective in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, suggesting that understanding non-human communication on Earth could be key to recognizing and interpreting signals from other intelligent life forms in the universe.</p><p>In summary, Whale-SETI stands as a beacon of interdisciplinary research, merging marine biology with linguistics and astrobiology. Its approach to understanding whale communication opens up a new frontier in the study of intelligent life, both on Earth and beyond. </p><p>This project not only deepens our connection with the marine world but also expands the horizons of our search for intelligence in the cosmos.</p><p>—–</p><p>Like what you read? <a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe to our newsletter</a> for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.</p><p>Check us out on <a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EarthSnap</a>, a free app brought to you by <a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Ralls</a> and <a href="https://www.earth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth.com</a>. </p><p>—–</p></div></div>
