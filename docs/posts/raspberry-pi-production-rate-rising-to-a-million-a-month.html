    <h1>Raspberry Pi production rate rising to a million a month</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Raspberry Pi boss Eben Upton says the micro manufacturer&#39;s ovens will crank out a million units in July, after years of supply issues restraining sales.</p>
<p>In a newsletter article spotted by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-ceo-million-unit-months-are-ahead">Tom&#39;s Hardware</a>, Upton said the fruiterer shipped 800,000 units in Q1 of 2023 – its worst result since 2015 and a number that buyers usually acquire in a single month.</p>
<p>Upton wrote that he is now seeing a &#34;rapid recovery in silicon supply&#34; – a recovery he attributed to &#34;Sony&#39;s willingness to stockpile the non-silicon elements&#34; required to build out single board computers (SBCs) which are Raspberry Pi&#39;s mainstay.</p>

    

<p>The biz shifted around 600,000 units this May, expects to produce 800,000 in June and will hit the million units mark in July. Upton said production levels will remain there &#34;for as long as necessary&#34; to clear remaining back orders and return to easy availability.</p>

        


        

<p>Upton also expressed confidence that Pi shortages are in the past, and 2023 will be the &#34;strongest ever year&#34; for the SBCs and modules.</p>
<p>The CEO has been predicting that supply chains would improve in Q2 since at least <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-update-its-good-news/">December last year</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>While Pis are again being produced in high numbers, increased component costs – as expected during a supply chain crisis – have led to price rises for the models including the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4, the Compute Module 4, and the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
<p>In a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_aL9V0JsQQ">interview</a> with YouTuber Jeff Geerling, Upton seemed content with the supply situation. He also revealed that the business decided not to float the price of its products and &#34;let capitalism take care of it&#34; as component prices moved in recent years – despite the amount of money that could have been made.</p>

        

<p>&#34;I think that would&#39;ve been a horrible betrayal of trust,&#34; said the CEO, though it would have left Raspberry Pi able to &#34;swim in the profits.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh my god, the amount of money that we could have made and if we&#39;d floated the price of the products.&#34;</p>
<p>That&#39;s a reference to the COVID-caused crimps on supply chain inputs ranging from chips to ships. Many tech vendors did hike prices as the cost of their inputs grew. The boot&#39;s on the other foot now, as supply chains are moving fast once more but demand has dived, leading companies like HP to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/31/aggressive_pc_discounts_might_not/">discount aggressively</a> and PC-makers like Lenovo <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/24/lenovo_q4_2023_profit_sales_crash/">experience</a> 75 percent profit declines.</p>

        

<p>Upton told Geerling that Raspberry Pi users tend to horde their machines, keeping several in the back cabinet for a rainy day.</p>
<p>&#34;People can survive a transient shortage, just as a company might … by having some buffer of supplies and inbound componentry. So a hobbyist can survive for a period of time by using the Raspberry Pis they already have,&#34; opined Upton. ®</p>
