<p><strong>Kingfishers</strong> have been regular visitors for a few months now and they remained near-daily for the first half of October before becoming harder to see. <strong>Sparrowhawks</strong> are being seen most days, usually causing a commotion amongst the local gulls and crows.</p>
<p>Flyover highlights of October were a <strong>Red Kite</strong> on the 10<sup>th</sup> and several sightings of<strong> jackdaws</strong>, usually as a pair which may have been the same birds spending some time locally. <strong>Meadow pipits</strong> in small numbers passed over throughout the month.</p>

          <div><p>October 9<sup>th</sup> was a big day for <strong>redwing (above)</strong> migration in London with some sites having thousands of birds passing over. Here we had around seventy flying over in a few flocks. From that day on it was possible to see a few birds in the trees around the site, especially the mature oaks. The situation with <strong>fieldfare (below)</strong> was similar, with small numbers passing over and then the odd bird being seen subsequently in trees.</p></div>

          <div><div><p><strong>Goldcrest</strong> numbers are often at their highest of the year in October and this year was no exception. A <strong>coal tit</strong> has been seen regularly on the feeders along the woodland trail. <strong>Chiffchaff</strong> numbers are still high, though they often drop once we start to get a few frosts. We are still getting the occasional <strong>blackcap</strong> too.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in October 2023 was 54, a shockingly low total considering we have had an October average of 65 in recent years. Likely contributing factors were the high water levels throughout the month and a mixture of weather-related reasons which meant that some of the winter birds haven’t arrived yet. </p>
