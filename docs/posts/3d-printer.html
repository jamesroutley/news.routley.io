<p>Not sure how degradeable these are, but they are softer, and can be used to make more flexible models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TPU</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nylon</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>cleaning filament (cleans nozzles)</li>
<li>wood filament</li>
<li>transparent</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder: are there filaments that are made to be printed more like spaghetti? I know this is traditionally something to be avoided, but I can’t help but think that by relying on the strength of the extrusion itself and a very sparse number of intersections, very lightweight but still relatively strong prints could still be made. The material would have a huge effect on the rigidity of these types of prints. However, softer, more flexible materials like nylon would have an interesting effect as well!</p>
<p>Maybe this is possible using a certain infill setting that prints the sparsest possible result.</p>

<p>Use a 3D modeling program like blender to create a model, then export it as an STL or a 3MF</p>
<blockquote data-callout="filetype">

<p>STL’s are more universal, but 3MF’s allow for the encoding of color data. The A1 has a type of nozzle (or maybe it’s a different kind of attachment?) that allows the printer to switch between up to 4 different colors. As it is now, it is possible to pause the print job and manually switch out colors, which doesn’t require color encoding in the file, but for the automatic color switching, a 3MF is necessary. There are <em>also</em> 3D printers out there that can <em>mix</em> colors, creating gradients, but this one does nont do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OR go to a 3D model marketplace and download a free or paid model for use. Kaylyn noted that you can usually drop these into a 3D modeling software and modify them if you would like.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-load-model-into-slicer">Step Two: Load model into slicer<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#step-two-load-model-into-slicer"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Next, open your model in the the Bambu <code>slicer</code>, a program that takes STL or 3MF files and does a variety of treatments to them to allow them to be printed. I guess it’s called a slicer because the form a 3D model’s data has to be printed in is a series of layers stacked on top of one of each other? Each coordinate it prints in each layer <em>may</em> is then translated into <code>GCODE</code>, - the actual language that commands are sent to the printer in.</p>

<p>Slicer’s have many features to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>brim</strong> - an artificially added excess around the base of a model that helps with plate adhesion</li>
<li><strong>raft</strong> - similar to a brim, but not just on the edge</li>
<li>supports/stilts - necessary to add for floating pieces, something to avoid if possible</li>
<li><strong>infill</strong> - the inside of a model is not solid but rather a partial fill of material, in a waffle design, hexagons, or a huge variety of other patterns, in order to both save material and print faster</li>
<li><strong>ironing</strong> - there is a way that a lower-flow or even 0% flow passover of the nozzle can sort of melt the top surface of a model to be smoother</li>
</ul>
<p>The tool in the slicer that was most useful for me was the <code>Cut</code> tool, which allowed me to cut the bottom of the model off to get a more even surface like this:</p>


<p>Check the 3D printer - is there filament threaded into the head?
Is there an existing model on the plate?
Has the plate been put on correctly?
Has the residue from the filament test been cleared from the last test?
Are there any errors on the monitor, or any weird business in general?
Are there any objects in the way that might get in the way of the movement of the printer, or that could spill?
Is any extra filament from messed up prints out of the way?</p>

<p>The plate can be easy to miss - here’s an instructional video for taking it on and off that may come in handy whether you are prepping or finishing up your print job</p>

<p>This little surfboard I printed took about 15 minutes, the octopus in the video at the top of this article took about an 88 minutes. The A1 has a webcam that shows the progress, so you can leave the premise and monitor it remotely.<img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/4f8759e281cf89ad22cc7f08f4b368a2.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Kaylyn showed me that the best way to get a  model off of the plate was to remove the plate itself. The plate on the A1 is connected magnetically, so it can be popped off. Kaylyn instructed me to wave the plate like a fan, cooling it off. Once it was cool, it was pretty easy to peel the model of! And voilé, you just printed your first model.</p>

Blender is an incredible open source and free piece of software (maybe the most impressive free software that exists, period), but it is also an absolute <em>beast</em>. The collective wisdom seemed to be this; if you have the time, it is worth learning Blender, because it’s free, it’s the standard of multiple industries (game dev 3D models, animation rigging, animation rendering, computer generated images), and there’s nothing it can do that another 3D modeling software can do better.</p>
<p>That said, it is difficult to learn without a teacher. I have experience using Autodesk Maya, Unity, and Sketchup and it’s <em>stillI</em> downright intimidating to me. There are things that transfer, but other things are completely different. I am lucky enough to be surrounded by blender aficionados and wrote up some quickstart notes below from graphics whizkid <a href="https://www.seamusedson.net/">Seamus Edson<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> that were incredibly helpful to me below, in the <code>Blender</code> section of this article.</p>
<p>There are a gazillion programs that can export STLs and are probably more beginning friendly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openscad</li>
<li>Sketchup</li>
<li>TextEdit (jk. I mean technically you could hardcode an STL.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The results of my first project are in! I was able to print a mess of surfboard earrings for a friends. I’ve ordered some earring hooks and have some acrylic paint at home to experiment with. It took me several iterations, but I got the model pretty close to what I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/6a2997cea894790b0979e79d34aaf23a.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>I found that although the subdivision modification in blender makes things smooth and organic, it can wreak havoc on smaller details, reducing them to meaningless nubs.</p>
<p>In the future, I’d really like to learn about creating prints that have 3D parts like ball-joint sockets, or snap-fits. It’s an amazingly fun feeling to be able to conjure up these shapes out of their original forms as pixels on screens!</p>

<p>I ordered some earring fixtures on amazon, dug up my acrylic paint, and got to work. Here’s what I made:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/3d403ccb73e8e10115cc21edb357b0a8.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>

<p>The mess that came with it:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/8b72b2cecbf744df3f483e765f8d1f21.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>At some point I wanted to create something geometrically louder, edgier (too on the nose?) and came up with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/cc840d12e97651f84de91d6edd35e52b.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>There was something about keeping with this basic, boxy geometry that was really fun. It actually inspired me to download a voxel editor <code>Goxel</code> and mess around a bit. Turns out <code>Goxel</code> can export <code>OBJ</code> files, which can be read by a 3D printer in addition to a <code>3MF</code> or <code>STL</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/b94614c59da6b2f43d5f1764c0fe2ae7.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>One advantage to voxel editor’s over a full-blown 3D workspace like Blender is that they are much more beginner friendly.</p>
<p>I made some creatures out of voxels that got me excited, but in order to easily create bodies for them, I felt it would be helpful to have some components that snap together. I haven’t yet looked into this too much, so my plan was simply to print things at a few different scales and see if they would click together / how they would interact.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/445eb43d1a0fdeccb4b93ff7d0d662a1.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The only ones that ended up clicking were 130% scale with 95% scale. So a positive piece roughly 2/3rds of the volume of a negative cavity will click! Now that I have this IRL observation, I will probably be more proactive and seek out the science and math that explains this, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-wlody/">Sam Wlody<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>suggested, rather than waste precious filament.</p>

<p>Bozz doesn’t actually have any web presence so I just linked a famous musician with the same name instead since he likes music.</p>
<p>Command + <code>,</code> to open settings.
change keybindings so that <code>space</code> isn’t <code>play</code> but instead is <code>search</code>
search set <code>curser 3d origin</code></p>
<p>Start with a cube
add loop cuts
command R is loop cut tool
scroll to adjust subdivisions
click to lock in (you get a chance to slide, but don’t)
There is an arrow at the bottom left to see loop cut options
If you want to select your loop agin, hold control and, while in edge mode, click a vertex</p>
<p>Shift A - opens new shape menu
You can use this to create a plane instead of a cube, or many other shapes</p>
<p>symmetry
- open the modifiers menu
- search for <code>mirror</code>, and select an axis to mirror
- You’ll want to delete half of your model that goes over the axis you are mirroring on I think?
- turn on <code>clipping</code> - once points are ON the axis, you can’t make them leave
- turn on <code>merge</code> if you take a point and move it close, merge it like a finger to a mirror (don’t mirror negative coords on that axis)</p>
<p>Other modifers</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>solidy</code> modifier allows the plane to have dimensionality without having to work with the complexity of a 3D model</li>
<li>The <code>subdivision</code> modifier smooths everything out (but while still allowing a simple base mesh to remain editable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Object mode vs. edit mode</p>
<ul>
<li>use tab to switch between these - object mode is for adding modifers to objects, adding them, deleting them, moving the entire object, etc</li>
<li>edit mode is more for changing specific properties of an object: for me this mostly means changing the mesh</li>
</ul>
<p>point / vertex / face mode</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a subset of modes that are part of the edit mode</li>
<li>By default, I think you can switch between them with the 1, 2, and 3 keys</li>
<li>But Russwel Boswell changed my configuration to use the virtual numpad, so now I can’t!</li>
<li>Which is okay, because they also have 3 buttons to switch between them in the UI on the top left</li>
</ul>
<p>Selection</p>
<ul>
<li>w is normal select</li>
<li>b changes to box select</li>
<li>c is circle select</li>
<li>On mac, holding down shift and holding down a right click allows for lasso select</li>
</ul>
<p>numpad emulation</p>
<ul>
<li>mostly nice because you can switch between lots of views using the numbers very easily</li>
</ul>
<p>deletion</p>
<ul>
<li>x</li>
<li>different in object and edit mode</li>
</ul>
<p>proportional editing</p>
<ul>
<li>really crazy circle button thing in the top-middle right-ish - if clicked, you can make more organic changes in edit mode because things are changed depending on their distance from your change, like a splash effect, rather than truly only editing vertices/faces/points in isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>blender scripting API</p>
<ul>
<li>Not going to dive into this now but Blender is totally scriptable with python</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah! My faces detached!</p>
<ul>
<li>apparently the key <code>v</code> “rips” things off of other things. Not great! So these faces won’t be displaced, but when you try to move them, they won’t be attached to their neighbors anymore. To fix this,
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are edit mode</li>
<li>Select everything on your current continguous model by pressing one part of it then pressing <code>L</code> - you could also just try to select everything you thing is relevant about your issue</li>
<li>Press the <code>mesh</code> dropdown menu, and find <code>merge by distance</code>. I think you might need to press enter, or apply or something.</li>
</ul>
