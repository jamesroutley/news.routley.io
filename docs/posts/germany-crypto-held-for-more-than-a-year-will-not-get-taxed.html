On Tuesday, Germany&#39;s Federal Ministry of Finance released its first <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/BMF_Schreiben/Steuerarten/Einkommensteuer/2022-05-09-einzelfragen-zur-ertragsteuerrechtlichen-behandlung-von-virtuellen-waehrungen-und-von-sonstigen-token.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>guidelines for framing the taxation of cryptocurrencies [PDF]</strong></u></a>, confirming the country&#39;s interest in developing digital assets.</span></p><p id="viewer-edhhu"><span>In particular, the 24-page document explores <strong>how cryptocurrencies are taxed</strong>. The most crucial point mentions the tax exemption for cryptocurrency gains held for more than a year by an individual, including <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.vanticatrading.com/post/should-there-be-a-tax-on-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><u>staking and lending</u></strong></a>.</span></p><p id="viewer-77jsk"><span>Until now, if germans wanted to get the tax exemption on their crypto, they had to wait ten years. This figure is now reduced to just one year, thus aligning with Section 23 of the German Income Tax Act, which states that if the period between the acquisition and sale of an asset is longer than one year, then the amount of the gains is tax-free.</span></p><p id="viewer-amdu1"><span>The document, which also mentions <strong>mining, hard forks, and airdrops</strong>, remains subject to change. However, according to the department:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-anc34"><span>&#34;The federal Department of Finance will continue to address income tax issues related to virtual currencies and other tokens in close coordination with the highest federal-state financial authorities and with input from associations.&#34;</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-a77em"><span><strong>Germany, the number one crypto-friendly country</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-9jj1b"><span>According to a ranking by Coincub, Germany now sits in 1st place in terms of <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://coincub.com/crypto-ranking-guide-for-2022-q1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>crypto-friendly countries</strong></u></a>, taking over from Singapore. At issue is the country&#39;s institutional position placing cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment vehicle for savers, including a tax system that was already far more welcoming than most other countries.</span></p><p id="viewer-5bi44"><span>Additionally, Germany has 1,430 <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.vanticatrading.com/post/what-is-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Bitcoin</strong></u></a> nodes, representing 9.08% of the total global nodes, putting it in second place in nodes held just behind the United States and ahead of France, with only 3.35%.</span></p><p id="viewer-2u3ti"><span>Last month, <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://commerzbank.com/en/hauptnavigation/home/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Commerzbank</strong></u></a>, Germany&#39;s second-largest bank, applied for a <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/banken-finanzen/commerzbank-beantragt-krypto-verwahrlizenz-303b9c3a-bbeb-11ec-8e62-5f7cf1d225cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>license to offer cryptocurrencies</strong></u></a> to its customers.
