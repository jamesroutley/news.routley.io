    <p>Dear friends,</p>

<p><a href="https://yoonandrew.bandcamp.com/album/the-complete-bach-cello-suites-on-melodica">The Complete Bach Cello Suites on Melodica</a> comes out June 3! My hobby has officially gotten out hand. Over the last couple years I’ve been learning to push this funny instrument far beyond anything I imagined it could do, to the point where I daresay it sounds…good? It’s been an incredible joy learning these timeless classics in a context that insists on playful invention, and I’m so so excited to share it with you!</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://yoonandrew.bandcamp.com/album/the-complete-bach-cello-suites-on-melodica">buy the pre-release on Bandcamp <strong>today</strong></a> and listen to some select movements. You can also watch me play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga9REaxZR5o">the entire first suite on Youtube here</a>! We recorded video to go along with the entire album; I’ll be releasing the rest over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>And to help kick off the release, on June 3 the <a href="https://mdbq.org">Melodica Drone &amp; Bach Quartet</a> will be playing an absolutely STACKED concert at the <a href="https://stonecircletheatre.org/">Stone Circle Threatre</a> in Ridgewood. We’ll be playing the Bach double concerto, a monstrous organ piece, a new piece by <a href="https://hannahcaisobel.squarespace.com/">Hannah Cai Sobel</a>, and so much more. <a href="https://theticketing.co/e/june03">Early tickets are available now at a discount</a>!</p>
