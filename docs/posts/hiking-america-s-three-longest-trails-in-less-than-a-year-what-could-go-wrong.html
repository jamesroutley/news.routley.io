</div><p>The two meticulously planned their trip, tracing their projected paths along the country’s most difficult terrain. They transformed the ground floor of the Parell family’s New Hampshire cottage into a situation room, taping paper maps to the walls and stockpiling boxes packed with trail provisions. They saved roughly $25,000 from summer jobs, internships and Stanford research projects to fund the trek.</p><p>“At the end of the day, there was a lot that went into this that had nothing to do with our will and desire for it to happen,” said Parell, 21. “A lot of it had to do with the luck and privilege that we’ve been blessed with.”</p><p>In the fall of 2020, they began working out twice a day to build up strength for a journey that would take them more than 7,000 miles, from snowy climes in the Eastern U.S. to desert pathways in the Southwest and lush forests in the Pacific Northwest. <b></b></p><p>The trek, dubbed the Calendar Year Triple Crown, has been conquered by fewer than a dozen people. Potter and Parell set out to be the youngest known hikers to accomplish the feat.</p><p>But on the trail — as in life — things happened.</p><div data-align-center-expanded="" data-click="enhancement">

</div><p>Their days began to take on a familiar rhythm. Waking about 5:45 a.m. and munching on oatmeal or bagels, Parell and Potter would hoist their packs, which weighed more than 20 pounds each, and start walking.</p><p>The pair, who adopted the trail names Woody and Buzz, would cover an average of 27 miles a day, excluding “zero days” when they went off-trail to rest and resupply. Breathtaking views, the kind that command the attention of day hikers, bled together, but Potter and Parell still relished their surroundings.</p><p>“We’ve seen a lot of stuff this year, and our portfolio of views has definitely filled out. The thing is, I think it’s always just so nice to make yourself stop and appreciate a view,” Parell said. “Because we’re moving so much that those few seconds or minutes that you just get to ... take in what’s around usually end up being really special.”</p><p>Each day brought a fresh set of delights, as well as challenges. A cool river could refresh their aching feet and legs, but craggy rocks could threaten a twisted ankle. </p><p>Sometimes they adopted different paces, one hiking a mile or more ahead of the other for part of the day before reuniting at night. A day’s journey would typically not stop until after 8 p.m., when they would set up camp. If they were near a water source, the friends brushed their teeth or took a cold bath before zipping into their tents — one in winter, two in summer. Once tucked in, they plotted the next day’s course, journaled and sent a quick message to their parents on satellite phones: “I’m stopping here xo love you.” <b></b></p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement">

The world I was hearing about and the world I was experiencing seemed too different, too detached to exist simultaneously. </p>

<p>They rerouted from the Appalachian Trail and flew to the warm Southwestern desert on the Continental Divide Trail, which, at its longest point, traverses roughly 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada. The full trail runs through New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana and can be tackled using some shorter, alternate hikes, shaving a few hundred miles off the overall trek, which is “what makes that trail special and unique,” Potter said.</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement">

</div><p>The Continental Divide Trail, with its extreme temperature swings, brought new quirks and challenges. During one stretch in New Mexico, a stray donkey followed the hikers for about 10 miles. At another point, red-and-white spots started spreading up Parell’s arm. Instead of a 150-mile drive in a trail angel’s car to the closest hospital, he opted for the helper’s homemade herb salve. The malady was gone the next day.</p><p>In Colorado, storms followed the two almost daily. Clambering up a mountain near Idaho Springs, Parell recalled seeing dark clouds gathering in the distance. Within 10 minutes, the storm was overhead. Jagged lightning started cutting across the open ridgeline. As the tallest figures on the mountaintop, Potter and Parell knew they had to run for cover.</p><p>“You really have to keep going,” Potter said afterward. “If you try to bail out on one of those side trails or something, you’re probably just going to get yourself into more danger. It was definitely a tough call in the moment whether to keep going or not, but eventually … we just had to get there.”</p><p>Holding tight to their packs, they raced nearly two miles downhill.</p><div data-align-center-expanded="" data-click="enhancement">

In the months before they embarked, the two stocked up on provisions and identified towns with post offices where their families could ship boxes of food to them.</p><p>But almost half of the airtight bags they had stuffed with rice and beans, tortillas and other fare broke, leaving their food covered in mold. It ended up being easier to restock at general stores and groceries along the way, occasionally exchanging calorie-rich trail food for more enjoyable treats.</p><p>Once summer started, they ditched their camp stove. Hot mashed potatoes mixed with cheese and deli meat gave way to protein bars and almond-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. They reverted to cold-soaking their instant potatoes and rice — mixing dehydrated food with water in a bag and letting the sun bake it as they hiked. Parell lost about 30 pounds.</p><p>They tried to stay clean and healthy, stopping as often as they could at laundromats to empty their tattered knapsacks, filled with weeks-old dirty clothing and sleeping bags, into washing machines. They purified water from rivers, ponds and puddles using filters.</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement">

</div><p>“That’s what we’re here for — to be the invisible supporter, to be the brightness in their day,” Whitley said. “It’s just our way of doing the old ‘pay it forward’ — we just never ask for it back.”</p><p>The roles of trail angels vary. Sometimes, they hand out snacks or drop “trail magic” — surprise gifts in the woods. Other times, they drive hikers from one trailhead to another or serve as a backup in case of emergencies. </p><p>Jim Hagan, 59, known on the Pacific Crest Trail as “Legend,” has been helping hikers for decades. He set up camp for a few months at the trail’s southernmost part in Campo, Calif., to encourage hikers. He had just made a big pot of spaghetti when he spotted a weary Parell and Potter approaching. He handed each a beer, and the three sat on picnic tables, swapping trail stories for a while.</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement">

Then, almost before he could think, she skirted around him and headed toward a tree and her waiting babies.

</div><h2 id="the-finish">The finish</h2>
<p>After wrapping up the Appalachian Trail and completing the Continental Divide Trail, Parell and Potter returned to Etna in October to connect the dots on the roughly 40-mile patch of the Pacific Crest Trail the wildfire had forced them to skip. </p><p>In 10 months, the two had walked approximately 7,400 miles. Together, they burned through 26 pairs of shoes crossing 22 states. They<b> </b>developed a deeper sense of self and <a href="https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/potter-and-parell-become-youngest-calendar-year-triple-crowners/" target="_blank">broke a hiking record</a> in the process.</p><p>The friends had one rule they assiduously followed for nearly a year: no talking about the end. The purpose of the trip was the journey, after all.</p><p>In the weeks preceding their final summit, the hazy finish line sharpened into focus, powering their steps. They skipped breakfast and dinner, snacking along the trail rather than stopping in the cold.</p><p>But as the reality of the end approached, their steps slowed until all that remained were 17 short miles.</p><p>Standing on the crest of a mountain road in the middle of Klamath National Forest, Parell’s mother, father and sister waited for the young men to end their long trek in the same misty weather as when they began. Two figures appeared out of the fog. Parell threw up his hands in victory as his family cheered, waving noisy party clappers. Potter pumped his fist.</p><p>The two hikers fell in a heap on their packs, clinked celebratory bottles of Corona beer and hugged. </p><p>Parell and Potter wondered about their next steps — this time, in the civilized world. After 295 days on the trail together, joked Parell’s dad, Jack, “now you know what marriage is like!”</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement">
