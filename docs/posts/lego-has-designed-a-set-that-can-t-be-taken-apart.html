<p>Traditionally, LEGO sets are designed to be assembled and, should you wish, taken apart to allow you to use the pieces for your own creations.</p>
<p>However, the company&#39;s latest release, <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/75313-1">75313</a> AT-AT, has broken from this tradition and some sub-assemblies within it are impossible to dismantle without resorting to using sharp metal implements.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Technic frames introduced in 2009 are versatile elements that help create sturdy models. However, they have to be used with care because it&#39;s possible to connect elements to them in a way that cannot be dismantled.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/element.img.lod5photo.192x192/4539880.jpg" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/element.img.lod5photo.192x192/4539880.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For example, if you were to position one of these...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/element.img.lod5photo.192x192/4234429.jpg" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/element.img.lod5photo.192x192/4234429.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>...inside a frame across the width, then insert two 2l axles through the adjacent holes, it is impossible to get it out again. Designers of Technic sets know this, and I cannot think of one instance where such a problem has arisen in an official set. However, an issue seems to have slipped through the net in <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/75313-1">75313</a> AT-AT.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following, which is part of the walker&#39;s legs. The orange pin is inserted into the end centre hole, then an axle connector is attached to it. No problems so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_4.png" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_4.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then, a green pin connector is positioned in the gap to the left of the axle connector before a 4l axle is pushed through it.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_1.png" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As a result, the assembly cannot be dismantled conventionally: there is only one way to do it. The green pin connector has a slit in it large enough for a knife blade. It&#39;s just about possible to use one to move the 4l axle fractionally, just enough to grip the end of it. However, it comes at the cost of damaging the axle.</p>
<p>It has presumably been done like this to stop the protruding end of the orange pin from being pushed back into the frame, but if that&#39;s the case it all seems totally unnecessary because when it&#39;s used to attach the leg to the underside of the walker later on in the build it&#39;s evident that a normal 2l black pin in the hole would have sufficed.</p>
<p>I am quite surprised that this passed LEGO&#39;s stringent model review, to be honest.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_5.png" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_5.png"/></a></p>
<p>And that&#39;s not all... When it comes to attaching the body to the underframe, axles are inserted into holes in the side and, while they do not mate with an axle hole inside the body, they cannot be removed without putting the mechanised beast on its side, shaking it, and hoping for the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_2.png" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_2.png"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_3.png" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return hs.expand(this)" data-cf-modified-81e43b633c8e9b1e9e9e0263-=""><img src="https://images.brickset.com/news/67650_3.png"/></a></p>
<p>This is not something I&#39;d expect to see in a flagship £700 set and seems to show a lack of care and attention. Is this an isolated example or have you noticed similar problems in the sets you&#39;ve built recently?</p>
<p>Thanks to <em>merman </em>for bringing this to my attention.</p>
