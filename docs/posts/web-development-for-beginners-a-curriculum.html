<p>“Thinking as activity”</p>



<p>I am cherry-picking this piece from chapter 2 which I read a week ago and only vaguely remember. </p>



<p>As I recall this chapter is about how ritual works and where ritual comesfrom. </p>



<p>It tells the story of a man returning to his ancestral home and wanting to enliven it. He fasts, he meditates, he sits and watches and the land “tells” him what to do.</p>



<p>I was binge-listening to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-can-do-hard-things-with-glennon-doyle/id1564530722">We can do hard things</a> – by Glennon Doyle and Abby Abby Wambach on a plane back from London. This was followed by binge listening to <a href="https://www.glitchbottle.com/">Glitch Bottle</a> – just saying.  Glennon talked about removing the distance between thinking and doing. I love this.</p>



<p>What is thinking anyway! A distraction IMHO. </p>



<p>What is ritual? What is a ceremony? I have asked these questions and people have given me answers.  Today it feels like a ceremony commemorates something and a ritual enacts something.  </p>



<p>What are markers? I imagine my life as map. There are sign posts and flags. There is a key, there are directions. There are hills and glades. I put down important points on the map to remind myself and to ground myself – these are the ceremonies.</p>



<p>When I go and walk a portion of the map in a new way, as a different person, to elevate it, to sanctify it to merge its vibrations with my ancestors, with the moss creatures, with the neutrinos – I do a ritual. </p>



<p>I have a grandmother’s altar in my closet. I go there to commune with the grandmothers. I vibe with them, they vibe with me. This is a ritual.  Sometimes we write python code together.</p>
