            <p>
                    Complete each level by reaching the target within the given number of moves.
                    Each piece you capture gives you +1 move, and points based on the piece
                    (Pawn: 1 point. Knight or Bishop: 3. Rook: 5. Queen: 9.)
                </p>
            <p>
                    Capture 2 or more pieces in a streak to get bonus points (bonus is the length of the streak).
                    Lose 1 point when you move to an attacked square.
                    Double your points when you capture all the pieces.
            </p>
