    <h1>The PGP problem (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptography engineers have been tearing their hair out over PGP’s deficiencies</a>
for (literally) decades. When other kinds of engineers get wind of this,
they’re shocked. PGP is bad? Why do people keep telling me to use PGP? The
answer is that they shouldn’t be telling you that, because PGP is bad and needs
to go away.</p><p>There are, as you’re about to see, lots of problems with PGP. Fortunately, if
you’re not morbidly curious, there’s a simple meta-problem with it: it was
designed in the 1990s, before serious modern cryptography. No competent crypto
engineer would design a system that looked like PGP today, nor tolerate most of
its defects in any other design. Serious cryptographers have largely given up
on PGP and don’t spend much time publishing on it anymore
(<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-poddebniak.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a notable exception</a>).
Well-understood problems in PGP have gone unaddressed for over a decade because
of this.</p><p>Two quick notes: first, we wrote this for engineers, not lawyers and activists.
Second: “PGP” can mean a bunch of things, from the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPGP standard</a> to its reference
implementation in GnuPG. We use the term “PGP” to cover all of these things.</p><h2 id="the-problems"><a href="#the-problems" aria-label="Link to The problems">The problems
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h2><h3 id="absurd-complexity"><a href="#absurd-complexity" aria-label="Link to Absurd complexity">Absurd complexity
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>For reasons none of us here in the future understand, PGP has a packet-based
structure. A PGP message (in a “.asc” file) is an archive of typed packets.
There are
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#page-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 8 different ways</a> of
encoding the length of a packet, depending on whether you’re using “new” or
“old” format packets. The “new format” packets have variable-length lengths,
like BER (try to write a PGP implementation and you may wish for the sweet
release of ASN.1). Packets can have subpackets. There are overlapping variants
of some packets. The most recent keyserver attack happened because GnuPG
<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1147162583969009664.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accidentally went quadratic</a>
in parsing keys, which also follow this deranged format.</p><p>That’s just the encoding. The actual system doesn’t get simpler. There are keys
and subkeys. Key IDs and key servers and key signatures. Sign-only and
encrypt-only. Multiple “key rings”. Revocation certificates. Three different
compression formats. This is all before we get to smartcard support.</p><h3 id="swiss-army-knife-design"><a href="#swiss-army-knife-design" aria-label="Link to Swiss Army knife design">Swiss Army knife design
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>If you’re stranded in the woods and, I don’t know, need to repair your jean
cuffs, it’s handy if your utility knife has a pair of scissors. But nobody who
does serious work uses their multitool scissors regularly.</p><p>A Swiss Army knife does a bunch of things, all of them poorly. PGP does a
mediocre job of signing things, a relatively poor job of encrypting them with
passwords, and a pretty bad job of encrypting them with public keys. PGP is not
an especially good way to securely transfer a file. It’s a clunky way to sign
packages. It’s not great at protecting backups. It’s a downright dangerous way
to converse in secure messages.</p><p>Back in the MC Hammer era from which PGP originates, “encryption” was its own
special thing; there was one tool to send a file, or to back up a directory,
and another tool to encrypt and sign a file. Modern cryptography doesn’t work
like this; it’s purpose built. Secure messaging wants crypto that is different
from secure backups or package signing.</p><h3 id="mired-in-backwards-compatibility"><a href="#mired-in-backwards-compatibility" aria-label="Link to Mired in backwards compatibility">Mired in backwards compatibility
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>PGP predates modern cryptography; there are Hanson albums that have aged
better. If you’re lucky, your local GnuPG defaults to 2048-bit RSA, the
64-bit-block CAST5 cipher in CFB, and the OpenPGP MDC checksum (about which
more later). If you encrypt with a password rather than with a public key, the
OpenPGP protocol specifies PGP’s S2K password KDF. These are, to put it gently,
not the primitives a cryptography engineer would select for a modern system.</p><p>We’ve learned a lot since Steve Urkel graced the airwaves during ABC’s TGIF:
that you should authenticate your ciphertexts (and avoid CFB mode) would be an
obvious example, but also that 64-bit block ciphers are bad, that we can do
much better than RSA, that mixing compression and encryption is dangerous, and
that KDFs should be both time- and memory-hard.</p><p>Whatever the OpenPGP RFCs may say, you’re probably not doing any of these
things if you’re using PGP, nor can you predict when you will. Take AEAD
ciphers: the Rust-language Sequoia PGP defaulted to the AES-EAX AEAD mode,
which is great, and nobody can read those messages because most PGP installs
don’t know what EAX mode is, which is not great. Every well-known bad
cryptosystem eventually sprouts an RFC extension that supports curves or AEAD,
so that its proponents can claim on message boards that they support modern
cryptography. RFC’s don’t matter: only the installed base does. We’ve
understood authenticated encryption for 2 decades, and PGP is old enough to buy
me drinks; enough excuses.</p><p>You can have backwards compatibility with the 1990s or you can have sound
cryptography; <em>you can’t have both</em>.</p><h3 id="obnoxious-ux"><a href="#obnoxious-ux" aria-label="Link to Obnoxious UX">Obnoxious UX
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>We can’t say this any better than Ted Unangst:</p><blockquote><p>There was a PGP usability study conducted a few years ago where a group of
technical people were placed in a room with a computer and asked to set up
PGP. Two hours later, they were never seen or heard from again.</p></blockquote><p>If you’d like empirical data of your own to back this up, here’s an experiment
you can run: find an immigration lawyer and talk them through the process of
getting Signal working on their phone. You probably don’t suddenly smell
burning toast. Now try doing that with PGP.</p><h3 id="long-term-secrets"><a href="#long-term-secrets" aria-label="Link to Long-term secrets">Long-term secrets
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>PGP begs users to keep a practically forever root key tied to their identity.
It does this by making keys annoying to generate and exchange, by encouraging
“key signing parties”, and by creating a “web of trust” where keys depend on
other keys.</p><p><a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long term keys are almost never what you want</a>.
If you keep using a key, it eventually gets exposed. You want the blast radius
of a compromise to be as small as possible, and, just as importantly, you don’t
want users to hesitate even for a moment at the thought of rolling a new key if
there’s any concern at all about the safety of their current key.</p><p>The PGP cheering section will immediately reply “that’s why you keep keys on a
Yubikey”. To a decent first approximation, nobody in the whole world uses the
expensive Yubikeys that do this, and you can’t imagine a future in which that
changes (we can barely get U2F rolled out, and those keys are disposable). We
can’t accept bad cryptosystems just to make Unix nerds feel better about their
toys.</p><h3 id="broken-authentication"><a href="#broken-authentication" aria-label="Link to Broken authentication">Broken authentication
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>More on PGP’s archaic primitives: way back in 2000, the OpenPGP working group
realized they needed to authenticate ciphertext, and that PGP’s signatures
weren’t accomplishing that. So OpenPGP invented
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MDC system</a>: PGP
messages with MDCs attach a SHA-1 of the plaintext to the plaintext, which is
then encrypted (as normal) in CFB mode.</p><p>If you’re wondering how PGP gets away with this when modern systems use
relatively complex AEAD modes (why can’t everyone just tack a SHA-1 to their
plaintext), you’re not alone. Where to start with this Rube Goldberg
contraption? The PGP MDC can be stripped off messages –– it was encoded in such
a way that you can simply chop off the last 22 bytes of the ciphertext to do
that. To retain backwards compatibility with insecure older messages, PGP
introduced a new packet type to signal that the MDC needs to be validated; if
you use the wrong type, the MDC doesn’t get checked. Even if you do, the new
SEIP packet format is close enough to the insecure SE format that you can
potentially trick readers into downgrading;
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/tB00vO5r-qneX9wz1xz3netpXVU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Perrin worked the SEIP out to 16 whole bits of security</a>.</p><p>And, finally, even if everything goes right, the reference PGP implementation
will (wait for it) release unauthenticated plaintext to callers, <em>even if the
MDC doesn’t match</em>.</p><h3 id="incoherent-identity"><a href="#incoherent-identity" aria-label="Link to Incoherent Identity">Incoherent Identity
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>PGP is an application. It’s a set of integrations with other applications. It’s
a file format. It’s also a social network, and a subculture.</p><p>PGP pushes notion of a cryptographic identity. You generate a key, save it in
your keyring, print its fingerprint on your business card, and publish it to a
keyserver. You sign other people’s keys. They in turn may or may not rely on
your signatures to verify other keys. Some people go out of their way to meet
other PGP users in person to exchange keys and more securely attach themselves
to this “web of trust”. Other people organize “key signing parties”. The image
you’re conjuring in your head of that accurately explains how hard it is to
PGP’s devotees to switch to newer stuff.</p><p>None of this identity goop works. Not the key signing web of trust, not the
keyservers, not the parties. Ordinary people will trust anything that looks
like a PGP key no matter where it came from—how could they not, when even an
expert would have a hard time articulating how to evaluate a key? Experts don’t
trust keys they haven’t exchanged personally. Everyone else relies on
centralized authorities to distribute keys. PGP’s key distribution mechanisms
are theater.</p><h3 id="leaks-metadata"><a href="#leaks-metadata" aria-label="Link to Leaks Metadata">Leaks Metadata
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Forget the email debacle for a second (we’ll get to that later). PGP by itself
leaks metadata. Messages are (in normal usage) linked directly to key
identifiers, which are, throughout PGP’s cobweb of trust, linked to user
identity. Further, a rather large fraction of PGP users make use of keyservers,
which can themselves leak to the network the identities of which PGP users are
communicating with each other.</p><h3 id="no-forward-secrecy"><a href="#no-forward-secrecy" aria-label="Link to No forward secrecy">No forward secrecy
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>A good example of that last problem: secure messaging crypto demands forward
secrecy. Forward secrecy means that if you lose your key to an attacker today,
they still can’t go back and read yesterday’s messages; they had to be there
with the key yesterday to read them. In modern cryptography engineering, we
assume our adversary is recording everything, into infinite storage. PGP’s
claimed adversaries include world governments, many of whom are certainly doing
exactly that. Against serious adversaries and without forward secrecy, breaches
are a question of “when”, not “if”.</p><p>To get forward secrecy in practice, you typically keep two secret keys: a short
term session key and a longer-term trusted key. The session key is ephemeral
(usually the product of a DH exchange) and the trusted key signs it, so that a
man-in-the-middle can’t swap their own key in. It’s theoretically possible to
achieve a facsimile of forward secrecy using the tools PGP provides. Of course,
pretty much nobody does this.</p><h3 id="clumsy-keys"><a href="#clumsy-keys" aria-label="Link to Clumsy keys">Clumsy keys
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>An OpenBSD signify(1) public key is a Base64 string short enough to fit in the
middle of a sentence in an email; the private key, which isn’t an interchange
format, is just a line or so longer. A PGP public key is a whole giant Base64
document; if you’ve used them often, you’re probably already in the habit of
attaching them rather than pasting them into messages so they don’t get
corrupted. Signify’s key is a state-of-the-art Ed25519 key; PGP’s is a weaker
RSA key.</p><p>You might think this stuff doesn’t matter, but it matters a lot; orders of
magnitude more people use SSH and manage SSH keys than use PGP. SSH keys are
trivial to handle; PGP’s are not.</p><h3 id="negotiation"><a href="#negotiation" aria-label="Link to Negotiation">Negotiation
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>PGP supports ElGamal. PGP supports RSA. PGP supports the NIST P-Curves. PGP
supports Brainpool. PGP supports Curve25519. PGP supports SHA-1. PGP supports
SHA-2. PGP supports RIPEMD160. PGP supports IDEA. PGP supports 3DES. PGP
supports CAST5. PGP supports AES. There is no way this is a complete list of
what PGP supports.</p><p>If we’ve learned 3 important things about cryptography design in the last 20
years, at least 2 of them are that negotiation and compatibility are evil. The
flaws in cryptosystems tend to appear in the joinery, not the lumber, and
expansive crypto compatibility increases the amount of joinery. Modern
protocols like TLS 1.3 are jettisoning backwards compatibility with things like
RSA, not adding it. New systems support <em>just a single suite of primitives</em>,
and a simple version number. If one of those primitives fails, you bump the
version and chuck the old protocol all at once.</p><p>If we’re unlucky, and people are still using PGP 20 years from now, PGP will be
the only reason any code anywhere includes CAST5. We can’t say this more
clearly or often enough: you can have backwards compatibility with the 1990s or
you can have sound cryptography; you can’t have both.</p><h3 id="janky-code"><a href="#janky-code" aria-label="Link to Janky code">Janky code
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>The standard implementation in practice of PGP is GnuPG. GnuPG is not carefully
built. It’s a sprawling C-language codebase with duplicative functionality
(write-ups of the most recent SKS key parsing denial of service noted that it
has multiple key parsers, for instance) with a
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-4711/Gnupg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long track record of CVEs</a>
ranging from memory corruption to cryptographic side channels. It has at times
been possible to strip authenticators off messages without GnuPG noticing. It’s
been possible to feed it keys that don’t fingerprint properly without it
noticing. The 2018 Efail vulnerability was a result of it releasing
unauthenticated plaintext to callers. GnuPG is not good.</p><p>GnuPG is also effectively the reference implementation for PGP, and also the
basis for most other tools that integrate PGP cryptography. It isn’t going
anywhere. To rely on PGP is to rely on GPG.</p><h2 id="the-answers"><a href="#the-answers" aria-label="Link to The answers">The answers
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h2><p>One of the rhetorical challenges of persuading people to stop using PGP is that
there’s no one thing you can replace it with, nor should there be. What you
should use instead depends on what you’re doing.</p><h3 id="talking-to-people"><a href="#talking-to-people" aria-label="Link to Talking to people">Talking to people
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Use Signal. Or Wire, or WhatsApp, or some other Signal-protocol-based secure
messenger.</p><p>Modern secure messengers are purpose-built around messaging. They use
privacy-preserving authentication handshakes, repudiable messages,
<em>cryptographic ratchets</em> that rekey on every message exchange, and, of course,
modern encryption primitives. Messengers are trivially easy to use and there’s
no fussing over keys and subkeys. If you use Signal, you get even more than
that: you get a system so paranoid about keeping private metadata off servers
that it tunnels Giphy searches to avoid traffic analysis attacks, and until
relatively recently didn’t even support user profiles.</p><h3 id="encrypting-email"><a href="#encrypting-email" aria-label="Link to Encrypting email">Encrypting email
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Don’t.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16088386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email is insecure</a>. Even with
PGP, it’s default-plaintext, which means that even if you do everything right,
some totally reasonable person you mail, doing totally reasonable things, will
invariably CC the quoted plaintext of your encrypted message to someone else
(we don’t know a PGP email user who hasn’t seen this happen). PGP email is
forward-insecure. Email metadata, including the subject (which is literally
message content), are always plaintext.</p><p>If you needed another reason,
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-poddebniak.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the Efail paper</a>.
The GnuPG community,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181225214730/https://flaked.sockpuppet.org/2018/05/16/a-unified-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which mishandled the Efail disclosure</a>,
talks this research down a lot, but it was accepted at Usenix Security (one of
the top academic software security venues) and at Black Hat USA (<em>the</em> top
industry software security venue), was one of the best cryptographic attacks of
the last 5 years, and is a pretty devastating indictment of the PGP ecosystem.
As you’ll see from the paper, S/MIME isn’t better.</p><p>This isn’t going to get fixed. To make actually secure email, you’d have to
tunnel another protocol over email (you’d still be conceding traffic analysis
attacks). At that point, why bother pretending?</p><p>Encrypting email is asking for a calamity. Recommending email encryption to
at-risk users is malpractice. Anyone who tells you it’s secure to communicate
over PGP-encrypted email is putting their weird preferences ahead of your
safety.</p><h3 id="sending-files"><a href="#sending-files" aria-label="Link to Sending files">Sending files
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Use <a href="https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Wormhole</a>. Wormhole
clients use a one-time password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) to encrypt
files to recipients. It’s easy (for nerds, at least), secure, and fun: we
haven’t introduced wormhole to anyone who didn’t start gleefully wormholing
things immediately just like we did.</p><p>Someone stick a Windows installer on a Go or Rust implementation of Magic
Wormhole right away; it’s too great for everyone not to have.</p><p>If you’re working with lawyers and not with technologists, Signal does a
perfectly cromulent job of securing file transfers. Put a Signal number on your
security page to receive bug bounty reports, not a PGP key.</p><h3 id="encrypting-backups"><a href="#encrypting-backups" aria-label="Link to Encrypting backups">Encrypting backups
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Use Tarsnap.
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/design.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin can tell you all about how Tarsnap is optimized to protect backups</a>.
Or really, use any other encrypted backup tool that lots of other people use;
they won’t be as good as Tarsnap but they’ll all do a better job than PGP will.</p><p>Need offline backups? Use encrypted disk images; they’re built into modern
Windows, Linux, and macOS.
<a href="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/04/30/you-dont-want-xts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full disk encryption isn’t great</a>,
but it works fine for this use case, and it’s easier and safer than PGP.</p><h3 id="signing-packages"><a href="#signing-packages" aria-label="Link to Signing packages">Signing packages
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Use Signify/Minisign.
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Unangst will tell you all about it</a>.
It’s what OpenBSD uses to sign packages. It’s extremely simple and uses modern
signing. <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minisign</a>, from Frank Denis,
the libsodium guy, brings the same design to Windows and macOS; it has bindings
for Go, Rust, Python, Javascript, and .NET; it’s even compatible with Signify.</p><h3 id="encrypting-application-data"><a href="#encrypting-application-data" aria-label="Link to Encrypting application data">Encrypting application data
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>Use <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libsodium</a> It builds everywhere,
has interface that’s designed to be hard to misuse, and you won’t have to shell
out to a binary to use it.</p><h3 id="encrypting-files"><a href="#encrypting-files" aria-label="Link to Encrypting files">Encrypting files
<span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></h3><p>This really is a problem. If you’re/not/making a backup, and you’re
/not/archiving something offline for long-term storage, and you’re
/not/encrypting to securely send the file to someone else, and you’re
/not/encrypting virtual drives that you mount/unmount as needed to get work
done, then there’s no one good tool that does this now. Filippo Valsorda is
working on
“<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yHom20CrsuX8KQJXBBw04s80Unjv8zCg_A7sPAX_9Y/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age</a>”
for these use cases, and I’m super optimistic about it, but it’s not there yet.</p><p><em>Update, February 2020</em></p><p>Filippo’s <a href="https://age-encryption.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age</a> has been released. It’s a solid
design with simple, easily auditable implementations in Go and Rust. You can
build binaries for it for every mainstream platform. Age is, of course, much
younger than PGP. But I would bet all the money in my pocket against all the
money in yours that a new vulnerability will be found in the clangorous
contraption of PGP before one is found in age. Look into age!</p><p>Hopefully it’s clear that this is a pretty narrow use case. We work in software
security and handle sensitive data, including bug bounty reports (another super
common “we need PGP!” use case), and we almost never have to touch PGP.</p></div></div>
