        <p>A little more than a thousand years ago, monks at Saint Catherine’s Monastery in Egypt’s Sinai desert removed <a href="https://collections.museumofthebible.org/artifacts/32858-codex-climaci-rescriptus-uncial-0250">Western Palestinian Aramaic and Greek writing</a> from animal-skin parchments. They replaced the words with a Syriac translation of writings by John Climacus, also known as <a href="https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2013/03/30/100943-venerable-john-climacus-of-sinai-author-of-the-ladder">Saint John of the Ladder</a>.</p>

<p>The monks had created something called a palimpsest—a text whose original writing was mostly erased to make room for new work—named the <em>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</em>. Parchments were extremely expensive at the time, so reusing pieces was common practice.</p>

<p>The original text, however, might not be completely lost. That’s good news, because it seems to contain copied portions of a second-century B.C.E. star catalog with maps originally created by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, known as the “<a href="https://nmspacemuseum.org/inductee/hipparchus/">father of scientific astronomy</a>.” Researchers are now using a type of particle accelerator at the <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> to uncover the hidden words.  </p>

<p>“X-ray beams from our synchrotron at SLAC are helping uncover the long-erased and overwritten star map by scanning for trace metals left behind by the original inks,” reads a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1D93VKFG3H/">social media post</a> from SLAC.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/medieval-manuscript-oldest-map-of-the-stars-Hipparchus-180980993/">Previous work</a> has revealed that many pages of the <em>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</em> come from a fifth- or sixth-century C.E. book, which included a copy of an astronomical poem titled <em>Phaenomena. </em>It was originally written by the Greek poet <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aratus-Greek-poet">Aratus</a> in the third century B.C.E. Alongside the poem appear to be transcriptions from Hipparchus’ <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/star-catalog">star catalog</a>, which was completed around 129 B.C.E. The work represents the “earliest known attempt to record accurate coordinates of many celestial objects observable with the naked eye,” researchers wrote in a 2022 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00218286221128289">study</a> investigating the <em>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</em>’ original writings.</p>

<p>Little of Hipparchus’ work, which he likely documented on papyrus, has endured the test of time. So, researchers often rely on the writings of later authors to investigate the Greek astronomer. Some of his known stellar coordinates have reached modern-day scholars through a Latin translation of Aratus’ poems and related texts, according to the study.</p><div>

    <h4>Did you know? Hipparchus’ history</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer">Hipparchus</a> was born in Nicaea, which is located in modern-day Turkey. He made advancements in trigonometry and approached astronomy as a mathematical science. He spent much of his adult life observing the night sky and conducting research on the island of Rhodes in Greece.</p>
    </div>
</div><p>Last month, researchers at SLAC began scanning 11 pages of the codex, which were sent to the laboratory in Menlo Park, California, by the <a href="https://www.museumofthebible.org/">Museum of the Bible</a> in Washington, D.C., reports <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12070647/stanford-scientists-reveal-oldest-map-of-the-night-sky-previously-lost-to-time">KQED</a>’s Ayah Ali-Ahmad. The facility’s <a href="https://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/ssrl/web/">synchrotron lightsource instrument</a> produces <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/research/slac-science-explained/synchrotrons">intense X-ray beams</a> that can unveil the document’s hidden text based on the ink composition, which differs from that used by the monks. The work has already revealed the ancient Greek word for “Aquarius” and details about stars within the constellation, <a href="https://cnrs.academia.edu/VictorGysembergh">Victor Gysembergh</a>, a historian of science at the French National Center for Scientific Research who is leading the project, tells the outlet.</p>

<p>“The goal is to recover as many of these coordinates as possible,” he says. “This will help us answer some of the biggest questions on the birth of science: Why did they start doing science 2,000 and more years ago? How did they get so good at it so fast? Because the coordinates we are finding are incredibly accurate for something that is done with the naked eye.”</p>

<p>The scribe who copied <em>Phaenomena</em>, which details how various constellations rise and set, onto the parchment integrated descriptions of the stars’ positions that were probably based on Hipparchus’ work. The celestial objects’ coordinate system and accuracy align with references to the ancient astronomer’s writings, reports <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greek-star-catalog-hipparchus-astronomy"><em>Science News</em></a>’ Adam Mann. “There’s an appendix which includes coordinates of the stars discussed in the poem, and then little sketches of the star maps,” <a href="https://www.physics.wisc.edu/directory/gardezi-minhal/">Minhal Gardezi</a>, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who is working on the project, tells the outlet.</p>

Callaway that the unveiled text might shed light on enduring questions if later astronomers, including <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, were recording their own observations or partly assembling earlier work made by others.</p>
