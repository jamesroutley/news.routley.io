Yet, while most people use them, few know their real power.</p><p>Airlines love these programs. </p><p>On the surface, they let them build loyalty and encourage passengers to keep coming back (that microwaved chicken penne they call food, be damned). </p><p>To us, we think it’s cool to get a free flight every once and a while. </p><p>For airlines, frequent flyer points are like having and controlling an in-house currency -- just like a central bank.</p><p>And just like central banks, airlines can manage their own economy to weather turbulent markets and boost growth on their terms. </p><p><strong>Here’s how.</strong></p><p>Airlines issue frequent flyer points, like central banks and treasuries print money. </p><p>Like central banks adjusting interest rates to manage the economy, airlines change the value of their points to meet market conditions. </p><p>If an airline is trying to encourage people to fly more, they lower the number of miles needed for free flights.  </p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://abroaden.typeform.com/to/Pp5DC3&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Get this newsletter in your inbox&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://abroaden.typeform.com/to/Pp5DC3" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Get this newsletter in your inbox</span></a></p><p>Additionally, they can flood the market with points by making it easier to earn them. Like a central bank will create money to get people spending. </p><p>If there’s a lot of demand for flights, they raise the reward threshold. That way, people will continue to buy tickets -- particularly the highly profitable premium cabin ones.   </p><p>Since these flights require more miles than before, the airline can, in effect, take points out of their economy. </p><p>It’s entirely possible to (and people do) compare the value of different airlines’ frequent flyer points to each other.  </p><p>You can give frequent flyer points a monetary value, showing how much one point is worth in dollars, euros, or whatever currency.  An ‘exchange rate’ if you will. </p><p><strong>Looking closer, the likeness between frequent flyer programs, central banks is even starker.</strong></p><p>Like governments, airlines need to borrow money. </p><p>Sometimes, they do it the old fashioned way by taking out a loan (bond) on the open market. </p><p>But when they feel that the market conditions are unfavorable, they can fall back on their central bank-esque frequent flyer program.</p><p>First, they’ll create billions of dollars worth of frequent flyer points.</p><p>Then, they reach out to banks and credit card companies, offering to sell them at a wholesale discount. </p><p>The banks happily take the offer.  Giants like JP Morgan, Barclays, and American Express are huge frequent flyer point buyers. </p><p>For them, these miles let them build lucrative rewards-based credit cards. </p><p>When a credit cardholder spends money, the bank gives them frequent flyer points. </p><p>The more the holder spends, the more points they receive.  And the more the holder uses the card, the more transaction fees the bank collects.</p><p>If the airline works with the bank to issue a branded credit card, they even receive sign up commissions, payment fees, and late interest payments. </p><p>All and all, frequent flyer points are a massive business for airlines. According to some valuations, these programs are worth just as much as the airline itself.</p><p><strong>And that’s why today, we’re going to see airlines tap into them more than ever.</strong></p><p>Right now, airlines are in a precarious spot. </p><p>After spending the last decade growing at breakneck speed, air travel all but ceased in March. </p><p>In the previous three months, airlines hemorrhaged billions of dollars a day while their planes sat grounded, unable to generate any revenue.  </p><p>Yet, airlines know that this situation is only temporary.  </p><p>Travelers will come back once the pandemic passes, and the economy begins to recover.</p><p>Until then, airlines face a dilemma.</p><p>They’ve already taken drastic steps like borrowing billions of euros using their planes, airport slots, and other assets as collateral. But for many airlines, that hasn’t been enough.</p><p>Some of the biggest airlines in the world like United, British Airways, Delta, and Air France-KLM are now all selling miles to raise much-needed cash. </p><p>In some cases, airlines are even borrowing against their frequent flyer program to access even more funds.</p><p>For the airlines, this vital cash source is a bit of a double-edged sword. </p><p>When people do start flying again, they’ll want paying customers sitting in seats. If travelers are redeeming flights with points, airlines aren’t generating new cash. Instead, they’ll be honoring a liability.</p><p><span>Yet, more people onboard, means people are comfortable traveling again, even if they’re doing so for free.  As</span><a href="https://news.abroaden.co/wtf-economy-airlines-recovery/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"> we wrote about before</a><span>, full airplanes and the routes flying are key economic indicators. Airlines will no doubt want this trend to develop, even if it costs them cash upfront.</span></p><p>As the economic recovery starts, we’ll see more of these alternative financing methods become more popular.  As the saying goes, “necessity is the mother of all invention.”</p><p>We’ll keep an eye on how creative banks, companies, and consumers can be. </p><p><span>P.S.: After reading this, you’re probably wondering where you take advantage of some of these deals.  The Points Guy is an excellent source for frequent flyer program news and deals. </span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/tag/buy-miles-promotions/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Here’s their aggregated deals page</a><span>. </span></p><p>If you’re in the EU, there won’t be as many credit card deals since European laws surround consumer protection and processing fees hamper this niche. </p><p>Unfortunately, in the EU, rules concerning credit card payments and fees make co-branded credit cards unattractive to airlines and banks.  That said, many loyalty programs are selling points directly to consumers at a deep discount.  Check out your favorite airline’s frequent flyer program’s website to see if they’re running promos; you might be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><em><span>Thank you all again for reading.
