    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>While going through my Outlook junk folder, I noticed that nearly all my Azure related mails are classified as such.</p><p>These e-mails are all real and also sent by addresses like azure@email.microsoft.com with the source SMTP server being in a subdomain of PROD.OUTLOOK.COM.</p><p>How comes that Microsoft would not just whitelist their own domains on their own e-mail service?</p></div></div></div>
