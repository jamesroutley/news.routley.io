    <h1>How to Work Effectively with Someone You Don&#39;t Like</h1>

<p>Work can be full of stressors from tough assignments to career setbacks, but one of the most challenging situations is when you must work with someone you don’t like, don’t get along with or are annoyed by.</p>


<p>Problems with colleagues seem to be on the rise. In fact, 84% of people reported they have worked with a toxic teammate and 87% have worked with a toxic boss, according to a poll by <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" target="_blank" title="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" aria-label="FlexJobs">FlexJobs</a>. And 74% of Americans believe civility and good manners have deteriorated, based on research by the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" target="_blank" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" aria-label="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.</p>

When people demonstrate incivility at work—for example, sarcasm, demeaning interactions, interrupting or rudeness—their behavior can cause stress as well as sleeplessness at night, based on research published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" target="_blank" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" aria-label="Occupational Health Science"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8">Occupational Health Science</em></a>. And bad behavior can also result in wellbeing problems such as anxiety (51%), fatigue (44%) and even physical challenges (33%)—as well as declines in productivity and engagement—according to the FlexJobs poll.</p>


<p>But even if someone isn’t demonstrating bad behavior, they can still cause you challenges when you dislike their approach or feel devalued when you’re interacting with them.</p>

<p>Here’s how to bring your best, even when you’re working with a difficult teammate you can’t avoid.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"></fbs-ad>

<h2>1 - Demonstrate Respect</h2>
<p>Perhaps most important it to start with respect. The colleague may be tough to handle, but when you demonstrate respect and integrity, you’ll reap strong benefits in terms of your own integrity and credibility. People generally notice interactions among others and when you take the high road, others will credit you with your ability to address challenges and behave professionally, even in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>In addition to your own sense of integrity, another reason to start with respect is because you have an ability to influence your co-worker—perhaps more than you realize. In terms of human relationships, the primary way we learn is through watching, listening and experiencing other people. So how you choose to interact will set the tone for the relationship and potentially positively impact your co-worker as well.</p>

<p>You may also find it easier to demonstrate respect if you can find even one or two redeeming qualities for the person. Perhaps they are overly aggressive, but you can appreciate how they stand their ground. Or perhaps they interrupt you, but you can value their enthusiasm and passion in expressing themselves. It may be tough, but finding things to value will ultimately help your own peace of mind and potentially carry over to the relationship as well.</p>


<p>And of course, when you disagree, focus on the problem or the process, rather than the person. Keep things at the task level as much as possible—and this can help you get through difficulties.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>When you&#39;re working with someone difficult, start with respect.</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure> 
<h2>2 - Maintain Perspective</h2>
<p>Another fundamental way to work successfully with a colleague you find difficult is to maintain perspective—on several fronts.</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>Timing</em>. Remind yourself you won’t have to work with the person forever. Given the high turnover in roles and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" aria-label="frequency of job changes">frequency of job changes</a>, you’re likely to move on to another job or see your co-worker move on within a reasonably short time—so remind yourself of this.</li>
 <li><em>Relationships</em>. Also remind yourself of all the great relationships you have with other teammates. This situation is likely unique and not typical of your ability to work successfully with the majority of people.</li>
 <li><em>Human Nature</em>. It’s natural to get along with some more easily than others, and there is certainly credence to what we think of as chemistry between people. There will be those you click with immediately and others with whom you struggle. Give yourself permission to have differences in the ways you relate.</li>
</ul>

<p>By maintaining your perspective, you can also sustain your own confidence. Avoid taking their behavior personally and remind yourself of your terrific value despite interactions with this person.</p>
<h2>3 - Seek Learning</h2>
<p>Another effective way to work with someone you find difficult is to seek to learn from the interactions. Each time you’re challenged, reflect on how you could have done better and explore how you might grow your own skills—in listening, empathy or tolerance.</p>
<p>Also reflect on why the person triggers you. Sometimes there is a similarity to your own areas for development—and what annoys you about them can help highlight ways you can grow. For example, their lack of follow through may drive you crazy, but you realize that you can work on your own responsiveness as well.</p>
<p>In addition, consider how you might learn from the way the other person is showing up. If they interrupt you or devalue you, use these behaviors to reinforce the importance of how you positively interact as an alternative. If they take credit for your work, remind yourself of how you want to consistently value other’s contributions. Sometimes, learning what not to do is as powerful as seeing what works better.</p>
<p>Also stay open and humble. If you’d decided you don’t like someone, it’s possible you’re jumping to conclusions about their behavior or making assumptions about their motives. Be sure to stay open to their viewpoints and try to bring a fresh start to every interaction.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>The way you interact will have a strong influence on others.</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure> 
<h2>4 - Be Empathetic</h2>
<p>Another strategy to deal with someone you find difficult is to be intentional about expressing empathy—considering how they may be feeling (emotional empathy) or what they might be thinking (cognitive empathy).</p>
<p>Consider sitting down with them and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" aria-label="talking through your work together">talking through your work together</a>, describing how their behavior is impacting you—and listening to their experiences. It’s possible their intention doesn’t match their impact, and that you can improve how you behave as well.</p>
<p>When you seek to understand, you’ll actually contribute to your own mental health as well as build the relationship. Remind yourself that you don’t know all the other person is going through. If you find them difficult, they may be going through especially challenging times outside of work and they’re trying to cope.</p>
<p>Also assume they have good intentions. Especially if they’re going through a lot of their own issues, their behavior toward you may not be as much about you as it is an unintentional expression of their own difficulties.</p>
<p>Of course, they must still be accountable for their behavior, but being patient, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" aria-label="demonstrating kindness">demonstrating kindness</a> and giving them a greater level of understanding can be helpful.</p>
<h2>5 - Let Go</h2>
<p>It’s also wise to learn to let go. Work takes up a lot of your time and you want to accomplish great things, but you will also need to establish a healthy boundary so you can be your best and avoid stewing on the problems with the person.</p>
<p>Take a walk during the day or get together for coffee with a supportive colleague. Outside of work, make time for things that help you rejuvenate—from creative pursuits to exercise or volunteer efforts.</p>
<h2>Move Forward</h2>
<p>It’s rare that every single person you work with will be in perfect alignment with your values, approaches or preferences for interaction, but you can focus on learning and keeping relationships constructive.</p>
<p>Know that you don’t have all the answers and challenge yourself to be open to others, even when you don’t agree with them.</p>
<p>And don’t underestimate the value of time—to smooth the relationship as you get used to working together or to take you to the next project with different teammates.</p>
