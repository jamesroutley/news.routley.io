    <h1>Flunking my Anthropic interview again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here&#39;s a vague overview of what just happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently applied for
<a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4816735008">Anthropic&#39;s Developer Relations role</a>.</li>
<li>My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again,
dude!).</li>
<li>I completed their secret take-home assignment.</li>
<li>On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published
<a href="https://diggit.dev">diggit.dev</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/diggit-000">a companion blogpost</a>
about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that
some unsolicited &#34;extra credit&#34; would make me look like an
exceptional/ambitious candidate.</li>
<li>I
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45012776">posted diggit.dev to HackerNews</a>
and it hit the frontpage!</li>
<li>I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.</li>
<li>They sent me
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j98vu0/the_word_unfortunately_is_literally_traumatizing/">the &#34;unfortunately&#34; email</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anthropic obviously didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I&#39;m just bummed.</p>
<p>Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you&#39;ve suffered
through <a href="https://taylor.town/about#appearances">my talks/interviews</a>, you&#39;re probably sick of my
enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic
because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. <a href="https://taylor.town/">This very blog</a>
is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of
sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally
clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to
swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject
candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.</p>
<p>This is different. I didn&#39;t misclick any buttons. My best wasn&#39;t good enough.
I&#39;m not good enough.</p>
<p>This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews
and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward
post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I&#39;m ashamed of these
thoughts. It&#39;s the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she&#39;s wrong
about <em>her own experience</em>.</p>
<p>Dating was difficult for me. I don&#39;t mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever
-- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately
rejected due to mysterious forces: &#34;He&#39;s cute, but he&#39;s too weird.&#34;</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;m weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for
my relationships, for my well-being. But it&#39;s moments like these when I just
want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole
and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I
exaggerate my eccentricities. It&#39;s easy to swallow criticism when it isn&#39;t the
<em>real</em> me, when it isn&#39;t <em>my best</em>, when it&#39;s <em>honest mistakes</em> -- what a load
of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being
an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I&#39;m so
deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I&#39;ve been striving to spread
joy, to do good, to be better. I&#39;m trying so hard.</p>
<p>And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I&#39;m not giving up. I
hate this feeling, and I&#39;m staring these nightmares straight in their stupid
eyeballs, and they&#39;re not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to
do.</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay. I mean it. I don&#39;t need (or deserve) your sympathy. I&#39;m so lucky to be
alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is
great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.</p>
<p>Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many
strangers are facing similar feelings. It&#39;s rough out there. Whatever it is,
wherever you are, I hope this helps. You&#39;ve got this. You&#39;re not alone, and
we&#39;re only human.</p></div></div>
