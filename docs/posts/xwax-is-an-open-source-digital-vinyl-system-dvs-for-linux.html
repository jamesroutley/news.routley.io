<p>xwax is an open-source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_vinyl_system">Digital Vinyl System</a> (DVS)
for Linux. It allows DJs and turntablists to
playback digital audio files (MP3, <a href="http://www.vorbis.com">Ogg
Vorbis</a>, <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">FLAC</a>, AAC and
more), controlled using a normal pair of turntables via timecoded
vinyls.</p>

<p>It&#39;s designed for both
<a href="http://vinylproject.com/dp/audio/chris-everest-snowy-death">beat mixing</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6pVZSTTXeY">scratch mixing</a>.
Needle drops, pitch changes, scratching, spinbacks and rewinds are all
supported, and feel just like the audio is pressed onto the vinyl
itself.</p>

<p>The focus is on an accurate vinyl feel which is
efficient, stable
and fast.</p>
