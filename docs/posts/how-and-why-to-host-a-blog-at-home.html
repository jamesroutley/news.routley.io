<p>Hosting a blog from home is a fun project to learn how to get a website on the internet the old fashion way, but self-hosting is equally about ownership, privacy, and cost. These days, personal sites and blogs aren&#39;t the most common thing to host anymore. Most of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com">our</a> users don&#39;t actually run blogs at all, instead they run <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates">self-hosted apps</a> like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates/erulabs/photostructure">Photostructure</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates/erulabs/jellyfin">Jellyfin</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/template/erulabs/nextcloud">NextCloud</a>.</p>
<p>A blog though, particularly a self-hosted one, somehow tingles the heart strings. The web (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=57&amp;v=scWj1BMRHUA&amp;feature=emb_title">not &#34;the net&#34;</a>), seems like it ought to connect people to each other - right? Today, a huge percentage of all web requests are sent to a few giants. If you want to visit a friends&#39;s page, you have to contact Facebook. The implication of this ranges from &#34;not a problem at all&#34; to &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/">existential political crisis</a>&#34;. We don&#39;t buy into <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist">cancel culture</a>, and yet there is something to be said about being <strong><span>un-cancelable</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Now this isn&#39;t exactly our pitch to investors. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates/erulabs/photostructure">Replacing Google Photos</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/template/erulabs/cal.com">Calendly</a> with a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pibox.io">tiny personal server</a> for small businesses will probably stay the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.saic.edu/150/sites/default/files/Monopoly.jpg">money-man</a> pitch for quite a long time. However, whenever I do explain the <em>practical</em> reasons to self-host, I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;m somehow missing the point. I feel like I&#39;ve let the big idea down a bit. Maybe it&#39;s a bit megalomaniacal, but I imagine myself as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/INSANELY-GREAT-Macintosh-Computer-Everything/dp/0670852449">Steve Jobs pitching</a> the Mac as a &#34;word processor&#34;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;It was just going be a word processor initially, that was Jef&#39;s original concept. But, by the time you really got it to be a good word processor, it was very little more money to make it a great whatever you wanted to do. So, the original concept was not quite right, but everything great starts off that way, and you change as you go along. If you define something when you start off, then you leave no room for the creativity of brilliant implementation&#34;</p>
<p>â€• Steve Jobs, INSANELY GREAT: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer that Changed Everything Hardcover</p>

<p>There is just something deeper about having a website on the internet than hosting photos or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/06/2456875/0/en/The-Global-SAAS-Market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-USD-720-44-Billion-by-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-25-89-over-the-forecast-period-2022-2028-SkyQuest-Technology.html">replacing consumer SaaS</a>. If it&#39;s possible to go further into the hyperbolic: more people writing on the net may even change political discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The internet is a powerful force, and used for pro-social ends, it would help revitalize American social discourse. A more open internet would relieve numerous social harms, from geographic inequity and violations of privacy to abusive working conditions and capture of government.&#34;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Back on earth, in reality, it&#39;s just hard to say exactly what compels us to make self-hosting as easy as possible. Primarily, we just want to help developers have a way of shipping their products! Practically, the easiest way to get and support <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://photostructure.com/">Photostructure</a> is to buy a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pibox.io/order/platform/photostructure">PiBox that shares revenue with them</a>. We&#39;re super excited about enabling self-hosted software to flourish. We&#39;re not alone either: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.pikapods.com/">PikaPods</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://umbrel.com/">Umbrel</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://turingpi.com/">TuringPi</a> and more amazing companies are being founded every day to distribute the web.</p>
<p>Speaking of distributing, we love the blockchain folks too - it&#39;s just that our strategy is different. To distribute the web: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pibox.io">we distribute web-servers</a>. But who knows what the side effect of this might be. A good bet is somewhere between &#34;a few more personal sites on the internet&#34; and &#34;refactoring the structure of the internet&#34;. A modest upper limit, surely.</p>

<p>Gather the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><span>A computer</span></strong></p>
<p>Hosting a blog doesn&#39;t require a powerful computer. An old spare PC works great, although it can be a bit loud to leave on all the time. Some people go <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/homelab">way over the top</a> and that can be fun too.</p>
<p>The most common barrier for our users used to be finding an appropriate computer to use. While we knew enthusiasts didn&#39;t mind building their <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2S2RMNv7OU">own miniature data centers</a>, we also knew we needed to be <em>much</em> easier for non-technical folks (or just <em>really</em> busy tech enthusiasts). This is why we built the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pibox.io">PiBox</a>.</p>
<div><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27600%27%20height=%27450%27/%3e"/></span><img title="The PiBox, a tiny personal server" alt="The PiBox, a tiny personal server" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span>Some blogging software</span></strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates/erulabs/ghost">Ghost</a> is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hot%20shit">hot shit</a>, but <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://kubesail.com/templates/erulabs/wordpress">Wordpress</a> is also available. Ghost is brilliant for home hosting - many of its assets are hosted from free CDNs, leaving your home-server free to simply deliver text to the user. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9FfI4-oRDo">Everything old is new again</a>! Either way, our goal is to make it as easy to install Ghost as it is to install an iOS app - no command line required (but available to those who want it!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span>A way for the internet to reach you</span></strong></p>
<p>For requests to reach your server you&#39;ll need an address on the internet, and you will need one that won&#39;t change. Residential ISPs typically issue &#34;Dynamic IP addresses&#34;, which means they&#39;re free to change your servers address whenever they want. On top of that, they also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=19010">often block internet requests</a> on their way to your system.</p>
<p><strong><span>Assuming your ISP doesn&#39;t block requests</span></strong>, you will want a &#34;Dynamic DNS&#34; provider (essentially someone who follows us around whenever our ISP changes our IP address and automatically updates a website to point at that address). There are several &#39;DDNS&#39; providers - we like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.noip.com/">No-IP</a> just to name one. You will also need to forward web-ports to our home-server by configuring our router.</p>
<p><strong><span>If your ISP <em>does</em> block traffic</span></strong>, you&#39;ll need a clever way to side-step that block; the steps above won&#39;t work! You&#39;ll need a <em>tunnel</em>, which keeps a connection open to a server that will relay requests for you. After that, you&#39;d need to buy a domain name, get an SSL certificate, and finally, connect all the pieces together! That... sounds a lot like work though, right? I&#39;m exhausted just typing it!</p>
<p>We automatically provide both Dynamic DNS <em>and</em> tunneling <em>and</em> free SSL <em>and</em> a free domain name when you install our agent (or just plug in a PiBox) ðŸ”¥</p>
<p>Of course <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/">CloudFlare Tunnel</a> is also available! And also does a great job of side-stepping the block by maintaining a private connection directly to your server and &#34;tunneling&#34; the requests through that connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span>A backup strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Backups are always sure to set off an argument in nerd-ville. How often, how many, where, when, why - it&#39;s a rabbit hole. At KubeSail, we&#39;re aggressively pragmatic - and for most folks, having backups at all is a huge step up. We make it crazy easy to enable automatic nightly offsite backups.</p>
<div><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27445%27%20height=%27270%27/%3e"/></span><img title="Automatic nightly backups just a toggle button away" alt="Automatic nightly backups just a toggle button away" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p></div>
<p>Our favorite feature is that we encrypt your backups locally, on-device, <em>before</em> uploading them to our Cloud. On top of that, we also support &#34;difference&#34; based backups, meaning we only backup the changes that occur. Our backup system uses <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> under the hood (which handles all the cool features). If you build your own custom backup solution - use Restic!</p>
<p>Enough about us - our favorite vendor is easily <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.backblaze.com">BackBlaze</a>, who we cannot recommend enough.</p>
<p>For many folks, local replication is also a common choice. Simply having three copies of your data is <em>typically</em> plenty. While our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pibox.io">PiBox</a> handles two disks, we&#39;re also working on a <strong><span>five drive model</span></strong> that can handle spinning disks, and we&#39;re adding tools to easily configure replication. Make sure to sign up for the mailing list on the PiBox site to get updates on this. Since we&#39;ll never beat the self-hosting king of content, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com">Jeff Geerling</a>, I strongly recommend his blog <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/backup">posts about backups</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last and most critical ingredient: <strong><span>The will to write</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I&#39;m saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you&#39;ll still learn new things from writing about them.&#34;</p>
<p>â€• Paul Graham, &#34;Putting Ideas Into Words&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no answers here. I&#39;ve heard &#34;A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people&#34;, and I suppose that must make me a writer. I&#39;ll save my motivational drivel until the end - for now let&#39;s focus on <em>why</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>So all that&#39;s nice - we know how to host at home and we know vaguely <em>why</em> to host at home (Writing makes you smart? Photo privacy? Democracy?). But... is it actually the future?</p>
<p>MidJourney, a painting AI, recently captured the imagination of the web. My wife generated the following prompt and image:</p>

<p>Ah technology.

It sometimes feels silly to try to guess the next major shift in technology. Certainly, in my early 20s, I would have had much more convincing arguments than I do today. I was sure we were headed for an explosion of tech-talent; the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3CKgkyc7Qo">whole world as hackers</a>! AI artists? A distributed web? Techno-democracy? In the fantastic book &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://press.stripe.com/the-dream-machine">The Dream Machine</a>&#34;, M.

<p>&#34;Technology isnâ€™t destiny, no matter how inexorable its evolution may seem; the way its capabilities are used is as much a matter of cultural choice and historical accident as politics is, or fashion.&#34;</p>
<p>â€• M. Mitchell Waldrop, &#34;The Dream Machine&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As so it seems, possibly, the answer to &#34;why host at home?&#34;, or equally to &#34;why write?&#34; appears as much about &#34;cultural choice and historical accident&#34; as it is about cost, privacy, freedom, or any other high-minded ideal. Nothing is certain - but we&#39;ll be here - doing our best to make it easy for anyone to host websites <em>themselves</em>. But websites, blogs, photos?
