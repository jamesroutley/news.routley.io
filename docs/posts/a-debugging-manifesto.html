    <h1>A debugging manifesto</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! I&rsquo;ve been working on a zine about debugging for the last 6 months with
my friend <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a>, and one of the problems we ran
into was figuring out how to explain the right <em>attitude</em> to take when debugging.</p>

<p>We ended up writing a short debugging manifesto to start the zine with, and I&rsquo;m
pretty happy with how it came out. Here it is as an image, and as text (with
some extra explanations)</p>

<h3 id="1-inspect-don-t-squash">1. Inspect, don&rsquo;t squash</h3>

<p>When you run into a bug, the natural instinct is to try to <em>fix it</em> as fast as
possible. And of course, sometimes that&rsquo;s what you have to do &ndash; if the bug is
causing a huge production incident, you have to mitigate it quickly before
diving into figuring out the root cause.</p>

<p>But in my day to day debugging, I find that it&rsquo;s generally more effective (and
faster!) to <strong>leave the bug in place</strong>, figure out exactly what&rsquo;s gone wrong,
and then fix it after I&rsquo;ve understood what happened.</p>

<p>Trying to fix it or add workarounds without fully understanding what happened
usually ends up just leaving me <em>more</em> confused.</p>

<h3 id="2-being-stuck-is-temporary">2. Being stuck is temporary</h3>

<p>Sometimes I get really demoralized when debugging and it feels like I&rsquo;ll NEVER
make progress.</p>

<p>I have to remind myself that I&rsquo;ve fixed a lot of bugs before, and I&rsquo;ll probably
fix this one too :)</p>

<h3 id="3-trust-nobody-and-nothing">3. Trust nobody and nothing</h3>

<p>Sometimes bugs come from surprising sources! For example, in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/28/mac-freeze/">I think I found a Mac kernel bug?</a> I describe how,
the first time I tried to write a program for Mac OS, I had a bug in my program
that was caused by a Mac OS kernel bug.</p>

<p>This was really surprising (usually the operating system is not at fault!!),
but sometimes even normally-trustworthy sources are wrong. Even it&rsquo;s a popular
library, your operating system, the official documentation, or an extremely
smart and competent coworker!</p>

<h3 id="4-it-s-probably-your-code">4. It&rsquo;s probably your code</h3>

<p>That said, <strong>almost all of the time</strong> the problem is not &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a bug in Mac
OS&rdquo;. I can only speak for myself, but 95% of the time something is going wrong
with my program, it&rsquo;s because I did something silly.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s important to look for the problem in your own code first before trying
to blame some external source.</p>

<h3 id="5-don-t-go-it-alone">5. Don&rsquo;t go it alone</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned SO much by asking coworkers or friends for help with debugging. I
think it&rsquo;s one of the most fun ways to collaborate because you have a specific
goal, and there are tons of opportunities to share information like:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to use a specific debugging tool (&ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to use GDB to inspect the memory here&hellip;.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>how a computer thing works (&ldquo;hey, can you explain CORS?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>similar past bugs (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen this break in X way in the past, maybe it&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-there-s-always-a-reason">6. There&rsquo;s always a reason</h3>

<p>This one kind of speaks for itself: sometimes it <em>feels</em> like things are just
randomly breaking for no reason, but that&rsquo;s never true.</p>

<p>Even if something truly weird is happening (like a hardware problem), that&rsquo;s
still a reason.</p>

<h3 id="7-build-your-toolkit">7. Build your toolkit</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a LOT about my love for debugging tools like tcpdump, strace, and
more on this blog.</p>

<p>To fix bugs you need information about what your program is doing, and to get
that information sometimes you need to learn a new tool.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes you need to build your own better tools, like by improving your
test suite, pretty printing, etc.</p>

<h3 id="8-it-can-be-an-adventure">8. It can be an adventure</h3>

<p>As you probably know if you&rsquo;re a regular reader of this blog, I love debugging
and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from doing it. You get to learn something new! Sometimes
you get a great war story to tell! What could be more fun?</p>

<p>I really think of debugging as an investment in my future knowledge &ndash; if
something is breaking, it&rsquo;s often because there&rsquo;s something wrong in my mental
model, and that&rsquo;s an opportunity to learn and make sure that I know it for next
time.</p>

<p>Of course, not <em>all</em> bugs are adventures (that off-by-one error I was debugging
today certainly did not feel like a fun adventure). But I think it&rsquo;s important
to (as much as you can) reflect on your bugs and see what you can learn from
them.</p>
