    <h1>Show HN: I made a web game that makes practicing basic arithmetic fun</h1>

<p>Mathic is a magical math search game that&#39;ll test your speed and accuracy!</p>
<h3>Find an equation that = the Magic Number (M.N.)</h3>
<p>You can see the current Magic Number above the grid:</p>

<p>When you find the correct equation, tap the start of it and then the end of it:</p>

<h3>Build streaks for higher scores</h3>
<p>The more Magic Numbers you solve in a row, the higher your streak will grow! A higher streak will lead to higher scores, so watch that accuracy!</p>
<h3>Stuck? Use a skip!</h3>
<p>To use a skip, just tap the current Magic Number:</p>

<h3>Good luck!</h3>
<p>This is a fast math game, so you only get 60 seconds each round. Try to score as high as possible! The clock starts as soon as you solve the first Magic Number.</p>
<p><strong>Customize your game!</strong> You can enable dark mode, change the game operators, modify the grid dimensions, and more in the game&#39;s settings.</p>
