							<h3>What is SEPIA?</h3>
							<p>
								The <span>&#34;A&#34;</span> in SEPIA stands for <span>assistant</span>. Think of it as a digital companion 
								that helps you whenever you need it, not unlike Apple&#39;s Siri, Amazon&#39;s Alexa, Microsoft&#39;s Cortana or Google Assistant, but a very special, private, customizable 
								and open version that really belongs to you!</p>

							<h3>You control your data</h3>
							<p>
								Backbone of the SEPIA-Framework is <span>your own, secure web-server</span>. It runs all the core-modules like the Elasticsearch database, 
								the user-account management, the natural-language-understanding (NLU) and the chat-module. Additionally it connects the NLU to smart-services
								like reminders, to-do lists, news, IoT interfaces and many more while keeping your data in a safe, <span>self-hosted</span> environment. 
								Thanks to Java the SEPIA back-end works on virtually any OS (Linux, Windows or Mac). It is optimized for single-board computers like the <span>Raspberry Pi</span>
								to run inside your private network but can also be scaled up <span>and</span> hosted as <span>cloud-service</span>.

							<h3>You shape your assistant</h3>
							
							<p>
								SEPIA is <span>extendable</span> and can be improved and individualized in many ways. 
								You can create your <span>own commands on-the-fly</span> and teach SEPIA new stuff using the app (iOS, Android or browser) or you can build complex, 
								voice-controlled <span>smart-services with the Java SDK</span>. Everything from a simple answer to a multi-step dialog with cloud-service integration is possible. 
								If that&#39;s still not enough feel free to dive deeper into the code and replace certain modules or rebuild SEPIA completely. 
								Every part of the framework is <span>open-source, free and everybody can contribute</span>.</p>
						</div>

							<h3>Be connected while staying private</h3>
							<p>
								Since you control the data and shape your assistant SEPIA&#39;s services and answers can <span>use your personal profile to give you individual results</span> 
								without this strange feeling in your stomach that you might get when you don&#39;t know who else is reading your messages or collecting information about you.
								Connect your own IoT devices to SEPIA and keep all the controls protected in your own environment or <span>use a third-party service</span>
								like Google Maps but share only an <span>anonymous</span> address without any context so	Google will never know if you are driving to your grandma or your girlfriend/boyfriend.

							<h3>Natural dialog and smart actions</h3>
							<p><img id="sepia-smart-img" src="http://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/week-nine/img/SEPIA_smart.png" alt="SEPIA smart"/>
							</p>
							<p>
								SEPIA is designed to understand requests spoken (or typed) in natural language, extract as much information as possible and combine it in an <span>intelligent</span> way
								with an ever growing number of useful services. If a service is missing some parameters to fulfil the request SEPIA can start a <span>multi-step conversation</span> and ask you questions to fill the gaps.
								On top of that SEPIA will try to show you <span>relevant information</span> depending for example on the time of the day or your personal preferences.

							<h3>DIY voice-controlled devices</h3>
							<p>
								With SEPIA Mesh-Nodes you can extend the reach of your assistant and <span>build your own voice-controlled device</span>.
								All your device needs is network access (e.g. via WiFi module) and the ability to run the lightweight Mesh-Node server (e.g. via Java). Mesh-Nodes <span>connect securely to SEPIA</span> 
								and can execute programs directly on your device. Via the SEPIA client app, you can create voice-commands for your Mesh-Node or you can use the SEPIA Control-HUB to <span>code and upload programs</span>.
