    <h1>Tesla stock marks lowest close in years as investors worry about Musk’s focus</h1>

Musk recently said he would find a new CEO to replace him after most <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-poll-shows-575-want-him-step-down-twitter-chief-2022-12-19/" data-link-name="in body link">polled Twitter users</a> voted for him to step down. Experts say his erratic behavior has undermined confidence in Tesla, with shares down 73% from November 2021. </p><p>Tuesday’s loss, which saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Tesla</a> shares drop 11.4%, also followed a Reuters report that the company was planning to run a reduced production schedule in January at its Shanghai plant.
