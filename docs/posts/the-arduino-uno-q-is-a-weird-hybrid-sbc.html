    <h1>The Arduino Uno Q is a weird hybrid SBC</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/product-uno-q">Arduino Uno Q</a> is... a weird board. It&#39;s the first product born out of <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/qualcomms-buying-arduino-%E2%80%93-what-it-means-makers">Qualcomm&#39;s buyout of Arduino</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like if you married an Intel CPU, and a Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller—oh wait, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxa-x4-sbc-unites-intel-n100-and-raspberry-pi-rp2040">Radxa&#39;s X4 did that</a>.</p>

<p>Arduino even tried it before with their old <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/boards/arduino-yun/">Yún</a> board, which had Linux running on a MIPS CPU, married to an ATmega microcontroller.</p>

<p>The Uno Q isn&#39;t quite a Raspberry Pi, but it looks like one when you squint at it. And it&#39;s not quite an Uno, but it does a pretty good job masquerading as that, too.</p>

<p>Really, it&#39;s a tiny computer in the shape of an Arduino Uno, with a bunch more IO than you might be used to.</p>

<p>What is it <em>best</em> for? That&#39;s a good question. Maybe robotics, where you need to run a lightweight machine vision model while you control a bunch of servos in real-time?</p>

<p>Maybe light industrial controls, where you could almost get by with just a microcontroller, but you wanna run some remote control through Linux?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I ran this thing through my gauntlet of SBC benchmarks (see my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/83">full results here</a>), then I also tried it out as a hybrid computer-plus-microcontroller, and I have to say, if there&#39;s one word to describe it, it&#39;s... <em>weird</em>.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Starting on the computer side, it runs a Qualcomm Dragonwing SoC. It has some older Arm A53 CPU cores, a tiny little Adreno iGPU, and has 2 gigs of RAM and a 16 gig eMMC storage chip.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/qualcomm-qrb2210-arduino-uno-q.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-5a3c6073-2ea9-4b2a-b424-4bccae2d182c" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;5a3c6073-2ea9-4b2a-b424-4bccae2d182c&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q Dragonwing Qualcomm QRB2210 SoC"/></p>

<p>In practice, those specs are pretty limiting, but it&#39;s still enough for many applications. Also, a 4GB RAM model should be coming later.</p>

<p>But on the Linux side, you get Debian, and right now <em>only</em> Debian, and the OS it comes with launches you straight into Arduino&#39;s new <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/software/app-lab/">App Lab</a>.</p>

<p>The App Lab gives you a unified IDE. Apps can run <em>Python</em> for the Linux side, and Arduino&#39;s flavor of C++ for the MCU side. This means you can have your custom code and what Arduino is calling &#39;Bricks&#39;, that unify the two sides of the board.</p>

<p>The MCU has access to all the pins on the top, but on the SBC-side, you get everything but wireless out of a single USB-C plug. And that includes power, HDMI, USB, everything.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-uno-q-back-high-speed-connectors.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-0fd6c22a-eb92-44ad-b6c4-0e17382b9514" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;0fd6c22a-eb92-44ad-b6c4-0e17382b9514&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q high speed connectors on bottom"/></p>

<p>There are also some high speed connectors on the bottom (pictured above), but so far I haven&#39;t seen any boards that use them, for like camera connections or extra GPIO.</p>

<p>The lone USB-C port being the only connection right now is a blessing and a curse.</p>

<p>One intention is for the Q to be an educational board: students plug one in at a table and work on robotics. Except if you don&#39;t have a display with a built-in USB-C hub, now you need a:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB-C power supply</li>
<li>USB-C hub with HDMI</li>
<li>A monitor and a keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to a Raspberry Pi, it <em>is</em> nice to have one USB-C cable with display, power, and IO, if you want that—and I really hope a future Raspberry Pi 6 could do it. But it&#39;s also nice to have physical ports for display and USB devices onboard as well. Even a Pi gets to be a bit of a mess, with ports along two edges—but the Uno Q sprawls even further with a mandatory USB-C hub.</p>

<p>And on the software side, it&#39;s nice on the Pi to be able to use GPIO in Python, instead of having App Lab run hybrid Python/C++ apps.</p>

<p>But we&#39;re getting a little ahead of ourselves.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-uno-q-benchmark-1-geekbench-6.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-8d9912d1-da07-4436-a408-3aef29d9327c" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;8d9912d1-da07-4436-a408-3aef29d9327c&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q - Benchmark - Geekbench 6"/></p>

<p>Getting back to the hardware, I ran tests like Linpack, Geekbench, and more. And besides the limited 2 gigs of RAM being a bit of a pain, the Linux performance was about on par with a Pi 3 B+ or Pi 4.</p>

<p>This won&#39;t be a daily driver for browsing the web or watching YouTube.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-uno-q-benchmark-2-hpl.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-fb257b0e-844c-41d8-bdbd-9746004f6aae" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;fb257b0e-844c-41d8-bdbd-9746004f6aae&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q - Benchmark - HPL"/></p>

<p>Most things are a bit slow, like they are on older Arm SBCs, and even downloading and starting the Docker containers App Lab sets up to run the apps you build, is a bit sluggish.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-uno-q-benchmark-3-hpl-efficiency.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-92539c92-6866-4be8-9a8a-36543eea6a27" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;92539c92-6866-4be8-9a8a-36543eea6a27&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q - Benchmark - HPL Efficiency"/></p>

<p>Energy efficiency is decent, with the board pulling .5 watts at idle, up to 2-3 watts at full power. <em>However</em>, if you&#39;re just using the MCU portion, it doesn&#39;t seem like you can just power that without the full Linux stack running.</p>

<p>I even tried shutting down in Linux, multiple ways, like through the GUI or via SSH, and every time it&#39;ll just power back on again... so I can&#39;t find a way to just run the MCU and not Linux.</p>

<p>I could get my older Uno running at a few dozen <em>milliwatts</em>, but because I have to run the full Linux stack too, the Q needs at least 10-100x the power. So battery use will be limited, like with a full Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>I keep comparing it to a Raspberry Pi, too, because the board costs $44 for the 2GB version. That gets you a decent little board, but the Pi <em>five</em>, which is <em>2-4x faster</em>, at the expense of another couple watts of power draw, is also $45 (also for 2GB).</p>

<p>And then you have the Radxa X4 I mentioned earlier, which is <em>faster still</em>, and it starts at <em>$60</em>. (Although the price for those of us living in the US has increased due to tariffs.)</p>

<p>So <em>just taking the Uno Q as an SBC</em>, it&#39;s not a good value. It&#39;s not horrible, and I was happy to see most things in Debian working out of the box. But it&#39;s definitely not the best SBC you can buy in the 40-50 dollar price range.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>But this <em>isn&#39;t</em> just an SBC. Or at least that&#39;s the message Arduino and Qualcomm are pushing.</p>

<p>This is a device that gives you &#34;<a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-q/">modern AI at the edge</a>,&#34; according to the documentation.</p>

<p>But even there, it can only run the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/83#issuecomment-3446866713">tiniest of models</a>, especially if you&#39;re talking LLMs, and it runs them slower than most other SBCs in the same price range. And managing apps between Python and C++ is still kind-of annoying.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-app-lab-blink-led.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-73df131b-715c-42da-b4c0-5a16aaf369b9" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;73df131b-715c-42da-b4c0-5a16aaf369b9&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino App Lab - Blink LED python example"/></p>

<p>It still feels like you&#39;re managing two separate things, though App Lab <em>is</em> an improvement over just doing it all on your own like you have to do on the Radxa. But it&#39;s not as easy as on the Pi, where you can just tap into GPIO from anywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I was finishing up this post, I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngdz6xvYiuU">this video from Gary Explains</a>, where he details some of the annoyances I also encountered, with programming the Uno from both the Uno Q itself, or through a connected computer. I didn&#39;t get <em>too</em> deep with the Uno Q, but I was having trouble with serial console output, having a stable board connection, etc... and I thought it was a PEBKAC, but apparently it might just be the beta-ish nature of App Lab as it currently exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to test things like CSI camera and DSI display functionality, because so far I haven&#39;t seen any boards that tie into the high speed connectors on the bottom. Supposedly those are coming, but like with most Shields, you&#39;ll end up paying another $20, $40, or $50 just to have some of the features you might get out of the box on other SBCs, like USB, Ethernet, camera and display connectors, or built-in HDMI.</p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t see this thing lighting the world on fire.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that it exists, especially if you have an Arduino-centric course or robotics pipeline already, and you want the convenience of Linux for remote access or running a tiny ML model. But after using it for a couple weeks, I just don&#39;t see the value for <em>my own</em> work. And I can&#39;t find many reasons to recommend it unless you&#39;re already in the Arduino ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>I think the immediate reaction from many in the maker community to Qualcomm&#39;s buyout was, &#34;Arduino is dead to me.&#34; And I get that. I feel the same way, since so many buyouts result in the long-term decay of what made an acquired company beloved.</p>

<p>A lot people wondered if boards would still be open source, and I&#39;m happy to report that <em>that</em>, at least, hasn&#39;t changed. The <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-q/">board schematics and step files were up</a> on launch day<sup id="fnref:designfiles"><a href="#fn:designfiles" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/arduino-uno-q-box-open-source-is-love.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-dcc69801-02b2-494f-a3b2-f07e1fbc6e5a" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;dcc69801-02b2-494f-a3b2-f07e1fbc6e5a&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Arduino Uno Q box - Open Source is Love resistors"/></p>

<p>Arduino doesn&#39;t just stamp their box with &#39;Open Source is Love&#39; as a platitude. But the bigger question is: can they convince Qualcomm to be the same? I&#39;m doubtful.</p>

<p>Having the schematics is great, but only so far as you could build your <em>own</em> board from scratch. To do that, you need all the main chips. Is the Dragonwing SoC available to buy?</p>

<p>Well... it looks like it <em>might be</em>, at least at some point. So that&#39;s good. Over on Digikey, I found this listing for the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/qualcomm/QRB-2210-0-NSP752-TR-00-0/27904331?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIoCUBCYwEYAMIC6BfIA">QRB2210</a>, and it even has a full <a href="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/docus/7554/QRB2210.pdf">datasheet</a> which is... more than I can say for the Broadcom chip on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>So who knows?</p>

<p>Arduino&#39;s strengths are software, community, and support, just like with the Raspberry Pi. So could they make this thing work in the long run? Maybe. The biggest question I have is whether Qualcomm will keep putting resources into it, or if they see some faltering first steps and just drop it <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/06/20/intel_joules_edison_galileo/">like Intel did with Edison</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, this board is <em>weird</em>. I have a lot more about my experience using it, using App Lab, and benchmarks <a href="https://sbc-reviews.jeffgeerling.com">over on my SBC Reviews website</a>.</p>

<p>I do hope this isn&#39;t a one-and-done, because it&#39;s good to have more players in the SBC game, especially with the support and open source push Arduino is known for.</p>
