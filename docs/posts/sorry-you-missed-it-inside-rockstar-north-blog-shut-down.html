<p>Today (22 Nov 2023) I got an email from R*North.</p><p>Apparently some of the OG&#39;s there are upset by my blog. I genuinely didn&#39;t think anyone would mind me talking about 20 year old games but I was wrong. Something about ruining the Rockstar mystique or something.</p><p>Anyway,</p><p>This blog isn&#39;t important enough to me to piss off my former colleagues in Edinburgh so I&#39;m winding it down.</p><p>I&#39;ll maybe just leave a few articles with anecdotes that don&#39;t affect anyone but me.</p><p>I would love for Rockstar to open up about development of the trilogy themselves, but it doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;ll try again in a decade or two.</p><p>Till then, Obbe.</p>

<h3><a href="https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/2023/11/why-does-moon-change-size-when-you.html">Why does the moon change size when you snipe it?</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size. A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon. &#34;No problem&#34; I said. It turned out they couldn&#39;t decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic. This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it. The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA.

<h3><a href="https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-trouble-with-cheats.html">The trouble with cheats</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
(Warning: techy) The cheats in the trilogy were activated by simply typing a sequence of characters. On PC the sequence would be something like ILOVESCOTLAND to make it rain or GUNSGUNSGUNS to give the player loads of weapons. The game remembers the last 20 or so keypresses and every time a new key is pressed, these keypresses are compared with the cheats. If there is a match, the cheat will activate. The straightforward way of doing this would be to compare the string &#34;ILOVESCOTLAND&#34; with the string of keypresses. This approach would mean that the strings for the cheats would be in memory as readable text. Any hacker could easily find the cheats and they would all be discovered on the day of release. This is why I used &#39;hash codes&#39; to store the cheats. A hash code is a number that is calculated from a string. As an example; a simple hash algorithm could add up the ASCII values of each character of the string. The hash code for ILOVESCOTLAND would be 983. For GUNSGUNS
