    <h1>Sorry You Missed It â€“ Inside Rockstar North Blog Shut Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3224829284983975058">
<p>Today (22 Nov 2023) I got an email from R*North.</p><p>Apparently some of the OG&#39;s there are upset by my blog. I genuinely didn&#39;t think anyone would mind me talking about 20 year old games but I was wrong. Something about ruining the Rockstar mystique or something.</p><p>Anyway,</p><p>This blog isn&#39;t important enough to me to piss off my former colleagues in Edinburgh so I&#39;m winding it down.</p><p>I&#39;ll maybe just leave a few articles with anecdotes that don&#39;t affect anyone but me.</p><p>I would love for Rockstar to open up about development of the trilogy themselves, but it doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;ll try again in a decade or two.</p><p>Till then, Obbe.</p>
