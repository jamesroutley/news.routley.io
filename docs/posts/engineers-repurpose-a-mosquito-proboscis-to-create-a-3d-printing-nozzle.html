</div><p>When it comes to innovation, engineers have long proved to be brilliant copycats, drawing inspiration directly from nature. But now some scientists are moving beyond simple imitation to incorporating natural materials into their designs. Stuck for ideas on how to create ultra-fine, low-cost 3D printing nozzles, researchers at McGill University in Canada repurposed the proboscis of a deceased female mosquito to create a sustainable, high-resolution 3D printing tip.</p>

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>The work is <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw9953" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Science Advances</i>.</p>
<p>High-resolution 3D printing is a process that creates three-dimensional objects with extremely fine details and very smooth surfaces. The technology is used in numerous fields such as aerospace, dentistry and biomedical research. However, its level of precision comes at a steep cost. The tiny nozzles can cost more than $80 per tip and are made of metal or plastic, both of which are nonbiodegradable.</p>

<h2>Repurposing nature</h2>
<p>The McGill University researchers first explored traditional engineering solutions, but couldn&#39;t find a cost-effective, high-resolution, biodegradable nozzle. So they tasked a graduate student with finding an organ in nature that could serve as a tip.</p>
<p>After considering various structures such as insect stingers, snake fangs, and plant xylem vessels, they selected the female mosquito&#39;s proboscis.</p>
<p>This complex, multi-part feeding tube was the ideal candidate for several reasons. Its inner diameter is 20 micrometers, which is about 100% finer than the best commercially available tips. The stiff, nearly straight shape is perfect for stable printing, and the tube is strong enough to withstand the internal pressure of approximately 60 kilopascals before rupturing, sufficient for injecting thick bio-inks. And, of course, it is biodegradable.</p>

</figure><p>The team tested their &#34;bio-nozzle&#34; by building a custom 3D printer, called a 3D necroprinter. They mounted the mosquito proboscis on a standard dispensing tip and used it to deposit specialized bioinks.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge they had to overcome was the proboscis&#39;s low mechanical strength, which they did by testing it until it burst to create a safe operational guideline.</p>
<p>They then successfully printed bioscaffolds used to support cell growth and <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-02-3d-technique-replicates-nature-delicate.html?utm_source=embeddings&amp;utm_medium=related&amp;utm_campaign=internal" rel="related" target="_blank">high-resolution microstructures</a> with line widths as fine as 20 micrometers (about the width of half a human hair).</p>

<h2>From the lab to the real world</h2>
<p>The successful test shows that nature can serve as both an inspiration and a source of materials for next-generation technologies.</p>
<p>&#34;By introducing biotic materials as viable substitutes to complex engineered components, this work paves the way for sustainable and innovative solutions in advanced manufacturing and microengineering,&#34; write the scientists in their paper.</p>
<p>Among the next steps for the team is to look at other possible natural micro-dispense tips that offer greater strength or finer resolution. They also want to investigate how 3D necroprinting can be used in the real world, particularly in sustainable manufacturing and biomedical research.</p>
