<h2 data-block-key="zymlb">How you can help (the clock is ticking)</h2><h3 data-block-key="6vqtn">Written testimony by Sunday morning</h3><p data-block-key="au6kb"><a href="https://council.nyc.gov/testify/">You have a window of 72 hours after the hearing to submit written testimony on a bill heard in that hearing.</a> The hearing was March 30th at 10am, so <b>you have till Sunday, April 2nd, 10am Eastern Time</b> to submit it. (Krishnan&#39;s office would have given me a heads-up before the hearing, but stuff moved fast and they hadn&#39;t expected it could make it onto the agenda for yesterday.) <b>You do not need to be a New York City resident to submit testimony!</b> If you have expertise in health education or open data more generally, or can do 30 minutes of research about your area, you can help. You don&#39;t have to write a lot! A paragraph is fine.</p><p data-block-key="crli2">Put any or all of the following in your written testimony:</p><ol><li data-block-key="4j2f2"><i>Anybody: AED/PAD open data examples from other places.</i> Look up whether your city, region, state, or country has published its PAD registry. If so, what fields do they publish in their dataset, and how have the city and others reused, republished, and remixed that data?</li><li data-block-key="a9l3a"><i>Anybody: public health education</i>. What works to help people learn first aid facts (from your personal experience <i>or</i> from research and expertise), and how could open PAD data help? Especially if we can help address historical inequities (poverty, race, gender, etc.). Bonus: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam">analyze data on leading causes of death in NYC</a>.</li><li data-block-key="5pjko"><i>Anybody: AEDs can be used effectively without training.</i> During the hearing, a DOHMH assistant commissioner mentioned concerns that AED users need training to use AEDs effectively. But bystanders (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa020932">even untrained ones</a>) who use AEDs on victims can save lives; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008654/">&#34;Application of an AED in communities is associated with nearly a doubling of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&#34;</a> Share that and similar research.</li><li data-block-key="2as2v"><i>Anybody: NYC REMSCO already has this data.</i> In the hearing, DOHMH said they don&#39;t have this data; they do have access to it via NYC REMSCO. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/foi/#AED-NYS-DOH">what I&#39;ve learned about the PAD registry through Freedom of Information requests</a>.</li><li data-block-key="agm4p"><i>Anybody: open data publication advice</i>. Suggest text for amendments to the bill, or implementation advice for DOHMH, to get them the data from NYC REMSCO, ensure we open appropriate data, and reduce unnecessary labor by DOHMH staff.

Lots of people die when AEDs could have saved them. And this is more important than ever: COVID has weakened a lot of people&#39;s cardiovascular systems and led to more heart attacks.
