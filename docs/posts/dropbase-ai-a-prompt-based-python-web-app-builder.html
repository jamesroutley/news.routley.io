    <p>The inimitable <a href="https://www.raphlee.com/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">Raph Lee</a> interviewed me on the second episode of his podcast,  Building AI Products. I love this podcast concept because it&#39;s about the nitty-gritty technical details of getting these products out the door‚Äîa framing I don&#39;t see talked about nearly enough. </p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve been interviewed about running teams and doing data work. It was really fun! I&#39;d love to do more of these. </p><h2 id="listener-feedback">Listener Feedback</h2><p>My favorite part has been hearing from listeners, so if you got something out of it, I&#39;d love to <a href="https://sashalaundy.com/contact/" rel="noreferrer">hear from you</a>! So far I&#39;ve heard: </p><ul><li>a lot of followup questions about using the Shape Up framework to structure and prioritize work</li><li>&#34;it&#39;s really interesting how you use <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">design thinking</a> to hone the scope of machine learning products. I&#39;m user researcher and didn&#39;t realize my skills could be used that way.&#34;</li><li>&#34;I will literally use this tomorrow!!&#34; and then when I followed up a couple days later: &#34;I showed this to my boss, and we used the questions to guide a stakeholder away from a dashboard they were requesting, but didn&#39;t actually need. We built them something better.&#34; Add 1 to my running Misguided Dashboard Kill Count, please and thank you üèÜ</li></ul><h2 id="show-notes">Show Notes</h2><blockquote>Sasha is one of those wonderful high-IQ, high-EQ, left-right-brained people who&#39;s both super technical and a great people manager.</blockquote><h2 id="listen-to-the-show">Listen to the show</h2><figure><a href="https://buildingaiproducts.show/?ref=sashalaundy.com"><div><p>Building AI Products Podcast</p><p>Building AI Products is a practical podcast for AI, machine learning, and data science practitioners.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.beacons.ai/user_content/8ME2COrKJOWVW3r5Ebl9HxMNtys1/favicon.webp?t=1712100587528" alt=""/><span>Beacons</span></p></div><p><img src="https://cdn.beacons.ai/user_content/8ME2COrKJOWVW3r5Ebl9HxMNtys1/profile_buildingaiproducts.png?t=1712099997098" alt=""/></p></a></figure><p>If you found it useful and want to share, you can boost <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/raphaeltlee_ai-datascience-machinelearning-activity-7181333928945856512-ztTj/?ref=sashalaundy.com" rel="noreferrer">Raph&#39;s post on LinkedIn</a> if you like. </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p>
