Should responses that basically boil down to &#34;I asked $LLM about $X, and here is what $LLM said:&#34; be allowed on HN, and the guidelines updated to state that people shouldn&#39;t critique it (similar to other guidelines currently), or should a new guideline be added to ask people from refrain from copy-pasting large LLM responses into the comments, or something else completely?</p></div></div></div>
