<p><strong>Started</strong>: January 2025</p>



<p><strong>Overview</strong>: CS50P is Harvard University’s introduction to programming with Python, available free as OpenCourseWare. From the course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/">welcome</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Each week of the course includes a video lecture taught by <a href="https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/">David J. Malan</a>, section, and shorts, as well as a problem set. If you register for the course through edX, you can submit the problem sets for feedback and receive a certificate after completing the course.</p>



<p><strong>My Story</strong>: During my first week at the Recurse Center, <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-4-building-your-volitional-muscles/">I decided</a> to prioritize improving my Python skills. Since I loved the <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/review-cs50x-introduction-to-computer-science/">CS50x course</a>, I decided to work through CS50P.</p>



<p>The CS50P lectures don’t have the quite the same energy that the CS50x lectures have. Instead of a live audience of students attending in person, we see a few puppets watching the lecture instead. It seems like the lectures were given live to a remote audience, since there are audio questions from students from time to time. </p>



<p>That said, David Malan’s teaching is consistently engaging and clear and the problem sets were both fun and challenging. The online notes are a great resource, and frequently include links to the official Python documentation, which I tried to use as much as possible. The early weeks of the course were a good review and opportunity to practice for me, since I had some experience with Python already from CS50x, but later on in the course I learned things like how to write unit tests and work with regular expressions that were new to me. I found the regular expressions problem set to be <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-37-gamma-regexes/">the most challenging</a> for me in the course.</p>



<p>For my final project I created a program called <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/bookmark-analyzer">Bookmark Analyzer</a>, a command-line program to sort links and remove duplicates from a bookmarks export TXT or HTML file.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I can definitely recommend CS50P to anyone who is new to Python. I still have more to learn but I think this course gave me an excellent foundation for continuing to program in Python.</p>
