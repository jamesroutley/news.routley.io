    <h1>Firefox is fine. The people running it are not</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> Dominance does not equal importance, nor is dominance the same as relevance. The snag at Mozilla is a management layer that doesn&#39;t appear to understand what works for its product nor which parts of it matter most to users.</p>
<p>It is very rare for an article on <em>The Register</em> to cause friends of mine to contact me and anxiously ask if they should change their choice of tech, but SJVN&#39;s recent column, &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/17/opinion_column_firefox/">Firefox is dead to me</a>,&#34; did it.</p>

<p>I am not here to shoot the messenger. Steven&#39;s core point is correct. Firefox is in a bit of a mess – but, seriously, not such a bad mess. You&#39;re still better off with it – or one of its forks, because this is FOSS – than pretty much any of the alternatives.</p>
<p>Like many things, unfortunately, much of computing is run on feelings, tradition, and group loyalties, when it should use facts, evidence, and hard numbers. Don&#39;t bother saying Firefox is getting slower. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s faster than it has been in years. Phoronix, the go-to site for benchmarks on FOSS stuff, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/firefox-benchmarks-120-141" rel="nofollow">just benchmarked 21 versions</a>, and from late 2023 to now, Firefox has steadily got faster and faster.</p>
<p>GNOME Shell is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/08/gnome_45_esm_extensions/">built in JavaScript</a>. As we detailed when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/17/gnome_project_25/">GNOME turned 25</a>, that JavaScript is executed by <a target="_blank" href="https://gjs.guide/" rel="nofollow">GJS</a>, which uses the Mozilla JS runtime. Regular readers will have spotted that <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk is not a big fan of GNOME, but when we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/24/gnome_48/">looked at version 48</a>, we commented that it felt like it was the fastest version in years.</p>

    

<p>Don&#39;t blame the app, and don&#39;t even blame the programmers. That is, the ones who still have jobs, after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/02/02/mozilla_ends_iot_project_cuts_staff/">years of engineer layoffs</a>. Don&#39;t even blame the whole organization – blame the management. Steven himself has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/09/opinion_column_mozilla_ceo_quits/">pointed this out before</a>, early in 2024. So have I. In 2023, I said that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/29/mozilla_asleep_at_wheel/">Mozilla was asleep at the wheel</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>Mozilla has missed so many boats that it&#39;s not even funny to catalog them, but sadly, I must.</p>
<p>Last year, the Stack Overflow <a target="_blank" href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages" rel="nofollow">survey said</a>:</p>

<p>Rust was developed at Mozilla. Mozilla axed it. In 2020, it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/18/rust_new_foundation/">laid off the whole team</a>.</p>
<p>As I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">reported back in 2023</a>, the Servo browser engine is doing well. Early this year, its <a target="_blank" href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/01/31/servo-in-2024/" rel="nofollow">own figures</a> show strong continued upticks in interest since Igalia took over development. You guessed it – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/18/firefox_83/">Mozilla also gave Servo the boot in 2020</a>.</p>

        

<p>It sort of had to. Servo is written in Rust, and Mozilla axed the Rust team, so that meant bye-bye Servo. It adds up in a demented sort of way, if someone were trying to work out the worst possible directions to turn. As the web gets bigger than ever, as a global pandemic means everyone&#39;s working from home and shopping remotely, obviously the oldest browser engine maker should <em>deep-six its next-gen browser engine</em>. Instead, it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/mozilla_unveils_a_subscriptionbased_vpn/">tried to sell a VPN</a>.</p>
<p>2020 is the same year <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cathaycapital.com/internet-access-for-the-next-billion-people-meet-kaios-the-company-taking-on-the-global-digital-divide/" rel="nofollow">Cathay Capital invested $50 million</a> into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaiostech.com/" rel="nofollow">KaiOStech</a>, saying it would help bring the next billion people online. As <em>The Register</em> reported in 2018, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/28/kaios_google_investment/">KaiOS is Boot2Gecko</a>, Mozilla&#39;s FirefoxOS rebranded. Mozilla <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/12/08/firefox_os_phones_dead/">killed its own version in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the web runs on advertising, as it has for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2006/09/29/internet_advertising_booms/">20-plus years</a>. And yes, that does include <em>The Reg</em>, although we try to keep them from being too brash. We writers face lots of ads, too, and that&#39;s why more and more of us run ad-blockers, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/02/iab_uk_ad_blocking_survey/">in the UK</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/27/america_ad_blocker/">the US</a>. <em>El Reg</em> even tries to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/08/pi_hole_6_flyby/">help you do it</a>.</p>

        

<p>You might think Mozilla would, say, buy and integrate an ad-blocker. Acquiring ad-blocking companies <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/10/02/adblock_flogged_off_to_mystery_buyer/">has been a thing for a decade</a>. Other browsers integrate ad-blocking, and you don&#39;t even need <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/03/zorin_os_173/">something controversial like Brave</a> – for instance, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/22/vivaldi_v3_ad_blocking/">Vivaldi has offered it for years</a>. Many of the team behind Vivaldi previously made Opera, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/10/opera_adds_adblocking_browser_firm_lives_off_ads/">it blocked ads too</a>. (Soon afterwards, the company <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/07/18/no_12bn_opera_buyout/">sold it to a Chinese group</a>.)</p>
<p>But no. Instead, Mozilla goes and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/18/mozilla_buys_anonym_betting_privacy/">buys an ad firm</a> and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/02/mozilla_introduces_terms_of_use/">removes its promise not to sell your data</a>. Once again, it&#39;s as if the leadership were actively trying to work out the worst direction to turn.</p>
<p>Mozilla is, sadly, far from alone in having faltering leadership. Around the industry, tech execs who couldn&#39;t tell an LLM bot from an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/20/crypto_ponzi_scheme_cofounder_pleads/">MLM scheme</a> if their lives depended on it are investing in AI. It&#39;s not just cool, it&#39;s a cult now. This isn&#39;t hyperbole. The phenomenon has a name – <a target="_blank" href="https://montrealethics.ai/the-tescreal-bundle-eugenics-and-the-promise-of-utopia-through-artificial-general-intelligence/" rel="nofollow">it&#39;s called TESCREAL</a>, and it is without exaggeration on its way to <a target="_blank" href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/silicon-valleys-obsession-with-ai-looks-a-lot-like-religion/" rel="nofollow">becoming a religion</a>.</p>
<p>All this, of course, despite the facts that AI <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/22/ai_pcs_productivity/">makes PCs less productive</a>, it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/13/cloud_costs_ai_inferencing/">doesn&#39;t help enterprises</a>, and it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/17/ai_not_doing_its_job/">doesn&#39;t do its job</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/09/gartner_simply_replacing_hold_music/">customers are not keen</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/02/call_center_ai_assistants/">staffers are not keen</a>. Service centers are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/gartner_ai_customer_service/">giving up on it</a>, and across the industry, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/13/cloud_costs_ai_inferencing/">adoption is stalling</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Mozilla&#39;s leadership is directionless and flailing because it&#39;s never had to do, or be, anything else. It&#39;s never needed to know how to make a profit, because it never had to make a profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whither Mozilla? Oh, it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/03/mozilla_developer_network_adds_ai/">built a bot into its docs server</a> in 2023, then promptly had to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/06/mozilla_ai_explain_shift/">turn it off again</a>. Its chief product officer was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/02/mozilla_in_2024_ai_privacy/">quite gung-ho about AI</a> in early 2024. He left the company soon afterwards, and later <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/24/mozilla_product_chief_sues_over/">alleged he was pushed out</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, Mozilla made more layoffs and announced it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/14/mozilla_layoffs_ai_pivot/">would invest in open source AI</a>. This year, Mozilla finally integrated a vertical tab bar into Firefox and, you guessed it, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/04/firefox_136/">built an AI chatbot into it</a>. You can, at least, <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/wo/questions/1497223" rel="nofollow">turn it off</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s no longer the fault of long-term CEO Mitchell Baker, she of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/02/mozilla_in_2024_ai_privacy/">six-million-bucks salary</a>. She took the cash and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/09/mozilla_ceo_mitchell_baker_departs/">left in February 2024</a>. After the February 2024 layoffs that went with the &#34;open source AI&#34; announcement, in November, new boss Laura Chambers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/06/mozilla_foundation_layoffs/">laid off another third of the staff</a>, but somehow found the money to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/new-executives/" rel="nofollow">hire new executives</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Money is the problem. Not too little, but too much. Where there&#39;s wealth, there&#39;s a natural human desire to make more wealth. Ever since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2004/10/25/firefox_countdown/">Firefox 1.0 in 2004</a>, Firefox has never had to compete. It&#39;s been attached like a <a target="_blank" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/far-side-mosquito-joke-FIZD1" rel="nofollow">mosquito to an artery</a> to the Google cash firehose. <em>The Reg</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2007/10/25/mozilla_releases_2006_financial_statement/">noted it in 2007</a>, and it made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/11/20/mozilla_2007_financials/">more the next year</a>. We were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/11/09/mozilla_on_google/">dubious when Firefox turned five</a>.</p>
<p>And as for that money — remember back in 2018? That&#39;s when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/09/04/google_at_20/">Google dropped &#34;Don&#39;t be evil&#34;</a> as its motto.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#39;s leadership is directionless and flailing because it&#39;s never had to do, or be, anything else. It&#39;s never needed to know how to make a profit, because it never had to make a profit. It&#39;s no wonder it has no real direction or vision or clue: it never needed them. It&#39;s role-playing being a business.</p>
<p>Like we said, don&#39;t blame the app. You&#39;re still better off with Firefox or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/04/waterfox_firefox_fork/">a fork such as Waterfox</a>. Chrome even snoops on you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/30/opinion_browser/">when in incognito mode</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/06/chrome_web_store_warns_end/">as we warned you</a>, Google <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/google_v2_eol_v3_rollout/">removed the APIs ad-blocker extensions used</a>. You still get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/ublock_firefox_chrome_issues/">better ad-blocking in Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>We can point at what we&#39;d like to see, sure. Did you know there&#39;s already a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" rel="nofollow">special developer&#39;s edition</a>? No web designer is building on Firefox first any more. We&#39;re lucky if they even test on it. All the functionality attached to Firefox&#39;s &#34;Browser tools&#34; sub-menu should be unceremoniously ripped out, banished to the developer&#39;s edition.</p>
<p>Stop copying Chrome. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/11/20/firefox_reveals_new_look_rounded_rectangles/">Australis theme in 2013</a> is what drove the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.palemoon.org/" rel="nofollow">Pale Moon</a> project to fork the code. The all-in-one <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Seamonkey project</a> still exists, too. We occasionally use its WYSIWYG HTML editor – even today, there&#39;s nothing else like it. It <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/10/28/mozilla_seamonkey_2point0/">used to be official</a>. Maybe it should be again.</p>
<p>The Pidgin cross-platform chat app is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/13/pidgin_chat_client_uopdate/">working on a major new version</a>. Good for them, but it will probably drop all its old connectors. They work via <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple" rel="nofollow">LibPurple</a>, which is still in active maintenance, unlike the Mozilla wrapper <a target="_blank" href="http://instantbird.com/" rel="nofollow">InstantBird</a>. (There used to be a Mozilla music player, too, <a target="_blank" href="https://getsongbird.net/" rel="nofollow">Songbird</a>. That&#39;s long dead, as is its fork, <a target="_blank" href="http://getnightingale.com/" rel="nofollow">Nightingale</a>.)</p>
<p>Mozilla can press on with independent subprojects such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/30/mozilla_thunderbird_has_a_new_nest/">Thunderbird owners MZLA Technologies Corporation</a>. The popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest" rel="nofollow">Electron framework</a> is based on Chromium. It&#39;s too late to change that, even if maybe <a target="_blank" href="https://servo.org/" rel="nofollow">Servo</a> may one day offer an alternative. But if Thunderbird sucked in Libpurple, it wouldn&#39;t matter if Slack and Teams and so on used Electron, as Thunderbird could talk to the servers directly.</p>
<p>But pointing at what we&#39;d like to see is attempting to treat the symptoms and not the disease. Is there a way to encourage Mozilla to be an organized, focused, professional business, with eyes keenly set on a clearly defined goal? Perhaps that&#39;s the wrong question. Perhaps that shouldn&#39;t be the goal at all. For all that the Linux business is huge, no company develops the kernel. They all cooperate on it. The Linux Foundation funds it, but doesn&#39;t really guide it.</p>
<p>One observer has been spectating and commentating on Mozilla since before it was a foundation – one of its original co-developers, Jamie Zawinksi. He has been accurately cataloging Mozilla&#39;s failings for years. In 2022, he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/01/mozilla-blinked/" rel="nofollow">called it out</a> for accepting cryptocurrency donations (or Dunning-Krugerrands, as he calls them). In 2023, he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/03/this-makes-sense-because-large-language-models-are-also-a-petroleum-product/" rel="nofollow">attacked Mozilla&#39;s first AI move</a> as well as its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/12/remember-when-mozilla-made-a-web-browser/" rel="nofollow">executive remuneration</a>. In early 2024, he criticized its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/my-dinosaur-just-threw-up-in-its-mouth-a-little/" rel="nofollow">formation of an investment arm</a>. In mid-2024, he pointed out its &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/06/mozillas-original-sin/" rel="nofollow">Original Sin</a>&#34; of adopting digital rights management. And in late 2024, its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/10/mozillas-ceo-doubles-down-on-them-being-an-advertising-company-now/" rel="nofollow">move to selling ads</a>.</p>
<p>Zawinski has repeatedly said:</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the only viable resolution.</p>
<p>Mozilla, for all its many failings, has invented a lot of amazing tech, from Rust to Servo to the leading budget phone OS. It shouldn&#39;t be trying to capitalize on this stuff. Maybe encourage it to have semi-independent spinoffs, such as Thunderbird, and as KaiOS ought to be, and as Rust could have been.</p>
<p>But Zawinski has the only clear vision and solution we&#39;ve seen yet. Perhaps he&#39;s right, and Mozilla should be a nonprofit, working to fund the one independent, non-vendor-driven, standards-compliant browser engine. ®</p>
