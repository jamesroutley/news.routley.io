            <p>I didnâ€™t get to play too many different games this year. Part of the reason is because I was absorbed with work, tennis, and a never-ending kitchen renovation (which deserves its own post), and a variety of other projects. The other reason is because Zelda is so damn good that it absorbed what little game playing time I had. Anyways, enjoy!</p>
