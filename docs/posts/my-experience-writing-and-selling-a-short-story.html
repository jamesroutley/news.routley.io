Among other things, I thought about what the future of arranged marriage and the caste system might look like. I also explored a future where whole cultures were wiped out and kept alive within computer simulations or theme parks. This latter idea, plus my life-long love of everything Michael Crichton has ever written, especially </span><em>Jurassic Park</em><span>, eventually became India World.</span></p><h3>How I wrote it</h3><ul><li><p>11/10/2019 - Brainstormed the initial idea.</p></li><li><p>11/23 - 12/8/2019 - Outlined the story, and wrote a rough first draft.</p></li><li><p><span>12/8 - 12/15/2019 - Revised draft, submitted </span><a href="https://sudowriters.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">to my critique group</a><span> for feedback from </span><a href="https://www.jamesyu.org" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">James</a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tharkibo" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Thea</a><span>, </span><a href="https://sahillavingia.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Sahil</a><span>, and </span><a href="http://danshipper.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Dan</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>12/15/2019 - 2/2/2020 - Edits.</p></li><li><p>12/16/2019 - Submitted draft to OnlineWritingWorkshop.com, a peer review site where writers exchange critiques.</p></li><li><p>1/2/2020 - “India World” was selected as an “Editor’s Choice” on OnlineWritingWorkshop, where an eloquently written editorial review argued that it had problematic themes. For instance, that Rohit&#39;s triumphant choice to return home sounded lot like white American &#34;immigrants go home&#34;. I proceeded to freaked out and spent the following weeks fixing.</p></li><li><p><span>2/</span><strong>2</strong><span>/2020 - Sent a draft to my critique group at the Futurescapes workshop.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2/3/2020 - Sent a draft to </span><a href="https://critters.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Critters</a><span>, another peer review group for spec fiction. I got helpful feedback from a dozen folks, including detailed notes from </span><a href="https://www.laurenbanka.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Lauren Banka</a><span> and Dwayne Minton.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2/13/2020 - Got feedback from my friend </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nickbaum" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Nick Baum</a><span>, who’s helped with nearly all of my stories so far. </span></p></li><li><p><span>2/17/2020 - Got feedback from </span><a href="http://www.kathowardbooks.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Kat Howard</a><span>. In particular, that Rohit’s motives for his actions in the ending weren’t believable.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2/17/2020 - Got feedback from my Futurescapes critique group (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/AshleaNAdams" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ashlea</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.katrinacarruth.com" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Katrina</a><span>, Olive, </span><a href="https://railwaywriter.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tali</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15759834.Tyra_Tanner" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tyra</a><span>). They offered suggestions for tightening the story, improving imagery, and fixing the ending (came too quickly, needed foreshadowing.) At this point I had Rohit returning to the USA to start “America World” in response to his time at India World. This had given some earlier readers Make America Great Again vibes, so I still wasn’t happy with the ending.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2/18/2020 - Got feedback from </span><strong><a href="https://maryrobinettekowal.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mary Robinette Kowal</a></strong><span> 🤩 (Hugo and Nebula winner, head of the SFWA) at Futurescapes. She suggested several improvements including a new ending that I loved.</span></p></li><li><p>2/21/2020 - Rewrote the ending to its current version.</p></li><li><p><span>2/24/2020 - Sent “India World” as my writing sample for my applications to </span><strong>Clarion UCSD</strong><span> and </span><strong>Clarion West</strong><span>. (These are competitive six-week workshops for spec fiction writers; their alumni list reads like a Who’s Who of Sci-Fi. This was my second year applying and I didn’t expect to get in.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>2/25/2020 - On a lark, submitted a draft to </span><a href="https://hughhowey.com/open-for-submissions/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">an open call</a><span> by </span><strong>Hugh Howey</strong><span> 🤩. (He wrote the best-selling Silo series and is one of the most popular self-published authors ever.) I didn’t expect anything to come of this.</span></p></li><li><p>2/26/2020 - One day later, Hugh wrote to say he loved the story and attached a marked-up manuscript with many suggestions I used. He also offered to publish it in a future anthology if I didn’t publish it elsewhere. (!) This made me pretty excited about this story finding a good home.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png" width="1392" height="1074" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1074,&#34;width&#34;:1392,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:325510,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fa0327d-0ce2-431e-b2ef-4fb73c0c9856_1392x1074.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div></li><li><p><span>3/8/2020 - Got feedback from my bud Sameem Siddiqui.

Here’s why:</p><ul><li><p>The number of publications seems to shrinks each year, but the number of submissions has increased.</p></li><li><p>Acceptance rates at the best pubs are very, very low.</p></li><li><p>Many publications don’t allow simultaneous submissions. That means if you send a story to magazine A, you can’t submit it elsewhere until you get a rejection from magazine A. That could take days, but more likely weeks or months. Some of the best pubs take the longest.</p></li></ul><p>My strategy is to apply to the long-long-long-shot pubs that accept simultaneous subs first. Then I start submitting to pubs that disallow simultaneous submissions, starting with the most prestigious, fastest-rejecting ones. The faster you’re rejected, the faster you can send it elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Submitting is a numbers game.

I worried I was being a nag, but writers I talked to encouraged me to keep checking in every month. No word back during this period. I’m guessing they didn’t know where it was going to slot in yet and were swamped.</span></p></li></ul><p><em>1 year, 5 months since contract signing…</em></p><ul><li><p>2/7/2022 - Emailed Tor asking for an update on publication date. The original contract allowed me to take rights back if it wasn’t published within 12 months of the contract signing,  Almost a year and a half in, with no word for nine months, I was starting to think it wouldn’t be published by Tor after all and wanted to make alternate plans. (No hard feelings, plans and priorities change. But I still wanted to get the story out there!)</p></li><li><p>3/10/2022 - I screwed up the courage to email Devi (VP at Tor) to see if she knew the pub date.

I needed to learn how to format my manuscript, how to find quality critiques, how to submit to publishers, how to network with other writers, and all the rest. Countless other writers took the time to answer my emails and take meetings and read crappy drafts and tell me what was wrong with them.</p><p>I’m so grateful for all the ways the writing community has helped me, and I’m hopeful this post proves helpful to others getting started.</p><p><span> 👋 Liked this?
