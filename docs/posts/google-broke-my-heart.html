    <h1>Google broke my heart</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>For years, I thought of Google as a <strong>trustworthy helper on the Web</strong>. Especially where it mattered most, removing pirated copies of my books from Google search results. After <a href="https://books.perishablepress.com/" title="Perishable Press Books">publishing a new book</a>, I would monitor the search results and file a <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> notice with Google whenever the inevitable <strong>pirated copies of my book</strong> were listed. Google always was very helpful in this regard, swiftly removing any pirated books <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">asap</abbr>. No hassle, no hoops, just immediate and direct relief from Google.</p>

<h3>Welcome to 2026..</h3>
<p>Recently, I asked Google to remove a pirated copy of my book from their search index. As usual, I filled out the obligatory <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> report and sent it in, hopeful that it was just a matter of time before the <strong>copyright infringement</strong> was dealt with by the trustworthy and <strong>very capable</strong> Google search team.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Instead of simply de-indexing the search result, like they do for so many other items, Google <strong>refused to acknowledge</strong> that I was the author of the book. After receiving my <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> complaint, they replied:</p>
<p>We are unsure whether you are authorized to submit a copyright removal request for the content in question. Only the copyright owner or their authorized representative can submit a copyright removal request. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is copyright infringing. […]</p>
<p>Okay, so ..<strong>not the response I was hoping for</strong>.. basically a complete denial of my identity and thinly veiled threat of legal action for having the audacity to report the pirated content in the first place. But no problem, maybe they have a new process for validating <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> requests. So I replied back <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">asap</abbr> <strong>asking how to prove my identity</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes it is me, Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book in question. Please let me know if any further information is needed, thank you.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that email to do much, other than prompt Google to <strong>explain how to prove my identity</strong>, so that they would take action and stop promoting the pirated copy of my book in their search results. After a couple more days of waiting, The Google Team replied back:</p>
<p>It is unclear to us how you came to own the copyright for the content in question, because you do not appear to be the creator of the content. […] please explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership.</p>
<p>Without acknowledging my previous reply regarding identity, now they are questioning my copyright ownership. Without explaining <strong>how</strong> to prove copyright ownership, they simply throw another hurdle at me, asking me to “explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership”. At this point, I am stressed, exhausted, and feeling very frustrated. <strong>Where was the friendly Google from days past</strong>?</p>
<h3>Holding out hope..</h3>
<p>Okay I thought, gotta really step this up and prove to The Google Team that I am who I claim, and that <strong>I am in fact the author of the book and thus own the copyright</strong>. But I wasn’t sure how to do this, because again they did not explain “how” to do so. Did they want a scan of my driver’s license? Blood sample? <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> test results? I mean, why the mystery? If some sort of identity or proof is required for Google to take action, shouldn’t it have been required on the DMCA form?</p>
<p><strong>Feeling frustrated and stressed</strong> about the apparent run-around and lack of concern, I replied back with plenty of evidence and clues that yes, I am Jeff Starr, and yes, the book belongs to me, and thus I own the copyright. <em>Message truncated for clarity.</em></p>
<div>
<p>My name is Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book […]. As explained in the filed report, Google is promoting copyright infringement of my book in its search results.</p>
<p>How can I prove my identity? Please explain what I need to do in order to get help with this copyright infringement. Surely there must be some protocol for proving identity/ownership, please let me know what that is, what are your requirements for taking action against someone who is violating my copyright?</p>
<p>If it helps, here are my book-related websites, which are all owned and authored by me, Jeff Starr: [..List of like five websites, including the site for the pirated book..]</p>
<p>You can verify that these sites are owned by me, simply check my account via Google Search Console, where I have verified that I am the owner for each of the above sites. My Search Console is associated with this same email account from which I am replying to your email. […]</p>
<p>I am a well-known author and web developer in the WordPress community. You can find me on social media, I have a list of my social-media channels pinned on my X account (first displayed post): https://x.com/perishable</p>
<p>The reported copyright infringement is costing me money and time. I am very frustrated and stressed because of Google’s apparent lack of concern. Please help, let me know what you need from me in order to remove the stolen book from your search results.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, I was feeling ignored and betrayed by Google, who for many years <strong>proved a trusted ally</strong>. Apparently something has changed, as the friendly corporate giant who once helped small publishers and content creators now <strong>refused to even acknowledge</strong> their existence. As if, surely you could not be who you claim, an author and small book publisher looking for our help. After all, <strong>We are Google</strong> — a massive organization that uses your content to fill our search results and pay our salaries.</p>
<h3>Heartbroken..</h3>
<p>Even after spending much time and heartache trying to get Google’s help, I held out hope. Hope that Google was still the <strong>benevolent helper</strong> that I once knew, years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> after two more days of nervous anticipation, Google finally replied to my lengthy probably desperate sounding email that was full of personal details and proofs of my identity and copyright ownership. A small surge of adrenaline as I clicked to hear back from The Google Team (emphasis mine):</p>
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>At this time, <strong>Google has decided not to take action</strong> on the following URLs: […]</p>

</div>
<p><strong>And there it was</strong>. A simple <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> request trying to remove copyright infringement from search results completely and utterly <strong>shrugged off by Google</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Immediately my heart sank</strong>. And I knew that something had changed at Google’s core. The friendly corporate giant no longer would even deign to <strong>consider</strong> cries for help from the little guy. The little guy being <em>me</em>, the little guy with a broken heart. </p>
