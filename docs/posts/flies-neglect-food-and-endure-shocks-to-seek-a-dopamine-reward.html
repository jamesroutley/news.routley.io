<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>The research</span><span> team</span><span>, </span><span>which included </span><span>DPAG </span><span>DPhil</span><span> student </span><span>and second author </span></span><a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/../../team/lucille-duquenoy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none"><span>Lucille </span><span>Duquenoy</span></span></a><span data-contrast="none"><span>, </span><span>used optogenetics to activate a</span><span> subset of reward-encoding dopamine neurons together with an odour. In the confocal microscopy image above, these dopaminergic neurons (in white) target the mushroom body (in blue), the centre of olfactory learning and memory in the fly </span><span>brain. Prior work suggests that these dopamine neurons are highly diverse and ordinarily convey different reward types as parallel teaching signals to the mushroom body.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<div>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Using optogenetic activation, </span><span>the team </span><span>discovered </span><span>that they</span><span> </span><span>could generate olfactory associations that starved flies would </span><span>seek</span><span> while neglecting food or enduring electric shocks. </span><span>This</span><span> </span><span>was not </span><span>observed</span><span> </span><span>when flies </span><span>were trained </span><span>to associate an odour with the activation of other neurons in the brain or with a natural reward such as sugar. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>The researchers</span><span> </span><span>discovered that flies took risks to endure shock while seeking reward because the dopamine neurons that ordinarily signal electric shock punishment were functionally impaired by prior activation of the reward-encoding dopamine neurons. This revealed antagonism between reward-encoding and punishment-encoding dopamine neurons in the brain.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Ordinarily, reward-encoding dopamine neurons are thought to send teaching signals to the mushroom body to reinforce </span><span>olfactory </span><span>associative learning. However, starved flies sought sugar less even </span><span>after </span><span>the reward-encoding dopamine neurons </span><span>were activated </span><span>in the absence of odour. This suggested that the dopamine neurons also convey satiety-like </span><span>‘</span><span>demotivational </span><span>signals</span><span>’</span><span>.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Since flies ordinarily do not neglect food or endure shock to seek reward, </span><span>the team </span><span>reasoned that the activity of these dopamine neurons must ordinarily be tightly controlled. </span><span>In the paper, t</span><span>he </span><span>authors </span><span>present </span><span>physiological and anatomical evidence that this is indeed the case. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Calcium imaging of these dopamine neurons using two-photon microscopy revealed that the dopamine neurons convey signals that are specific to both reward type and the physiological state of the fly. </span><span>The researchers </span><span>also </span><span>observed</span><span> calcium responses that resembled teaching signals and satiety-like signals in these neurons. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Moreover, using the latest connectome data of the fly hemibrain, </span><span>the </span><span>authors</span><span> </span><span>found that the reward-encoding dopamine neurons (</span><span>approximately </span><span>60 in total) receive inputs from over 1700 neurons from all over the brain (visualized in the connectome image below). This is over 25 times as many inputs</span><span>, suggesting that these dopamine neurons have elaborate input controls</span><span>.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>With all this evidence, </span><span>Professor </span><span>Scott </span><span>Waddell and Dr </span><span>Kristijan </span><span>Jovanoski</span><span> </span><span>propose that these heterogeneously rich reward-encoding dopamine neurons are ordinarily tightly controlled by upstream neurons that convey reward type and physiological state. </span><span>Optogenetically</span><span> activating these dopamine neurons bypasses their elaborate input control and destroys the reward-specificity and state-specificity of their signalling. Consequently, flies seek a non-specific reward that is greater than the sum of individual rewards, leading to supranormal reward </span><span>seeking</span><span> despite electric shocks or physiological needs.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><span>Given that there are many parallels between the dopamine neurons of flies and mammals, </span><span>the </span><span>authors</span><span> </span><span>propose that the mechanisms discovered here may similarly apply towards understanding unconstrained reward-seeking behaviour and substance use disorders in mammals.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p>
