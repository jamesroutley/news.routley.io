        </h2>

        <p>The Amber language is deeply inspired by Smalltalk. It is designed to make client-side development faster
                and easier.
                Amber includes a live development environment with a class browser, workspace, unit test runner,
                transcript, object inspector and debugger.</p>

        <p>Amber is written in itself, including the compiler, and compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping
                one-to-one with the JS equivalent.</p>

  <h2>Amber...</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>So...What is it about again?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber is a language (derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>) and environment built for the web.</p>
With Amber, client-side web development finally gets the power and productivity that exists in other Smalltalk dialects.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why should I care?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Having a true live &amp; incremental development environment where you can build your application interactively in the browser is unbeatable.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Why a Smalltalk dialect?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Smalltalk stands head and shoulders above most other languages for clarity, conciseness, and human-friendliness.</p>
      <p>As a language, it is immensely clean and mature, both syntactically and semantically. It is a pure OO language, with objects all the way down.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>But what about all the JS ecosystem?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Amber plays very well with the outer world. You can interact with JavaScript objects seamlessly, and even inspect them as any Amber object.</p>
      <p>Evaluating JavaScript object methods is transparent and makes using libraries a breeze.</p>
    </dd>

  It&#39;s a 3D WebGL game engine that is very easy to get to work with Amber. Specifically though I am using its WebVR integration.  This is a pretty nice way to do VR development.  Being able to take the headset off, change a method, and then put the headset back on without having to restart is pretty nice.
