    <h1>US Supreme Court&#39;s dog toy ruling puts parody products on notice</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">June 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court handed brand owners a win against parody products on Thursday when it <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-rules-jack-daniels-fight-over-parody-dog-toy-2023-06-08/">ruled</a> that &#34;Bad Spaniels&#34; dog toys resembling Jack Daniel&#39;s whiskey bottles are not shielded by the U.S. Constitution from the liquor maker&#39;s trademark lawsuit.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">The decision is likely to force companies to toe a more careful line when making commercial products that mimic other brands for the sake of parody, legal experts said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">VIP Products had argued that the First Amendment protected its toys&#39; poop-themed variations on Jack Daniel&#39;s famous label and bottle design, which it described as commentary on alcohol brands&#39; &#34;self-serious bombardment of consumers with advertising&#34; and dog owners&#39; &#34;joyful humanization of their pets.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">But in a 9-0 decision, the justices said a precedent known as the Rogers test for assessing the use of trademarks in artistic expression did not apply to VIP&#39;s products, reversing a U.S. appeals court and raising the bar for parodies to survive trademark claims.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The Rogers test is &#34;not appropriate when the accused infringer has used a trademark to designate the source of its own goods - in other words, has used a trademark as a trademark,&#34; Justice Elena Kagan wrote.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Kagan contrasted the case with situations where she said applying the Rogers test was justified, including when Danish pop group Aqua&#39;s label MCA Records defeated a trademark lawsuit by Mattel over the band&#39;s song &#34;Barbie Girl.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#34;On the one hand, this is a victory for artists,&#34; said Megan Bannigan, a partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. Bannigan said the decision is &#34;also a victory for brands&#34; because it clarifies that the Rogers test does not apply when branding is being used as a typical trademark to identify a source of goods without permission.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">VIP had conceded that it used &#34;Bad Spaniels&#34; as a trademark. But the high court provided little guidance on where to draw the line between a trademark use and a non-trademark use that could be subject to the Rogers test, Bannigan said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Doug Masters, a partner at Loeb &amp; Loeb, said the decision suggested parody products accused of infringement may not be able to rely on the Rogers test if they are &#34;intended to be a commercial product, even if there&#39;s some expression beyond just the commerce part of it.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Masters said the decision could force companies that want to engage in parodies to ink licensing deals or find ways &#34;to be more creative&#34; and less similar to the brands they reference.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Other experts said the decision leaves space for the First Amendment to apply to parody products.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Alexandra Roberts, a law professor at Northeastern University, cited a &#34;Chick-Fil-Hate&#34; t-shirt as an example of a parody product that could still receive First Amendment protection because it conveys a message about Chick-fil-A and does not use &#34;Chick-Fil-Hate&#34; as a trademark.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The shirt refers to fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A&#39;s past donations to Christian groups that opposed same-sex marriage.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">&#34;If Chik-Fil-Hate were also on the inside of the shirt on the tag, that would be more of a trademark use,&#34; Roberts said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Elizabeth Brannen, a partner at Stris &amp; Maher, said Jack Daniel&#39;s victory &#34;could turn out to be pyrrhic.&#34; The whiskey maker will still have to prove VIP&#39;s toys are likely to confuse potential customers into thinking it was affiliated with them in order to win its infringement case.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">&#34;The likelihood of confusion analysis will still take the challenged product&#39;s funny message into account,&#34; Brannen said. She noted that the high court said consumers are &#34;not so likely to think that the maker of a mocked product is itself doing the mocking.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">(This story has been refiled to change dateline to June 12)</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><div><address><a href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/blake-brittain/"></a><div><p><a data-testid="Heading" rel="author" href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/blake-brittain/">Blake Brittain</a></p><p data-testid="Heading">Thomson Reuters</p><p data-testid="Body">Blake Brittain reports on intellectual property law, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, for Reuters Legal.
