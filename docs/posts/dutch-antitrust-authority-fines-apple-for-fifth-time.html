    <h1>Dutch antitrust authority fines Apple for fifth time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Dutch tech reporter Nando Kasteleijn of <a href="https://nos.nl/">NOS</a> just reported on Twitter that the Authority for Consumers &amp; Markets--the Dutch antitrust authority--has imposed another contempt sanction on Apple of €5 million ($5.7 million) for this calendar week, on top of €20 million ($22.7 million) imposed over the course of the past four weeks. The competition regulator of the Netherlands claims that Apple&#39;s so-called &#34;solutions&#34; still fall short of what the agency believes needed to enable dating-app makers to make use of alternative payment systems to Apple&#39;s own IAP:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="nl" dir="ltr">Nieuwe week, nieuwe last onder dwangsom van de ACM voor Apple. Nu totaal €25 mln (max is €50 mln).</p>— Nando Kasteleijn (@nandokasteleijn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nandokasteleijn/status/1495776326946590720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>As I <a href="https://twitter.com/arnoudwokke/status/1495774851327733761">discussed with Tweaker&#39;s Arnoud Wokke on Twitter</a>, these fines are levied <i>in advance</i>. They are meant to have a coercive effect: Apple can still avoid them for a new week by bringing its conduct into compliance.</p>
<p>Those weekly sanctions can reach--but not exceed--a total of €50 million ($56.7 million). </p>
<p>The complaint that led to the underlying decision on the merits (which Apple is still appealing) was brought by Match Group, a U.S. company best known for Tinder. Someone claimed on Twitter that Match Group has zero employees in the Netherlands. There may not be a single Dutch app maker that has a substantial benefit from this case. That doesn&#39;t deprive the ACM of jurisdiction as its job is to protect the &#34;C&#34; in its name: Dutch consumers. However, it&#39;s easy to see that this case only makes sense as a &#34;pilot project&#34; with the objective of expanding the same reasoning to other app categories and to other jurisdictions, particularly other EU member states, as the ACM says it&#39;s decision is based not only in Dutch but also EU competition law.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m a vocal critic of Apple&#39;s App Store terms, <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/02/dutch-antitrust-authority-keeps-fining.html">the Dutch situation is not a simple one of Apple committing violations and acting as if it were above the law</a>. The situation is rather more nuanced, and on the specific question of whether Apple can reasonably require app makers to submit a new app for the Dutch market, I can see technical reasons--apart from obvious commercial motives--for which Apple has made that choice. Apple is simply trying to capitalize on the fact that the Dutch market is small. If Apple required app makers to submit a new app for the entire EU Single Market, some would also complain that it&#39;s a hassle, but if it resulted in major savings for developers, it would be worth the effort.</p>
<p>The <i>much bigger</i> issue here is whether Apple can collect a 27% commission on revenues that bypass its IAP system. Considering that certain alternative payment systems have a base transaction fee such as $50, 27% is a prohibitive commission compared to the 30% Apple normally demands (and in any event it&#39;s higher than the 15% of Apple&#39;s small business program, making it a total non-option for dating-app startups). I don&#39;t think Apple would realistically be able to impose a 27% commission as a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) IP license fee. But the question is whether the ACM can do anything about it in the short term. I have my doubts, let&#39;s put it that way.</p>
<p>New York University (NYU) professor Scott Galloway calls Apple&#39;s cut a &#34;mob-like 30% toll&#34; in <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/apple-thief/">a very thought-provoking article on how Apple might hit $1 trillion in revenue by 2030 (from $366 billion last year) leveraging its power and resources.</a> The headline is &#34;Apple: Thief&#34; and I&#39;d like to highlight this tweet by the author on Apple just &#34;stealing markets from incumbents&#34;:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting to a trillion $ in revenue will require stealing markets from incumbents. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nomercynomalice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#nomercynomalice</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amazon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Amazon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Meta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Meta</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Microsoft?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Microsoft</a> <a href="https://t.co/DvesgueKhX">https://t.co/DvesgueKhX</a></p>— Scott Galloway (@profgalloway) <a href="https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1495017043938009088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>There are serious issues. I <a href="https://twitter.com/FOSSpatents/status/1495038806852046851">agree with mobile app business guru Eric Seufert</a> that the impact of Apple&#39;s ATT (anti-ad-tracking) policy on Shopify&#39;s stock price raises concerns about how small and medium-sized businesses (many of which rely on Shopify) suffer under the Apple tyranny. Also, ATT is a total squeeze that makes user acquisition (&#34;UA&#34;) more expensive while diminishing the ad-based revenue generation opportunity.</p>
<p>I still think the Dutch dating-app case has the potential--if the same reasoning is applied to other app categories and spills over to other (especially European) markets. But it&#39;s all taking time, and in some jurisdictions (including the EU) new legislation may make an impact ahead of definitive and tangible results from any enforcement of the existing laws.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a complex situation. I will continue to criticize Apple, but I strive to be a <i>rational</i> (not rabid) critic. For now, I think Apple&#39;s conduct following the ACM decision is above board. Sort of hardball, but not out of line--and not entirely without merit.</p>
