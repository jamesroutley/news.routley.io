    <h1>Bottles of OOP now available in Python</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-75010da9924652307e71"><div><p><em><strong>What Makes It Unique?</strong></em></p>
<p>We are practical people. We love beautiful code but we&#39;re also committed to getting things done. <em>99 Bottles of OOP</em> enables both of these desires. It teaches practical programming techniques that lead, naturally and inevitably, to beautiful code.</p>
<p>This book contains an extended refactoring, and it details the rationale behind every change. It is a hands-on workbook rather than a list of theoretical ideas. It explains how to use the principles of object-oriented design to guide, not just the final arrangement of code, but each decision about what line of code to write <em>next</em>.</p>
<p>It teaches the theory of what good OO looks like, but even better, it supplies step-by-step guidance about how to achieve it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who Should Read It?</strong></em></p>
<p>The lessons work for programmers with a broad range of experience, from rank novice to grizzled veteran. Regardless of your background or preferred programming language, <em>99 Bottles of OOP</em> will teach you techniques to make your code easier to understand, simpler to change, and more satisfying to contemplate.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#39;s new in the 2nd Edition?</strong></em></p>
<p>The 2nd Edition contains 3 new chapters and is about 50% longer than the 1st.  Also, because <em>99 Bottles of OOP</em> is about object-oriented design in general rather than any specific language, this time around we created separate books that are technically identical, but use different programming languages for the examples.</p>
<p><em>99 Bottles of OOP</em> is currently available in the <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Ruby</strong> programming languages, and <strong>beer</strong> and <strong>milk</strong> beverages. It&#39;s delivered in epub, kepub, mobi and pdf formats.  This results in eight different books and (4x2x4) 32 possible downloads; all unique, yet still the same.  One purchase gives you rights to download any or all.</p>
<p><em><strong>What formats are available?</strong></em></p>
<p>99 Bottles of OOP is currently available in digital form only (epub, kepub, mobi, pdf) and will be delivered from DPD.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#39;s The Current Version?</strong></em></p>
<p>As of November 15, 2024, the current release of the 2nd Edition is version 2.2.1.  This is the complete book, and is approximately 105,000 words long (bigger than most novels, and right up there up with some beefy science fiction).</p>
