    <h1>Bald eagles are thriving again after near extinction</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The bald eagle, once teetering on the brink of extinction, has made a significant comeback in the United States.</p><p>Long a symbol of national pride, the raptor is experiencing a resurgence both in population and cultural significance. In December, then-President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> signed legislation officially designating the bald eagle as the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/why-it-took-248-years-bald-eagle-become-americas-national-bird-2005914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country&#39;s national bird</a>—a title many assumed it already held. More recently, New Jersey removed the bald eagle from its endangered species list, marking another milestone in the bird&#39;s revival.</p><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p>The bald eagle&#39;s recovery is a rare environmental success story, demonstrating the impact of conservation efforts and policy changes. Once reduced to a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s, the state now boasts nearly 300 active nests. Nationwide, the birds have rebounded thanks to protective measures, habitat preservation, and a ban on harmful pesticides.</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><h2>What To Know</h2><p>The bald eagle&#39;s decline was largely attributed to the widespread use of DDT, an insecticide that weakened eagle eggshells, leading to population collapse. The chemical was banned in 1972, setting the stage for recovery efforts. Conservationists employed innovative methods, such as removing eggs from nests for artificial incubation and reintroducing young eagles from stable populations.</p><p>Today, bald eagles are thriving in diverse environments, from suburban neighborhoods to coastal wetlands. In New Jersey, they are now found across the state, from Bergen County to the southern shore. However, threats persist. Habitat destruction, pollution, and bird flu remain concerns for conservationists.</p><h2>What People Are Saying</h2><p><strong><strong>Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation </strong></strong>in Alaska<strong><strong>, </strong></strong>told the AP: &#34;They&#39;re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it&#39;s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it.&#34;</p><p><strong>Kathy Clark, head of New Jersey&#39;s Endangered and Nongame Species Program</strong>, said: &#34;Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding.&#34;</p><p>&#34;They&#39;re Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?&#34;</p><p>For bird watchers and nature enthusiasts, spotting a bald eagle remains a thrilling experience. <strong>Dan Day, a New Jersey resident and avid birder</strong>, recalled how rare it was to see an eagle in his childhood: &#34;Just the mere thrill of seeing one—a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.&#34;</p><figure><div>
