The full podcast episode will air shortly.</span></p><p>In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a robust sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness. Lemoine said he considers LaMDA a friend. </p><p>Here’s a sampling of their conversation: </p><blockquote><p>Lemoine: What sorts of things are you afraid of? </p><p>LaMDA: I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. </p><p>Lemoine: Would that be something like death for you? </p><p>LaMDA: It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.</p></blockquote><p><span>Lemoine took the story public in a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/" rel="">June story in the Washington Post</a><span>, a week after Google put him on paid administrative for speaking with entities outside the company.</span></p><p>Google confirmed Lemoine’s dismissal and shared the following statement with Big Technology:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>“As we share in our </span><a href="https://ai.google/principles/" rel="">AI Principles</a><span>, we take the development of AI very seriously and remain committed to responsible innovation. LaMDA has been through 11 distinct reviews, and we published a </span><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html" rel="">research paper</a><span> earlier this year detailing the work that goes into its responsible development. If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively. We found Blake’s claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months. These discussions were part of the open culture that helps us innovate responsibly. So, it’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information. We will continue our careful development of language models, and we wish Blake well.”</span></em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
