    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback"><div><div><h2>H3 indexes points and shapes into a hexagonal grid.</h2><hr/><p>H3 is a discrete global grid system for indexing geographies into a hexagonal grid, developed at Uber.</p><p>Coordinates can be indexed to cell IDs that each represent a unique cell.</p><p>Indexed data can be quickly joined across disparate datasets and aggregated at different levels of precision.</p><p>H3 enables a range of algorithms and optimizations based on the grid, including nearest neighbors, shortest path, gradient smoothing, and more.</p></div></div></div></div>
