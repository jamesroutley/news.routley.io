                        <p>
                          Since Taskwarrior strives to be _the very best_, we are proud to announce the availability of the 2.6.2
                          bugfix release. Sometimes being best also means best at releasing versions with problems that need
                          to be fixed üôÇ and (hopefully, eventually) catching them all.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This bugfix-only release improves the upgrade path to 2.6.x, prevents corruption of the depends attribute
                          when syncing, provides better support for detecting invalid write contexts and fixes a handful of small
                          regressions introduced in our recent <a href="https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/releases/tag/v2.6.0">2.6.0 release</a>.

                        <p>
                          Taskwarrior team is happy to announce the release of Taskwarrior 2.6.0, which brings a number of improvements
                          to your favourite task management tool. To just pick a few - writeable and configurable contexts, support for
                          XDG Base Directory Specification, and most importantly, the ability to use emojis in your task descriptions üöÄ
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          We also made a number of stability and bug fixing improvements to multiple areas of TW, including parsing,
                          display or platform compatibility.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This is also the first release which supports 64-bit timestamps (also known as Y2038 problem), hence adding
                          tasks that will likely outlive them, barring unprecedented advances in human longevity, is something our users
                          can now indulge in:

                          We have made good use of beer time at FOSDEM to lay out our plans
                          for 2018.  Here is what we are doing, starting immediately in most
