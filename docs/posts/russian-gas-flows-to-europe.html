<title>Russian gas flows to Europe, storage rates</title>


<center>
Russian gas flows to Europe, sourced from <a href="https://entsog.eu">ENTSO-G</a>, gas storage levels from <a href="https://agsi.gie.eu/#/historical/eu">GIE</a>.
<!--
<font color="red">Be careful! ENTSO-E data is lagging behind and some
of the statistics are probably not correct! I do not believe the Ukrainian graph is
right, for example</font>

<p>Uzhgorod is on the Ukrainian border, and is also called <a href="https://tis.eustream.sk/TisWeb/#/?nav=rd.flw">Veľké Kapušany</a>. The Yamal
 pipes are also called Mallnow, Jamal or Jagal. Nordstream meanwhile is also known
 as Greifswald in other tables.</p>
 <p>As long as the EU storage withdrawal graph is positive, we are using up
 our reserves. Similar data but going back further in time and with prettier
graphs &amp; much more data can be found <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/european-natural-gas-imports/">on
 this Bruegel page</a>.</p>

Data sourced daily from <a href="https://entsog.eu">ENTSO-G</a>, the
European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and <a href="https://agsi.gie.eu/#/historical/eu">GIE</a>, Gas Infrastructure
Europe (thanks!).  Very rough pricing indication based on Dutch TTF Gas May &#39;22
(TGK22). Please let me know urgently if I am missing any
pipelines, of if I am misintepreting the data!
