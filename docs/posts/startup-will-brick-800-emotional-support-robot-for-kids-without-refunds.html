          <p>Startup Embodied is closing down, and its product, an $800 robot for kids ages 5 to 10, will soon be bricked.</p>
<p>Embodied blamed its closure on a failed “critical funding round.&#34; On its <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs">website</a>, it explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had secured a lead investor who was prepared to close the round. However, at the last minute, they withdrew, leaving us with no viable options to continue operations. Despite our best efforts to secure alternative funding, we were unable to find a replacement in time to sustain operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company didn’t provide further details about the pulled funding. Embodied’s previous backers have included Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, Amazon Alexa Fund, Sony Innovation Fund, and Vulcan Capital, but we don&#39;t know who the lead investor mentioned above is.</p>
<p>When it first announced Moxie in April 2020, Embodied described the robot as a “safe and engaging animate companion for children designed to help promote social, emotional, and cognitive development.” It advertised play built around “best practices in child development and early childhood education”; changing weekly themes, like empathy, friendship, and respect; and activities like meditation, reading, and drawing with the bot.</p>
<p>But soon, none of those features will be available, making the pricey children’s toy virtually useless. According to Embodied, Moxie can’t perform core functionality without cloud connectivity. Worse, owners apparently have an uncertain and limited amount of time until the devices are bricked. Per Embodied:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t know the exact date when services will cease. It is likely to happen within days. However, we are exploring options to keep Moxie operational for as long as possible, although we cannot provide any guarantees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Embodied marketed Moxie as a companion and development toy for children, there’s concern about kids potentially suffering an emotional toll after the robot abruptly becomes inoperable. Embodied has responded by promising to provide a guide for telling children about Moxie&#39;s demise. <a href="https://x.com/zerostatereflex/status/1863803327995371666">Online</a>, however, customers are already sharing videos of their sad kids learning that their robot friend will stop playing with them, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/10/moxie-kids-robot-shuts-down">Axios</a> pointed out.</p>
