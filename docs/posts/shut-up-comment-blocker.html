            <p>
              Comments are awful. Shut Up hides them by default,
              sparing your sanity and preventing you from getting
              sucked into a world of hurt.

              For the sites where discussions can be more constructive –
              like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>,
              or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> –
              you can show comments by default.
            </p>

            <h5>How&#39;s it work?</h5>
            <p>
              Shut Up is an app you can install on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac,
              and a browser extension you can install in Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Opera.
              At its core is a stylesheet by <a href="https://stevenf.com/">Steven Frank</a>
              called <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/shutup-css">shutup.css</a>.
              The extension injects the stylesheet&#39;s rules into almost
              all of the pages you visit.
            </p>
            <p>When you want to see comments, it couldn&#39;t be easier:</p>
            
            <p>
              Rarely, you might find that Shut Up inadvertently blocks
              legitimate page content, or doesn&#39;t block comments properly.
              Please <a href="#">contact me</a>
              if you think something&#39;s not working right. If you&#39;re
              good at web development, you can submit a pull request
              for <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/shutup-css">shutup.css on GitHub</a>.

            <h5>What about privacy?</h5>
            <p>
              Shut Up won&#39;t track nor spy on your browsing activity.
              The extension only periodically contacts this server
              for the newest copy of shutup.css, at which point some
              temporary diagnostic logs are recorded. On Firefox,
              this update check is omitted. Learn more about
              <a href="https://rickyromero.com/shutup/privacy/">my privacy policies</a>.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h5>Anything else?</h5>
            <p>
              On iPhone or iPad, Shut Up requires iOS/iPadOS 12 or newer. You
              also need a 64-bit processor. Any of the following devices
              will work:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>iPhone 5s</strong> or newer</li>
              <li><strong>iPad Air</strong> or newer</li>
              <li><strong>iPad mini 2</strong> or newer</li>
              <li>iPod touch <strong>(6th generation)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One more thing: You have to activate Shut Up in Settings
              before it may start blocking comments. To do that:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app.</li>
              <li>Tap <em>Safari</em>.</li>
              <li>Tap <em>Content Blockers</em>.</li>
              <li>Turn on <em>Shut Up</em>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If you can&#39;t turn on Shut Up from here, you may need to
              first <a href="https://www.imore.com/cant-enable-content-blockers-your-iphone-or-ipad-heres-fix">disable your device&#39;s web browsing restrictions</a>.
              Once you&#39;ve done that and turned on Shut Up, you can turn
              the restrictions back on.
