<p>The main reason of we choosing the 168x series is because it has the largest inner space among all the feature phones we inspected so far. Its inner space is big enough to put a spring antenna inside! Also, its power connector has its own piece of plastic on the PCB, this means it can be changed to another type of connector without problems. However it doesn&#39;t look very pretty, and I hope we can get enough money to replace the plastic clip surrounding the charging port.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="8b46c55f-3d4c-4dec-b09b-f1fa9067cbfb"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>I tried my best to make the Type-C surroundings look good</span></p></div></div></div>

So we changed it to a 240x320 IPS LCD, and it&#39;s a bit larger than the original one. So, some pixels are hidden by the plastic borders, yielding a visible space of ~220x280 pixels. But it&#39;s still a lot more pixels than the original LCD, this allows more information to be displayed on the screen, and more importantly, better color and response time.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="ad0313fa-75a4-4c97-b1ef-227c4ee17e29"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>Screen comparison.

<h3 id="toc-power-9"><span>Power</span></h3><p>We selected a very overkill PMIC, the TI BQ25890, for this tiny little device. It has a very important feature: power on without battery. I always wondered why most phones can&#39;t power on with only a power cable. Anyway, this feature is supported in our case. This also enables you to switch batteries without powering off with power cable connected. Moreover, it provides the power switch functionality, and a steady 5V 1A power supply for USB OTG.</p><p><span>The battery is the standard BL-5C - you can get them at pretty much everywhere, and just be careful with the quality.

The original reason was because the modern smartphones are becoming increasingly hacker-unfriendly and privacy-unfriendly. I&#39;m a CyanogenMod/Lineage user since around 2011. If you experienced that era, you may have the same feelings.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="e622ce20-ebc2-450d-8e75-bb3e6901d11f"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>CyanogenMod was the game changer at that time (photo by me, sadly I lost this phone)</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>I was a loyal OnePlus user since OnePlus 3 because it was the best &#34;hackable&#34; smartphone at that time. I bought an OnePlus 7 Pro in late 2019, and then I went very angry with the Android resizable partitions (&#34;reinvent LVM and readonly&#34;) nonsense. I already went angry with the merge of boot and recovery years ago. It became very hard to modify the system partition on the fly. More and more tools, the Magisk, the App Cloner, are invented and continuously improved by humans using their free time to solve more and more man-made (or Google-made) problems. Many good things disappeared these years, such as the KDE4, Win7, Google+, and people&#39;s privacy awareness. Personally I don&#39;t think this is right. I don&#39;t want to compromise at all. I&#39;m stubborn enough for this to be bothering me everyday. Then I began to think: why not make a phone by myself?</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="fe46faa3-22a4-4b64-930f-bebb29a63dce"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>1 / 3</span> • <span>The Oneplus 3.

<p><strong>It&#39;s HARD</strong></p><p>I actually heard about the Librem 5 a long time ago, but I was too poor to buy it (it seems to be cheaper in the recent years). So I did I very nerdy test. A Raspberry Pi, a touchscreen HAT, a 3000 mAh battery, and a EC20 4G module. I can surf the Internet using Firefox and chat using Pidgin, but typing and calling became a headache. The xvkbd is the best virtual keyboard I can find. I wrote a small script to send AT commands and setup PCM over serial port in order to call someone. It conflicted with the modem manager so I can only choose SMS or calling at one time. The battery lasted only for 3 hours or so. It failed completely.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="20e763f6-7712-42fa-acb8-fab1bc28d5f4"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>A demonstration. Not the exact setup at that time.</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>Moreover, the plastic case becomes a problem. I asked multiple plastic mold factories, and the average price for a suite of phone cases is 200K CNY (that&#39;s almost 30K USD). The only thing I can imagine at that time is a FDM printed case with lots of layer lines. I began to feel discouraged.</p><p><strong>​Seek for help instead of this?</strong></p><p><span>​​I​ shared this idea in a local electronics group. It&#39;s full of EE gurus that were  graduated from the best universities here. Some of them got their chip R&amp;D jobs in Germany, Belgium and the USA, and a few of them even had their own chips built in fabs like the TSMC. </span><strong>Almost everyone laughed at me, and some of them even teased me. Most of them didn&#39;t believe there&#39;s a privacy &#34;crisis&#34; ongoing.</strong><span> I demonstrated a way to prove the phones are listening to us everyday: attach a gdb on the Android audioserver process, set a breakpoint in the sound_trigger.so provided by device vendor, and see when it breaks. They seemed to be believing my claim, but I guess nobody was ever bothered to try for themself. </span><strong>Maybe this is why these app vendors</strong><span> </span><strong>can spy on people without the slightest scruple.</strong></p><p>The same thing was happening everywhere else. Maybe it&#39;s because I had too few friends, most of my friends weren&#39;t actually interested in this idea. I began to feel hopeless.​</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>In the end of 2020, I heard about the RetroPie project. It puts a RPi Zero inside a GameBoy-like case. Then I immediately began my research on reusing existing game console plastic cases. I was planning to use the GBC plastic case. I thought at least I could get a &#34;Pokemon Communicator&#34;-like stuff. I spent a lot of time using a scanner to replicate a PCB with the same shape. Everything was good, the Type-C port was placed at the place of the GB communications port, and there are 14550 Li-ion batteries. Then I was stuck in finding a correct power switch and a suitable LCD screen. I even wanted to use these white goods touch button IC to emulate a touchscreen. Time passes, tons of money wasted, and this idea was stuck forever.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="7b3f3337-3d0e-452d-83c3-bc08d1c43bd8"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>The GBC replacement PCB.

<p><strong>Hope x2</strong></p><p><span>In the end of 2021, I heard about the &#34;</span><a href="https://github.com/TrevorAttema/OTGMessenger" data-ha="{&#34;eventName&#34;:&#34;Clicked link&#34;,&#34;customProps&#34;:{&#34;value&#34;:&#34;OTG Messenger&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:&#34;https://github.com/TrevorAttema/OTGMessenger&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;story&#34;,&#34;location&#34;:&#34;story&#34;},&#34;clickOpts&#34;:{&#34;delayRedirect&#34;:true}}" rel="nofollow">OTG Messenger</a><span>&#34; project. It repurposed the Nokia E63 plastic case to make a Lora messenger. It inspired me that plastic cases of old phones can be repurposed, and the value of Lora is huge. Then I started to find suitable phone cases. At first, I used the E63 as well. But it has multiple problems, the only available area to place components is under the keyboard, that&#39;s only 50x40mm, and height is limited to 2mm. It ruled out the possibility to place any SoM there. The only option is to design the processor surroundings from scratch. Initially I designed using the Ingenic X2000 (8000+ CoreMark), but it requires 4 power rails with different voltages and tons of decoupling caps. I eventually gave up. Then I changed to the X1000, it only needs 3 power rails and all caps can be put in one layer. I actually did it, but never felt satisfied with it. The SDIO wires were too long and crossed 2 layers, and I don&#39;t have any confidence that it will run over 20MHz. I had the same concern for the LCD (8080 bus) and camera (DVP). It never went into production.</span></p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="804082a5-aaa5-4d3e-82d0-8371ff961845"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>1 / 2</span> • <span>The E63 replacement PCB.

<p>In the meantime, I started to get bored with these HUGE modern smartphones. They&#39;re impossible to operate with one hand comfortably, and it&#39;s extremely painful to have them fall into your face. The influence of the old iPhone SE is fading, and it appears that nobody cares to produce smaller smartphones any more. This is not correct either. Fun fact: When I was in elementary school, my classmates and I can text each other with our eyes still staring at the teacher and blackboard. This can decrease the probability of being discovered by the teacher. We were indeed bad kids, but this effectively demonstrates the advantages of a hardware T9 keyboard.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="a0e63333-b82f-4502-b172-861c6b505be8"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>The efficiency of a properly implemented T9 IME unbeatable. At least this is true for Chinese and English.</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>I continued to search for usable plastic cases. I searched them on Taobao, Alibaba, everywhere. Nokias, Samsungs, and their clones in Shenzhen. I even tried these POS machine ones. Each one has its unavoidable shortcomings. If you were in our Discord server, you can see this part of history, including the funny looking &#34;Wireless Terminal&#34; food ordering machine. I had no luck, until recently.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="197608b7-1752-4be2-8af1-5c940f66de63"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>1 / 3</span> • <span>Different plastic cases tried.</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>Early this year (2022), I found the Nokia 168x series in random recommendations (no they aren&#39;t random at all, these apps spy on users all the day) of shopping apps. It looked cool for me. Then I searched photos of its PCB on the Internet. Wow, there&#39;s so much space in it! I became excited. Then the usual procedure happened: buy, disassemble, picturing, and replicate the PCB shape. In this time I became a little smarter, I made a tiny SoM of the X1000 processor first. And it went production &amp; was tested before anything else. The SoM was a success. Then I started designing the rest. It became a great success.</p><div data-hypernova-key="ImageCarousel" data-hypernova-id="5727ff18-7358-4662-86d2-a438b1b37059"><div data-reactroot=""><div><div><div></div></div><p><span>The tiny Ingenic X1000 SoM designed by me</span></p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The entire process was very painful, lots of money and time were wasted for trial and error. As the CTO of our company (SudoMaker), I did this sorely as my own personal interest and didn&#39;t spent much time caring for the company over the 2 years. And our company isn&#39;t in a good condition now - with the interfere from COVID-19, we&#39;re actually running out of money. However, I finally made it. This is at least a meaningful thing. Hope you can understand my feelings, enjoy this project, share it to others, and maybe support it. Let&#39;s get over this hard time together.</p></div>Read more</section><section id="schematics"><div><h2><a href="#schematics"><i><svg><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></i></a><span>Schematics </span></h2></div><div></div><div></div></section><section id="team"><div><h2><a href="#team"><i><svg><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></i></a><span>Credits</span></h2></div><div><div><p><a href="https://commoncog.com/reimunotmoe"><img srcset="https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4b64f95c791b1e9625b2bea14815045.png?d=retro&amp;s= 2x, https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4b64f95c791b1e9625b2bea14815045.png?d=retro&amp;s=60" alt="ReimuNotMoe" src="https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4b64f95c791b1e9625b2bea14815045.png?d=retro&amp;s=60"/></a></p><div><h3><a href="https://commoncog.com/reimunotmoe">ReimuNotMoe</a> </h3><p>0 projects • 0 followers</p><div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
