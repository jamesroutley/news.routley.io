<p>Earlier this year, I bought a pristine HP 1670G logic analyzer at the 
<a href="https://www.electronicsfleamarket.com/">Silicon Valley Electronics Flea Market</a>.</p>

<p>Produced sometime early 2000, it’s new enough to have an Agilent sticker.
Unlike most other HP logic analyzers, a 1670G doesn’t have
expansion cards: what you see is what you get, but 136 channels that can be sampled
at 500MHz is plenty, and my machine has the 2 channel oscilloscope option. A bandwidth
of 500MHz and 2GSa/s sampling rate are very nice specs.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/hp1670g.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/hp1670g.jpg" alt="HP 1670G"/></a></p>

<p>The 1670G is one of the last HP models that runs on a custom operating system, later models
switched to HP/UX, but it already has some advanced features, such as being to operate the UI 
through an external X Window server. And that’s great because operating the UI with the keys 
and rotary knobs on the front panel is not a pleasant experience. You can connect a keyboard 
and mouse, but who has extra space for that on their bench or equipment cart?</p>

<p>It used to be easy to have any kind of X client connect to a remote X server. Back in the
early 1990s on the HP Apollo workstations in college, it was a simple matter of setting
the DISPLAY environment variable, but that was before network security was a concern. Things are 
bit more complicated now, and it took me a couple of hours to get the remote X server connection up 
and running on my Ubuntu 20.04 machine.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I got through the steps that were required to make it work so that I
won’t forget the next time I need it.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/analyzer_connected_to_x_server.jpg" alt="Analyzer connected to X server"/>
<em>Logic analyzer showing that it’s connected to an external X server.</em></p>

<p>It all feels very hacky, and there’s absolutely no guarantee that my solution will work on 
your machine.</p>



<p>Like most other people, all of my household’s PCs, laptops, and IOT devices are
assigned a dynamic IP address with DHCP. The 1670G, however, only supports a static IP address.</p>

<p>Luckily, my router, an Asus RT-AC88U, has the option to reserve a static IP address for 
a particular Ethernet MAC address.</p>

<p><em>If your router doesn’t supported static IP reservation, don’t worry too much. Even though
DHCP assigned IP addresses are dynamic, they often stay the same for a long time. Just
choose an address that’s different that all the others and hope for the best. You probably won’t
be using a machine like this 24/7…</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Determine the Ethernet MAC address of the logic analyzer</strong></p>

<p>You can do this as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System config screen -&gt; External IO -&gt; LAN settings -&gt; Factory Settings</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/Factory_Settings_MAC_address.png" alt="Factory Settings - Ether Address screen"/></p>

<p>Write down the Ethernet MAC address. In my case, it’s 00:10:83:7b:93:95. You should also be able to
find this number on a sticker on the back of your machine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Find the IP address of the machine with the X server</strong></p>

<p>This is probably the Linux machine on which you’re reading this… (It also works on a Windows machine with
an X server, but you’ll have to figure that out yourself.)</p>



<div><div><pre><code>...
wlp5s0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inet 192.168.1.51  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        inet6 fe80::7491:3d2f:f191:a182  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;
        ether 78:2b:46:be:5d:f7  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 7543776  bytes 5725183269 (5.7 GB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 122599  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1707142  bytes 336828263 (336.8 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My PC’s IP address is 192.168.1.51.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Log in to Router</strong></p>

<p>Your router is usually assigned the IP address of your machine with the last number changed to 1.
In my case, it’s 192.168.1.1. You point your browser to that address.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/router_login_screen.png" alt="Router login screen"/></p>

<p>After logging in, assign a fixed IP address for the logic analyzer:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/manually_assigned_IP_address.png"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/manually_assigned_IP_address.png" alt="Manually assigned IP address"/></a>
<em>Click to enlarge</em></p>

<p>This screen will obviously look different if you have a different router.</p>

<p>I filled in the MAC address and an IP address of my own choice: 192.168.1.200.</p>

<p>The router was able to figure out by itself that the specified MAC address is owned by Hewlett Packard.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Fill in the LAN settings</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/assign_IP_address.png" alt="LAN Settings - Internal Settigns"/></p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure that the LAN port is set to “LAN TP” (for twisted pair), because the logic
analyzer also supports the old school BNC connector.</li>
  <li>Fill in the chosen IP address: 192.168.1.200.</li>
  <li>Fill in the IP address of the router: 192.168.1.1</li>
  <li>I changed the file timeout to 5.0s, but I don’t think this was necessary.</li>
  <li>Fill in a name of the device. This name will show up at the top of the X window.</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn’t touch any of the other values.</p>



<p>This took me hours to figure out. Chances are high that you’ll have to do something different…</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Install socat</strong></p>

<p><code>socat</code> is “a multipurpose relay tool for Linux”. It’s an abbreviation of “SOcket CAT” and
creates a bi-directional link between two different sockets… I think?</p>

<p>On Ubuntu, I just ran <code>sudo apt install socat</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Determine your current X window display number</strong></p>





<p>In my case, the display number is :1.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Open up your firewall to receive X client TCP/IP requests</strong></p>

<p>The logic analyzer X client will send X server request for particular, user defined
display.  I chose 111 as the external display number. Don’t try to find meaning behind this number,
you can use pretty much any number.</p>

<p>The logic analyzer will send X server request to TCP/IP port 6111 for display number 111.</p>

<p>We need to tell the firewall to allow packets from the logic analyzer IP address to this port to come through:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>ufw allow from 192.168.1.200 proto tcp to any port 6111
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Step 8: Route incoming X server TCP request to your current display</strong></p>

<p>This was the key incantation to made everything work for me.</p>

<p>Logic analyzer requests to port 6111 are rerouted to the active X display with <code>socat</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>socat TCP-LISTEN:6111,fork,bind<span>=</span>192.168.1.51 UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There 3 key values here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>6111</p>

    <p>the external X server port.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>192.168.1.51</p>

    <p>the IP address of my Linux machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>/tmp/.X11-unix/X1</p>

    <p>The 1 of X1 is the display number that I determined in step 6.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 9: Set the remote X server parameters</strong></p>

<p>Go to the X-Window Settings configuration screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System -&gt; External IO -&gt; X Settings</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/x-window_settings.png" alt="X-window Settings"/></p>

<p>Fill in the IP address of your Linux machine and the display number, the same
111 as used above.</p>



<p><strong>This is super important: your logic analyzer will crash if you don’t do this!</strong></p>

<p>HP provides special font files for your X server. They can be found on the hard drive
of the logic analyzer in the <code>\SYSTEM</code> directory. You need the following files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LG165.BDF
SM165.BDF
README
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’re supposed to copy these files from the logic analyzer to your local machine with FTP, but
that didn’t work for me so I used a floppy disk instead. I’m making the 3 files available here for
download. Just click on them here to grab them:
<a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/LG165.BDF"><code>LG165.BDF</code></a>, <a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/SM165.BDF"><code>SM165.BDF</code></a>, 
<a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/README"><code>README</code></a>, and store the files on your Linux machine’s file system.</p>

<p>The README explains what to do. It boils down to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd</span> &lt;directory with the 2 font files&gt;
mkfontdir
xset +fp <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>
xset fp rehash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will need to redo the last 2 command after each reboot.</p>

<p>The README also has instructions on how to make these font changes permanent, but that didn’t 
work on my machine.</p>



<ul>
  <li>System -&gt; External IO -&gt; X-Window Connect</li>
</ul>

<p>If all goes well, you should see the logic analyzer screen on your desktop:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/logic_analyzer_on_the_desktop.png" alt="Logic analyzer on the desktop"/></p>



<p>Your logic analyzer may show the following image and error message:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/hp1670g/error_screen.jpg" alt="Software error screen"/></p>

<div><div><pre><code>X Error: BadFont
Request Major code 56 ()
ResourceID 0x0
Error Serial #1602
Current Serial #1817

SOFTWARE ERROR - Please record these number XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this, check if the font files were installed correctly. I didn’t do that as first
and got this message all the time. It went away for good after installation of the fonts.</p>



<p><em>This is not directly related to X server remote control, but I need to put it somewhere.</em></p>

<p>On some of my machines, ftp is not working. Here is what you’re supposed to see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Connected to 192.168.1.200.
220    167XG V03.02 FUSION FTP server (Version 3.3) ready.
Name (192.168.1.200:tom): data
230 User DATA logged in.
ftp&gt; dir
200 PORT command ok.
150 Opening data connection for  (192.168.1.51,41623).

dr-xr-xr-x    3    1    1       766  slot_b
226 Transfer complete.
ftp&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, on my main Linux machine, it hangs immediately after issuing the <code>dir</code> command.</p>

<p>In this case, <code>dmesg</code> reports this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[UFW BLOCK] IN=wlp5s0 OUT= MAC=... SRC=192.168.1.200 DST=192.168.1.51 LEN=44 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=240 ID=1894 PROTO=TCP SPT=20 DPT=50021 WINDOW=0 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is telling me that the UFW firewall is block packets. The key info here is:</p>

<p><code>SRC=192.168.1.200 ... SPT=20</code></p>

<p>Packets from the logic analyzer that are coming from port 20 (ftp!) are blocked.</p>

<p>I can tell UFW to allow packet from a given source IP address, but I can’t tell it to only
allow packets from source port 20. So my current solution is very crude:</p>

<p><code>sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.200</code></p>

<p>This allows <em>all</em> traffic coming from the logic analyzer… or any device that pretends to be one.
It’s not ideal, but I don’t use ftp very often so I only enable this rule when I need it.</p>

<p>To disable, do the following:</p>



<div><div><pre><code>Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
...
[ 8] 6111/tcp                   ALLOW IN    192.168.1.200             
[ 9] Anywhere                   ALLOW IN    192.168.1.200             
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then delete the rule:</p>



<div><div><pre><code>Deleting:
 allow from 192.168.1.200
Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Rule deleted
</code></pre></div></div>

  by using the more traditional way. I was not able to get this method to work on my more
  modern Ubuntu machine.</p>
