This video of a human bone-cancer cell shows its three nuclei (blue —probably the result of failed cell divisions), actin cytoskeleton (red) and a network of moving mitochondria (yellow). It was captured using a confocal microscope by cell biologist Dylan Burnette at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Burnette says that mitochondria often move around the cell and interact with other structures, and that they exist in a mixture of forms. “The common perception of mitochondria as bean-shaped likely stems from textbook and cartoon depictions,” he says, which are in turn based on microscope images of thin slices through them. “These two-dimensional views do not fully capture the complex and dynamic mitochondrial networks present in most cells.”</span></p>
