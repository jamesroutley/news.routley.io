    <h1>“Pigeon Neck” Illusion (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a id="anchor_top"></a><h2 id="what-to-see">What to see</h2><p>In the animation above you see “pigeons” craning their neck while scurrying along, and worms shrinking and extending while worming their way. Looks a little silly…<br/></p><h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2><p>As you probably already guessed: the movent is, in reality, quite smooth. Try deselecting the “<span>Grid</span>” checkbox: now all scurrying gives way to fluid movement. </p><p>This was Jun Ono’s, Akiyasu Tomoeda’s, and Kokichi Sugihara’s <a href="http://illusionoftheyear.com/2014/pigeon-neck-illusion/" target="_blank">contribution</a> to the 2014 “Best illusion of the year” contest. As these authors write, it is a version of the “kickback illusion”, which is closely related to the <a href="https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-feetLin/index.html">Stepping Feet</a> illusion – see my explanation <a href="https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-feetLin/index.html">there</a>.</p><p>A simple concrete explanation: Start with a “worm”, imagine it had the same colour than the dark grid stripes. Thus, when its front end crosses the dark stripe, this edge is not visible. The length of a worm is chosen so that when its front is on a dark stripe, its back will be on a light stripe. Consequently, when the front end is not visible, its back end will be obvious, and its movement will be apparent: the worm seems to shrink. As soon as the front end leaves the dark stripe, it extends again.</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p><a href="http://illusionoftheyear.com/2014/pigeon-neck-illusion/" target="_blank">Ono J, Tomoeda A, Sugihara K (2014)</a> “Pigeon-Neck illusion” entry to the 2014 illusion contest</p><p><a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/6/12/5.long" target="_blank">Howe PDL, Thompson PG Anstis SM, Sagreiya H, Livingstone MS (2006)</a> Explaining the footsteps, belly dancer, Wenceslas, and kickback illusions.
