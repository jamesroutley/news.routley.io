The search took place between March and June using aerial laser mapping (LiDAR) technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The Maya civilization, known for its advanced mathematical calendars, spanned southeast Mexico and parts of Central America. Widespread political collapse led to its decline centuries before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors, whose military campaigns saw the last stronghold fall in the late 17th century.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The Ocomtun site has a core area, located on high ground surrounded by extensive wetlands, that includes several pyramid-like structures up to 15 meters high, lead archaeologist Ivan Sprajc said in a statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The city also had a ball court. Pre-Hispanic ball games, widespread throughout the Maya region, consist of passing a rubber ball representing the sun across a court without the use of hands and getting it through a small stone hoop. The game is believed to have had an important religious purpose.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Sprajc said his team had also found central altars in an area closer to the La Riguena river, which may have been designed for community rituals, though more research is needed to understand the cultures that once lived there.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The site probably declined around 800 to 1000 AD judging from materials extracted from buildings, he said, adding this was likely a reflection of &#34;ideological and population changes&#34; that led to the collapse of Maya societies in that region by the 10th century.</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Sarah Morland; Editing by Edwina Gibbs</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
