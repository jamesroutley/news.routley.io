    <h1>Everything I googled in a week as a professional software engineer (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an attempt to dispel the idea that if you have to google stuff you‚Äôre not a proper engineer, this is a list of nearly everything I googled in a week at work, where I‚Äôm a software engineer with several years&#39; experience.</p><p><a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/ground.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/ground.png" alt="Threw it on the ground."/></a></p><p>Obviously these weren‚Äôt all googled in a row (although you can probably spot that a few were), but throughout the day. I can‚Äôt remember the context of everything I was googling, but hopefully it‚Äôll make you feel a little better next time you have to google something.</p><h2 id="monday">Monday</h2><p><code>npm react-testing-library</code> - during a React upgrade, looking at dependencies to see latest versions and checking for breaking changes.</p><p><code>Expecting a parsed GraphQL document. Perhaps you need to wrap the query string in a &#34;gql&#34; tag?</code> - said React upgrade then started causing some super fun errors.</p><p><code>react-apollo release notes</code></p><p><code>react-apollo/test-utils</code> - tests were throwing some odd errors with our graphQL components.</p><p><code>undo a rebase</code> - oops.</p><p><code>react testing library apollo &#34;invariant violation&#34;</code> - package upgrades are so much fun!</p><p><code>jest silence warnings</code> - don‚Äôt judge me, ok?</p><p><code>semantic HTML contact details</code> - wanted to check if the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> tag was relevant here</p><p><code>aa contrast checker</code></p><p><code>temporary visual impairment</code> - fact checking for an accessibility talk I was giving that week</p><p><code>dominos accessibility</code> - popcorn.gif</p><p><code>shame gif</code> - an important part of any presentation</p><h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2><p><code>javascript get array of unique dates</code> - if I have an array of <code>Date</code>s, how can I filter them so they are unique? (<code>reduce</code>, naturally, but I can rarely use that without googling it first)</p><p><code>date to locale string</code></p><p><code>js date to locale string</code> - after I got a load of Java results</p><p><code>alternatives to Moment.js</code> - it‚Äôs large</p><p><code>group array items by date</code> - more <code>reduce</code> fun</p><p><code>sort object keys javascript</code></p><p><code>react fragment keys</code></p><p><code>next link</code> - needed a reminder of how to use the Link component in Next.JS</p><p><code>React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.</code></p><p><code>visual studio code disable autocomplete html</code> - it keeps autoclosing HTML elements on the same line, and I still can‚Äôt switch it off</p><p><code>dt dd dl</code> - couldn‚Äôt remember what the example use for these was.</p><p><code>html nested sections</code> - is it ok to have <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> inside <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>?</p><p><code>display dl in pairs</code></p><p><code>veggie ipsum</code> - the best lorem ipsum generator</p><p><code>css keyframes</code></p><p><code>css animate underline text</code></p><p><code>dl vs ul</code></p><p><code>react generating keys</code> - should I use some kind of hash, or should I use data in the props? (I ended up constructing a string with unique timestamp data)</p><p><code>css checkbox</code> - can we style checkboxes yet? (no)</p><p><code>flexbox center span</code> - it was 17:24 and I was tired by this point</p><p><code>grid minmax</code></p><p><code>flexible grid row</code> - I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of CSS Grid experience, so I always end up googling a ton with this.</p><p><code>grid row height auto</code></p><p><code>cauliflower shortage</code> - someone told me about this and I panicked</p><p><code>next.js hooks</code> - we can use them, right? (we can, and I did)</p><h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2><p><code>cors</code> - today is going to be bleak</p><p><code>the corrs</code> - once I hit some CORS errors I decided I needed to make a meme, and I needed to find the perfect image. It took a surprisingly long time.</p><p><a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/thecorrs-search.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/thecorrs-search.png" alt="Image of many many Google search results for The Corrs"/></a></p><figure><p><a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/thecors.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/images/thecors.jpg" alt="The CORS."/></a></p><figcaption>Worth it</figcaption></figure><p><code>git patch trailing whitespace</code> - I was sent a git patch with some whitespace that prevented it from actually patching</p><p><code>jsx annotation</code></p><p><code>web api fetch preflight</code> - in my CORS adventures I wanted to read up a bit more about preflight requests.</p><p><code>web api fetch origin header</code></p><p><code>discriminated union flow</code> - trying to diagnose problems with my Flow types.</p><p><code>whitespace regex</code> - is it <code>\w</code>?

Never be ashamed of googling, even if it seems like the most basic thing you‚Äôre looking up. I can never remember how <code>Date</code> works.
I‚Äôve built plenty of forms in React but couldn‚Äôt remember how <code>onSubmit</code> worked on the Friday evening at 5:30pm. I constantly have to google JS string methods. Cookies are terrible. (Incidentally, we fixed the cookie issue by running everything in a docker container and tunneling with <code>ngrok</code>, so everything‚Äôs on the same domain.)</p></div></div>
