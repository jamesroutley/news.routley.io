And so one can only conclude that HawkEye’s surveillance support for Gulf dictatorships is not an anomaly, but rather a corporate extension of official U.S. foreign policy.</span></p><h4>Appendix</h4><p><span>The full text of Hawkeye 360’s pitch to the Pentagon through the </span><a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/exclusive-inside-trident-spectre" rel="">Vulcan</a><span> contracting marketplace follows:</span></p><blockquote><p>(U//PROPIN) HawkEye 360 (HE360) operates the first-of-its-kind constellation of commercial satellites that can independently detect, identify, and geolocate radio-frequency (RF) signals to within 500 meters of their point of origin. Launched in December 2018, the first cluster of three spacecraft (known as the Pathfinder Cluster) has been fully operational since February of 2019. The software-defined radio (SDR) payload on all three spacecraft can be tuned to a wide range of different frequencies (144MHz-15GHz) and switched between several different RF front end and antenna paths. The HE360 Signal of Interest (SOI) library is the list of signals that can be geolocated by the company’s spacecraft. Common SOIs include UHF GMRS/FRS Push-to-talk Radios, VHF Radios, Automatic Identification System (AIS) EPIRB Emergency Radio Beacons, Cellular Towers, Satellite Phone, X-band Maritime Navigation Radars, Ku-band VSAT Terminals. Tools developed in-house by HE360 efficiently process this data in an integrated signal-processing and geo-engine to calculate and deliver information about myriad emitter types from around the planet.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) Additionally, HawkEye 360 satellites can detect RF signals in the GPS bands, as well as other GNSS systems, e.g. GLONASS. If detected by all three spacecraft, the RF energy from a GNSS interference can be geolocated to its point of origin using an adaptation of the company’s existing geolocation techniques. Due to the global coverage of the constellation, geolocation of GNSS jamming or spoofing can be conducted over denied areas without exposing airborne or terrestrial sensors or personnel to hostile conditions. Unlike electro optical sensors, RF geolocation provides data day and night in all weather conditions.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) HE360 Spectrum Awareness products can support multiple applications and mission areas; including theater indications and warning, pattern of life analysis; maritime domain awareness; illegal fishing identification; border monitoring, mapping communications nodes; and disaster response.</p><p>(U) HE360 data and products are entirely unclassified, providing theater intelligence officers with an unprecedented ability to share RF geolocations with tactical echelons and partner nations. HE360 data is easily accessible via a web interface, and is interoperable “out of the box” with all GIS, C4ISR, and mobile device systems.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>
