    <h1>Six mistakes I made in my dioramas-and-felt Steam game and one I didn&#39;t</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;m still working on my point-and-click puzzle game made from dioramas.</p>
<p>Often when you watch videos of people doing crafts on the internet,
they&#39;re people who have been doing it for years.  They don&#39;t make
mistakes, or if they do, they don&#39;t really show them to you.  I
haven&#39;t been doing any of these crafts for years.  So I&#39;ve made lots
of mistakes, and I want to show them to you, so you don&#39;t get the
impression that this is easy.</p>
<p>Before you read further: Please wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3469350/High_Mountain_Abbey/">High Mountain Abbey on Steam</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Tapestries</h2>
<p>Machine-woven tapestries (which I&#39;m using for rugs) are very
low-res -- 14ppi (which is, at my scale, 14 pixels per foot, which is
not very realistic, but it&#39;s probably forgivable).  The way they work
is really neat (but requires some pre-planning): they have six colors
of yarn: red, green, yellow, blue, white, and black. Depending on the
color of each pixel of your image, a different color ends up on top.
I wish I had known about this in advance, so that I could have
designed my images to do my own dithering, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be
a supported mode of operation for the services I found.  I guess
palletized pixel work is a dying art.</p>

<h2>2. Git hosting</h2>
<p>I quickly learned that git hosting was going to be an expense.  I
started with Gitlab&#39;s free tier, but that has a limit of 10GB.  I
would have liked to give them money, but their pricing for additional
storage is $0.50/GB/mo, which is outrageous -- S3 charges
$0.023/GB/mo, which is less than a twentieth of the price.  I assume
that Gitlab charges such high prices to account for the data transfer
costs, but my data is basically write-only, so it&#39;s a bad deal for me.</p>
<p>With seven rooms photographed so far, my repo right now is 53 GB,
since I&#39;m storing all of the photos that go into each focus-stack, as
well as the raw (xcf) versions of each shot so that I can edit and
color-correct without repeated JPEG compression.  I ended up just
running my own Gitlab on a cheap Hetzner VPS, which was trivial to set
up, and not very expensive.  It probably has less reliability than
Gitlab&#39;s service, but I have Hetzner&#39;s backups and also my own
desktop&#39;s backups, so I am not too worried.</p>
<h2>3. Animation</h2>
<p><a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/the-state-of-ai-for-hand-drawn-animation-inbetweening.html">Yossi warned me about this</a>, but I didn&#39;t listen: AI isn&#39;t actually
good at tweening.  It worked really well when I just had wool roving moving
around:</p>
<p><video controls="" height="720" loop="" width="928">
<source src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/wool-animation-2.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
    A video of a weird machine: on the right, a bronze circular frame has
    an inner rim made of blue wool roving.  Around the frame are three
    knobs.  When a knob is clicked, the wool roving retracts around
    the circle before growing again to its original shape.  Inside the
    circle, there are seven dots which move around, and on the left is
    a hopper with eleven red wool balls.  A ball falls into one of two
    wooden boxes as the wool animation runs.
</video></p>
<p>But then I tried to use it to tween a solid object rotating 60 degrees:</p>
<p><video controls="" height="126" loop="" width="104">
<source src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/bad-rife-rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
    A chartreuse needle-felted dial turns on a gray felt background. There&#39;s
    blurring and warping.
</video></p>
<p>This is surprisingly bad.  But I thought: maybe it&#39;s just that
rotation is bad?  So I tried with a door sliding down. Actually I
tried it with a door sliding up, but I didn&#39;t save the result, and
then when I went to re-create it for this blog post, the images ended
up in reverse order, so I guess it&#39;s sliding down now.  I&#39;m not
counting this as one of my six mistakes -- you get that one for free.</p>
<p><video controls="" height="640" loop="" width="382">
<source src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/door.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
    A door made out of horizontal slides up.  There is significant
    blurring.
</video></p>
<p>Admittedly, the motion on the door is a bit shaky (that&#39;s the joy of
stop-motion), but I would have expected better.  I guess the wool only
worked because it was already, well, wooly.  So I will have to live
with a low framerate on most of my animations.</p>
<p>I can sometimes use some trickery to improve the framerate.  For the
animation of something rotating, what I actually do is have Godot
rotate each frame while fading in the next frame.  I still have a bit
of the stop-motion look, since the object moves unevenly (and it&#39;s
made out of felt, so it wiggles too).  And I still have decent
shading, since the keyframes are photographed in situ with the correct
light.</p>
<h2>4. Shooting in confined spaces</h2>
<p>I had thought that I could do all of the photography by placing the
camera inside the dioramas.  But for narrow hallways, this doesn&#39;t
work -- the camera ends up too close to the wall to get a wide enough shot.</p>
<p>So I ended up doing something a little weird: I cut holes in the
walls, and shot the side views from the outside, through the holes.
Then, to make the insides look right, I put paintings or lamps or other
decorations over the holes.</p>
<p><img alt="Hole in the wall" src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/hole-in-the-wall.jpg" title="A photo of a diorama from the outside.  The bottom half shows the outside of a foamcore wall, which has a tiny square hole.  The top looks over the wall, into the diorama, at the top of a wooden door."/></p>
<p>That hole fits a camera lens -- I&#39;m still suffering from my camera&#39;s
narrow field of view, but at least you can see the door.  And when
I&#39;m shooting from the inside of the diorama, I pop a lamp into the
hole and you would never know it&#39;s there.</p>
<h2>5. Steam marketing</h2>
<p>I put up my <a href="https://novalis.org/blog/2024-10-18-building-a-game-with-the-real-engine.html">previous blog post</a>, which got some traction on Hacker
News. Great, I thought, everyone will want to buy my game!  But I
forgot a step: first, people have to learn about the game, and not
the seventeen people who follow my blog.  It turns out that the way
to do this is to get lots of people to wishlist the game on Steam.</p>
<p>So what I should have done is: first, create the Steam page for the
game, <em>then</em> post the first blog post.  Well, better late than never:
please <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3469350/High_Mountain_Abbey/">wishlist the game</a>.  The more folks wishlist it, the more Steam will feature
it at launch, and the more folks will buy it.</p>
<h2>6. Veneer</h2>
<p>So then I started working on the Steam page.  Steam requires nine
graphics, each with a different aspect ratio.  Normal people make
these graphics in Photoshop or Illustrator.  But High Mountain Abbey
is not a normal game; it&#39;s made of physical objects.  So, of course,
the Steam graphics must also be made of physical objects.  I started
with a piece of walnut burl veneer. Veneer is supposed to be flat, but
burl wood has wild grain, so when I tried to glue the piece down, it
warped like crazy.  Probably I should have clamped it hard, instead of
just tossing a board on top of it and hoping.  Or used a
non-water-based glue.</p>
<p><img alt="Steam assets" src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/steam-the-assets.jpg" title="On a messy desk, a piece
 of warped walnut burl veneer holds a sheet-brass bird skull
 silhouette with glass lens eyes and unlit filament LEDs coming out of
 its nortrils, some blue wool spelling &#39;High Mountain Abbey&#39; and a
 sparrow wing."/></p>
<p>Oh well, it adds character, I tell myself.</p>
<h2>One mistake I didn&#39;t make</h2>
<p>I love the idea of Rust: big abstractions, safety, performance. I feel
unease with non-memory-safe languages in 2025 even though I actually
really enjoy programming in C.  But it would have been <a href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/">a mistake</a> to build
High Mountain Abbey in Rust. There&#39;s always the temptation to make a
<a href="https://handmade.network/">custom engine</a> for any game.  But for this
game, Godot is just fine, and I think I regret even the slight amount
of weird custom stuff that I built to avoid dealing with Godot&#39;s
resource format.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>High Mountain Abbey will be released in 2026.  I can&#39;t wait for you
to play it.</p>
