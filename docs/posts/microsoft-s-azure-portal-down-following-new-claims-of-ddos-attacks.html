<p>The Microsoft Azure Portal is down on the web as a threat actor known as Anonymous Suda claims to be targeting the site with a DDoS attack.</p>
<p>Attempting to access the portal at <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://portal.azure.com</a> displays an error message stating, &#34;Our services aren&#39;t available right now. We&#39;re working to restore all services as soon as possible. Please check back soon.&#34; The mobile app appears unaffected at this time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Azure status page</a> includes status information stating that Microsoft is aware of the incident and are attempting to mitigate it.</p>

<p>At the same time, a threat actor known as Anonymous Sudan claims to be conducting a DDoS attack against the Microsoft Azure portal, sharing an image of the page not working.</p>

<p>Anonymous Sudan claims to be a hacktivist targeting US companies to protest the United States&#39; involvement in Sudanese internal affairs. However, <a href="http://twitter.com/780thC/status/1648269010851569665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">some believe</a> this is a false flag and that the threat actors are actually Russian.</p>
<p>Regardless of the threat actor&#39;s origins, this has not been a good week for Microsoft, with the threat actor conducting DDoS attacks on other Microsoft web portals for <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/outlookcom-hit-by-outages-as-hacktivists-claim-ddos-attacks/" target="_blank">Outlook.com</a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-onedrive-down-worldwide-following-claims-of-ddos-attacks/" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>, which also suffered outages at the same time.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has not confirmed that these outages were due to DDoS attacks, they did share the following statement with BleepingComputer yesterday, hinting that the issues are more than just a technical problem.</p>
<p>&#34;We are aware of these claims and are investigating. We are taking the necessary steps to protect customers and ensure the stability of our services,&#34; Microsoft told BleepingComputer in a statement.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has once again contacted Microsoft to ask if the services are down due to a DDoS attack, but a response was not immediately available.</p>
