<h2>A clear improvement</h2>
<p>As you can see in the included charts, SteamOS showed noticeable frame rate improvements in four of the five games tested. Only <em>Borderlands 3</em> showed comparable performance across both operating systems, with Windows eking out ever-so-slightly higher frame rates in that game&#39;s benchmarks.</p>


<p>For the other four tested games, the stock Lenovo Windows drivers were sometimes significantly worse than those included with SteamOS. When playing <em>Returnal</em> at &#34;High&#34; graphics presets and 1920Ã—1200 resolution, for instance, changing from Lenovo&#39;s Windows drivers to SteamOS meant the difference between a hard-to-take 18 FPS average and a downright decent 33 FPS average.</p>
<p>Sideloading the updated Asus drivers showed a noticeable improvement in Windows performance across all tested games and even brought <em>Homeworld 3</em>&#39;s &#34;Low&#34; graphics benchmark test to practical parity with SteamOS. In all other cases, though, even these updated drivers resulted in benchmark frame rates anywhere from 8 percent to 36 percent lower than those same benchmarks on SteamOS.</p>
<p>These results might seem a bit counterintuitive, considering that games running on SteamOS must go through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/valves-upcoming-steam-deck-will-be-based-on-arch-linux-not-debian/">a Proton translation layer</a> for every native Windows instruction in a game&#39;s code. But Valve has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">put in consistent work</a> over the years to make Proton as efficient and cross-compatible as possible; not to mention its <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/">continued work on Linux&#39;s Mesa graphics drivers</a> seems to be paying dividends for SteamOS graphics performance.</p>
<p>Running SteamOS also means eliminating a lot of operating system overhead that the more generalist Windows uses by default. Microsoft seems aware of this issue for gamers and has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">recently announced</a> that the upcoming &#34;Xbox Experience for Handheld&#34; will &#34;minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks&#34; to allow for &#34;more [and] higher framerates&#34; in games.</p>
