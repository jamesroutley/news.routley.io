    <h1>Goodbye 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>It&#39;s been a year. It&#39;s been a series of years.</h3>
<p>First, a quick rewind... without much ado:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I passed the <a href="https://www.visaverge.com/news/denmarks-citizenship-test-2025-new-format-stricter-passing-criteria/">Indfødsretsprøve</a> in November.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very difficult test with a ~40% pass rate, and was the last official
hoop I needed to jump through before I am allowed to apply for Danish
citizenship, which I will do now as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If I am lucky, I may have an approval by the end of this year. If I am unlucky, maybe
by the end of next year, or the next. They do like to take their time, but I
have made my application as straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>I never thought I would gain a second citizenship, and even throughout this process
(which has been laborious and long) the actual <em>getting of the thing</em> has
always felt so abstract, and remote. I have concrete <em>reasons</em> to do this, of
course, my son has dual citizenship and I&#39;ve lived here for nearly a decade
now. My wife is Danish, also, obviously.</p>
<p>I have learned the language toto what I&#39;ll say is a serviceable degree. In my
honest moments I must say that Danish culture has truly influenced me a lot,
and that I feel very aligned with it, and that I feel very at home here much of
the time. I&#39;m proud to be pursuing this, but the reality of it will, I think,
still catch me off guard.</p>
<p>But! I passed the test. It was the last hoop. Now I just apply, and wait. That test
was a huge stressor in my life, and before it the <a href="https://www.studieskolen.dk/en/tests/danish-tests/proeve-i-dansk-3-pd3">language test</a>, which
I failed once and passed the second time... I am no natural linguist as it
turns out. It was years of Danish classes, module tests, practice and finally
the PD3. It took a lot of time and a lot of headspace. Having jumped through
these hoops frees up an enormous amount of both of those things in this new
year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407801271744774144/">I was promoted to Staff Engineer in December</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On a video call from my childhood bedroom, which was a bit surreal.</p>
<p>This has been a long term career goal. I&#39;ll be working on a new project this
year and there is still so much to learn. I&#39;m having a really great time, professionally.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Some private but very serious health issues in my family were resolved in the fall</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some intense stuff, involving emergency surgeries and scary moments. Recovery,
patience, time. Things are better now, and I am thankful for that.</p>
<p>So, like I said, it&#39;s been a year.</p>
<h3>Next...</h3>
<p>I have designs to write more, and to be more creative in general, in public. I
have time to do it. I have the resources I need to do most of what I&#39;d like to
try to do.</p>
<p>People often ask me if I &#34;still play guitar&#34; or music in general, which is a
reasonable question, I guess, but to me sounds like &#34;are you still breathing
and eating?&#34;  What?? Yeah? Wth. I practice or play almost every day, and
although I do go through periods where I don&#39;t as much, it&#39;s a vital part of my
life and always will be.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I was cleaning out some old materials from my parents&#39; house,
finding recordings and experiments, flyers for shows I played... I&#39;ve never
regretted anything I&#39;ve made, and all that tells me is that I should make more.
So that is what I&#39;m hoping to do. And in public.</p>
<p>In codeland... learning Erlang a bit this spring for work and play, hoping to
get into some light homelabbing, reading more, going to the gym regularly
again... I&#39;ve got some hardware projects in mind, and learning more about
embedded systems. This job is an endless font of new challenges and things to
learn, and I love that.</p>
<p>2026 is a big year for me; I feel like I can finally start having a &#34;normie
life&#34; after decades of being a nomad, then a creative class near vagabond,
then an expat dad... it&#39;s maybe strange to say, I know, but for the first time
in my adult life I have real, reliable stablity without any swords of
damocleses hovering directly over my personal head.</p>
<p>I may retire this blog. I may start a new one somewhere else. That feels like
it might be the right time.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve been a reader of this blog at any point, thank you. If you&#39;re reading
this on RSS, double thank you. And let me know that! I have no idea if that is
actually being used much.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>
