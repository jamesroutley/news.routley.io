<p>In much of the work that I do I try to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/">automate to save mental energy</a>.
Automation, to ‚Äútechy‚Äù people, often means to apply some sort of repeatable
application of machinery or code in order both free us from manual labor and
potentially increase our effective throughput. I‚Äôm using a more general
interpretation of ‚Äúautomation‚Äù when I say ‚ÄúI try to automate to save mental
energy‚Äù ‚Äì an interpretation more in line with what John D. Cook points towards
in his post quoted and linked to above.</p>
<p>Yes, writing scripts, applying tools and utilities to common everyday
programming problems are undeniably ‚Äúautomation‚Äù. However, automation in its
purest sense isn‚Äôt reserved for silicate or metallic machinery only. Biology
automates through instinct and practice.</p>
<p>What this means to me in practice is that I relatively often invest a
significant amount of time learning new things, practicing various skills, and
iterating on my workflows. Not necessarily to save on some imaginary ‚Äúnet sum of
time spent‚Äù<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ‚Äì although Randall Munroe of <code>XKCD</code> has <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">shared</a> some <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">thoughts</a>
on the topic of ‚Äì but to ensure I can maintain a certain level of focus in my
work when I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="focus">Focus üîç</h2>
<p>Why is focus so important? Well, <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2023-09-19-programming-is-hard.html">programming is hard</a> and I‚Äôm sure also most
non-programmers acknowledge the importance of focus when doing work requiring a
certain level of immersion.</p>
<p>This little gem from <a href="https://www.monkeyuser.com/">MonkeyUser.com</a> illustrates ‚Äúfocus‚Äù for a programmer
perfectly:</p>
<p><img src="https://myme.no/images/monkeyuser-focus.png" alt="&#34;https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/focus/&#34;" title="Focus"/></p>
<p>I‚Äôve often used the analogy of building a house of cards when explaining to
non-programmers how we build mental models of the problems we are solving. Like
a house of cards these mental models take considerable time and effort to
construct, but topple over and collapse from even the smallest breath of air
(interruptions).</p>
<p>Our mental models dissolve faster than cotton candy in water when we‚Äôre
distracted at an inappropriate time.</p>
<p><img src="https://myme.no/images/raccoon.gif"/></p>
<p>How about focus in <em>my</em> work? Sure!</p>


<p>The draft of this post is over a year old. I guess I got distracted!</p>
<p>In fact, I was writing this very post when I realized the prelude was worthy of
a post of its own. That became <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2023-09-19-programming-is-hard.html">Programming is hard</a>. It gained quite a few views,
then I guess I forgot all about this one.</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions ‚ö°</h2>
<p>Distractions; the arch enemy of every coder. Distractions break our focus by
ripping us out of our flow states. It doesn‚Äôt help that programming environments
are littered with potential distractions. They come in many shapes and forms, to
name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ö° Physical interruptions from our surroundings (meetings, colleagues, notifications).</li>
<li>üß† Internal interruptions through impulsive thoughts (spontaneous ideas, procrastination).</li>
<li>ü§∑ Missing preconditions to perform a task (unclear objectives, yak shaving, tech debt).</li>
<li>‚û∞ Long feedback loops (handovers, difficulty testing, ++).</li>
<li>ü•™ An empty stomach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some distractions are obvious, others are more subtle.</p>
<p>When we talk about distractions it‚Äôs often the ‚Äúbig and obvious‚Äù ones that
people think of. Those are the distractions where you‚Äôre interrupted by someone
or something in your surroundings. It may be somebody ‚Äújust popping over to ask
a question‚Äù or some meeting looming on the horizon about to evacuate you from
your warm and cozy ‚Äúflow zone‚Äù.</p>
<p>In recent years I‚Äôve also grown more conscious of less obvious forms of
distractions. Things like small papercuts and annoyances which I previously
might have accepted simply as a natural part of ‚Äúwork‚Äù. By not acknowledging
these minor nuisances as distractions I‚Äôve never stopped to consider how they
may negatively affect my productivity or cognitive ability. However, tiny
inconveniences can add up to make solving issues more difficult than it needs
to be.</p>
<p>Much can be done to reduce the distractions within an organization, but
introducing transformational change can be hard for an individual alone.
Organizational chaos might even be outside of our control. What we <em>can</em> control
to some extent is how we interface with the environment around us.</p>
<p>I find many negative effects of distractions ‚Äì large and small ‚Äì can be greatly
reduced through personal organization and mastery of your tools.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization üìì</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm personally a big fan of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettlekasten</a> methods
(using <code>emacs</code> with <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> and <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a>), and various other ‚Äúproductivity
life-hacks‚Äù.</p>
<p>I strongly believe everyone should invest a bit of time and effort into learning
a few organizational tools. I don‚Äôt have strong opinions on which, but I believe
it‚Äôs crucial to learn them well enough and integrate them into your daily
workflow so that they stay out of your way. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be anything
digital. A paper notepad is honestly perfectly acceptable too. However, I
believe tighter integration into e.g. code editors increases the possibility for
distraction free note-taking and organization.</p>
<p>I feel an organizational tool hits the sweetspot when you hardly notice yourself
using it.</p>
<p>In my case I‚Äôve achieved such ergonomics using <code>emacs</code> as both my primary code
editor <em>and</em> note-taking application. <code>Org mode</code> lets me capture all kinds of
fleeting notes and <code>Org-roam</code> complements it by allowing me to quickly refile
things into a personal knowledge graph. <code>TODO</code> lists and priorities fit nicely
into the same workflow, as does time-tracking.</p>
<p>I must admit I have a lot of issues with <code>emacs</code>, but the way some of these
‚Äúkiller app‚Äù plugins integrate into a comprehensive productivity tool I have yet
to find anything matching what I‚Äôm after.</p>
<p>There is A LOT of literature on personal organization, so I don‚Äôt want to spend
too much time on this topic in this post. Let‚Äôs move on to another critical tool
in the battle against distractions: mastery.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-mastery">The value of mastery üßô</h2>
<p>I briefly touched on ‚Äúpractice makes perfect‚Äù in <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2024-01-21-produce-dont-consume.html#practice-makes-perfect">produce, don‚Äôt consume</a> and how
practice can be incorporated into constructive efforts. Writing this post I‚Äôve
also come to realize that another trait of practice and mastery is how
automating our skill through practice helps us cancel out distractions in order
to maintain focus.</p>
<p>Mastering our tools is important as it allows our brains to focus on the task at
hand. If we are forced to spend a significant amount of our brain power learning
programming language syntax, editor bindings or APIs then we have less mental
energy to spend on solving <em>actual</em> problems. Battling complexity on multiple
fronts increases cognitive load and often a loss of focus.</p>
<p>A dancer who doesn‚Äôt know the basic moves of a dance style will have great
trouble connecting motions in the choreography while maintaining rhythm and
composure. Similarly, a programmer who constantly stumble on basic syntax or
interpreting compiler errors will have a harder time constructing a mental model
of the problem she‚Äôs solving.</p>
<p>But we do not necessary have to become specialists to become effective. In fact,
becoming and staying a proper expert in more than a handful of fields is a fools
errand in modern software development. Ecosystems evolve too quickly, new tools
and practices come and go. Not to mention the looming paradigm shift of
artificial intelligence and how it might render significant aspects of
conventional programming obsolete<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What I find useful is to learn enough about a wide variety of topics to build a
basic intuition for when specific technologies or methodologies will help solve
the problems we‚Äôre faced with. You‚Äôll then eventually start picking out what
matters to you and your expertise will grow somewhat organically<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Also try
to surround yourself with smart people complementing your own abilities.</p>
<p>Practice and repetition is crucial to become a master in just about anything. A
musician spends time with her instrument to improve, programmers spend time with
their ‚Äútech stacks‚Äù, editors and tools. It‚Äôs a matter of starting somewhere.
Experts weren‚Äôt born experts. And even though talent or determination allow some
to progress faster than others nobody who achieve mastery within any discipline
will admit to not having worked hard ‚Äì or for a long time ‚Äì to acquire the skill
they possess.</p>
<p>Just as a musician is likely to butcher an unfamiliar instrument, a programmer
dropped into a new development environment will most definitely experience some
initial regression in their productivity. This is normal, but it is also the way
we learn. The difficulty is knowing (or choosing) what to learn, and when. In
the middle of a high-stakes project is probably not the right time to pick up a
new language or framework<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Whether you consider yourself a specialist or a generalist I believe software
development is quite unique in the way many skills are transferable across
environments. Some skills invested transcend their technologies almost entirely
due to their pervasiveness or general applicability.</p>
<h3 id="typing-speed">Typing speed</h3>
<p>Muscle memory and habits are both important abilities of the body and mind to
increase our efficiency and reduce our cognitive load. Making things more
automatic allows us to complete repeatable tasks faster or do so without
sacrificing our ability to reason about the problems we‚Äôre currently solving.</p>
<p>Most seasoned programmers know that we spend significantly more time reading and
navigation through code than actually changing existing code or writing new
code. For this reason it‚Äôs easy to assume that learning effective typing is
secondary to learning how to structure programs really well. I don‚Äôt disagree,
yet I have the impression that many of the really amazing programmers I know are
also great typists.</p>
<p>I believe there might be a very simple reason for this correlation ‚Äì besides the
obvious take that great programmers spend a lot of time in front of their
computer, thus become great typists. No, I believe by being able to generate
many programs fast you are also able to attempt many possible solutions faster.
Difficult problems require thinking, I know. But few things beat the speed of
finding code problems as actually passing code through a compiler or an
interpreter and executing it.</p>
<p>I would say it‚Äôs worth putting effort into improving your typing. Not with the
end-goal ‚Äúwriting as fast as possible‚Äù in mind of, but rather to <em>interface</em> as
efficiently as possible with the computer. Why then not also try to improve
<em>how</em> you type? Let‚Äôs take <code>vi/vim</code> and modal editing as an example.</p>
<h3 id="vim-bindings">Vim bindings</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://neovim.io/">(neo)</a><a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> there are keybindings bound to operations which operate on various
textual structures.</p>
<p>Bindings may operate on ‚Äúbodies‚Äù of text like letters, words, sentences or
paragraphs. Or they operate on pairs of quotes, parentheses and brackets. They
can work on locations like the beginning and end of a buffer. Or even metadata
not represented in the buffer itself, like the location of compilation errors
from an external tool or spelling errors from a spell checker.</p>
<p>Once <code>vim</code> motions are internalized it‚Äôs amazing how efficient it feels to
‚Äúdelete all word‚Äù (<code>daw</code>) or ‚Äúchange in paragraph‚Äù (<code>cip</code>) without breaking a
sweat. The great strength and power of <code>vim</code> motion bindings come from how a few
handfuls of general-purpose operations translate across different types of
textual motions, from prose to any style of programming and markup languages.</p>
<p>Editors like <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune">Kakoune</a> and <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> attempt to improve further on this concept. I
have little experience using them, but I struggle to see how investing
significant time into them at this point is worth the effort. After all, one of
the main benefits of <code>vim</code> and <code>vim</code> motions is how pervasive they are.</p>
<p>There are many ways people can argue that learning <code>vim</code>-style modal editing
helps their productivity. It can, however, be somewhat tricky to determine what
exactly people benefit from it. Personally I‚Äôm certain the time I invested into
learning motion bindings and compound operations many years ago has reaped
dividends way past the initial investment.</p>
<h3 id="optimize-the-common-paths">Optimize the common paths</h3>
<p>But how? By letting me type faster? What has typing and <code>vim</code> motions to do with
avoiding distractions?</p>
<p>Everything!</p>
<p>The keyboard is still my main interface to the computer. As long as it continues
to be it matters to me to wield it well.</p>
<p>Similarly to <code>vim</code> motions most mainstream <code>$SHELL</code> prompts default to
<code>emacs</code>-style <code>readline</code> bindings<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. To me that was motivation enough to put
some effort into internalize the most common <code>readline</code> keyboard bindings on the
CLI (for <code>emacs</code> users this is trivial).</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you know how to undo edit operations in <code>readline</code> ‚úã (yes,
<code>C-/</code> and <code>C-u C-/</code> works in your prompt!)</p>
<p>Programming is littered with micro-distractions, remember? Not only do you
increase your efficiency at typing out actual programs by learning effective
text navigation and manipulation (as well as text generation through snippets
and generative A.I.). You also do so while sparing your brain from having to
think about these trivial ‚Äúproblems‚Äù and road-blocks.</p>
<p>This is just as true <em>in</em> your editor as outside of it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not uncommon to find myself thinking about my <em>next</em> steps while doing some
other thing like text navigation or manipulation using either <code>vim</code> or
<code>readline</code> keybindings. By now they‚Äôre so ingrained in muscle memory that I more
often that not think about <em>what</em> I need to do, not <em>how</em>. It just happens.</p>
<p>And let me say that the point of this section is not to boast or rave about
<code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> bindings. The point is that by learning your tools really well
they eventually get out of your way and you‚Äôre free to tackle the actual
problems you‚Äôre faced with. It‚Äôs even better if these skills are applicable in a
wide variety of applications and environments ‚Äì try to stick to defaults.</p>
<h2 id="braaains">Braaains üß†</h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt mind learning, but I want to choose ‚Äì within my power ‚Äì when, how and
how much to learn. After all, learning is all about rewiring our brains. It‚Äôs
mental exercise, and like physical exercise learning can be very exhausting. The
same goes for problem solving ‚Äì it‚Äôs our brains applying our existing knowledge
in order to achieve something new.</p>
<p>Knowing when to invest time into learning, automation or optimization is not
trivial. Done prematurely there‚Äôs the risk of sinking costs into efforts that
won‚Äôt pay off, yet stubbornly sticking to old ways could be impeding future
efficiency. A big part of maturing as a software developer is knowing (or more
likely, <em>sensing</em>) when the time is right for you.</p>
<p>The biggest bottleneck of software development is still the (human) brain. It‚Äôs
a precious resource, but it can only do so much and distractions greatly reduce
its capacity.</p>
<p>Through practice and mastery, by building and honing physical and internal
tools, we can offload our brains to focus much more of its effort on the
problems we‚Äôre solving. By allocating more brainpower into solving problems
we‚Äôre also more likely to succeed in solving some of the hard ones, and to more
gracefully recover from distractions when they occur.</p>
<p>Now, what was I doing again‚Ä¶?</p>
