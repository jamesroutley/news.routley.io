  <h4>Pricing</h4>

  <p>
    This language model is priced by how many input tokens are sent as inputs and how many output tokens are generated.
  </p>

<h2 id="model-details">Model Details</h2>
<p>Arctic is a dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture pre-trained from scratch by the Snowflake AI 
Research Team. We are releasing model checkpoints for both the base and instruct-tuned versions of 
Arctic under an Apache-2.0 license. This means you can use them freely in your own research, 
prototypes, and products. Please see our blog 
<a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/arctic-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models-snowflake" rel="nofollow">Snowflake Arctic: The Best LLM for Enterprise AI — Efficiently Intelligent, Truly Open</a> 
for more information on Arctic and links to other relevant resources such as our series of cookbooks 
covering topics around training your own custom MoE models, how to produce high-quality training data, 
and much more.</p>

<h2 id="model-architecture">Model Architecture</h2>
<p>Arctic combines a 10B dense transformer model with a residual 128x3.66B MoE MLP resulting in 480B 
total and 17B active parameters chosen using a top-2 gating. For more details about Arctic’s model
