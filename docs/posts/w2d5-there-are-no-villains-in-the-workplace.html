    <h1>W2D5 - There are no villains in the workplace</h1>

      <div><p>We drove up to Point Reyes today, so another sparse post.</p><p>I completed Advent of Code Day 6. The instructions clearly refer to a hypothetical Camel Cards game, but I implemented a poker hand strength evaluator which worked for the example which didn&#39;t work for the puzzle input. I went down a rabbit hole trying to debug Part 1, and I was not in a good mood when I started working on Part 2 (especially since I had to wait after the trip).</p><p>Cindy Wu and I co-organized an RC meetup in SF! It was great seeing people at the start of the New Year. I made a note to listen to Avery Burke and Stevie Hryciw being <a href="https://topiclords.com/darmok-and-jalad-go-to-white-castle">featured</a> in the podcast Topic Lords.</p><p>I did get to listen to Will Larson&#39;s <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-engineering-mindset-will-larson-carta-stripe-uber-calm-digg/">interview</a> on Lenny&#39;s Podcast. This quote stood out to me.</p><blockquote>Is it ever this simple? It&#39;s really never that simple. People create simplistic narratives to find villains that they work with. There are no villains in the workplace. They&#39;re just people with complex incentives that are doing complex things.</blockquote></div>
