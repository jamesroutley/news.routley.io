    <h1>Ask HN: YC co-founder matching is bad</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m wondering is there a monthly or periodically post on HN where we could actually learn about other people&#39;s ideas or people who are just in development phase or maybe just researching and are looking for co-founders.</p><p>I&#39;m wondering what everyone thinks.</p></div></div></div>
