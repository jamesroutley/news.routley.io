          romfile
          games/gba [ -a ] [ -b biosfile ] [ -s savetype ] [ -g

     DESCRIPTION
          Gb, gba, nes and snes are emulators for the Nintendo Game
          Boy and Game Boy Color (GB and GBC), Nintendo Game Boy
          Advance (GBA), Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and
          Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).  They execute
          the romfile given as an argument.  The z, x, a, s, q, w,
          return and shift keys correspond to B, A, Y, X, L1, L2,
          Start and Select, respectively.  Other keys:

          F1   Pause the emulator. If already paused it will step one
               video frame.

          F5   Save the current state in gb.save / gba.save / nes.save
               / snes.save.

          F6   Load the current state from gb.save / gba.save /
               nes.save / snes.save.

          F12  Toggle the emulator&#39;s speedometer.  It shows in the
               upper left, off-viewport corner, the ratio between the
               expected and observed time it took to draw 60 frames.

          t    Toggle tracing of the emulator.

          `    It uncaps the 60fps frame rate and lets emulation go as
               fast as possible.

          Esc  Pause the emulator.

          Del  Exit the emulator.

          Command line options:

          -a   Enable audio output.

          -x   Scale the screen to a given factor regardless of the
               window&#39;s size.

          gb options:

     <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>                                           <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>

          -c   Run GBC roms in GBC mode and DMG (GB) roms in GBC&#39;s DMG
               compatibility mode.

          -d   Run GB roms in DMG mode. GBC-only roms will not run in
               this mode; others will run only in black &amp; white.

          -Cnnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn
               Select a color palette. Has no effect on roms in color
               mode. The syntax is of the form -C
               ffffff,aaaaaa,555555,000000 (using HTML style rrggbb
               notation).

          -liaddr
               These enable serial port connectivity emulation using
               the network. The -l flag configures the listening part-
               ner, whereas -i configures the dialing partner. The
               connection is established before the rom starts.  Com-
               munication is synchronous, emulation will stall while
               waiting for the other partner.

          gba options:

          -b   Location of the GBA BIOS file (required to operate the
               emulator). Default is /sys/games/lib/gbabios.bin.

          -s   Save format used by the original game. Valid formats
               are: eeprom4, eeprom64, sram256, flash512, flash1024.
               The number corresponds to the size, in kilobits, of the
               save file. By default, the emulator attempts to auto-
               matically detect the save format, but does not always
               succeed.  Some roms require a specific flash device id
               which may need to be set manually for them to work.
               Valid formats and corresponding ids are: flash512
               (SST), flash512mx (Macronix 64K), flash512pan (Pana-
               sonic), flash512atm (Atmel), flash1024 (Macronix 128K),
               flash1024san (Sanyo).

          -g   GPIO hardware used by the original game. The only valid
               type currently is rtc (real time clock).  By default,
               the emulator attempts to automatically detect the GPIO
               hardware using the game code found in the rom header.

          nes options:

          -o   Hide the top and bottom eight pixels (overscan area),
               like a real television would.

          -s   Save contents of battery backed SRAM (used by some
               games for savegames) as a file (gb and snes automati-
               cally detect if this is needed).

          snes options:

     <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>                                           <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>

          -h   Override HiROM/LoROM detection: -h sets LoROM, -hh sets
               HiROM.

          -m   Enable mouse emulation using system mouse. Mouse button
               1 (left button) engages the SNES left mouse button.
               Mouse button 3 (right button) engages the SNES right
               mouse button. Holding down mouse button 2 (middle but-
               ton) disengages the SNES mouse entirely so that the
               Plan 9 cursor offset can be adjusted to align with the
               SNES cursor.

          Each of these emulators support the use of joysticks via
          <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/joy">joy(1)</a>. Nes also supports selecting the joystick for either
          player 1 or 2.

     BUGS
          You bet!
          SRAM saving on the NES only functions when the -s option is
          used.
          The SNES horizontal hires mode is supported only with -2
          scaling.
          All emulators assume a North American (i.e. NTSC) system.
          PAL games (and in some cases Japanese games) are not sup-
          ported.
          The serial link emulation has issues with desynchronization
          in timing dependent scenarios.
