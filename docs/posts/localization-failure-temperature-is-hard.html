						<p>The Guardian is one of my favorite news sources. I’m a subscriber (support news organizations!) and I read it daily. But it is not immune to errors, as this headline shows:</p>
<p><a href="https://randomascii.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/image-7.png"><img width="236" height="241" title="Record heat: Malawi swelters with temperatures nearly 68F above average" alt="Record heat: Malawi swelters with temperatures nearly 68F above average" src="https://randomascii.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/image_thumb-7.png?w=236&amp;h=241"/></a></p>
<p>68 <b>°</b>F above average is a lot. For a tropical country it is not credible for temperatures to be that much warmer than average because the average is too high to give enough headroom. So what gives?</p>

<p>Reading the article I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>parts of Malawi saw a maximum temperature of 43C (109F), compared with an average of nearly 25C (77F)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I expected the actual temperature increase was 32 <b>°</b>F, not 68 <b>°</b>F. So what’s up with that headline? Here’s a hint: this is what the headline might say if you set your location to somewhere other than the United States:</p>
<p><a href="https://randomascii.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/image-8.png"><img width="235" height="203" title="Malawi swelters in record heat with temperatures nearly 20C above average" alt="Malawi swelters in record heat with temperatures nearly 20C above average" src="https://randomascii.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/image_thumb-8.png?w=235&amp;h=203"/></a></p>
<p>Now “nearly 20C” is an odd way of saying “18 <b>°</b>C”, but I guess they really like round numbers, and that’s not the problem. The problem is that somebody – the localization team? an algorithm? – decided that 20 <b>°</b>C was equivalent to 68 <b>°</b>F. And they’re not wrong. And yet they are.</p>
<p>When converting from a temperature in Celsius to one in Fahrenheit you have to multiply by 1.8 (because each degree Celsius covers a range 1.8 times as large as a degree Fahrenheit) and you have to add 32 <b>°</b>F (because the freezing point in Fahrenheit is 32, compared to 0 in Celsius). However if you are converting a temperature <em>difference</em> you just multiply by 1.8.</p>
<p>That is, if the temperature goes up by 1 <b>°</b>C then it has gone up by 1.8 <b>°</b>F. If it goes up by 10 <b>°</b>C then it has gone up by 18 <b>°</b>F. If it goes up by 20 <b>°</b>C then it has gone up by 36 <b>°</b>F. Adding 32 <b>°</b>F in this context is just wrong.</p>
<p>This is just another version of the fallacy involved when somebody says that it is “twice as hot” when the temperature goes from 5 <b>°</b>C to 10 <b>°</b>C – note that this is equivalent to going from 278 <b>°</b>K to 283 <b>°</b>K, or 41 <b>°</b>F to 50 <b>°</b>F, so clearly not “twice as hot” in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>In short, translating 20 <b>°</b>C requires examining the context and there are at least three possible translations:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The temperature is 20 <b>°</b>C” translates to “The temperature is 78 <b>°</b>F”</li>
<li>“It’s 20 <b>°</b>C warmer than yesterday” translates to “It’s 36 <b>°</b>F warmer than yesterday”</li>
<li>“The temperature is minus 20 <b>°</b>C” translates to “The temperature is minus 4 <b>°</b>F”</li>
</ul>
<p>So 20 <b>°</b>C is either 78 <b>°</b>F, 36 <b>°</b>F, or (minus) 4 <b>°</b>F.</p>

I also unicycle. And play (ice) hockey. And sled hockey. And juggle. And worry about whether this blog should have been called randomutf-8.
