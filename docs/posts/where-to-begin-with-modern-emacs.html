    <h1>Ask HN: Where to begin with &#34;modern&#34; Emacs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi all,</p><p>I’m a longtime Neovim user who’s been EMacs-curious. The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what. I know Doom exists, but I want to fully “own” my config and not over complicate it.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div></div></div>
