<p dir="auto">The OS-1000-lines-zig repository is a Zig-based operating system project. The primary purpose of this project is to create a simple, lightweight operating system with a focus on performance and scalability. The key features of this project include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A monolithic kernel architecture</li>
<li>Support for basic process management and memory management</li>
<li>A simple command-line interface</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">To get started with the OS-1000-lines-zig project, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Zig compiler (version 0.10.0 or later)</li>
<li>A code editor or IDE of your choice</li>
<li>A terminal or command prompt</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To install the project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Clone the repository using the command <code>git clone https://github.com/botirk38/OS-1000-lines-zig.git</code></li>
<li>Navigate to the project directory using the command <code>cd OS-1000-lines-zig</code></li>
<li>Build the project using the command <code>zig build</code></li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">To use the OS-1000-lines-zig project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Run the project using the command <code>zig run</code></li>
<li>Interact with the command-line interface to execute commands and view output</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Some basic examples of usage include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Running a simple &#34;Hello World&#34; program</li>
<li>Viewing system information such as memory usage and process list</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The OS-1000-lines-zig project uses a monolithic kernel architecture, which means that the kernel and user space are combined into a single executable. The kernel is responsible for managing processes, memory, and other system resources.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project includes several key components, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>src/kernel.zig</code>: The kernel implementation, which provides basic process management and memory management functionality.</li>
<li><code>src/common.zig</code>: A utility file that provides common functions and macros used throughout the project.</li>
<li><code>build.zig</code>: The build script, which is used to compile and link the project.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The project uses a simple configuration file to store settings and options. To modify the configuration, edit the <code>config.zig</code> file and rebuild the project.</p>

<p dir="auto">Contributions to the project are welcome! To contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.</p>

<p dir="auto">The OS-1000-lines-zig project is licensed under the MIT License. See the <code>LICENSE</code> file for more information.</p>

<p dir="auto">The project includes automated tests and validation scripts to ensure its correctness and stability. To run the tests, use the command <code>zig test</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are several areas for future development and expansion of the operating system, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Adding support for more advanced process management and memory management features</li>
<li>Implementing a more robust command-line interface</li>
<li>Adding support for networking and file systems</li>
</ul>
