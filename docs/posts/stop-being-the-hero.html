    <h1>Stop Being the Hero</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TLDR: </strong><em>your customers and teammates want to be the hero, so the greatest opportunity is to help them get there; be the Yoda to their Skywalker </em>When I became a lead PM, I made a near-fatal career mistake. I was used to working at a tiny startup. A startup is like a baby. It cries 24/7 and requires a team of heroes to keep alive. I liked being a hero, someone trusted to save the day. </p><h2><strong>Every problem is 3 layers deep</strong></h2><p>Every juicy problem has three layers. It starts with a practical need, turns into an emotional desire, and is topped with a captivating narrative. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6036cf6ddcc77dbf6df8fe1e/60628803621c00240e5fcc41_Webp.net-resizeimage%20(56).jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong></strong> We present our product as the best solution — it’s the hero! But customers ignore features unless they translate into benefits that make <em>them</em> the hero. The most convincing benefits align with their aspirational identity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6036cf6ddcc77dbf6df8fe1e/60615e589a0fa541bba25eeb_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F91c7cc44-b03e-47d8-8c59-de19c408677d_1316x982.png" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Source: backlinko.com</figcaption></figure><h2>Connect the dots</h2><p>In most places, a different team is responsible for each layer, and it shows. A thing is first made, then marketed and explained in the most flattering light. </p><ul role="list"><li>What is the direct thing you make possible? </li></ul><p><strong>Emotional: </strong></p><ul role="list"><li>What do your customers aspire to be? Think: what will help them survive and thrive?</li><li>How can you help them step into their new identity with what you make? <em>‍</em></li><li><em>Hint: Pay close attention to the words they use because they reveal how you should describe your offering </em></li></ul><p><strong>Narrative: </strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Why is this the right thing for the world?</li></ul><h2><strong>Competitive edge</strong></h2><p>Many players can fill your practical needs, but emotions and narratives forge a deeper bond. Endless car and device makers, but only one Tesla and Apple. It&#39;s hard to replace a product that makes you the person you want to be!</p><h2><strong>Curse of knowledge</strong></h2><p>Getting good with emotions and narratives make you a better leader and teammate. </p><ul role="list"><li>What’s the problem you’re solving?</li><li>What options are you considering?</li><li>What does your next step look like?</li></ul><p><strong>Having good answers can hurt your ability to </strong><a href="https://www.productlessons.xyz/article/ask-better-questions" target="_blank"><strong>ask better questions</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It feels good when people see you as the expert, but the day you start believing it, you stop learning. You also unintentionally rob others the thrill of learning. </p><h2>The OG hierarchy</h2><p>Think about your favorite product. Then think about your favorite project. Mine are Spotify and learning Webflow. It’s no coincidence that both are about self-expression. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6036cf6ddcc77dbf6df8fe1e/60615e58729114a9793acd14_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F5defe2ac-bab0-4870-aa90-75668a891c50_1500x1000.png" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Recommended reads</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://amzn.to/39pqGEV" target="_blank">Building a StoryBrand</a> — mind-blowing book that inspired this post 🤯</li><li><a href="https://backlinko.com/copywriting-guide" target="_blank">Copywriting Guide</a> — long read that feels short; packed with actionable gems 💎</li></ul><p>👋 P.S.
