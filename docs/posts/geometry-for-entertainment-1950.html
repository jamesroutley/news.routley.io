Several of his classic works are translated, though this one was not. This was a rather ambitious first project of translating an entire book, I was not sure if I could complete it in a reasonable time frame. To my own surprise the project got completed in <a href="https://gitlab.com/mirtitles/perelman-geometry/-/commits/master" rel="nofollow">little over a month:</a> first commit on 25 April and last on 30 May 2024. I took help from several online translators for the translations. I did learn to read a bit of Russian in the process. :)</p><p>Hopefully there are no major blunders in the translation. Please do let me know if you find any errors either in the translation or the mathematics.</p><p>Though I have credited the link on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/20220910_perelman_geometry/" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a> (IA user <em>Philipp Zanko</em> aka <a href="https://archive.org/details/@philipp_zanko" rel="nofollow">Russian Lutheran),</a> I must thank the original scanner who made this file available (if it was not Russian Lutheran). The processing of these scans was done with GIMP (for selection and editing) and Inkscape (for vector pdf conversion). The final file size is slightly larger (~ 55 M) primarily due to the heavy illustrations. They were converted to vector pdf for the book from the original scans.</p><p>I have use LuaLaTeX engine for compilation and Linux Libertine font for the book. The typesetting in LaTeX also provided several challenges which were sorted through expert help at <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">tex.stackexchange</a>. I have used a square profile for the book with wide margin which allows for a nicer reading.</p><p>The book is released with an open but a restrictive license, CC By NC SA. We might go for a print version of the book (though others are still pending ikik), this step is towards that goal.</p><p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the outcome, and it gives me great pleasure to share it with you. I hope you enjoy reading it too. I am optimistic that this is first of many translations of to come. Do wish me luck!</p><p><em>Damitr Mazanav – &#34;The Mitr&#34;</em></p><p>PS: An electronic version of <em>Astronomy for Entertainment</em> updated with all the recent discoveries in astronomy is in the pipeline, hopefully we should see its release in next couple of months. Also, Irodov&#39;s <em>Fundamental Laws of Mechanics</em>and <em>Basic Laws of Electromagnetism</em> are about ready (figures remain to be redrawn).</p><p>**********************************************************</p><p>Translated from the Russian by <em>Damitr Mazanav </em>from Seventh Revised edition published in 1950.</p><p>This English edition first Published online in May 2024 by <em>The Mir Titles Project.</em></p><p>Source files available <a href="https://gitlab.com/mirtitles/perelman-geometry/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/></p><p>**********************************************************</p><p>Editor’s Preface xv</p><h2>I.
