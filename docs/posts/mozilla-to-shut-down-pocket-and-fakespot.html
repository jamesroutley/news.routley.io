<p>We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Pocket on July 8, 2025. Thank you for being part of our journey over the years—we&#39;re proud of the impact Pocket has had for our users and communities.  
</p><p>This article explains everything you need to know, including how to save your content, get a refund (if you&#39;re a Premium user), and what to expect next.
</p>


<p>Pocket will no longer be available after July 8, 2025.
</p><p>You can continue using the app and browser extensions until this date. After July 8, Pocket will move into export-only mode. Users can export saves anytime until October 8, 2025, after which user data will be permanently deleted.
</p>

<p>Pocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading. But the way people use the web has evolved, so we’re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs. 
</p><p>Read more about the decision <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/building-whats-next/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>What began as a read-it-later app evolved into something much bigger. After <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/mozilla-acquires-pocket/">Mozilla acquired Pocket in 2017</a>, we invested in building our content curation and recommendation capabilities so people everywhere can discover and access high quality web content. While Pocket is shutting down, we will continue to invest in this promise—through the New Tab experience, our email newsletter, and more.
</p><p>Over the past eight years, we’ve:
</p>
<ul><li>Expanded high-quality content recommendations to more than a dozen countries and five languages.
</li><li>Connected tens of millions of people across the world with stories worth their time and attention.
</li><li>Earned recognition including a Webby Award for “Best of Pocket: 2020” and an Anthem Award in 2023 for supporting local journalism.
</li><li>Published hundreds of curated collections on topics from fighting algorithmic bias to rethinking happiness.
</li></ul>
<p>While this chapter is ending, we&#39;re deeply proud of Pocket’s impact and grateful to every reader, saver, and explorer who made it special.
</p>

<h2 id="w_how-to-export-your-saved-articles">How to export your saved articles</h2>
<p>You will be able to export your saved articles, including items in your list, archive, favorites, notes, and highlights, until October 8, 2025. After this date, all user accounts and data will be permanently deleted.
</p><p>You can learn more about exporting your saved content <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/exporting-your-pocket-list">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="w_do-i-need-to-delete-my-account-to-protect-my-data-what-happens-if-i-dont-delete-it">Do I need to delete my account to protect my data? What happens if I don’t delete it?</h2>
<p>You don’t need to delete your account. All Pocket user data will automatically be deleted on October 8, 2025. You can export your saves anytime before then from the Pocket export page.  
</p>

<h2 id="w_how-will-refunds-to-premium-annual-subscribers-be-calculated">How will refunds to Premium annual subscribers be calculated?</h2>
<p>Pocket Premium refunds will be made on a prorated basis. This means the refund will be based on how much time was left in a subscription after July 8, 2025. We’ve arranged refunds to your original payment method based on your subscription type:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Monthly subscribers</strong>
<ul><li> We will begin disabling automatic renewal of monthly subscriptions immediately.
</li><li> You can continue to enjoy the benefits of Pocket Premium until the end of the monthly subscription period.
</li><li> You will not be charged again, so no refund will be necessary.
</li><li> No action is required from you.
</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Annual subscribers</strong>
<ul><li> On July 8, 2025, Annual subscriptions will be cancelled and Annual users will receive a prorated refund automatically to the original payment method.
</li><li> No action is needed from you.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<h2 id="w_what-will-happen-to-the-pocket-browser-extensions">What will happen to the Pocket browser extensions?</h2>
<p>The Pocket web extensions will no longer be available to install from May 22, 2025. Anyone attempting to use the Pocket extensions from this date will be taken to the Pocket export page. 
</p><p>Pocket browser add ons will remain on users&#39; browsers after Pocket shuts down on July 8, 2025. Users have to manually remove the Pocket add on from their browsers. 
</p><p>For more information on how to remove an add on from their browser, users should visit their browser’s support pages. 
</p><p>More information for Firefox users on how to remove the Pocket add on is available <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/et/kb/disable-or-re-enable-pocket-for-firefox">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="w_when-will-the-app-no-longer-be-available-on-app-stores">When will the app no longer be available on app stores?</h2>
<ul><li>Users who have never installed the Pocket app will not be able to install it after May 22, 2025. 
</li><li>Users who already have the app installed will be able to re-install it up to October 8, 2025. 
</li><li>Users who still have the app installed on their device will need to manually delete it. 
</li></ul>

<h2 id="w_how-are-api-users-going-to-be-impacted">How are API users going to be impacted?</h2>
<p>Any product that leverages Pocket’s API will no longer be able to load users’ lists, or save, tag, or delete articles. 
</p>
<h2 id="w_will-api-users-be-able-to-continue-using-pocket-after-it-shuts-down">Will API users be able to continue using Pocket after it shuts down?</h2>
<p>API users will no longer be able to transact data (read or write) over Pocket’s API from October 8, 2025 and will need to export their data before this date.
</p>

<h2 id="w_whats-happening-to-pocket-hits">What’s happening to Pocket Hits?</h2>
<p>Our email newsletter, currently known as Pocket Hits, will soon be renamed “Ten Tabs”. While the name is changing, the heart of the newsletter remains the same—expertly curated, trustworthy content delivered by the same editorial team you know and enjoy, now powered by Firefox.
</p><p>All readers will be notified about the update through the newsletter itself, and no action is needed to continue receiving it.
</p><p>Once the transition is complete, Ten Tabs will be sent Monday through Friday. The weekend editions will be discontinued, and the once-a-week delivery option will no longer be offered. Readers on the weekly schedule will only be moved to daily (weekday) delivery if they opt in. As always, you can unsubscribe anytime using the link at the bottom of each email.
</p>

<p>Thank you for your support, feedback, and enthusiasm over the years. We’re grateful to have been part of your reading and discovery experience online.
