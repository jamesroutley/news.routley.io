    <h1>Auto Xylophone with Homemade Solenoids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The main idea of the electric part is the solenoids, buying 24 Solenoids is quite expensive so I
                        decided to make my own also its more fun and will help me better understand electromagnets. The
                        math behind Electromagnet is quit tricky so I used the trial and error approach until I
                        arrived to a result that Im satisfied with. </p>
            </div><div>
                <p>Afer trying many desings and nail sizes, I was satisfied with sounds made by a
                        2 ohm solenoid
                        28mm length , 26 AWG.</p>
