    <h1>The RCE that AMD won&#39;t fix</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
<p>After being interrupted multiple times by an annoying console window that would pop up periodically on my new gaming PC, I managed to track the offending executable down to AMD’s AutoUpdate software.</p>
<p>In my anger, I decided to punish this software by decompiling it to figure out how it worked, and accidentally discovered a trivial Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the process.</p>
<p>The first thing I found, is that they store their update URL in the program’s <code>app.config</code>, although its a little odd that they use their “Develpment” URL in production, it uses HTTPS so its perfectly safe.</p>

<p>The real problem starts when you open up this URL in your web browser, and realise that all of the executable download URL’s are using HTTP.</p>

<p>This means that a malicious attacker on your network, or a nation state that has access to your ISP can easily perform a MITM attack and replace the network response with any malicious executable of their choosing.</p>
<p>I was hoping that AMD perhaps had some form of certificate validation to ensure that it could not download &amp; run any unsigned executables, however a quick look into the decompiled code revealed that the AutoUpdate software does no such validation and immediately executes the downloaded file.</p>

<p>After finding this issue, I thought it was worth reporting to AMD since it seemed to be a pretty severe issue.</p>

<p>However it turned out to be considered “out of scope”, resulting in AMD not considering this to be a vulnerability.</p>
