Its workforce consists of over 10,000 employees, both civil servants and contractors. </p><p>The centre is responsible for the oversight and execution of a $4bn portfolio, Nasa pointed out. The centre is also home to the US’s largest concentration of scientists, engineers and technologists dedicated to Earth and space science.</p><p>“Makenzie is a natural leader, bringing to Goddard a scientist’s drive for discovery along with a wealth of industry experience and knowledge,” said the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://indy-web-prod.brightsites.co.uk/topic/space-agency">space agency</a>’s administrator <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://indy-web-prod.brightsites.co.uk/topic/bill-nelson">Bill Nelson</a>.</p><figure><amp-img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/11/12/lystrup_headshot.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/11/12/lystrup_headshot.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/11/12/lystrup_headshot.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" alt="&lt;p&gt;Dr Makenzie Lystrup poses for a photo following her swearing-in ceremony on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;" height="6060" width="4848" layout="responsive" on="tap:inline-image-gallery,inline-image-carousel.goToSlide(index=1)" tabindex="0" role="button" data-gallery-length="2" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer slot="i-amphtml-svc"></i-amphtml-sizer></amp-img><figcaption><p>Dr Makenzie Lystrup poses for a photo following her swearing-in ceremony on Thursday</p><p> (Nasa/Keegan Barber)</p></figcaption></figure><p>“As centre director, she will lead a world-renowned team of scientists, engineers, and technologists focused on Earth and space science,” he said.</p><p>“Under her leadership, the Goddard workforce will continue to inspire, innovate, and explore the unknown for the benefit of all.”</p><p>Before joining Nasa, Dr Lystrup was vice president and general manager of civil space at Ball Aerospace, where she led contributions to several missions such as Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope, Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), Landsat 9 and the Roman Space Telescope. </p></div></div>
