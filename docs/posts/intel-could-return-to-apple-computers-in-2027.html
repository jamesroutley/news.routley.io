That’s what supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted on X Friday. Citing his latest industry surveys, Kuo says that Intel’s chances of becoming Apple’s latest “advanced-node supplier… has improved significantly” in recent weeks.</p><div><p>Any deal with Intel would be significant considering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4337954/intel-could-have-been-inside-the-original-iphone-says-outgoing-ceo">the chipmaker famously missed out on supplying its own processors for the original iPhone</a>. Apple now has a deal with Taiwan-based TSMC to supply silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products.</p></div><p>Kuo says that Apple has a non-disclosure agreement with Intel to acquire <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-roadmap-update-new-18a-pt-variant-that-enables-3d-die-stacking-14a-process-node-enablement">the company’s 18AP PDK 0.9.1GA chips</a>. At this point, the company is waiting on Intel to deliver the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit, which is supposed to arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If everything stays on track, Intel could start shipping Apple’s lowest-end M-series processor, built on the 18AP advanced node, sometime in the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo says. But that timing still depends on how smoothly things go once Apple actually gets the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit.</p><p>Kuo theorizes that a deal with Intel could help Apple demonstrate to the Trump administration that its committed to “buying American” by rerouting its supply chain to include more US-based companies. For Intel, a deal could signal that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713388/intel-q2-2025-leave-germany-poland-costa-rica">the company’s worst days are passed</a>. “Looking ahead, the 14A node and beyond could capture more orders from Apple and other tier-one customers, turning Intel’s long-term outlook more positive,” Kuo writes.</p><p>Could Apple strike a deal with Intel? And what would happen if it decided to use the chipmaker’s 18AP processors for its entry-level M-series?</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew J.
