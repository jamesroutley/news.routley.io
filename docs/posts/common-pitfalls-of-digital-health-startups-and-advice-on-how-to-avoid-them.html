  <section><p>2023’s stacking up to be a bloodbath for early-stage digital health startups… and it’s only January. Digital health has always been challenging to build in — with lengthier sales cycles, higher implementation costs, and regulatory red tape all over. Tack on the pressure of rising interest rates making capital costly and startup valuations tank, investors are skittish. Funding into digital health startups in 2022 was <a href="https://rockhealth.com/insights/2022-year-end-digital-health-funding-lessons-at-the-end-of-a-funding-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only half</a> of 2021’s.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s a great time to build a digital health startup. Funding in 2022 marked the second highest year ever. Experienced investors are sticking around because the long-term opportunity is clear. And on top of that, the digital health gold rush over the past ten years has produced builders with earned industry knowledge. This resetting moment leaves us with more disciplined, profit-driven founders.</p>
<p>I’ve met with 100+ of these early-stage founders over the past year building both healthcare SaaS and tech-enabled care delivery services, to understand the challenges and opportunities across their companies. I’ve also gotten a front row seat of the successes and mistakes of my own healthcare infrastructure startup. I’m here to share with early-stage founders the common pitfalls I’ve seen <em>specific</em> to building in digital health — and advice on how to avoid them.</p>
<p>The goal is to help founders on the frontlines pushing healthcare innovations forward weather the storm over the next few years, so there are more winners that emerge and better outcomes delivered. I also hope this advice helps generalist investors better evaluate and win digital health deals, and support healthcare founders with empathy.</p>
