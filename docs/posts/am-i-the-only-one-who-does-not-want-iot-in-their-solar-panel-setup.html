    <h1>Ask HN: Am I the only one who does *NOT* want IoT in their solar panel setup?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>All solar panel systems I can find seem to require an internet connection. The (seemingly) best option I have found so far is a system with an inverter that only requires an internet connection during the initial installation, which uses a wifi dongle so I can probably unplug that afterwards. Even then, the manufacturer states that not having it connected to the internet voids their warranty, and I&#39;m afraid the software might even have some kind of countdown where the system will stop working when it hasn&#39;t been connected to the internet after a certain amount of time.</p><p>I am not interested at all in connecting something that should help me get off the grid to the internet. Combine that with security issues[0] and I&#39;m starting to think we&#39;re collectively folding our arms behind our back and intentionally falling forwards.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;m too paranoid. Thoughts?</p><p>[0]: For example: https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2022-00009/</p></div></div></div>
