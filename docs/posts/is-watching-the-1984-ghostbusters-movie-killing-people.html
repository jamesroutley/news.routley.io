I don&#39;t know how to explain this other than movie-caused mortality.

I was told by everyone that the 1984 Ghostbusters movie was safe and amusing, and never anticipated it could be so dangerous to young people!  It appears the 2021 film is MUCH safer, and strongly preferred, but this fact has been hidden by conspiracy</span></p><div id="viewer-856s0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img aria-hidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/is-watching-the-1984-ghostbusters-movie-killing-people-a-statistician-s-perspective" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_1b5f5eee72934b2489def482c87ba5be~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_800%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_1b5f5eee72934b2489def482c87ba5be~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_750,h_1125,al_c,q_20/file.jpg"/></p></div></div></div></div><div id="viewer-4rl8i"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img aria-hidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/is-watching-the-1984-ghostbusters-movie-killing-people-a-statistician-s-perspective" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_ce428499bb4249c8b2302a9421707d66~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_318%2Ch_159%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_ce428499bb4249c8b2302a9421707d66~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_318,h_159,al_c,q_20/file.jpg"/></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-1arga"><span>Digging further, I noticed the probability of seeing 1984 film is higher for those older in the spectrum, while demographic of those watching the 2021 film is much younger.    </span></p><p id="viewer-6ee2u"><span>I guess that makes sense, since for GenX&#39;ers the 1984 movie came out in their childhood and teen years, while the 2021 movie just came out for the post-millennial subset of the 10-59yr age group to see.</span></p><div id="viewer-cgqe1"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img aria-hidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/is-watching-the-1984-ghostbusters-movie-killing-people-a-statistician-s-perspective" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_069b56ff51074c148a65c012f0a32fad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf58cd_069b56ff51074c148a65c012f0a32fad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"/></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-38ujq"><span>Digging some more, I found UK data showing age-specific mortality rates from 2019, shown in the black numbers above the bar plot.

 Thus, the older part of the 10-59yr age group has death rate &gt;50x more than the younger part.

This got me thinking, &#34;I wonder if the different age distributions have something to do with this.&#34;  </span></p><p id="viewer-9l5t4"><span>So I computed the expected mortality rate for the cohorts watching the 1984 and 2021 movies based on a weighted average using their age distribution.

Thus, maybe the 2x higher rate of death among 1984 Ghostbuster movie watchers has another explanation other than movie-caused mortality.  </span></p><p id="viewer-dki91"><span>Maybe it is the dramatic difference in age distribution in watchers of a GenX film vs. a Post-Millenial film that explains the death disparity we are seeing.
