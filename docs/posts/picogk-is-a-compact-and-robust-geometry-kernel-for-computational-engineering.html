<p dir="auto">PicoGK (&#34;peacock&#34;) is a compact, robust, and fast geometry kernel for Computational Engineering.</p>
<p dir="auto">PicoGK was developed by <a href="https://github.com/LinKayser">Lin Kayser</a>, and is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/www.leap71.com">LEAP 71</a>. PicoGK is open-sourced under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" rel="nofollow">Apache License 2.0</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, please visit <a href="https://PicoGK.org" rel="nofollow">https://PicoGK.org</a></p>
<p dir="auto">We believe that <a href="https://leap71.com/computationalengineering/" rel="nofollow">Computational Engineering</a> will profoundly change the way we design physical objects in the years to come. But it needs a neutral, transparent and free and open-source platform in order to be adopted widely.</p>
<p dir="auto">By developing and maintaining PicoGK, we hope to make a contribution to accelerate the progress of invention.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>To get started with PicoGK, please jump over to the <a href="https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/Documentation/README.md">documentation</a></strong> and <a href="https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/releases">install the latest PicoGK release</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To understand what can be done with PicoGK, what other modules we have, we recommend checking out the <a href="https://github.com/leap71">LEAP 71 Github Overview Page</a> â€” this page also has pointers to articles about the fundamentals of Computational Engineering.</p>

<p dir="auto">We are indebted to other Open-Source projects, without which writing PicoGK would have been an impossible task. Most notably we use the Academy Software Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://www.openvdb.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenVDB library</a>, which provides the majority of the functionality neccessary to build a robust geometry kernel. In many ways, PicoGK is a thin-yet-powerful layer of functionality on top of OpenVDB.</p>
<p dir="auto">The PicoGK viewer relies on the <a href="https://www.glfw.org/" rel="nofollow">GLFW library</a>, for simple cross-platform OpenGL user interface functionality.</p>

<p dir="auto">PicoGK consists of two modules.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PicoGK</strong>, which is the C#-based project that you have currently open, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PicoGKRuntime</strong>, a C++-based runtime library, which is in a <a href="https://github.com/leap71/PicoGKRuntime">separate GitHub project</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PicoGK</strong> provides an framework based on <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp" rel="nofollow">Microsoft&#39;s open-source C# language</a>. It depends on PicoGKRuntime for the heavy lifting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PicoGKRuntime</strong> exposes a minimal &#34;extern C&#34; interface, which can be implemented by other geometry kernels, including commercial ones.</p>
<p dir="auto">We encourage other software vendors to support the PicoGKRuntime API and release commercial alternatives to our open-source project. PicoGK was developed as a reliable common interface that you, the engineer, can always rely on as a free and universally available platform to fall back on when creating your own intellectual property.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PicoGK</strong>, the C# code, which you have open right now, provides rich functionality based on the PicoGKRuntime interface. It makes it as simple as possible to build computational geometry.</p>
<p dir="auto">You will, however, ususally not use PicoGK directly to build Computational Engineering Models. We encourage you to look at our other open-source project, the <a href="https://github.com/leap71/LEAP71_ShapeKernel">LEAP 71 ShapeKernel</a>, which was written by Josefine Lissner, and forms the basis of all objects we create at LEAP 71 and uses PicoGK as the foundation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/Documentation/README.md">Please head over to our documentation, for how to get started with PicoGK.</a></p>
