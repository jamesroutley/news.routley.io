    <h1>Ask HN: How to Resurrect a Site from Archive.org?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I recently bought the expired domain of a niche interest site because the previous owner was determined to let it die and did not want to put any effort in it anymore.</p><p>Is there a way I can &#34;revive&#34; it from archive.org in a more or less automated fashion? Have you ever encountered anything like it? I am familiar with web scraping, but archive.org has its peculiarities.</p><p>I really, really love the content on it.</p><p>It&#39;s a very niche site, but I would love for it to live on.</p></div></div></div>
