Suppose one minute were spent recounting the events of the past year.  What would you
include in a one minute summary of 1995?  1945?  1865?  A lot can be told in a minute.
If we were to allow one minute for each year, all of recorded history could be recounted in
a mere three days (of continuous talking)!  Here, then, are the Cliff Notes for human civilization:
one year = 1 minute.  The present moment is 11:59:59 PM of December 31.  January began
525600 years ago...

<a href="https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/topten.html">Chemistry 104</a>, &#34;From Caveman to Chemist&#34; is a course exploring landmark
technologies on the road to modern industrial civilization.  We will begin by
learning to make fire and stone tools and progress up through plastics and
semiconductors.  Your grade in the course will be determined by the <em>number</em>
of technologies which you master. Although this is not a lab course, it is very
much a course about <em>doing</em> things. You will not only read about
these landmark technologies, you will be expected to make things like paper
and metals and batteries from scratch. By the time you have completed the course,
you will have an intimate knowledge of most of the <a href="https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/industry/index.html">top 25 chemicals</a> used in
modern industry.

</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/calendar.html">2000 Lecture Schedule</a>
</li></ul>



<p>
The unit of work for this course is the <em>project</em>. Most projects consist
of a written quiz and a product. To get credit for a project you must
have a perfect quiz <em>and</em> your product must meet the specifications outlined in
each project description. No credit is given for a quiz without its associated
product or for a product without its associated quiz except as described below.
Your projects will be documented in your <a href="https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/notebook/">notebook</a>.

</p><p>
Some of the projects (those marked with a Q) are passed by <strong>Q</strong>uiz alone. These
projects deal with brain tools rather than physical products.


</p><p>
Other projects (those marked with a P) require you to read the designated book
 and write a 4-6 page <strong>P</strong>aper on what you have read.

</p><p>

Still other projects (those marked with a T) may be done
as a <a href="https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/tribes.html"><strong>T</strong>ribal</a> effort.  That is, a group of you will band together and work on the
project as a group. Each of you must pass the quiz individually, but the product
will be produced by the group.

</p><p>
Finally, two projects (marked with a B) are passed by exhibiting certain admirable
<strong>B</strong>ehaviors as described below.

</p><p>
Many of these projects can be completed in your own time and in a place of your choosing.
Others, however, are most easily accomplished using tools such as beakers and
hotplates which are available to you in the chemistry department <em>only</em>
during V period (2:30-4:00, Mondays). <strong>You are not allowed in the
labs at any other time, so don&#39;t ask.</strong>

</p><p>
The best time to take quizzes and turn in projects is during the last half hour
G period. The second best time is during V period. Otherwise, you can take
quizzes and turn in projects 8:30-5:00 M-F as long as it is convenient for <em>me.</em>
While all of these projects are pass/fail, you may attempt any of them as many
times as you wish until you pass the project.


</p><p>
There is one final consideration in passing projects which will help to preserve
my sanity toward the end of the semester. <strong>You may only attempt to
pass one project per day (8:30-5:00 M-F).</strong>
If you attempt to pass a project and fail it, you are finished for the day.
If you pass a project, you are finished for the day. In either case, you cannot
attempt to pass another project that same day. This rewards people who start passing projects
early in the semester and prevents my being indundated with hundreds of projects
:on the last day of class.

The following projects may be completed for credit this semester:

<p>
Your grade for this course will be determined entirely by the number of projects
completed according to the following table:
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Requirements
</th></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>6 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td>7 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td><td>8 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>9 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>10 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>11 Projects

</td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td>13 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td><td>14 Projects
</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>15 Projects
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<li>Perfect attendance counts as one extra project.
</li><li>Completion of 7 projects by Halloween counts as one extra project.

This site was awarded The Alchemist&#39;s WebPick on 21 August
1998 as an outstanding Chemistry/Science or humorous place to visit.
Here&#39;s what they said:

</p><p>

From Caveman to Chemist - not much evidence of
evolution here you might think! But this website is a
course in exploring landmark technologies on the road
to a modern industrial civilisation. It begins with the
concepts of making fire and stone tools and progresses
up through plastics and semiconductors. While this is a
&#39;physical&#39; course requiring attendance at lectures, the
online notes, questions and answers, and experimental
details can easily be used elsewhere. Almost thirty
projects ranging from metathesis to stoichiometry, from
potash to electromagnetism. Each section is complete
with introduction, information and questions. This
would prove to be a superb learning resource for any
chemistry class.
