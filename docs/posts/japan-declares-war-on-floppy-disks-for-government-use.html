<p>Japan&#39;s <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/12/national/taro-kono-digital-minister/">newly appointed</a> Minister of Digital Affairs, Taro Kono, has <a href="https://twitter.com/konotaromp/status/1564767072554745856?s=20&amp;t=RX6_pwbllpBPMwAFBDCinQ">declared war</a> on the floppy disk and other forms of obsolete media, which the government still requires as a submission medium for <a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/councils/f0c4ebf4-bd96-49f3-bd84-cb0653629b25/">around 1,900</a> types of business applications and other forms. The goal is to modernize the procedures by moving the information submission process online.</p>
<p>Kono announced the initiative during a press conference in Japan on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-31/japan-s-digital-chief-vows-to-purge-floppy-disks-from-government?srnd=technology-vp">according to Bloomberg</a>. Legal issues have prevented the modernization to cloud data storage in the past, and Japanese government offices often use CDs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc">MiniDiscs</a>, or floppy disks to accept submissions from the public and businesses. For example, Japan&#39;s Mainichi newspaper <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20211227/p2a/00m/0na/072000c">reported</a> in December 2021 that Tokyo police lost two floppy disks containing information on 38 public housing applicants. A digital task force group led by Kono will announce how to fix those issues by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Shortly after taking office earlier this month, Kono announced his desire to modernize technology in the Japanese government, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/12/national/taro-kono-digital-minister/">speaking out</a> about Japan&#39;s reliance on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(East_Asia)">hanko</a> hand stamps during the COVID-19 pandemic and fax machines instead of email. He&#39;s also been outspoken about the subject <a href="https://twitter.com/konotaromp/status/1557554908575870977?s=20&amp;t=Oduv65YS81tnlcHuarZD9g">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>As a storage medium, floppy disk technology <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/740436/from-idea-to-icon-50-years-of-the-floppy-disk/">dates back</a> over 50 years. Sony introduced 3.5-inch floppy disks in 1983, and they typically store a mere 1.44 megabytes of data in their most popular variation. Sony stopped manufacturing them in 2011, prompting Taro to quip during his press conference, &#34;Where does one even buy a floppy disk these days?&#34;</p>
