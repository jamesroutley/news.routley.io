  Blinkenlights is a command line debugger that focuses on visualizing
  how software changes memory. It&#39;s able to emulate statically linked
  i8086 and x86_64-pc-linux-gnu programs on the Linux, Mac, Windows,
  FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD platforms.

  Computers once had operator panels that provided an intimate overview
  of the machine&#39;s internal state at any given moment. The blinking
  lights would communicate the personality of each piece of software.
  Since our minds are great at spotting patterns, developers would
  intuitively understand based on which way the LEDs were flashing, if
  a program was sorting data, collating, caught in an infinite loop,
  etc. This is an aspect of the computing experience that modern
  machines haven&#39;t done a good job at recreating, until now.

  What makes Blinkenlights unique is that its interface is designed
  under the assumption that terminal displays have grown larger than 80
  columns. Therefore we can display many more panels of useful info than
  alternatives such as GDB. The most important panels are the ones that
  hexdump memory
  using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code Page
  437</a>. It&#39;s also able to automatically infer the type signatures of
  SSE registers based on the instructions. For example, here&#39;s an
  operating session screencast for a program that just
  <a href="https://justine.lol/printimage.html">prints images in the terminal</a>.

<p>
  Watching this program execute (c / ctrl-c) at adjustable speed (ctrl-t
  / alt-t) it becomes clearer that the process of printing an image is
  basically a pipeline that goes: IDCT → Y′CbCr to RGB → decimate →
  sharpen → block render. Thanks to Blinkenlights we can also see that
  the RGB conversion is going slower than it should, because code isn&#39;t
  benefiting from SSE register vectorization. Many other common issues
  concerning micro-optimization, such as register spillage, become super
  apparent as well.

  Software is conventionally written with an abstract theory of mind
  that&#39;s rooted in computer science concepts such as time complexity.
  However sometimes we get lazy at inappropriate moments and make our
  code <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally
  quadratic</a>. Modern CPUs have a feature called spectre that makes
  slow algorithms go as fast as good ones for small datasets, which
  unfortunately makes these issues difficult to spot. On the other hand,
  Blinkenlights behaves more like a conventional CPU so you concretely
  see the true impact of algorithms that are sloppy from a theoretical
  standpoint, thus saving you from the potential mistake of pushing that
  code into production to crunch data at scale.

</p><p>
  Here are some of the features that are supported:

  Blinkenlights is also a proper emulator in the sense that it can
  emulate itself. This can be accomplished by simply passing the
  blinkenlights.com binary as an argument to itself. Blinkenlights
  doesn&#39;t need any system commands to be installed beforehand (e.g. gdb
  backend) so this does in fact emulate the entire emulation process.

</p><p>
  What are the tradeoffs? Blinkenlights is really good at creating a
  deterministic environment for program execution that can reproduce
  program state down to the finest detail across operating systems. It
  also runs as a first-class native binary on each system. But since
  it&#39;s an <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">Actually Portable Executable</a> it
  might not be able to perfectly conform to the conventions of your
  local operating system.

</p><p>
  For example, you can use Blinkenlights on Windows, but you can&#39;t use
  it to emulate a PE WIN32 executable, since Blinkenlights doesn&#39;t
  implement Microsoft&#39;s APIs. You can however use it to run a Linux
  executable inside your Command Prompt or Powershell, as Blinkenlights
  takes care of the chore of translating Linux ABI to WIN32.

</p><p>
  The Blinkenlights binary releases also work great on Linux, Mac, and
  BSD. On Linux specifically, they&#39;ll work on any distro since RHEL5
  including Musl-based ones like Alpine. Some users might find it
  surprising that this portability comes at the cost of having no
  awareness of distro-specific conventions, like shared object search
  directories. You can fix that by passing <code>-static</code>
  and <code>-no-pie</code> to ld or gcc when linking programs you intend
  to emulate.

</p><p>
  How you build your binaries also impacts how informative
  visualizations will be. The most important flag to pass
  is <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code> so that backtraces will work.
  C++ name demangling works too if <code>c++filt</code> is on the path.
</p><p>
  Lastly note that Blinkenlights is only a few months old, and as such,
  is still working hard to implement some intended ABIs. For example,
  clone() currently returns ENOSYS and the BIOS ABI surface area is
  currently limited to what&#39;s needed to bootload a program into long
  mode. Progress updates will be posted to the mailing list.
