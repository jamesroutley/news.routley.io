<h3>
Breaking Story: Facebook Building Subsea Cable That Will Encompass The World
</h3>


<div id="post-body-4952847995282059562">
<p>Several sources have whispered in my ear that META is planning a new 16 fibre pair cable that will encompass the world going from the US East Coast to the US West Coast via the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and the Pacific. The most ambitious subsea project ever undertaken. I do not know the exact routing. I know that the cable will launch from the American East Coast and will go down the West African Coast to South Africa and then head straight to Mumbai. It is not clear if Europe will be online or not. From Mumbai it will head straight to Australia and then up to the US West Coast. I speculate that there may be branching units to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. </p><p>This semi-secret cable reflects META&#39;s desire for network resiliency given the four month Red Sea down time that AAE-1 and other subsea cables suffered during the first half of 2024. It appears willing to suffer a latency penalty to avoid the Red Sea as well as Egypt&#39;s expensive digital toll roads. While Egypt&#39;s terrestrial routes for submarine cables are good, they are overpriced and elevate market wavelength pricing. The design also demonstrates India&#39;s growing importance. China is off limits to Google, Facebook, and the other American Digital Titans. This makes India and Africa the two key high growth markets for the content providers. I suspect META will use the ride down the West African Coast to fill in digital coverage gaps or deploy branching units like Google&#39;s Equiano in case these smaller African states decide to join these subsea fibre optic highways. </p><p>I speculate that the cable goes from Myrtle Beach to Lisbon and then back out to sea to West Arica&#39;s coast. It may land in many of the same countries as 2Africa, but will undoubtedly be diverse to the existing terrestrial back haul including new cable landing stations. A good guess is 320 Tbps design throughput. </p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8lgjVA9VfOQRcWcLIs1cPbI1DAqtBljhCoRXp5z8ba7Pn6SnKQXtFhjmuBeTCt2wxECl_8OnjT9wt5dc3X47E-KwD_EcWn4u0p3Vd2S_TXGLLw3qrWueaedO2_Xw8Os4fEUpA2fmDaL0fih2jXwtCQP4ZUZYGA_AiZghSHyJB2R4ktQEcIrnY5LhFTM/s1200/Submarine-Cable-Map.jpg"><img alt="Map of the World&#39;s Fibre Optic Subsea Cables" data-original-height="675" data-original-width="1200" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8lgjVA9VfOQRcWcLIs1cPbI1DAqtBljhCoRXp5z8ba7Pn6SnKQXtFhjmuBeTCt2wxECl_8OnjT9wt5dc3X47E-KwD_EcWn4u0p3Vd2S_TXGLLw3qrWueaedO2_Xw8Os4fEUpA2fmDaL0fih2jXwtCQP4ZUZYGA_AiZghSHyJB2R4ktQEcIrnY5LhFTM/w640-h360/Submarine-Cable-Map.jpg" width="640"/></a></p></div>

 A few days I wrote that  Facebook was planning a new subsea cable directly linking the US East  Coast to South Africa, then up to India, and then to Australia, and  finally to the US West Coast. Clearly resiliency is a big theme. It  avoids Lisbon, Egypt, the Red Sea, and Singapore. All choke points due  to their telecom hub status. Note that the map below shows lots of  branching units, but I don&#39;t have insider confirmation although they  make perfect sense. The cable is 16 fibre pairs.  This  cable may be heavily influenced by AI considerations. AI data centres  require lots of space and power. The US, South Africa, India, and  Australia are good candidates for AI data centres in terms of space. All  of them except for South Africa have modern power grids. But South  Africa is still the best place on the continent for large scale AI  facilities.  An  AI theme makes particular sense given the cable&#39;s high latency. An AI  data centre does not directly serve customers. It is a

<div>

<p>
The IRU price should reflect your forecast of future lease revenes. If the current MRC is high and prices have been stable and are expected to remain so, then the opportunity cost of selling an IRU is high.  You are sacrificing a lot of lease revenue if you sell that capacity. In this case the upfront IRU price should equal the three year MRC multipled by 4 to 6 years. So if the three year Faster cable MRC is $17K, then 48x to 72x times that number is fair value. So 48*$17K=$816K. Plus a standard 4% annual fee to cover the wavelength&#39;s share of maintenance and operations.. So strong markets and tight capacity mean that leasing is more attractive than IRUs to the supplier. Vice versa, the buyers will be desperate to lower their long term costs via an IRU. In my example, $816K divided by 15 years equates to $4500 per month excluding O&amp;M. Bad for the seller. Good for the buyer. That&#39;s why so many of you are looking for IRU capacity to resell to your clients, but finding few se
