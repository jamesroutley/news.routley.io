<h3>
Breaking Story: Facebook Building Subsea Cable That Will Encompass The World
</h3>


<div id="post-body-4952847995282059562">
<p>Several sources have whispered in my ear that META is planning a new 16 fibre pair cable that will encompass the world going from the US East Coast to the US West Coast via the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and the Pacific. The most ambitious subsea project ever undertaken. I do not know the exact routing. I know that the cable will launch from the American East Coast and will go down the West African Coast to South Africa and then head straight to Mumbai. It is not clear if Europe will be online or not. From Mumbai it will indubitably go to Singapore with possible branches to Australia and Japan. Clearly one branch will make a direct line to the Californian coast. </p><p>This semi-secret cable reflects META&#39;s desire for network resiliency given the four month Red Sea down time that AAE-1 and other subsea work horses suffered during the first half of 2024. It appears willing to suffer a latency penalty to avoid the Red Sea as well as Egypt&#39;s expensive digital toll roads. While Egypt&#39;s terrestrial routes for submarine cables are good, they are overpriced and elevate market wavelength pricing. The design also demonstrates India&#39;s growing importance. China is off limits to Google, Facebook, and the other American Digital Titans. This makes India and Africa the two key high growth markets for the content providers. I suspect META will use the ride down the West African Coast to fill in digital coverage gaps or deploy branching units like Google&#39;s Equiano in case these smaller African states decide to join these broadband highways. </p><p>I speculate that the cable goes from Myrtle Beach to Lisbon and then back out to sea to West Arica&#39;s coast. It may land in many of the same countries as 2Africa, but will undoubtedly be diverse to the existing terrestial back haul including new cable landing stations. A good guess is 320 Tbps design throughput. </p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8lgjVA9VfOQRcWcLIs1cPbI1DAqtBljhCoRXp5z8ba7Pn6SnKQXtFhjmuBeTCt2wxECl_8OnjT9wt5dc3X47E-KwD_EcWn4u0p3Vd2S_TXGLLw3qrWueaedO2_Xw8Os4fEUpA2fmDaL0fih2jXwtCQP4ZUZYGA_AiZghSHyJB2R4ktQEcIrnY5LhFTM/s1200/Submarine-Cable-Map.jpg"><img alt="Map of the World&#39;s Fibre Optic Subsea Cables" data-original-height="675" data-original-width="1200" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8lgjVA9VfOQRcWcLIs1cPbI1DAqtBljhCoRXp5z8ba7Pn6SnKQXtFhjmuBeTCt2wxECl_8OnjT9wt5dc3X47E-KwD_EcWn4u0p3Vd2S_TXGLLw3qrWueaedO2_Xw8Os4fEUpA2fmDaL0fih2jXwtCQP4ZUZYGA_AiZghSHyJB2R4ktQEcIrnY5LhFTM/w640-h360/Submarine-Cable-Map.jpg" width="640"/></a></p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p>
The IRU price should reflect your forecast of future lease revenes. If the current MRC is high and prices have been stable and are expected to remain so, then the opportunity cost of selling an IRU is high.  You are sacrificing a lot of lease revenue if you sell that capacity. In this case the upfront IRU price should equal the three year MRC multipled by 4 to 6 years. So if the three year Faster cable MRC is $17K, then 48x to 72x times that number is fair value. So 48*$17K=$816K. Plus a standard 4% annual fee to cover the wavelength&#39;s share of maintenance and operations.. So strong markets and tight capacity mean that leasing is more attractive than IRUs to the supplier. Vice versa, the buyers will be desperate to lower their long term costs via an IRU. In my example, $816K divided by 15 years equates to $4500 per month excluding O&amp;M. Bad for the seller. Good for the buyer. That&#39;s why so many of you are looking for IRU capacity to resell to your clients, but finding few se

It is standard practice to bury subsea cables in shallow waters. This generally means the ocean or sea lying above the continental shelf.  The shelf is really just that part of the continent that is submerged under water during the warm periods between the earth&#39;s recurring ice ages. During interglacial periods like now the shelves remain submerged and during each ice age the shelves become dry land as the sea levels fall due to less precipitation. Precipitation declines as the earth becomes colder and water is locked up in snow, ice, and glaciers on dry land. Indeed, during the last ice age the oceans were about 130 meters lower than today&#39;s levels and the continental shelves were dry land. In general, the continental shelves range from 100 to 200 meters below the water surface. At the continental shelf&#39;s edge the depths plunge down a steep slope to the bottom of the ocean. The purpose of burying is to protect a fibre optic cable from its most ferocious predators and enemi
