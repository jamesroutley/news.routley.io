    <h1>Reader feedback: &#34;bad&#34; names, !main(), and Mastodon</h1>
    
    
<p>
Questions, questions, questions.  Sometimes I have answers.  Here we go 
with more reader feedback.
</p><p>
...
</p><p>
M.D. asks if I could share a story about when a company "did something 
really wrong". 
</p><p>
OK, how about yet another case of "real names" gone wrong?  I'm talking 
about the thing where some derpy programmer writes a filter to "exclude 
naughty words" and ends up rejecting people with names that HAPPEN to 
match a four-letter English word.  My canonical example is "Nishit" 
because that's what actually happened at another job back around 2009.
</p><p>
But that's old news.  I'm talking about "yet another case".  This one is 
from right at the end of 2019.  It seems like someone decided they were 
going to "move a metric" from the support queue.  There were a TINY 
NUMBER of customers who had deliberately signed up with obviously 
offensive names.  They were being handled by reasonable bags of mostly 
water (i.e., people) who could look at it and figure out what to keep 
and what to purge.
</p><p>
Well, the derpy programmer with a goal to hit by the end of the quarter 
apparently struck again, and they wrote a thing to ban anyone who 
matched a short list.  Then they ran it, and - surprise - it banned a 
bunch of real people who weren't doing anything wrong.  Of course, 
those people have probably had many problems on other services, and now 
THIS company was the latest one to show how damn stupid and unfeeling 
it could be.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
"My last name really is 'Cocks'.  How would you like me to proceed?"

</p><p>
Unsurprisingly, this pissed off a bunch of people and generated a blip 
in the news cycle.  Internally, it was brought to the weekly review 
meeting that I was somehow still running at that point.  Someone was 
there and presented the case, and it was pretty clear they were going 
through the motions because we called them on the carpet.
</p><p>
For some really stupid reason (literally every other senior engineer and 
manager was at some offsite planning thing that morning, and *someone* 
had to run this meeting), I was the most senior person in the room, and 
so I felt I had to ask them the question as "the voice of the company" 
(whatever that even means):
</p><p>
"Can I get you to promise to never do this again?"
</p><p>
They wouldn't commit to it.  I got no reply.  They just looked at me.
Conclusion: this will definitely happen again.  Nobody gave a damn
about what happened to the customers, and how bad the whole thing 
looked.
</p><p>
Afterwards, I talked to some friends who had worked in the trenches in 
customer support.  They knew what was happening in terms of the "trouble 
reports" that would come in from people using the app.  They had a good 
feel for what was actually a problem and what was clearly 
"<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKR</a> scamming".
</p><p>
Near as we can figure, they decided to code this up because it would let 
them claim to have automated some class of tickets that were being 
filed.  It's like, sure, it would in fact remove the handful of tickets 
that get filed about this.  It would also generate a godawful amount of 
hurt (and bad PR and so on) a few hours or days later, and would have to 
be turned off.  But, the person managed to ship the feature, and so 
they can get their bonus, or promotion, or whatever.
</p><p>
Of course, karma is a bitch.  A few months later, COVID hit and the 
company started laying people off in droves.  I bet all of those people 
are gone now.  Unfortunately, this also means anyone who learned a 
lesson from this event is probably gone, too.  Hmph.
</p><p>
For anyone who's in today's "lucky 10,000" set, have some 
<a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">additional reading</a>
on this topic.

A reader responded to my 
<a href="/w/2023/01/20/mainless/">"mainless"</a>
program post and asked if you could avoid the segfault by putting 
"_exit()" into the destructor or similar.  They're totally right.  If 
you make the program bail out instead of trying to carry along into 
uncharted territory, it will in fact exit cleanly.  You already have 
unistd.h in my example, so go for it.
</p><p>

Another reader commented on the same post, asking just "The file name is 
a bit worrying. Is everything alright?".  I guess they missed the link 
to knowyourmeme.com, or are generally unfamiliar with the notion of 
"things that aren't really trolling but are sort of funny kind of".
</p><p>

Jeff asks if I'm on Mastodon.  I am not using that (or any other aspect 
of the "Fediverse").  I am also not on Twitter.  I used to have a 
"business" account out there for a while, but never really used it, and 
deleted it last year when it became apparent where Twitter was headed.  
I stand by that decision.
</p><p>
I should mention that there are some dubious parts of the whole 
Fediverse thing, as someone who runs a site that occasionally gets links 
shared around.  Posting a link to one of these things basically summons 
a <em>giant swarm of (bot) locusts</em> who all want to generate a link 
preview at the same time.  I was going to write a post about this a 
while back, but it would be short and kind of threadbare, so I'll just 
mention it here instead.
</p><p>
Now, since all of this /w/ stuff is just a bunch of flat files on disk, 
all of it gets served out of memory and it's like ho hum.  I can't 
run out of database connections or anything like that.  I'm 
basically limited by the level of bandwidth I pay for on my switch 
ports.  Eventually, they all have what they came for and it stops.  
But, for a minute or two, it can be interesting to watch.
</p><p>
There's a certain "cadence" to a web server's activity logs as seen in 
"tail -f".  When this happens, it scrolls so fast you can barely read 
it.  You definitely notice.
</p><p>
This is far from a new issue.  A report that it can collectively be used 
"as a DDOS tool" was filed back in August 2017, when it was a far 
smaller problem.
</p><p>
It should not surprise anyone who's been doing this kind of thing for a 
while that the bug report in question (which I won't link here, but 
which people will still look up and try to brigade) has been closed 
since 2018.
</p><p>
Did anyone ever see the classic Simpsons episode where someone falls 
down a well, and at the end of the episode they "solve the problem" by 
sticking a "CAUTION WELL" sign in the ground?

I can hear his voice in my head any time I see a bug like that.
