The board has many unique particularities that appealed me:</p><ul><li>it is small, very small, about 3x3cm, barely larger than the Ethernet jack, because yes, at this size, it comes with Ethernet!</li><li>it is quite cheap, roughly $10 for a complete board in small quantities<br/></li><li>it is entirely made out of discrete components that are human-friendly and it can be assembled at home!</li><li>despite its small size, it comes with a 1 GHz Cortex A7 CPU, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB SPI NOR flash, and has plenty of I/Os available.</li><li>Daniel wants it to be not only blob-free, but also supported by a mainline Linux kernel</li></ul><p>Daniel had started assembling and giving away a few of these to various testers. I could have been interested but had no immediate use case for it and didn&#39;t want to abuse. But Daniel insisted on sending me the required parts so that I could try to assemble two boards. I guess he was interested in testing how feasible it was for the board to be assembled by an amateur, and in sharing experience to improve the design. With that in mind, I finally accepted, and after a few months (due to lock down here) I received his package with all the components to make two boards plus quite some extras allowing me to fail multiple times.</p>

  </div><p>You don&#39;t want to discover the components while soldering them. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the board&#39;s schematic and its layout, to roughly understand what component does what and to locate them on the board. From memory I can say that at the middle top there&#39;s the DC-DC converter, on the right there&#39;s the NOR, below it are some decoupling capacitors and ethernet resistors, below is the crystal oscillator, middle bottom are other capacitors and the reset circuit, on the middle left, just 2 capacitors and test points, and above is the USB-serial adapter and 3 other capacitors. Simply knowing this helps locating the components you&#39;re about to place, and also helps avoid mistakes. Daniel provided a <a href="https://breadbee.github.io/breadbee/ibom.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nice dynamic imprint</a> that allows to spot components and their locations.<br/></p><p>I personally like to print the whole layout with <a href="https://github.com/breadbee/breadbee/blob/master/howtobuild/components-copper.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all components names and values</a> on a full size sheet of paper that&#39;s placed on the table under the device I&#39;m working on. And seeing the copper tracks on this layout definitely helps understand if a bridge between two solder joints is expected or not. I also like to note the various voltage measurement points, that provides a quick help during debugging.</p><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HN8xewXDo_U/X2jTrXX8Y4I/AAAAAAAABc8/idmceCy48S0MCx76nAsEbuQO7xuJ0jBgACLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/IMG_0465cs.JPG"><img data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HN8xewXDo_U/X2jTrXX8Y4I/AAAAAAAABc8/idmceCy48S0MCx76nAsEbuQO7xuJ0jBgACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_0465cs.JPG" width="320"/></a></p></div><p><h3>Prepare all the small components </h3></p><p>For most components that come in rolls, there&#39;s nothing more annoying than permanently switching tools between the tweezers needed to place the components and whatever you use to peel off the rolls and pick one component at a time. A solution to avoid this consists in checking the BOM (<i>Bill of materials</i>) first  and prepare as many of each type as needed. I like to place them on a sheet of paper  under their reference, though the risk of moving them away or mixing them is a bit high. They can also be placed in small plastic boxes or even in an ice tray. Note that values are not marked on 0402 components, so you must absolutely not mix them, or you&#39;ll need your multimeter to sort them out. You&#39;ve been warned!</p><p>Note that the official list of components is <a href="https://breadbee.github.io/breadbee/ibom.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here using a nice lookup interface</a>. I tested an <a href="https://github.com/breadbee/breadbee/issues/30#issuecomment-671731543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alternate list of resistors</a> that reduces the number of references from 11 to 7. This is only useful if you want to order a small number of component rolls, otherwise it will not bring you any benefit.<br/></p><p><h3>Prepare the solder paste</h3></p><p>Many people using solder paste for the first time believe it&#39;s a chemical that turns to tin once heated. That&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s made of microscopic tin balls glued toghether in fat liquid very similar to flux. This is visible in the following close-up of solder paste dispensed on a metal plate. The second image zooms on the first one at approx 2.5 µm per pixel:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGX-BjOZg-c/X2jWxCPsLqI/AAAAAAAABdM/tO179qOXWmY5R7tiLhuTlMADonUqFfdIwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/IMG_0467cs.JPG"><img data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGX-BjOZg-c/X2jWxCPsLqI/AAAAAAAABdM/tO179qOXWmY5R7tiLhuTlMADonUqFfdIwCLcBGAsYHQ/w200-h150/IMG_0467cs.JPG" width="200"/></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1sk922Kd_HE/X2jWw0DOSTI/AAAAAAAABdI/D2xQJMXMDLgkM01ZvxStT0mXS9BCUKOqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/IMG_0467z2.JPG"><img data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" height="150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1sk922Kd_HE/X2jWw0DOSTI/AAAAAAAABdI/D2xQJMXMDLgkM01ZvxStT0mXS9BCUKOqgCLcBGAsYHQ/w200-h150/IMG_0467z2.JPG" width="200"/></a></p></div></div>
