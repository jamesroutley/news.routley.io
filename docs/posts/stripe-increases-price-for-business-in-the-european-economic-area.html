<p>Starting 10 April 2023, fees for card processing, disputes, and USD currency payouts will be higher due to increases in network costs (in recent years, major card networks have introduced several new fees and increased existing fees), as well as increases in underlying service costs.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following details to understand how these changes may impact your business.</p>

<h2><strong>Changes for card processing</strong></h2>
<p>There will now be two different fees for cards issued within the European Economic Area (EEA). We separated these fees in order to contain fee increases just to cards where network costs have increased significantly.</p>
<div><div><table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Card fees today</strong></td>
<td><strong>Card fees starting 10 April 2023</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All EU cards: 1.4% + €0.25 per transaction</td>
<td>Standard EU cards: 1.5% + €0.25 per transaction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>International cards: 2.9% + €0.25 per transaction</td>
<td>International cards: 3.25% + €0.25 per transaction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UK cards: 2.5% + €0.25 per transaction</td>
<td>UK cards: 2.5% + €0.25 per transaction<strong> (no changes)</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div></div>
<p><em>If you have an account located in an EEA country that has not adopted the Euro, here are the fixed fees of €0.25 in local currencies: Bulgaria: ЛВ0.50; Czech Republic: 6.50Kč; Denmark: 1.80kr; Hungary: 85Ft; Liechtenstein: 0.30CHF, Poland: 1zł; Romania: 1LEU, Sweden: 1.80kr.</em></p>
<h3><strong>What are standard cards?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Consumer cards issued by Visa and Mastercard</p></li>
<li><p>All cards issued by American Express, Discover, Diners Club, Maestro, Cartes Bancaires, UnionPay</p></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What are premium cards?</strong></h3>
<ul><li><p>Commercial, corporate, or business cards issued by Visa and Mastercard</p></li></ul>
<p>You can read more on the differences between <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-s-the-difference-between-standard-and-premium-cards" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-source="question_content_link" data-analytics-action="question_content_link_click" data-analytics-guru_id="ac6c021e-1072-4cbc-89e8-971033d831ba">Standard and Premium cards here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>How does Stripe determine when a card is standard or premium?</strong></h3>
<p>We determine whether a card is standard or premium based on the information available from card networks at point of charge. The accuracy of this mapping is regularly reviewed to ensure the appropriate fee is applied to all card transactions.</p>

<h2><strong>Changes for disputes</strong></h2>
<p>Dispute fees (also known as chargebacks) will increase from €15 to €20. We’ll also no longer refund this fee if the customer’s bank resolves the dispute in your favor, due to the costs Stripe incurs for managing dispute evidence submissions (regardless of the outcome).</p>
<p><em>If you or your users have an account located in an EEA country that has not adopted the Euro, here are the fixed fees of €20 in local currencies: Bulgaria: ЛВ40; Czech Republic: 550Kč; Denmark: 200kr; Hungary: 7,000Ft; Liechtenstein: 20CHF, Poland: 90zł; Romania: 100LEU, Sweden: 200kr.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Changes for USD alternative currency payouts</strong></h2>
<p>Businesses in the EEA paying out to a bank account that accepts USD without requiring a business to be in the US (US-domiciled accounts) will now incur a 1% fee, with a minimum fee of US$2.50 per payout. This is in line with alternative currency payout fees from common providers.</p>

<h2><strong>Alternative lower cost payment methods</strong></h2>
<p>If you are using Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Checkout</u></a> or the <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Payment Element</u></a>, you can easily <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>turn on over 25 payment methods</u></a> from the Dashboard with zero additional engineering work. Stripe will automatically surface the right payment method to help you increase conversion based on where your user is located.</p>
<p>Below are a few commonly used low cost payment methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Link</strong></a>, Stripe’s one-click checkout experience, can be used to process all domestic cards for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1.2% + €0.25 per transaction</u></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/payments/europe-bank-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bank transfers</strong></a> can be used to process large, one-off transactions for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.5% per transaction, capped at €5.00</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/payments/sepa-direct-debit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SEPA Direct Debit</strong></a> can be used for EU-based recurring payments for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€0.35 per transaction</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How can I calculate the impact of these updates to my business?</strong></h2>
<p>The best way to calculate the impact these changes might have to your business is to leverage the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reports section</u></a> of your Stripe Dashboard.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reports section</u></a> of your Dashboard</p></li>
<li><p>Click on “Download” located at the top right hand of the “Balance change from activity” module</p></li>
<li><p>Export your activity to a .CSV file and ensure that “Card country” is selected as a column</p></li>
<li><p>Review transactions processed by the countries impacted</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Starting 10 April 2023 these types of transactions will be subject to the new fees.</p>
