</figcaption></figure><p>Nonogram puzzles present a grid with constraints on each row and column.
Constraints reveal the number and length of contained cells, and when all constraints are met a picture is revealed.
This screams for a computerized solution: the fabric of the puzzles themselves is binary.
</p><p><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/nonolog">Nonolog</a> is a solver for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram"><i>nonogram</i></a> (better known in English as <i>picross</i>) puzzles and was an excuse for me to learn Prolog.
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jleightcap/nonolog/tree/main/item/nono.prolog">The implementation itself</a> is not worthy of report and very naively written, but may be interesting to those with a background in or curiosity for logic programming. 
</p>
<p>Prolog was a natural language for expressing puzzle constraints.
Compared to the <i>additive</i> thinking I&#39;m comfortable with from most programming languages, where small pieces build up to a larger idea, writing Prolog felt to me distinctly <i>subtractive</i>, more like chiseling away all possibilities to define a boundary around an idea.
</p><p>These puzzles have haunted my boredom, and in total have demanded many hours of my idle attention.
My compulsion was particularly clear to me when I began noticing repeats in apps described as containing &#34;infinite&#34; puzzles.
Instead of continuing to solve individual puzzles, I wondered if by solving <i>all</i> puzzles I would be cured.
This has so far been true.
