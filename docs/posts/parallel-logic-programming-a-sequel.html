      <span>Abstract:</span>  Multi-core and highly-connected architectures have become ubiquitous, and
this has brought renewed interest in language-based approaches to the
exploitation of parallelism. Since its inception, logic programming has been
recognized as a programming paradigm with great potential for automated
exploitation of parallelism. The comprehensive survey of the first twenty years
of research in parallel logic programming, published in 2001, has served since
as a fundamental reference to researchers and developers. The contents are
quite valid today, but at the same time the field has continued evolving at a
fast pace in the years that have followed. Many of these achievements and
ongoing research have been driven by the rapid pace of technological
innovation, that has led to advances such as very large clusters, the wide
diffusion of multi-core processors, the game-changing role of general-purpose
graphic processing units, and the ubiquitous adoption of cloud computing. This
has been paralleled by significant advances within logic programming, such as
tabling, more powerful static analysis and verification, the rapid growth of
Answer Set Programming, and in general, more mature implementations and
systems. This survey provides a review of the research in parallel logic
programming covering the period since 2001, thus providing a natural
continuation of the previous survey. The goal of the survey is to serve not
only as a reference for researchers and developers of logic programming
systems, but also as engaging reading for anyone interested in logic and as a
useful source for researchers in parallel systems outside logic programming.
