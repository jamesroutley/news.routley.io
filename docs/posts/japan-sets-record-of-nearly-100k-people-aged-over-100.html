    <h1>Japan sets record of nearly 100k people aged over 100</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="byline-block"><div data-testid="byline-new"><p><span data-testid="byline-new-contributors"><p><span>Jessica Rawnsley</span><span data-testid="undefined-role-location"></span><span> and</span></p><p><span>Stephanie Hogarty</span><span data-testid="undefined-role-location">Population correspondent</span></p></span></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The number of people in Japan aged 100 or older has risen to a record high of nearly 100,000, its government has announced.</p><p>Setting a new record for the 55th year in a row, the number of centenarians in Japan was 99,763 as of September, the health ministry said on Friday. Of that total, women accounted for an overwhelming 88%.</p><p>Japan has the world&#39;s longest life expectancy, and is known for often being home to the world&#39;s oldest living person - though some studies contest the actual number of centenarians worldwide.</p><p>It is also one of the fastest ageing societies, with residents often having a healthier diet but a low birth rate.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The oldest person in Japan is 114-year-old Shigeko Kagawa, a woman from Yamatokoriyama, a suburb of the city Nara. Meanwhile, the oldest man is Kiyotaka Mizuno, 111, from the coastal city of Iwata.</p><p>Health minister Takamaro Fukoka congratulated the 87,784 female and 11,979 male centenarians on their longevity and expressed his &#34;gratitude for their many years of contributions to the development of society&#34;.</p><p>The figures were released ahead of Japan&#39;s Elderly Day on 15 September, a national holiday where new centenarians receive a congratulatory letter and silver cup from the prime minister. This year, 52,310 individuals were eligible, the health ministry said.</p><p>In the 1960s, Japan&#39;s population had the lowest proportion of people aged over 100 of any G7 country - but that has changed remarkably in the decades since.</p><p>When its government began the centenarian survey in 1963, there were 153 people aged 100 or over. </p><p>That figure rose to 1,000 in 1981 and stood at 10,000 by 1998.</p><p>The higher life expectancy is mainly attributed to fewer deaths from heart disease and common forms of cancer, in particular breast and prostate cancer.</p><p>Japan has low rates of obesity, a major contributing factor to both diseases, thanks to diets low in red meat and high in fish and vegetables.</p><p>The obesity rate is particularly low for women, which could go some way to explaining why Japanese women have a much higher life expectancy than their male counterparts.</p><p>As increased quantities of sugar and salt crept into diets in the rest of the world, Japan went in the other direction - with public health messaging successfully convincing people to reduce their salt consumption.</p><p>But it&#39;s not just diet. Japanese people tend to stay active into later life, walking and using public transport more than elderly people in the US and Europe.</p><p>Radio Taiso, a daily group exercise, has been a part of Japanese culture since 1928, established to encourage a sense of community as well as public health. The three-minute routine is broadcast on television and practised in small community groups across the country.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, several studies have cast doubt on the validity of global centenarian numbers, suggesting data errors, unreliable public records and missing birth certificates may account for elevated figures.</p><p>A government audit of family registries in Japan in 2010 uncovered more than <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11258071">230,000 people listed as being aged 100 or older who were unaccounted for</a>, some having in fact died decades previously.</p><p>The miscounting was attributed to patchy record-keeping and suspicions that some families may have tried to hide the deaths of elderly relatives in order to claim their pensions.</p><p>The national inquiry was launched after the remains of <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10809128">Sogen Koto, believed to be the oldest man in Tokyo at 111</a>, were found in his family home 32 years after his death.</p></div></div>
