    <h1>Microsoft seeks Rust developers to rewrite core C# code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft&#39;s adoption of Rust continues apace if a posting on the IT titan&#39;s careers website is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Although headcount at Microsoft might currently be down – by two percent compared to the previous year – recruitment persists at the Windows giant. In this case, the company is forming a team of Rustaceans to tackle a platform move away from C#.</p>
<p>The job, a principal software architect for Microsoft 365, has responsibilities that include &#34;guiding technical direction, design and implementation of Rust component libraries, SDKs, and re-implementation of existing global scale C# based services to Rust.&#34;</p>

    

<p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1633482/Principal-Software-Architect">post</a>, spotted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-forms-new-team-to-help-rewrite-core-windows-components-into-rust-from-c-c/">MSPowerUser</a>, the job lurks within the Substrate App Platform group, part of the Microsoft 365 Core Platform organization. The Substrate does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for Microsoft&#39;s cloud services, making a rewrite into Rust quite a statement of intent.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft said: &#34;We are forming a new team focused on enabling the adoption of the Rust programming language as the foundation to modernizing global scale platform services, and beyond.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>The company has had an interest in Rust for a while. In 2023, the director of OS security for Windows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/microsoft_windows_rust/">announced</a> the arrival of Rust in the Windows kernel and the language has been making its way into multiple components over the years.</p>
<p>Microsoft, alongside companies such as Meta and AWS, is a platinum member of the Rust Foundation. Considering the growing enthusiasm for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/26/memory_safety_mainstream/">memory-safe programming</a>, something Rust delivers with far less effort than the likes of C++, Microsoft&#39;s move is unsurprising. However, the company&#39;s desire to shift existing C#-based services to Rust will raise a few eyebrows among the developer community.</p>
<p>Memorably, a Microsoft engineer had to rapidly <span>backpedal</span> issue a clarification after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/18/microsoft_roundup/">proudly proclaiming</a> that Office 365 was being ported to JavaScript. In this instance, while Microsoft remains committed to C#, at least in public, its actions over the last few years and the job posting are indications that the company is keeping its options open.</p>

        

<p>It is also an indicator of the direction of travel for engineers mulling what new skills to pick up in an increasingly competitive world. ®</p>
