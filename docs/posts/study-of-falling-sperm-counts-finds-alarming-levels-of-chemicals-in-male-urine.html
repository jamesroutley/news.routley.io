    <h1>Study of falling sperm counts finds &#39;alarming&#39; levels of chemicals in male urine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Scientists searching for the causes of falling sperm counts are getting a clearer picture of the role played by chemical pollutants - and itâ€™s not a pretty one.</p><p>A study of urine samples from nearly 100 male volunteers has uncovered &#34;alarming&#34; levels of endocrine disruptors known to reduce human fertility.</p><p>Cocktails of chemicals such as bisphenols and dioxins, which are believed to interfere with hormones and affect sperm quality, were present at levels up to 100 times those considered safe.</p><p>The median exposure to these chemicals was 17 times the levels deemed acceptable.</p><p>&#34;Our mixture risk assessment of chemicals which affect male reproductive health reveals alarming exceedances of acceptable combined exposures,&#34; wrote the authors of the study, published on Thursday in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022002495#t0015"><strong>Environment International</strong></a>.</p><p>The study measured nine chemicals, including bisphenol, phthalates, and paracetamol, in urine samples from 98 Danish men aged 18 to 30.</p><p>Additionally, it used existing data, mostly from the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA), to estimate their likely exposure to 20 other chemicals.</p><p>The team then compared the results with acceptable levels of exposure derived from the scientific literature.</p><p>This resulted in a measure of the potential impact of each chemical, which the scientists combined to produce an overall risk measure - or &#34;hazard index&#34; - for the cocktail of compounds.</p><p>The study authors, led by Professor Andreas Kortenkamp of Brunel University London, said they were &#34;astonished&#34; by the magnitude of this hazard index in the volunteers studied.</p><p>They were also surprised to find that bisphenol A (BPA) was the dominant risk factor, given that recent research had focused on phthalates, which are used in plastics.</p><p>BPA was followed by dioxins, paracetamol, and phthalates. Removing BPA from the mix did not bring down the combined exposure to acceptable levels, and paracetamol was described as &#34;a driver of mixture risks among subjects using the drug&#34;.</p><p>The researchers acknowledged some limitations to their research.</p><p>For example, the data used dated from 2009 to 2010, and exposure to BPA may have decreased since, while exposure to other chemicals may have increased.</p><p>Another uncertainty is whether women of reproductive age have the same levels of chemical exposure as the men in the study.</p><p>But the researchers stressed their research may actually underestimate the risk posed by exposure to these chemical cocktails, given &#34;the multitude of chemicals humans are exposed to&#34; - which were not all measured in this study.</p><h2>Sperm count collapse</h2><p>Sperm quantity and quality have dramatically declined across Western countries in recent decades, with research suggesting sperm counts have been more than halved in the space of 40 years.</p><p>Meanwhile, other reproductive health disorders have been on the rise, such as non-descending testes and testicular cancer.</p><p>Scientists around the world have considered a range of other possible causes behind falling sperm counts, including lifestyle factors, tobacco consumption, and air pollution.</p><p>But recent studies have increasingly zeroed in on the role played by chemicals.</p><p>&#34;Our analysis has the character of a prediction which could be verified in suitably designed epidemiological studies of semen quality,&#34; Kortenkamp and his colleagues wrote.</p><p>Pending further studies in populations, the researchers called for urgent regulatory action such as a ban of BPA from food contact materials as a precautionary measure.</p><p>They added that animal studies looking at the impact of different doses of paracetamol on semen quality were &#34;missing altogether and are urgently needed&#34;.</p></div></div>
