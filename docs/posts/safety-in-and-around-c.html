    <h1>Safety in and around C&#43;&#43;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://izzys.casa/2024/11/on-safe-cxx/" rel="external" target="_blank">On “Safe” C++</a>, in which C++ is not just a language, but a community, which is not safe for everyone.</p>
<p>Linked out of the above: <a href="https://patricia.no/2022/03/08/cppcon.html" rel="external" target="_blank">CppCon’s failure to protect the community</a>;
and in a different direction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050901020250/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/28/22428/7034" rel="external" target="_blank">a story</a>
about “Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman”
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050901161245/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tenshi/Killer_000.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">this essay</a>
on the moral perspective evidenced in <em>Ender’s Game</em> and sequels.</p>
<p>Retrospective on how late Google was <a href="https://chandlerc.blog/posts/2024/11/story-time-bounds-checking/" rel="external" target="_blank">adding bounds checks to C++ containers</a>.
Turns out you can make dynamic checks cheap, once you decide to make that a goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you discouraging experiments that might change our prior assumptions?
Is your negativity based on historical data reflecting things that remain fundamentally true, or might there have been changes that motivate re-examining them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://safecpp.org/draft.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Safe C++</a> proposal, “What would a C++ with Rust’s safety model look like?” while keeping subclassing, etc.
And same author on <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/draft-profiles.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Why C++ safety profiles failed</a>.</p>
<p>Another critique of <a href="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/profiles/" rel="external" target="_blank">C++ profiles</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Profiles have a very explicit goal of shipping in C++26 (that is, in less than 3 months)…. You’d expect them to be implemented, researched, or motivated, but they appear to be none of these things[.]</p>

<p>An attempt to enumerate <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1705r1.html" rel="external" target="_blank">undefined behavior in C++</a>.</p>
