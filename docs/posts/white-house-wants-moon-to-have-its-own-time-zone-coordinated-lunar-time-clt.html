If they were placed on the Moon, over 50 years they would be running one second faster. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;An atomic clock on the Moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on Earth,&#34; said Kevin Coggins, Nasa&#39;s top communications and navigation official. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It makes sense that when you go to another body, like the Moon or Mars, that each one gets its own heartbeat,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Bettmann/Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>An early atomic clock &#34;maser&#34;, in the mid-1950s</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Nasa is not the only one trying to make lunar time a reality. The European Space Agency has also been developing a new time system for a while. There will need to be agreement between countries and a centralised co-ordinating body - currently this is done by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for time on Earth. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the moment on the International Space Station, Coordinated Universal Time is used because it remains low in orbit. Another element that countries will have to agree on is where the new time frame begins from and to where it extends.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The US wants LTC to be ready by 2026 in time for its manned mission to the Moon. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Artemis-3 will be the first mission to return to the Moon&#39;s surface since Apollo 17 in 1972. It is set to land at the lunar south pole, which is thought to hold vast stores of water-ice in craters that never see sunlight. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Locating and directing this mission requires extreme precision down to the nanosecond, errors in navigation which could risk spacecraft entering the wrong orbits.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Artemis-3 is also one of numerous planned national missions to the Moon as well as private endeavours. If time is not co-ordinated between them it could lead to challenges in sending data and communication between spacecraft, satellites and Earth.</p></div><section data-component="around-the-bbc"><p><h2>Around the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
