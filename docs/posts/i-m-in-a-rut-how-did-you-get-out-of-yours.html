    <h1>Ask HN: I&#39;m in a rut. How did you get out of yours?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I&#39;m a technical writer in his late 20&#39;s working remotely for a company based in New York. My background is in software development, but I took this job because at the time it was easier for me to find work as a technical writer than as a software engineer (and because I saw technical writing as close enough in spirit). I started the job this past fall.<p>In a nutshell, I&#39;m dissatisfied with how my life is going. I can&#39;t galvanize myself to do anything. I&#39;m on the clock right now, and here I am complaining about my life instead.</p><p>I don&#39;t give a damn about my employer, or the product it makes. I can&#39;t get interested in it. I can&#39;t get excited about the tedious parts of my work, and I can&#39;t even get excited about _automating and eliminating_ the tedious parts of my work.</p><p>And it&#39;s not just my day job. I&#39;m ostensibly working on a game on the side, but I haven&#39;t touched it in months. I&#39;m not even sure I want to continue it, as I&#39;ve been working on it for years without being able to fulfill my goals for it. And this is coming from someone who got into computer science _because_ of video games.</p><p>Things that used to bring me joy...don&#39;t, any more. All I really look forward to these days is getting high and playing video games or watching Seinfeld reruns each weekend. And even that barely tickles my fancy these days! There&#39;s a game coming out this week that I <i>should</i> be excited for (because I love the series it&#39;s part of), yet I can&#39;t even galvanize myself to purchase it.</p><p>I can barely even open my IDE at work, as it greets me with dread where I once found joy and ambition.</p><p>Also, I have ADHD. This is probably relevant, but I haven&#39;t quite figured out how.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the only person here who&#39;s ever felt like this, so my question is this: *if you&#39;ve ever been in this kind of rut, what was the nature of that rut and what did you do about it?*</p><p>Also, one thing I&#39;d like to clarify: I&#39;m not suicidal.</p></div></div>
