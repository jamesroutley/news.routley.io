<p data-block-key="u4q9q">If you need a hearty laugh, you may enjoy what Leonard and I enjoyed recently: <i>The Goes Wrong Show</i>, a British farce TV show (<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/the-goes-wrong-show">JustWatch for US</a> to advise on streaming options; <a href="https://tubitv.com/tv-shows/563122/">watch the first season free in the US on Tubi</a>).</p><p data-block-key="do5o7"><i>The Goes Wrong Show</i> is a spinoff of the live theater production <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Play_That_Goes_Wrong"><i>The Play That Goes Wrong</i></a>, which Leonard and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing in New York City -- twice, if I recall! -- a few years ago. The live show and the TV show depict an ambitious theatrical troupe trying valiantly to get through live performances of (fairly clich√©d) plays-within-a-play, despite all manner of mishap -- props and sets that fall apart, musical cues gone wrong, pratfalls, and whatnot.</p><p data-block-key="1lnei">A good farce is such a delight, like a magic trick or an arbitrage or an elegant piece of music. I absolutely love it when artists surprise me by combining pieces that were already right in front of me, such that immediately after the surprise I think &#34;well of course that&#39;s what had to happen.&#34; And farces with physical elements require <i>so much precise preparation</i> so that slips, cracks, falls, etc. will all &#34;go wrong&#34; in precisely the <i>right</i> ways, on cue. I love laughing with admiration.</p><p data-block-key="a2fhs"><i>The Goes Wrong Show</i> and <i>The Play That Goes Wrong</i> explore so many <i>ways</i> to go wrong, as though systematically cleaning out the problem space. I particularly appreciate when an explosive effect accidentally goes off many minutes before it&#39;s meant to, a neat inversion of the axiom of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun">Chekhov&#39;s gun</a> on the mantelpiece.</p><p data-block-key="cs3as">And there&#39;s no villain. The Show Must Go On and every character is trying to keep it going. The conflict is &#34;us vs. nature/fate&#34; like in a disaster movie. This is particularly pronounced when actors have to make up for a missing prop by miming. As Leonard said: it&#39;s all make-believe anyway, so why not one more?</p>
