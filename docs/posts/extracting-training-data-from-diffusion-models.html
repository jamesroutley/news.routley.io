      <span>Abstract:</span>  Image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion have
attracted significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality
synthetic images. In this work, we show that diffusion models memorize
individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time.
With a generate-and-filter pipeline, we extract over a thousand training
examples from state-of-the-art models, ranging from photographs of individual
people to trademarked company logos. We also train hundreds of diffusion models
in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect
privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private
than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these
vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.
