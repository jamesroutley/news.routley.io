<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Had a fun microvibes game jam in the Game Dev Interest Group meeting. We had half an hour to vibe code a game and then we shared demos. The theme was “Inconvenient Superpowers”. I made three small games using Claude &amp; Cursor. My favorite was probably Food Boy, inspired by the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Food_Boy">The Adventures of Food Boy</a>. In Claude’s words: “The goal is to keep spawning food and rack up points.” I iterated to get to more of a real game by adding a very short time limit (10 seconds) and a goal score to reach in that time limit. Here’s a demo:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>It was fun to see the other demos too! We also had a short discussion about the impact of AI on indie games.</li>



<li>Started studying a LeetCode guide. I’ve done a few LeetCode problems here and there in the Python Skills Accelerator group, but I’m thinking I want to start practicing on LeetCode regularly on my own. I’ll give it a try at least and see how it goes.</li>



<li>Last Thursday presentations in-batch were great and somewhat bittersweet, niceties too! Really nice to hang out and celebrate for a bit. It’s been lovely.</li>
