    <h1>$5 device tests for breast cancer in under 5 seconds: study</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>GAINESVILLE, Fla. —</strong> A five-dollar circuit board could hold the key to near-instantaneous breast cancer screenings. Scientists say a new handheld device is capable of testing for breast cancer in less than five seconds using just a small sample of saliva. This portable device is not only remarkably quick and user-friendly but also highly cost-effective.</p>



<p>The $5 device, along with its test strips that cost just a few cents each, uses common components. These include glucose testing strips readily available on the market and Arduino, an open-source hardware-software platform.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://studyfinds.org/smart-contact-lenses-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biosensor</a>, a collaborative development by the University of Florida and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, employs paper <a href="https://studyfinds.org/covid-test-3-minutes-no-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test strips</a> coated with specific antibodies. These antibodies interact with cancer biomarkers targeted in the test. Upon placing a drop of <a href="https://studyfinds.org/oral-partners-bedroom-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saliva</a> on the strip, electrical pulses are sent to contact points on the biosensor device. This process leads to the binding of biomarkers to antibodies, resulting in a measurable change in the output signal. This change is then converted into digital data, indicating the biomarker’s presence.</p>



<p>The researchers highlight that this device stands as a revolutionary alternative to traditional methods such as <a href="https://studyfinds.org/ai-technology-mammograms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mammograms</a>, ultrasounds, and <a href="https://studyfinds.org/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MRIs</a>. These conventional methods often involve <a href="https://studyfinds.org/cancer-treatment-without-side-effects-flash-rt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiation exposure</a>, are expensive, invasive, slow, and require bulky equipment.</p>

<p>The team behind this innovation hopes it will enable early breast cancer <a href="https://studyfinds.org/gene-changes-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detection</a> worldwide.</p>



<p>“Imagine medical staff conducting <a href="https://studyfinds.org/dog-sniffing-out-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast cancer</a> screening in communities or hospitals. Our device is an excellent choice because it is portable — about the size of your hand — and reusable,” says the author of the study, Hsiao-Hsuan Wan, a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, in a <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/would-you-prefer-a-mammogram-mri-or-saliva-on-a-test-strip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media release</a>. “The testing time is under five seconds per sample, which makes it highly efficient.”</p>



<p>Wan notes that in many regions, particularly in developing countries, advanced technologies for breast cancer testing, such as MRIs, may not be readily accessible.</p>



<p>“Our technology is more cost-effective, with the test strip costing <a href="https://studyfinds.org/skip-doctors-healthcare-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just a few cents</a> and the reusable circuit board priced at $5,” Wan says. “We are excited about the potential to make a significant impact in areas where people might not have had the resources for breast cancer screening tests before.”</p>



<p>Testing results demonstrate the device’s ability to provide accurate results even with <a href="https://studyfinds.org/forever-chemicals-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biomarker</a> concentrations as low as one femtogram per milliliter.</p>



<p>“The highlight for me was when I saw readings that clearly distinguished between healthy individuals and those with cancer,” Wan highlights. “We dedicated a lot of time and effort to perfecting the strip, board, and other components. Ultimately, we’ve created a technique that has the potential to help people all around the world.”</p>
