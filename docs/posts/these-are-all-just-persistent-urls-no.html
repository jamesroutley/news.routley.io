    <h1>These Are All Just Persistent URLs, No?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><time>July 5, 2022</time></p><div>
<p>I am beginning to walk through each <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question">question</a> of the
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) Ontology</a>. My goal
is to construct and share a populated model of people’s articulations – aka
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Declaration">declarations</a> – of choices they’ve made or with
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-No-Choice-Declaration">challenges</a> they face with regard to
addressing each question, as well as the
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/considerations">considerations</a> they associate with any such choice
or challenge.</p>
<p>The first question for which <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/fip-question-f1/">I’m seeking
declarations</a> is
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question-F1-D">F1-D</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What globally unique, persistent, resolvable identifiers do you use for datasets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve gotten some great responses so far, mostly
about people choosing to use the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-handle-system-of-persistent-identifiers/">Handle (incl.
DOI)</a> or
<a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-ark-system-of-pids/">ARK</a> systems.</p>
<p>I got a great question from my former group-mate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyam-dwaraknath/">Shyam
Dwaraknath</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end these are all just persistent URLs no?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For all intents and purposes, <em>yes</em>. Practically, if you don’t give someone a resolving<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> HTTP(S)
URL, such that they can Locate and retrieve the Resource given a Uniform Identifier (i.e.,
URI\(\implies\)URL), they should be able to straightforwardly construct one.</p>
<p>Handles and ARKs use their compact forms to communicate</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>an intention of persistence, and (related to this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a URL-construction protocol in case they are</p>
<p>(a) not communicated as URLs, or</p>
<p>(b) they are, but the URLs don’t resolve.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you see e.g. <code>10.1038/sdata.2016.18</code> somewhere, the hope is you will grok that
the <code>\d+[\.\d+]+/.+</code> pattern (period-delimited numbers, then a <code>/</code>, then stuff) is likely a Handle,
so you will try putting <a href="https://doi.org/">https://doi.org/</a> or <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/">https://hdl.handle.net/</a> before it. There either need to
be well-known public Handle HTTP Proxy servers, or you search around for “Handle proxy server”.
You’ll also see <code>doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18</code> sometimes. Same principle. The hope is you know how to
URLify it trivially.</p>
<p>The form of an ARK is similar in intent. The hope is that if you see e.g. <code>ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</code>
somewhere (for ARKs, the <code>ark:</code> prefix is part of the ID form, even in URL paths), you’ll think
“this ID is intended to be persistent – an archival resource key” and “I hope some name mapping
authority (NMA) is publicly resolving <code>ark:57802</code> IDs”. The well-known public ARK HTTP Proxy is
<a href="https://n2t.net">https://n2t.net</a>, and e.g. <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045">https://n2t.net/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</a> passes through to
<a href="https://ns.polyneme.xyz/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045">https://ns.polyneme.xyz/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</a> because <code>https://ns.polyneme.xyz</code> is registered
there as the NMA for the name assigning authority (NAA) <code>ark:57802</code>.</p>
<p>Other persistent ID systems that imply/offer HTTP URLs have tighter coupling to the DNS domain
responsible for resolving the IDs. Some of these systems are intended for general use, such as
<a href="https://purl.org/">https://purl.org/</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/">https://w3id.org/</a>.</p>
<p>In these systems, prefixes are not <em>allocated</em> like with Handles or ARKs, and there is no emphasis
on prefixes being semantically opaque so as to increase the likelihood of continued commitment to
persistence if/when stewarding organizations change names. Rather, prefixes are <em>claimed</em>, like
<a href="http://purl.org/dc">http://purl.org/dc</a> (serving e.g. <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms">http://purl.org/dc/terms</a>) and <a href="https://purl.org/dw">https://purl.org/dw</a> (serving
e.g. <a href="https://purl.org/dw/squirrel">https://purl.org/dw/squirrel</a>), or <a href="https://w3id.org/nmdc">https://w3id.org/nmdc</a> (where currently, all path
extensions, e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/nmdc/nmdc-schema">https://w3id.org/nmdc/nmdc-schema</a>, resolve to the same page).</p>
<p>Other DNS-coupled systems are socially positioned as providing specific types of persistent
identifiers. Such systems include the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://w3.org/">https://w3.org/</a> namespace
for standards (e.g. <a href="https://w3.org/ns/dcat">https://w3.org/ns/dcat</a>), the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)
<a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a> (e.g. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8424-0604">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8424-0604</a>), the International Generic
Sample Number (IGSN) <a href="https://igsn.org">https://igsn.org</a> (e.g. <a href="https://igsn.org/IEWFS0001">https://igsn.org/IEWFS0001</a>), and the Research
Organization Registry (ROR) <a href="https://ror.org/">https://ror.org/</a> (e.g. <a href="https://ror.org/02jbv0t02">https://ror.org/02jbv0t02</a>).</p>
<p>If/when any such special-purpose, domain-name-tied system cannot fulfill persistence, it is hoped
that there will be (a) an adopter organization and (b) sufficient signage (e.g. minimal maintenance
of the old domain as a static notice) to enable programmatic workarounds, like the case of the
Global Researcher Identifier Database (GRID) <a href="https://grid.ac/">https://grid.ac/</a> being passed to ROR for stewardship.</p>
