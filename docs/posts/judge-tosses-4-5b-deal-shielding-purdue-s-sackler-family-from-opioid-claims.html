The U.S. Justice Department’s bankruptcy watchdog and the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office also objected.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">McMahon raised questions about more than $10 billion Purdue distributed to the Sacklers spanning a roughly decade-long period that preceded the company’s bankruptcy filing.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">The Sacklers have faced allegations, which they deny, that they authorized the financial transfers to prevent the money from being drained in future litigation against Purdue. The Sacklers have said much of the money went toward taxes and investments, as opposed to their pockets.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">McMahon&#39;s ruling came a week after the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Sacklers, long known for their philanthropy, announced an agreement to remove Sackler name from seven exhibition spaces.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits accusing the company and Sackler family members of contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">The litigation accused the company and family members of aggressively marketing OxyContin while downplaying its addiction and overdose risks. The company and family members have denied the allegations.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, agreed early in Purdue&#39;s court restructuring to halt litigation against the company and Sackler family members, who had not filed for Chapter 11 protection themselves.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker last year pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">Drain said it was clear the wrongful marketing of the company&#39;s opioid products contributed to the addiction crisis that touched every corner of the country.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">But he overruled objections to the legal releases shielding the Sacklers. Drain predicted that denying the releases would unravel Purdue’s reorganization – settlement aimed at steering funds toward communities reeling from the opioid epidemic – and result in the company’s liquidation, leaving little to nothing for victims.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">McMahon, though, found that the Bankruptcy Code “does not authorize” granting such nonconsensual third-party releases.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Brendan Pierson, Mike Spector and Maria Chutchian in New York; editing by Diane Craft, Lincoln Feast and Grant McCool</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
