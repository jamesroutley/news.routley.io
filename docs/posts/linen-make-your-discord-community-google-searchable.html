    <h1>Linen â€“ Make your Discord community Google-searchable</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linen syncs your Slack and Discord threads to an SEO friendly website that allows your community to discover you through search engines and reduces the number of repeat questions.</p><div><p>Backed by <b>Y Combinator</b></p><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2725%27%20height=%2725%27/%3e"/></span><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p></div></div><div><p>Linen syncs all your threads in your public channels and threads to linen.dev/s/your_slack_workspace_name. This makes your Slack/Discord contents available for your community members without requiring a login.</p><p>Linen is free to set up and install. Once you go through the 10 minute setup process and wait for the syncing you will be able to make your community&#39;s threads free of charge.</p><p>The paid edition puts Linen behind your subdomain where you can generate organic SEO friendly content that is relevant for your domain. You will get a 301 redirect from our subdomain to yours to give all the SEO benefits. You also will be able to customize your Linen page with your custom logo and branding.</p><p>Slack/Discord communities are great for chatting and engaging but over time they become overwelming. As a community grows so does the number of repeat questions. As previously a former open source maintainer I wanted to minimize the number of repeat questions and encourage the community to search.</p><p>Linen is a great way to make your community content more discoverable. No longer do you need to login to your Slack/Discord workspace to view your community&#39;s content. You can link specific conversations in github issues without requiring a sign in to get the context of the issue.</p><p>Linen only syncs conversations in the public channels. We only pull the display name and profile picture from Slack/Discord and we do not store community member&#39;s email or private information. Upon request we will delete any community member&#39;s information and messages within 14 days. Finally we have the options of anonymizing your community member&#39;s display name with a fake randomly generated string like `many-ancient-parrot`, `adventurous-billowy-kangaroo`, and `benedict-cumberbatch`.</p></div></div>
