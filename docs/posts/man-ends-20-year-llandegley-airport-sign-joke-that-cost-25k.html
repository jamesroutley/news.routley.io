It was made by Wrexham Signs, given the OK, one thing led to another and there it is.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Whitehead added &#34;as a journalist, whatever you do, someone, somewhere, is going to get upset about it&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, this particular joke has seemingly been popular among locals and tourists alike.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Farmer Neil Richards says the fictitious airport draws tourists to the area</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;In 20 years, I haven&#39;t had a single complaint about Llandegley International,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Loads of people love it, some people might not get it. But as far as I know, nobody is upset or angry about it. That&#39;s a first for me.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="A-national-treasure"><span role="text">&#39;A national treasure&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>It has cost  around £1,500 per year to maintain the billboard. After paying more than £25,000, Mr Whitehead has decided it&#39;s time to call it a day.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think the airport is established now - and I think the establishment should take it on,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s not exactly a national monument - but it is a national treasure.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He hopes Welsh government heritage body Cadw may be interested in taking it over.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It has become an item of Welsh heritage. It wouldn&#39;t cost them anything like as much as it&#39;s cost me. In terms of value for money, it&#39;s unbeatable.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>&#34;The sign is part of our community,&#34; says Holly Richards from Llandegley</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the nearby service station in Crossgates - a cafe popular with bikers - locals said they were sad to see the landmark go.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Holly Richards said: &#34;I&#39;ve lived in Llandegley all my life. The sign is part of our community. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s a bit of a running gag - people joke that they&#39;ve just flown into Llandegley and they&#39;re flying back out tomorrow. It&#39;s a wonderful feature.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>William Jones hopes to one day pass the story of the airport onto his own children</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>William Jones, 20, added: &#34;Every time we see it, me and my mates have a giggle. I asked my mum all about it when I was young, and I&#39;d like to be able to tell my own kids about it one day.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Farmer Neil Richards said it had helped put the village on the map. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There&#39;s no end of people who have seen and heard about the sign who&#39;ve stopped at our farm on the edge of the Radnor Forest, asking how to find the airport,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Apparently two American airforce planes landed nearby as part of a military mission in World War Two.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The airport has also taken off in a big way on social media. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Thousands of followers across Facebook and Twitter enjoy updates about Llandegley&#39;s impressive environmental credentials, and engage in flights of fancy about the &#34;top secret&#34; Terminal 2. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Whitehead said these are the people who make the airport what it is. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The sign is just a sign,&#34; he said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The sign can come down but the airport is still there. The airport exists in the same way that songs exist. If you set fire to the scrap of paper on which Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday, that wouldn&#39;t destroy the song. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The song exists as a shared experience; it&#39;s indestructible. It&#39;s the same with the airport.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When Jill Dibling, a long-time fan of the airport, died of liver cancer, the sign was changed in her honour. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her family in Llandrindod approved and were touched by the tribute. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The sign was altered in 2019 in memory of long-time fan of the airport, Jill Dibling</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Whitehead now plans to launch a campaign to gain official recognition for the quirky institution he founded.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With a lot of local support and a big online fanbase, it might not yet be the end of the road for Llandegley International. </p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
