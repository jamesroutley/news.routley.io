          I subscribe to about 100 RSS feeds and one email newsletter: Money
          Stuff. I wanted a way to receive Money Stuff in my RSS reader instead
          of in my inbox. Unfortunately, Bloomberg doesn&#39;t seem to offer an RSS
          feed for Money Stuff anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found a website called
          <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a>
          that converts email newsletters into RSS feeds. For each newsletter
          you want to subscribe to, Kill the Newsletter gives you a brand-new,
          unique email address and Atom feed URL. You subscribe to the
          newsletter using the email address and add the feed to your RSS
          reader. When Kill the Newsletter receives a newsletter email, it
          converts the email into a post and adds it to the feed, so that it
          shows up in your reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          One disadvantage is that my RSS reader doesn&#39;t refetch feeds very
          often. There&#39;s some delay between the newsletter being sent out and me
          receiving it, whereas I get a notification about the email version as
          soon as it lands in my inbox. My RSS reader does give me the ability
          to manually refresh a certain feed, which mostly addresses this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Kill the Newsletter has worked well for me. I plan to use it
          for more newsletters in the future.
