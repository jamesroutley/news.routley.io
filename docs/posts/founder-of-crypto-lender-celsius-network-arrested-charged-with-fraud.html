    <h1>Founder of crypto lender Celsius Network arrested, charged with fraud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">July 13 (Reuters) - Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, was arrested and charged with fraud, a U.S. prosecutor in New York said Thursday, while three federal regulatory agencies sued him and his company.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">Mashinsky, 57, was charged with seven criminal counts - including securities fraud, commodities fraud and wire fraud - while Celsius&#39; former chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, was charged with four criminal counts, according to the indictment, which was unsealed on Thursday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Lawyers for Mashinsky and Celsius did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Cohen-Pavon&#39;s attorney could not immediately be reached.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Mashinsky is one of several crypto moguls to be indicted in another blow for the industry, which has been experiencing a reckoning after a slump in crypto prices led several companies to collapse, including exchange giant FTX. Its founder <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-loses-bid-toss-criminal-charges-over-ftxs-collapse-2023-06-27/">Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with fraud</a> last year, and has pleaded not guilty.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office in Manhattan said it would hold a press conference to provide details on the charges against Mashinsky and Cohen-Pavon.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">&#39;PROFITS IN YOUR POCKET&#39;</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Celsius <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-lender-celsius-network-reveals-119-billion-hole-bankruptcy-filing-2022-07-14/">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in July last year after customers rushed to withdraw deposits as crypto prices fell. Many have been unable to access their funds for more than a year.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Mashinsky and Cohen-Pavon were charged with market manipulation of the New Jersey-based company&#39;s crypto token, known as Cel, as well as a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the cryptocurrency and wire fraud related to the manipulation of the token, according to the indictment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Prosecutors alleged Mashinsky also personally reaped approximately $42 million in proceeds from selling his holdings of the Cel token.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">In a related development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mashinsky and Celsius on Thursday, according to a court filing, alleging he and his firm raised billions of dollars through the sale of unregistered crypto securities and misled investors about the financial state of the privately held company.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The SEC, along with other regulators which also filed lawsuits Thursday, accused Mashinsky and his company of touting Celsius as safe - akin to a traditional bank - even as they took increasingly risky steps to deliver promised high yields on customer deposits.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Celsius used emails with phrases like &#34;Pour Yourself a Cup of Profits&#34; and &#34;Profits in your Pocket&#34; to promote its interest-earning program, which promised investors returns of up to 17%, the SEC said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">While the firm lost millions of dollars as customers raced to withdraw funds, the then-CEO and Celsius continued to claim the company was financially secure and had enough funds to meet withdrawals, regulators said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Celsius was among the first in a <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cryptos-string-bankruptcies-2023-01-20/">series of bankruptcies</a> in the cryptocurrency sector last year as token prices cratered amid rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation. It filed for bankruptcy shortly after Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and rival crypto lender Voyager Digital did the same.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Crypto lenders such as Celsius <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/world-crypto-lending-2022-06-13/">grew rapidly</a> as crypto prices surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. They promised easy loan access and high interest rates to depositors, then lent out tokens to institutional investors, hoping to profit from the difference.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">The SEC said Celsius engaged in &#34;risky trading practices&#34; and made uncollateralized loans, despite telling investors that it did not. The company also falsely claimed to have raised $50 million from its initial token sale, and claimed to have 1 million active users when in fact it only ever had around 500,000 depositors, many of whom were no longer active, the SEC said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission also sued Celsius and Mashinsky. The FTC said it had reached a settlement with Celsius that will permanently ban it from handling customers&#39; assets.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">The regulators&#39; lawsuits add to a series of challenges for Celsius Network and its founder.
