<p>(This is a guest post by Bhavik Mehta)</p>



<p>On March 16, 2023, a paper by Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe appeared on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arXiv</a>, announcing an exponential improvement to the upper bound on Ramsey numbers, an open problem since 1935. Around the same time, posts by <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/110034365802889269">Terence Tao</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1636632071069106181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothy Gowers</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2023/03/16/some-news-from-a-seminar-in-cambridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gil Kalai</a> appeared, all discussing this announcement. These were soon followed by articles in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/after-nearly-a-century-a-new-limit-for-patterns-in-graphs-20230502/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quanta</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00840-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2365577-breakthrough-in-fiendishly-hard-puzzle-has-mathematicians-partying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Scientist</a>. The new paper was clearly exciting news. </p>



<p>About six months after this, I finished formally verifying the titular result of Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe’s beautiful paper in the Lean Theorem Prover. In this post I’ll discuss the gap between informal mathematics and formalised mathematics, demonstrating that very recent and involved arguments in combinatorics can often be formalised in real time. The code for this formalisation is available here: <a href="https://github.com/b-mehta/exponential-ramsey/blob/main/src/main_results.lean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/b-mehta/exponential-ramsey/blob/main/src/main_results.lean</a>, and this specific file shows an overview of the relevant definitions and theorems. Another version can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/ae455e738408cee6cf0414794475225da76cacae/src/combinatorics/simple_graph/exponential_ramsey/main_results.lean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branch of Lean’s mathlib</a>, which additionally shows that the proof has been checked by Lean, and further verified by an external type-checker. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first recent result in combinatorics to be formalised in Lean soon after its announcement: together with Thomas Bloom I <a href="https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalised</a> a 2021 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> of his within a year of it being uploaded, and Ellenberg-Gijswijt’s 2016 result giving upper bounds on the cap-set problem (which later appeared in the Annals) was <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/e-g/e-g.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalised</a> by Dahmen, Hölzl, and Lewis in 2019. Of course, no post about formalisation in combinatorics would be complete without a mention of the the four colour theorem, proved in 1976 (with the final gaps closed in 1989) and <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101382p.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalised in Coq</a> in 2005. </p>



<h2>5 years, 50 pages, 5 months</h2>



<p>Quite unlike the remarkably short proof of Ellenberg-Gijswijt result on cap-sets, the new result here has a particularly involved proof which was a 5-year long project of the authors, and the paper comes to over 50 pages in total. In comparison, the formalisation took me about 5 months, including prerequisites, and I ended up with around 20k lines of Lean code. </p>



<p>For the sake of comparison with other recent large-scale formalisations, the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/lte-final/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Tensor Experiment</a> took just over a year with a large amount of person-hours, and the portion of the lecture notes that was formalised was around 10 pages; although that project had a massive amount of prerequisites to formalise also. The cap-set proof (4 pages long) similarly had a large proportion of prerequisities to deal with, as that project was written at a time when Lean’s mathlib had not much support for polynomials, which is of course necessary for a proof which uses the polynomial method. </p>



<p>The formalised exponential Ramsey proof also relies on mathlib, most heavily the support for manipulating finite sets, but vitally on asymptotic estimates as well, since almost all the statements are about “sufficiently large” naturals. Another key aspect of the proof is probabilistic constructions, in which we show the existence of an object because it has non-zero probability of appearing if we try to make it randomly. Fortunately, the probability spaces needed here are all finite, so they can be formally represented by sums on finite sets.<sup data-fn="a4201525-a9da-430d-a3c7-e6dba45e39ca"><a href="#a4201525-a9da-430d-a3c7-e6dba45e39ca" id="a4201525-a9da-430d-a3c7-e6dba45e39ca-link">1</a></sup> </p>



<p>The end of the proof requires surprisingly precise numerical approximations, as the final part of the argument fundamentally relies on the fact that the red and blue regions in the diagram below don’t intersect. In the original paper, it is enough to say that this can be checked by computer (though the authors give suggestions towards a slightly more detailed proof as well), but formally some more careful analysis is needed.</p>

<p>In terms of the global structure of the proof, the formal version follows the informal version closely, which is a testament to both the clarity of the paper, and the strength of Lean and mathlib to formalise practical arguments. In particular, no blueprint was needed for this formalisation, and it was in some sense done “on the fly”. I understood each part of the proof as it came to translate it, rather than writing a separate semi-formal version first. Indeed, when I started, my goal wasn’t to verify the entire paper. It was just to understand the argument because I thought it was an interesting result! </p>



<h2>Mathematical typos </h2>



<p>An obvious question when formalising a maths paper is how much the proof needed to change to be formalised: in other words whether there were any flaws in the paper. This question is surprisingly subtle, but a simple summary is that most of the mistakes I identified were easily fixable. Importantly all mistakes were fixable in a way that preserved the spirit of the argument, so the Lean version of the proof can reasonably be said to be a translation of the informal proof. </p>



<p>I like to consider certain such small mistakes “mathematical typos”. It’s fair to call them errors, and just like typos in English prose can confuse a non-native speaker, mathematical typos can impede meaning for a reader who isn’t familiar with mathematics. However, with a little experience, it’s not hard to see what the intended meaning was, and fixing it isn’t too bad. A mathematical typo certainly doesn’t constitute a flaw in the proof, and almost all the problems I found fall in this category. </p>



<p>That said, there were two places where I needed some help from the authors to figure out how to fix something from the paper, but it still remains true that the spirit of the argument was unchanged.<sup data-fn="fa5ce04f-5bde-499c-acdb-178dccece4ea"><a href="#fa5ce04f-5bde-499c-acdb-178dccece4ea" id="fa5ce04f-5bde-499c-acdb-178dccece4ea-link">2</a></sup></p>



<h2>What are Ramsey numbers? </h2>



<p>The existence of Ramsey numbers was shown by Frank Ramsey in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-30.1.264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1930 paper</a> whose goal was to show decidability of a particular fragment of first-order logic. Shortly afterward, in 1935, a <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/88611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper of Erdős and Szekeres</a> popularised Ramsey numbers, giving rise to the fundamental branch of combinatorics now known as Ramsey theory. Ramsey theory itself can fill entire lecture series and textbooks, but in this post I’ll focus on the simplest and most well-studied case: two-colour Ramsey numbers. </p>



<p>The definition of two-colour Ramsey numbers is fairly easy to give. For any numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k"/> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="l"/>, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, l)"/> is the smallest number of people at a party you need, to find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k"/> people who all know each other or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="l"/> people who all don’t know each other. More mathematically, for any red/blue colouring of the edges of the complete graph on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, l)"/> vertices, you can find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k"/> vertices with only red edges between them or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="l"/> vertices with only blue edges between them. </p>



<p>Erdős and Szekeres in their 1935 paper gave an upper bound of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29+%5Cleq+%5Cbinom%7Bk+%2B+l+-+2%7D%7Bk+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29+%5Cleq+%5Cbinom%7Bk+%2B+l+-+2%7D%7Bk+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+l%29+%5Cleq+%5Cbinom%7Bk+%2B+l+-+2%7D%7Bk+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, l) \leq \binom{k + l - 2}{k - 1}"/>, (implying that the <em>diagonal</em> Ramsey number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k)"/> can be upper-bounded by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="4^k"/>). The research community attempted improvements to the problem of decreasing their upper bound, and in 1988 the first polynomial improvement was found by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jgt.3190120406">Thomason</a>. His method was taken further by <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2009/170-2/p15">Conlon in 2009</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-172/issue-3/Diagonal-Ramsey-via-effective-quasirandomness/10.1215/00127094-2022-0048.short">later by Sah</a>, eventually reaching a bound of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+4%5E%7Bk+-+%28%5Clog+k%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+4%5E%7Bk+-+%28%5Clog+k%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+4%5E%7Bk+-+%28%5Clog+k%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k) \leq 4^{k - (\log k)^2}"/>. Conlon’s paper, giving the first super-polynomial improvement to the Erdős-Szekeres bound, was especially noteworthy and appeared in the Annals of Mathematics. But despite all of these successes, the question of decreasing the base of the exponent in the bound was still open. Is there a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3C+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3C+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3C+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C &lt; 4"/> for which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+C+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+C+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+C+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k) \leq C ^ k"/>? </p>



<p>It is worth saying something briefly about the lower bound for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k)"/>. It was first shown by Erdős in 1947 that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k) \geq \sqrt{2}^k"/> using a probabilistic argument which was itself groundbreaking, and gave rise to the field of probabilistic combinatorics. While a lower order improvement has been made to this, the base <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\sqrt{2}"/> has not been improved, giving a wide gap between the lower and upper bounds of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\sqrt{2}"/> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="4"/>. </p>



<p>Finally, in March 2023, the paper of Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe was made public, giving the desired <em>exponential</em> improvement, a massive strengthening of Conlon’s result. They show that there is a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="c &gt; 0"/> such that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k"/>, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+%284+-+c%29+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+%284+-+c%29+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2C+k%29+%5Cleq+%284+-+c%29+%5E+k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(k, k) \leq (4 - c) ^ k"/>. This paper is in the publication process, and this is the result which I formalised. </p>



<p>As part of this formalisation project, I additionally formalised a general form of Erdős’s lower bound and gave some upper and lower bounds for the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%283%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%283%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%283%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(3, k)"/>.<sup data-fn="4c63ee36-be18-4797-a6d8-afe3791f9a8e"><a href="#4c63ee36-be18-4797-a6d8-afe3791f9a8e" id="4c63ee36-be18-4797-a6d8-afe3791f9a8e-link">3</a></sup></p>



<p>“Suppose aliens invade the earth and threaten to obliterate it in a year’s time unless human beings can find the Ramsey number for red five and blue five. We could marshal the world’s best minds and fastest computers, and within a year we could probably calculate the value. If the aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six, however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive attack.” – Paul Erdős, <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/90_06_ramsey_theory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relayed by Graham and Spencer</a>.</p>



<p>This famous quote of Erdős discusses the difficulty of computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%285%2C+5%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%285%2C+5%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%285%2C+5%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(5, 5)"/> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%286%2C+6%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%286%2C+6%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%286%2C+6%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(6, 6)"/>, both of which are still unknown, and the main result of this post doesn’t get us any closer. Nonetheless, as part of this project, I formalised bounds on some of the known small values of Ramsey numbers, including <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%284%2C+4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%284%2C+4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%284%2C+4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="R(4, 4)"/>.<sup data-fn="b831a86e-25c3-4326-89c0-f9799756b4f9"><a href="#b831a86e-25c3-4326-89c0-f9799756b4f9" id="b831a86e-25c3-4326-89c0-f9799756b4f9-link">4</a></sup></p>



<h2>What’s next? </h2>



<p>To get to the primary result – an exponential improvement on the upper bound for Ramsey numbers – the authors give two proofs, their second proof providing a slightly better constant. Here I only formalised the first, meaning a future project could be to improve the constant in the Lean proof. This should be easier now because a large portion of the technical difficulties have been overcome. Furthermore, any future claimed improvements on the number should be much quicker to verify, since the original framework of this paper can be extended. </p>



<p>This formalisation was done in Lean 3, for multiple reasons, but most importantly that when I started the prerequisite mathlib lemmas were not yet implemented in Lean 4. I’m in the process of trying to port the project to Lean 4.<sup data-fn="6ffbbea2-a8e3-48db-ae0a-e2724e051fc3"><a href="#6ffbbea2-a8e3-48db-ae0a-e2724e051fc3" id="6ffbbea2-a8e3-48db-ae0a-e2724e051fc3-link">5</a></sup></p>



<p>Finally, if you want to get involved in the Lean community, contribute to mathlib, use Lean to check some part of your research, or just try to understand a new argument like I did, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the community website</a> is a great place to start. </p>
