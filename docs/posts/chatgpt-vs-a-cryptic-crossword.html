<p>Having seen several mind-blowing articles about ChatGPT’s ability (most notably <a href="https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/">this one</a>), I wondered how ChatGPT would fare solving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crossword</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to try with an easy one: a Quick Cryptic from The Times. I had a search through <a href="https://timesforthetimes.co.uk/category/quick-cryptic">the Times for the Times archives</a> to try and find one on the easier side. Eventually, I settled on <a href="https://timesforthetimes.co.uk/times-quick-cryptic-no-2273-by-beck">Quick Cryptic 2273 by Beck</a>, which was described as “very gentle” by the solver.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Okay, let’s get started:</p>

    <img src="https://jameswillia.ms/images/chatgpt-cryptic1.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>A swing… and a miss. Wrong answer, and the reasoning is nonsensical.</p>
<p>(The answer is “MANTRA” – MAN (chap) and ART (skill) reversed (recalled)).</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let’s hit “try again”:</p>

    <img src="https://jameswillia.ms/images/chatgpt-cryptic2.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Correct answer! But let’s check the reasoning…</p>
<p>Chap is indeed <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chap#Etymology_1">derived from chapman</a> (which was news to me), and a chapman <em>is</em> a trader.</p>
<p>But that’s where we start to go off the rails… TRADER reversed is REDART, not REDARAT. And REDARAT is definitely not a homophone of MANTRA.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One more try:</p>

    <img src="https://jameswillia.ms/images/chatgpt-cryptic3.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Okay – again, the right answer! How is it getting to the answer though?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taking the first letter of the word “chap” (M)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>uhhh…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the past tense of the verb “to recall” (ANT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>umm…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the first two letters of the word “skill” (RA)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>???</p>
<hr/>
<p>Okay, let’s try another clue.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://jameswillia.ms/images/chatgpt-cryptic4.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>The solution here is IMPACT – ACT (legislation) after I (one) and MP (politician) (“Introduced by” is an indicator to put the I MP at the front.)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Maybe the clues I’ve been trying have been too hard. Let’s try the easiest one I can find.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://jameswillia.ms/images/chatgpt-cryptic5.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>So close, yet so far… The reasoning is <em>almost</em> right. The correct reasoning is S + US (American) + HI (greeting).</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Credit where it’s due, ChatGPT gets a couple of things right in these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>it understands the structure of a clue in most case: it gets that the clue is formed of a straight and cryptic part, and the straight part is at the start or end</li>
<li>it generally answers with the correct amount of letters</li>
<li>it understands what wordplay is (anagrams, homophones, reversal, concatenation, etc.), and kind of applies them – just incorrectly</li>
</ul>
<p>And, importantly, it occasionally gets to the correct answer. But in these cases, it appears to reach the correct answer entirely based on the straight clue: it forces the cryptic solution backwards from there (even when it makes no sense).</p>
<p>I find it interesting that it replies with 100% confidence, despite the reasoning being obviously (to a human) absurd.</p>
<p>I guess cryptic crosswords fall into the (surprisingly small) category of things that ChatGPT just isn’t very good at!</p>
