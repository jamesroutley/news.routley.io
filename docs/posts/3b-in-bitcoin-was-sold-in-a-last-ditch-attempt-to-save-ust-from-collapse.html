Now, they&#39;ve got their answer.</p><p>Luna Foundation Guard, a fund set up by Terra creator Do Kwon, <a href="https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126703046582272" target="_blank">said Monday</a> it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save terraUSD — or UST, for short.</p><p>The foundation had accumulated a total of more than 80,000 bitcoins, which was worth nearly $3 billion last week, as well as other tokens including BNB, tether, USDC and avalanche. Kwon had promised to use the bitcoin in the event of a dramatic fall in the value of UST.</p><p>In a series of tweets, Luna Foundation Guard said it transferred 52,189 bitcoins to &#34;trade with a counterparty&#34; as UST fell below its intended $1 peg. A further 33,206 bitcoins were sold by Terra directly in a last-ditch effort to defend the peg, the foundation said.</p><p>As of Monday, Luna Foundation Guard had just 313 bitcoins left in its reserve, worth approximately $9.3 million. The firm said it would use the remainder of its $85 million in crypto assets — including some BNB and avalanche — to &#34;compensate remaining users&#34; of UST.</p><p>&#34;We are still debating through various distribution methods, updates to follow soon,&#34; Luna Foundation Guard said.</p><p>UST is what&#39;s known as an &#34;algorithmic&#34; stablecoin. Unlike tether and USDC, which hold fiat assets in a reserve to back their tokens, UST relied on a complex set of code, coupled with a floating token called luna, to balance supply and demand and stabilize the price.</p><p>When UST began to drop below $1 last week, luna also started to sell off, resulting in a vicious cycle that caused UST to plunge to less than 30 cents while luna became worthless. UST is now worth just 9 cents, according to CoinGecko data.</p><p>&#34;The big problem when you&#39;re dealing with a partially collateralized stablecoin like UST is that your hard collateral — bitcoin, in this case — is going to be considerably more valuable to [investors] than your governance token,&#34; or luna, said Frances Coppola, an independent economist.</p></div><div><p>Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/what-happened-to-the-3.5-billion-terra-reserve-elliptic-follows-the-bitcoins" target="_blank">estimates</a> holders of UST and luna have lost a total of $42 billion over the past week. Analysis from the company shows that 52,189 bitcoins were moved to a single account at crypto exchange Gemini, while a further 28,205 bitcoins were transferred to Binance. Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic, said it was &#34;not possible&#34; to trace the movement of funds beyond these wallets.</p><p>The debacle <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/12/bitcoin-btc-price-falls-below-27000-as-crypto-sell-off-intensifies.html">rippled through crypto markets</a>, wiping out more than $200 billion of wealth in a single day. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.BS=-USS">Bitcoin</a> on Thursday briefly fell below $26,000, its lowest level since December 2020. The world&#39;s biggest cryptocurrency was last trading at $29,526.75, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s not a whole lot of outstanding sell pressure,&#34; said Dustin Teander, analyst at crypto research firm Messari.</p><p>&#34;In a sense, the market is going to take that as kind of bullish.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
