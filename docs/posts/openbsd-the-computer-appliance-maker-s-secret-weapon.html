    <h1>OpenBSD, the computer appliance maker&#39;s secret weapon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Between our ESP32 prokaryotic organisms and our 24/7 Internet-enabled
megafauna servers, there exists a vast and loosely-defined ecosystem of things
the
B2B world likes to call <strong>computer appliances</strong>. Picture a bespoke Pi 4 packaged
up neatly with some Python scripts, a little fancy plastic embossing, and maybe
a well-guarded <code>id_ed25519.pub</code> in case you end up in hot water during the
(long - very long, stable cash flow for generations long) maintenance contract,
and you’re in the ballpark.</p><p>This is the little slice of computing heaven I currently live within. In a lot
of ways it feels like what I imagine employed hackers of old in the 90s were up
to. You can’t feed your data into Grafana, but you <em>can</em> <code>tail -f /var/log/syslog</code>
and make
a tidy profit off of your long-gestating Bash/Perl scripting skills.
You probably can’t <code>terraform destroy &amp;&amp; terraform apply</code>, but when was the
last time you saw immutable infrastructure done right anyway? Et cetera,
et similia.</p><p>Hey, you know what’s really dangerous over the 15 to 30 year lifespan of an
average B2B computer appliance? <em>Forgetting stuff.</em> Everyone can feel their
way around Debian 12, 11, maybe even 10 – but how do you debug a service that
is running all the way back on Debian <em>4</em>? Let’s not even get into the horrors
of Windows XP-based appliances, which power more of the world than you want
to know.</p><p>If only there were a freely-usable set of Unix-like operating systems, with an
emphasis on keeping things very, very stable over releases, even more stable
than Debian does. Enter <strong>the BSDs</strong>. Free, Open, Net, take your pick. All of
them take a “don’t fix it if it ain’t broken” approach to things, which means
someone who started slinging NetBSD installs back in 2007 can probably spin up
a well-manicured VM of that 2007 install and reliably make their way around
the system, even today, in 2024.</p><p>I’ve recently
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/i-m-turning-30-so-i-m-switching-to-openbsd/">taken to learning OpenBSD</a>
for this very reason. And for reasons of security: While having the box not
physically connected to the Internet creates an activation energy to doing
something nasty with them that
99.9% of
ne’er-do-wells will ignore, the remaining 0.1% are likely to be
<em>really motivated</em> to want to do this. If they run into OpenBSD, however, their
efforts are quite likely to be thwarted just because the blowfish is so darn
spiky.</p></div></div>
