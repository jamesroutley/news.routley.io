      <p>Since the recent US strikes, there are whispers from inside Iran that the country will close the strategic Hormuz Strait - although nothing is concrete yet.</p><p>The strait is located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran, and is considered the world&#39;s most vital oil transit choke point.</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, when asked today if the country will close the strait, said there are &#34;various options&#34; on the table.</p><p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has speedboats that could be used to blockade the strait. Its closure could lead to significant delays in the supply of oil needed by global markets, with a rise in oil prices.</p><p>Around a fifth of the planet&#39;s crude oil goes through the strait, which is only 40km wide at its narrowest point.</p><p>Several countries could be impacted, including the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait, but the impact is not limited to them.</p><p>China, India, Japan, and South Korea are among the top importers of crude oil that passes along it. Beijing is highly unlikely to welcome any rise in oil prices or disruptions to shipping routes.</p><p>And of course, by closing one of its major export routes, Iran itself would lose out. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio today said it would be “economic suicide”.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Strait of Hormuz" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/4df480e4-4de8-443d-b46f-5e890b4adbef.png.webp 800w" width="1280" height="1474"/></span></p></figure>

      <p>A senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, says &#34;there will no longer be any place for the presence of the United States and its bases&#34; in the region in the wake of US strikes, according to the IRNA news agency. </p><p>Ali Akbar Velayati adds other countries &#34;will become legitimate targets&#34; for Iran if they facilitate the US&#39;s actions. </p><p>Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) also says in a statement following the US attacks that Iran has &#34;identified the location from which the aggression took place&#34;, according to the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim news agency. </p><p>The scale of US military bases in the region is &#34;not a strength&#34; but it &#34;increases their vulnerability&#34;, they add. </p><p>In the region, the US maintains military bases in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Syria.</p><p>Iran has directly attacked a US base in the region before. In 2020, Iran carried out a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51028954">ballistic missile attack on air bases housing US forces in Iraq</a>, in retaliation for the US killing of General Qasem Soleimani who was the commander of the IRGC&#39;s extraterritorial arm, the Quds force.</p>

      The US hit three sites in Iran - <b>Fordo</b>,<b> </b>a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside, <b>Natanz</b> and <b>Isfahan</b>

      Israeli officials say they were in <b>&#34;full co-ordination&#34;</b> with the US in planning these strikes

      The <b>US contacted Iran through diplomatic channels on Saturday</b> to say the air strikes were all it intended to do - later, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were not about regime change
