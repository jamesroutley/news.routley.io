      <p>Currently, most markets are closed for the weekend, with the exception of cryptocurrencies, which have shown little reaction. Bitcoin has remained stable.</p><p>Most stock markets in the Middle East were trading higher on Sunday despite concern surrounding the escalating tension in the region and its impact on trading.</p><p>Brent crude oil is set to reopen for trading tonight. It had climbed earlier in the year during the initial stages of the Israel-Iran conflict, closing on Friday at around $77 per barrel. That’s up from around $65 before the conflict - a roughly 10% increase. </p><p>However, it&#39;s worth noting that oil has traded within this range for much of the past year.</p><p>For context, during the spring of 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, oil prices spiked significantly higher, reaching $112 per barrel. This highlights how current levels, while elevated, are not unprecedented.</p>

Here&#39;s a recap of the key lines:</p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Hegseth said the US &#34;conducted a precision strike in the middle of the night against three nuclear facilities in Iran, Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      &#34;We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it&#39;s worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people,&#34; Hegseth added
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      &#34;This mission was not, and has not, been about regime change,&#34; Hegseth added
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      On the details of the operation, Caine said the bombers set off from the US, with some heading west into the Pacific as a &#34;decoy&#34;
    </li></ul><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Caine said around 75 &#34;precision guided weapons&#34; were used, including 14 &#34;Massive Ordnance Penetrators&#34; - also known as &#34;bunker busters&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Hegseth said no shots were fired at the US during the operation, adding that the bombers were on their way back to the US
