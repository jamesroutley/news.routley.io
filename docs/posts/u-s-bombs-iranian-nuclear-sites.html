      <p>The Iranian public are expressing their mixed feelings about the US strikes on Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities.</p><p>Although the internet is still patchy across the country following the nationwide blocks, some have managed to bypass the restrictions and voice their fear, anger and hope about the attack.</p><p>Some have told BBC Persian that they hope for de-escalation and a better future for Iran, while others vent their frustration about uncertainty and the fear of further escalation.</p><p>Shahla, not her real name, said: &#34;My days and nights are the same. I feel paralysed, I just stare at the ceiling all day and all night.

On the other hand, this is so upsetting because the Iran&#39;s war is among three people - three leaders and their egos.&#34;</p><p>Homayoun from the northern city of Maku said: &#34;Although our lives have become more difficult and our problems have worsened, we stand by our country till the end.&#34;</p>
