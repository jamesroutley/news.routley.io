      <p>Hegseth is asked to address US veterans&#39; concerns about the US potentially becoming involved in &#34;another open-ended war in the Middle East over weapons of mass destruction&#34;.</p><p>The defence secretary says: &#34;this is most certainly not open ended.&#34; He adds that President Trump has provided him with a &#34;powerful and clear&#34; mission on the destruction of Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s what the Iranian regime needs to understand,&#34; he says. &#34;As the president put out last night, he wants peace, there needs to be a negotiated settlement here.&#34;</p>

      <p>Hegseth is asked to clarify about the damage assessment, and what his next step would be if Iran or militias under Iranian influence attack US interests in the region.</p><p>The damage assessment is ongoing, but the initial assessment is that &#34;all of our precision munitions struck where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect&#34;, Hegseth answers. </p><p>He again says the US believes it has destroyed capabilities in Fordo, which was their main target.</p>

      <p>Hegseth is now asked if there was a particular moment when Donald Trump decided to &#34;pull the trigger&#34;.</p><p>He responds, asserting that Trump was &#34;fully committed to the peace process&#34; and he wanted a negotiated outcome.</p><p>However, Hegseth says he &#34;gave Iran every opportunity and was met by stonewalling&#34;.</p><p>He adds that there was &#34;no particular moment for Trump, but there was a moment where he realised there was a time when action needed to be taken to minimise the threat&#34;.</p><p>As a reminder, the White House said on Thursday that President Trump would decide whether the US would get involved in the Iran-Israel conflict &#34;within two weeks&#34;.</p>
