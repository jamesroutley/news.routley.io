      <p>Donald Trump has just posted a long message on Truth Social, taking aim at Republican Congressman Thomas Massie - who criticised the US strikes on Iran as not &#34;constitutional&#34;.</p><p>Trump writes: &#34;We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the &#39;bomb&#39; right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!) but, as usual, and despite all of the praise and accolades received, this &#39;lightweight&#39; Congressman is against what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran.&#34;</p><p>The president concludes: &#34;MAGA is not about lazy, grandstanding, nonproductive politicians, of which Thomas Massie is definitely one. </p><p>&#34;Thank you to our incredible military for the AMAZING job they did last night. It was really SPECIAL!!!&#34;</p>

It had climbed earlier in the year during the initial stages of the Israel-Iran conflict, closing on Friday at around $77 per barrel. That’s up from around $65 before the conflict - a roughly 10% increase. </p><p>However, it&#39;s worth noting that oil has traded within this range for much of the past year.</p><p>For context, during the spring of 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, oil prices spiked significantly higher, reaching $112 per barrel. This highlights how current levels, while elevated, are not unprecedented.</p>
