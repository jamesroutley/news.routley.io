forms, or isotopes - and separates it into the type of uranium that’s used
for nuclear reactors and bombs.</p><p>But dropping a bomb on properly stored stockpiles of
enriched uranium does not mean a “nuclear incident” on the same scale as
disasters that occurred at nuclear power plants in Fukushima or Chernobyl.</p><p>“Highly enriched uranium is about three times more
radioactive than non-enriched uranium. But in fact, on the scale of things,
neither of them are particularly densely radioactive,&#34; explains Prof Jim Smith, from the
University of Portsmouth, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl
disaster.</p><p>&#34;It wouldn’t cause a major environmental contamination problem.&#34;</p><p>Smith says he&#39;s more concerned about &#34;fission
products&#34; - &#34;the things that uranium splits up to when it&#39;s in a reactor or in a bomb&#34;.</p><p>But because no nuclear reaction is taking place at the
enrichment sites -  and a blast from a bomb would not trigger one - these
dangerous radioactive &#34;fission products&#34; would not be present, he says.</p><p>Uranium radiation also does not travel far - making any risk
more of a local problem. For people close to the site, breathing
in uranium particles could cause longer term health problems.</p><p>Some of the substances used in uranium enrichment are also
chemically hazardous – but would only contaminate the immediate area. </p><p>The UN’s nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ckg3rzj8emjt?post=asset%3A966d6545-1dfb-4192-8d89-9507474e4082#post">said earlier there had been &#34;no increase in off-site radiation levels&#34;</a> reported after the US struck three nuclear sites in Iran. But said
it would provide further assessments as more information became available. </p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykjvl1y9jo">Read more on the risks of bombing Iranian nuclear sites. </a></p>
