Here&#39;s a quick recap of the main developments in the past few hours:</p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      The US says it carried out strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran: Natanz, Isfahan and Fordo - the latter is believed to be the most difficult and prized target
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      In a televised address to the nation, Trump hailed the operation as a &#34;spectacular military success&#34;, warning Tehran to quickly make peace or face &#34;far greater&#34; attacks
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The US reportedly used heavy bunker-busting bombs dropped from B-2 strategic stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles - details could be announced at a Pentagon briefing later on Sunday
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Iran&#39;s state media admit part of the Fordo site was &#34;attacked by enemy strikes&#34;, but it is downplaying the extent of the damage
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Tehran earlier warned it would target American interests in the Middle East in retaliation for any US attack - so far it has fired missiles at Israel, with blasts heard over Jerusalem
    </li></ul><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Israel welcomes the US involvement, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying the &#34;bold decision&#34; will &#34;change the course of history&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      In the US, there was a mixed reaction from lawmakers roughly along party lines - with Republicans commending Trump, and Democrats warning that America is being dragged into another &#34;open-ended&#34; war

      <p>Bluff. It is a word repeated a lot since I started watching Iran’s
state TV a few hours ago to see their reaction to the US attacks on its nuclear
sites.</p><p>A presenter on state TV said Donald Trump is “bluffing” about
destroying Fordo nuclear site, adding that “only two tunnels at the entrance
and exit of Fordo have been damaged”.</p><p>Iranian official media began downplaying the attacks early on,
calling them “unverified reports”.</p><p>Morteza Heydari, spokesperson for Qom province crisis management,
who had confirmed the attack on “a part” of Fordo, was quick to say afterwards
that the whole province was “entirely calm”.</p><p>Iranian outlets also tried to downplay by saying the explosions
were “not that loud”.</p><p>At the same time, Iran has limited access to the internet,
citing “enemy cyberattacks” as the reason. This has led to a drop in videos and photos sent to the BBC and
shared on social media, meaning we have to rely more on videos by Iranian
outlets and state media and their narratives.</p>

      <p>When
Israel hit Iran last Thursday week, Donald Trump’s Secretary of State and
National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio, immediately distanced the US from the
action, calling it “unilateral” on Israel’s part.</p><p>Fast
forward to now, and America is a combatant.</p><p>The
president hopes this is a ‘one and done’ action, as Americans like to put it,
but the one thing that is out of his hands is how Iran responds.</p><p>He
is urging Iran to make peace – warning that future attacks would be “far worse
and a lot easier”.</p><p>Does
that mean he’s prepared to go as far as regime change? That would certainly be
counter to his promise to avoid taking the US into foreign wars and could cause
a significant domestic backlash among many of his supporters.</p><p>US
presidents often come into office vowing to focus on their agenda at home – and
many have ended up getting drawn into international hotspots and wars. Is the
same happening to the most isolationist president in living memory?</p>
