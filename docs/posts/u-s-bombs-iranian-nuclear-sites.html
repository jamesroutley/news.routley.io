      <p>That Pentagon briefing flooded the zone with facts. </p><p>There was plenty for military analysts to pore over, but one line stood out: we heard twice that the battle damage assessment is still ongoing.</p><p>That’s to be expected, but it also sits awkwardly alongside President Trump’s bold claim that Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities have been “completely and totally obliterated”.</p><p>How do you know if you&#39;re still assessing it?</p><p>The rhetoric was strong, but the evidence was thin or non-existent. </p><p>While we got maps of the bomber routes, there was no imagery of the nuclear sites themselves, no hard proof to back up the claims <i>(the BBC has looked at satellite images </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ckg3rzj8emjt?post=asset%3Adee30aee-2e33-4f74-bc60-2a1632b1033b#post">showing the surface of the Fordo site here</a><i>).</i></p><p>So, for now, I think that the jury is very much still out on what was actually achieved.</p><p>Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance is also ramping up the messaging. He’s been on US networks warning Iran, suggesting its nuclear programme has been “pushed back by years”.</p><p>Expect that message to be hammered home throughout the day, as the president’s senior lieutenants line up to appear on America’s Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

      Hegseth said the US &#34;conducted a precision strike in the middle of the night against three nuclear facilities in Iran, Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      &#34;We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it&#39;s worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people,&#34; Hegseth added
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      &#34;This mission was not, and has not, been about regime change,&#34; Hegseth added
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      On the details of the operation, Caine said the bombers set off from the US, with some heading west into the Pacific as a &#34;decoy&#34;
    </li></ul><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Caine said around 75 &#34;precision guided weapons&#34; were used, including 14 &#34;Massive Ordnance Penetrators&#34; - also known as &#34;bunker busters&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Hegseth said no shots were fired at the US during the operation, adding that the bombers were on their way back to the US
