      <p>Global oil prices are expected to rise when energy
markets start trading on Monday morning in Asia.</p><p>“The US attacks have pushed the conflict to a new level
and many fear it will only make a bad situation worse,” Dr Carole Nakhle, chief
executive of Crystol Energy tells the BBC.</p><p>“That fear will be reflected in a higher geopolitical
premium added to oil prices - no one knows how much that accounts for, but as a
rule of thumb the bigger the fear, the bigger the premium,” she adds.</p><p>Brent crude ended the trading week on Friday at $77.01 a
barrel after gaining almost 20% in the last month.</p><p>Despite those gains, oil prices are still currently lower
than where they were at the same point last year.</p><p>The cost of crude oil affects everything from how much it
costs to fill up your car to the price of food at the supermarket.</p>
