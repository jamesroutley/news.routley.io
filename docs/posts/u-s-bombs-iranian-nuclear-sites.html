      <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is feeling vindicated. </p><p>From his 1995 book, Fighting Terrorism, to his famous speech at the United Nations Security Council in 2012, when he displayed the illustration of a bomb to explain how close, in his view, Iran was to obtaining a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu has long told the world Iran must be stopped. </p><p><i>Will Israel stop attacking Iran now? </i></p><p>Israeli military officials have repeatedly warned that this could be a prolonged campaign, and they have celebrated what they see as an extremely successful operation so far. They may see little reason to stop before inflicting even more damage.</p><p>Meanwhile, more and more Israeli officials, Netanyahu included, have hinted at regime change in Iran. </p><p>The hope seems to be that the bombing campaign will lead to a movement against the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, toppling the Islamic Republic that has been in power since the revolution of 1979.</p><p>Which puts Iran on survival mode. The country has repeatedly rejected any deal that would see it giving up enriching uranium on its soil, a key US demand, saying it is its right. </p><p>In their weakest position in nearly five decades, Iran’s leaders will be under international pressure to accept an agreement, that will inevitably try to prevent any resumption of nuclear activities. </p><p>The alternative is more conflict, which could lead to the end of Khamenei’s rule and an uncertain future for the country.</p>
