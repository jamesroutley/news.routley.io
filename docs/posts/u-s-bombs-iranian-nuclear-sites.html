      <p>In a dramatic
move, the US has joined Israel in its attacks on Iran, carrying out large-scale
strikes on three key nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, with
President Trump saying they were “completely and totally obliterated”. </p><p>He
warned Iran that it “must now make peace”, otherwise “future attacks would be
far greater and a lot easier”.</p><p><i>What happens
next?</i></p><p>Iran and its proxies had threatened to target US interests in the region
in response to any direct American involvement in the conflict. </p><p>Its military
capabilities, however, are significantly damaged after nine days of attacks,
and the groups it supports, part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, have also
been weakened. </p><p>Any retaliation could lead to more US attacks, as President
Trump left the door open for further action: “Remember there are many targets
left”.</p>

      <p>Iran must now choose between
three strategic courses of action in response to the US attack overnight. </p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      <b>Do
     nothing</b>. This could spare it from further US attacks. It could even choose
     the diplomatic route and rejoin negotiations with the US. But doing
     nothing makes the Iranian regime look weak, especially after all its
     warnings of dire repercussions if the US did attack. It may decide the
     risk of weakening its grip on its population outweighs the cost of further
     US attacks.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      <b>Retaliate
     hard and fast.</b> Iran still has a substantial arsenal of ballistic missiles
     after manufacturing and hiding these away for years. It has a target list
     of around 20 US bases to choose from in the broader Middle East. It could
     also launch ‘swarm attacks’ on US Navy warships using drones and fast
     torpedo boats.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      <b>Retaliate
     later at a time of its own choosing.</b> This would mean waiting until the
     current tension has subsided and launching a surprise attack when US bases
     were no longer on maximum alert.

      <p>Bluff. It is a word repeated a lot since I started watching Iran’s
state TV a few hours ago to see their reaction to the US attacks on its nuclear
sites.</p><p>A presenter on state TV said Donald Trump is “bluffing” about
destroying Fordo nuclear site, adding that “only two tunnels at the entrance
and exit of Fordo have been damaged”.</p><p>Iranian official media began downplaying the attacks early on,
calling them “unverified reports”.</p><p>Morteza Heydari, spokesperson for Qom province crisis management,
who had confirmed the attack on “a part” of Fordo, was quick to say afterwards
that the whole province was “entirely calm”.</p><p>Iranian outlets also tried to downplay by saying the explosions
were “not that loud”.</p><p>At the same time, Iran has limited access to the internet,
citing “enemy cyberattacks” as the reason. This has led to a drop in videos and photos sent to the BBC and
shared on social media, meaning we have to rely more on videos by Iranian
outlets and state media and their narratives.</p>
