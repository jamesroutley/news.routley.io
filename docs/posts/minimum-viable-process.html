    <h1>Minimum viable process</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" role="main">  <h2> The software you build is a supporting component for a more efficient process. </h2> <h2 id="your-product-is-more-than-the-tech"> <a href="#your-product-is-more-than-the-tech" aria-labelledby="your-product-is-more-than-the-tech"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Your product is more than the tech </h2> <p>New founders often misunderstand product development. They equate the software they built with the entirety of their product.</p> <p>But a startup’s product is very rarely the technology itself.</p> <p>It’s a software-optimized evolution of an entire existing process.</p> <h2 id="minimum-viable-processes"> <a href="#minimum-viable-processes" aria-labelledby="minimum-viable-processes"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Minimum viable processes </h2> <p>The real work of building a startup, particularly a marketplace, lies in figuring out what to do and in what order, i.e. the process.</p> <p>That’s what <em>Do Things That Don’t Scale</em> means – first figure out the process manually, and only then automate away as much as possible to scale.</p> <p>Developing your processes must also follow the familiar principles of building software.</p> <p>You need to build your processes.</p> <p>You need to measure your processes.</p> <p>You need to learn and iterate on your processes.</p> <p>You need to release updates to your processes early and often.</p> <p>The intermediate steps of your processes need to be usable.</p> <h2 id="because-thats-where-most-of-your-value-is"> <a href="#because-thats-where-most-of-your-value-is" aria-labelledby="because-thats-where-most-of-your-value-is"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Because that’s where most of your value is </h2> <p>Supplybunny’s product isn’t the platform – it’s tail-end sales. The platform is a tool to accomplish that more effectively and efficiently than others.</p> <p>The processes we’ve developed include supplier onboarding, customer service, advertising, customer care, etc. Only after we were reasonably sure of a version of a process did we implement it in software.</p> <p>If someone tried to copy Supplybunny, and copied only the software, they’d end up with just a third of a business.</p> <p>And that’s true not only for most other marketplaces but startups as well.</p>    <h4> Further reading </h4> <!--small class="text-muted">Books might be affiliate links.</small--> <ul> <li> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Things That Don&#39;t Scale</a> </li> </ul> </div></div>
