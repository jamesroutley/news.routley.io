    <h1>Ask HN: What runs L4-related microkernels/hypervisors these days?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been learning about the L4 microkernel, and am thinking about doing something related to it for a research project.  I&#39;m especially curious about more recent examples of specific devices that run L4 variants (seL4, PikeOS, OKL4, etc.).  I already found a few that use seL4, but to take OKL4 as an example, most of the specific devices I could find are from more than a decade ago, and I&#39;m trying to find things from at least the last 5 or 6 years.  I&#39;m even more curious to find devices that use a form of L4 as a hypervisor.</p><p>Has anyone here worked on a device that used an L4-related kernel or hypervisor?  I know one major area they&#39;re used in is defense and full of NDAs, but hopefully some of the other industries they&#39;re used in (medical devices, automotive, IoT) are a little less restrictive.  Thanks in advance!</p></div></div></div>
