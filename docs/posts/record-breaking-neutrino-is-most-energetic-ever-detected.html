The particle — which probably came from a distant galaxy — was spotted by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), a collection of light-detecting glass spheres on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, on 13 February 2023. Researchers monitoring the telescope did not notice the detection until early 2024, when they completed the first analysis of their data. They <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02074-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02074-5" data-track-category="body text link">unveiled it as a potentially record event last year</a> at a conference in Milan, Italy, but did not disclose details such as the timing, direction or energy of the neutrino.</p><p>“We had to convince ourselves that it wasn’t something strange or weird with the telescope,” says Paschal Coyle, a neutrino physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France and KM3NeT spokesperson. The result was published on 12 February in <i>Nature</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, and will be described in four preprints due to be posted on the arXiv preprint server.</p><h2>High-energy neutrinos</h2><p>Neutrinos are electrically neutral particles more than one million times lighter than an electron. They are typically produced in nuclear reactions such as those at the centre of the Sun, from which they emerge with energies on the order of millions of electronvolts (10<sup>6</sup> eV). But for more than 10 years, researchers have been recording neutrinos carrying unprecedented energies of up to several quadrillion electronvolts (10<sup>15</sup> eV, or 1 petaelectronvolt), which are thought to originate in distant galaxies. (The most energetic particle ever detected, at 320,000 PeV, was not a neutrino but a cosmic ray dubbed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03677-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03677-0" data-track-category="body text link">the Oh-My-God particle</a>.)</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02074-5" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00444-1/d41586-025-00444-1_50617414.jpg"/><p>‘Fantastic’ particle could be most energetic neutrino ever detected</p></a></article><p>KM3NeT consists of strings of sensitive light detectors anchored to the sea floor at a depth of around 3,500 metres off the coast of the Italian island of Sicily, as well as in a second, smaller array near Toulon, France. These sensors pick up light emitted by high-energy, electrically charged particles such as muons. Muons are continuously raining down on Earth’s surface, because they are produced when cosmic rays hit air molecules. But occasionally, a cosmic neutrino that smashes into the planet’s surface also produces a muon.</p><p>In the February 2023 event detected by the Sicily observatory, the team estimated that the muon carried 120 PeV of energy, on the basis of the unusual amount of light it produced. The particle’s path was close to horizontal with respect to Earth’s surface and travelled eastwards, towards Greece.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00444-1/d41586-025-00444-1_50625836.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00444-1/d41586-025-00444-1_50625836.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"/><img alt="SEA-FLOOR SENSORS.
