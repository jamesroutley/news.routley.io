    <h1>British Columbia to recriminalize use of drugs in public spaces</h1>

Health Minister Adrian Dix said the province is also introducing specific measures aimed at curbing illicit drug use in health care facilities — including the prohibition of street drug possession or use.</p><p>&#34;We are taking immediate action to make hospitals safer and ensuring policies are consistent and strictly enforced through additional security, public communication and staff supports,&#34; Dix said in a statement.</p><p>&#34;The action plan launching today will improve how patients with addictions are supported while they need hospital care, while preventing others from being exposed to the secondhand effects of illicit drug use.&#34;</p><p>The province said it is working with police to come up with guidance to ensure that people who merely possess drugs are not arrested unless they&#39;re threatening public safety or causing a disturbance.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A white woman wearing a police uniform looks at the camera." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6952381.1693435453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/vancouver-police-department-deputy-chief-const-fiona-wilson.jpg" data-cy="image-img"/></p><figcaption>VPD Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Wilson told a parliamentary committee on health the limit on police powers to address the public consumption of illicit drugs is affecting public safety.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Vancouver Police Deputy Chief Fiona Wilson said at the announcement that decriminalization has to be part of a broader strategy to address the province&#39;s drug crisis.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve heard loud and clear from the front-line police officers who continue to see the unintended ramifications that unchecked public drug use has on the safety and well-being of neighbourhoods,&#34; she said.</p><p>&#34;And the feedback has been unequivocal — public consumption is a significant issue that needs to be addressed and major changes are required.&#34;</p><h2>14,000 lives lost</h2><p>The decriminalization pilot was introduced in January 2023 and allows adult drug users in B.C. to carry up to 2.5 grams of opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy for personal use without facing criminal charges.</p><p>Relying on an exemption granted by Health Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, it also allows for open drug use in some public spaces.</p><p>The pilot is part of a government response to the public health emergency declared eight years ago due to a rise in deaths from toxic, illicit drugs. </p><p>More than 14,000 people have died since the emergency was declared in 2016, largely due to the opioid fentanyl.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A white sign at a New West Naloxone training event that says &#34;I love someone who uses drugs&#34; but the love is represented by a purple heart.

Premier David Eby says he shares public safety concerns that have been raised by police and city councillors from multiple municipalities. Jess Lamb, co-founder of the East Kootenay Network of People Who Use Drugs, and Alexa Loo, a city councillor in Richmond, B.C., give their thoughts on whether the pilot should continue.</span></span></span></p><p>Eby says he expects the changes to go through this time because he is asking them to come from Health Canada.</p><p>&#34;The resolution of that court issue is potentially more than a year down the road and we cannot afford to wait. We need to act now,&#34; Eby said. </p><p>&#34;I have talked to the prime minister about this. He assures me that the federal government will provide full support to ensure that police have the tools that they need.&#34;</p><p>Eby said it&#39;s possible the government could face another legal challenge in response to these changes, but he thinks the risk is low.</p><p>&#34;In order for it to be successful, the court would have to find that the entire Controlled Drugs and Substances Act at the federal level was unconstitutional,&#34; he said.</p><p>Eby said criminalizing drug use costs lives and taxpayer money while not making the public safer, but &#34;police do need the tools to address extraordinary circumstances where people are compromising public safety through their drug use.&#34;</p><h2>Election looms</h2><p>Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim said in a statement that he welcomed the change. </p><p>&#34;Today&#39;s changes will make public drug use effectively illegal and provide the VPD with actual tools to maintain public safety. This change aligns with the critical work we have already undertaken with the federal and provincial governments to address open drug use in public areas, especially around playgrounds, splash pads, beaches, and sports fields.&#34;</p><p>The premier said the issue has been intensely politicized as the province heads into an election.</p><p>British Columbians go to the polls on Oct. 19. </p><p>Opposition B.C. United Leader Kevin Falcon and his critic for mental health and addiction Elenore Sturko issued a joint statement calling the government&#39;s move a &#34;desperate attempt to salvage a failing policy.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Instead of upholding their commitments to scrap the decriminalization pilot when it clearly wasn&#39;t meeting its goals, David Eby and the NDP have stubbornly persisted with this dangerous policy,&#34; the statement says.</p><p>&#34;From its inception, the decriminalization experiment has failed to connect drug users with any necessary treatment or recovery services.&#34;</p><p>B.C. Conservative Leader John Rustad said in an interview that &#34;decriminalization has been an utter failure in this province.&#34;</p><p>&#34;This should have never happened in the province of British Columbia,&#34; he said.</p><p>In a statement posted online, B.C. Green Party Leader Sonia Furstenau expressed concerns about the increase in arrests that could be associated with the policy, writing, &#34;Police discretion is especially likely to stigmatize Indigenous and racialized British Columbians.&#34;</p><p>&#34;This issue is intrinsically linked to the housing and affordability crisis. Rolling back decriminalization isn&#39;t going to fix that. No jurisdiction in the world has arrested their way out of this problem, and we won&#39;t either.&#34;</p></div></div>
