                <em>Evennia</em> is an open-source Python-based framework, codebase and server for creating text-based multiplayer online games (aka MUD/MU* etc) using modern technologies and tools.</p>

                            </a>Installation</h2>
                                Evennia requires Python 3.10+.
                                <p><code>
                                        pip install evennia
                                    </code>
                                </p>
                                The <a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Setup/Setup-Overview.html">Installation</a> instructions gives a lot more help. Once installed, creating your new game
                                is quick:<p><code>    evennia --init mygame</code>
                                </p>You can now browse your new game&#39;s website and play locally in your browser at <code>http://localhost:4001</code>. You can also connect to it with a traditional third-party MUD client on <code>localhost, port 4000</code> (use <code>127.0.0.1</code> instead of <code>localhost</code> if your OS doesn&#39;t understand the latter).

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>A toolbox and framework:</strong> Evennia is intended for game developers    who want to make a game uniquely theirs. But it&#39;s also easy enough to be a    popular tool for quick game prototyping and for those who want an    educational project for learning Python.   </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Game agnostic:</strong> Evennia does not prescribe a genre, game    rules, skills, classes, combat system or other things that will be specific    for your game anyway.   </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Optionally a little less unique:</strong> We have a growing library of    commonly needed code-snippets and bigger game systems that you can choose to     build from, copy or be inspired by.   </li><li>
                                            <strong>What we do:</strong> Evennia takes care of all the gritty    networking, database-handling and other boring details that all online    games need. The idea is to allow you, the game developer, to focus on    designing your game&#39;s systems and content.  </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Modern workflow:</strong> Coding in Evennia is primarily done by    normal Python modules and classes, making the codebase extremely flexible -    you don&#39;t tweak the library itself, you just override the defaults and tell    Evennia where to find your changes. For experienced developers, not relying    on some custom in-game scripting language means you can use modern    development tools, version control and workflows.  </li>
                                        <strong>A lot of help:</strong> Evennia&#39;s code is heavily documented should    you want to dive in. We have also spent a lot of time on our <a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/index.html">extensive documentation</a>. Finally, our  active and friendly developer community is always there to help you if you  get stuck!

                                    <p>Whereas your Evennia game starts out with no game-specific content, it&#39;s notempty! Out of the box you get a &#39;talker&#39;-style game with basic functionality:You can create rooms and items, pick up stuff, talk to people, walk around, dolight roleplay with emotes ... this starting point is easy to extend orcompletely replace as you prefer.</p>
                                    <p>Here are some of the default resources and tools available out of the box:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Classes for persistent objects, exits, rooms and characters.</li>
                                        <li>Separation between character and their accounts (multi-character play, if desired).</li>
                                        <li>In-game channels and chats (including linking to external chat channels).  </li><li>Some 90 commands for administration, building, chatting, basic roleplay etc.</li>
                                            <li>Available commands and even their function can vary with circumstance and game state.</li>
                                            <li>Delays, tickers, timers (fully asynchronous, no threading so no risk of race conditions).</li>
