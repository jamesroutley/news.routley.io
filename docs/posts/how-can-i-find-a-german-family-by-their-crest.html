    <h1>Ask HN: How can I find a German family by their crest?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I just inherited a ring that has been passed down in my family since WWI. My great grandfather (who was a scoundrel) took a brooch off of a dead German officer in 1915 in Belgium. He had it converted into a ring.</p><p>In 1931, my great grandfather coincidentally met the brother of the dead officer. The brother saw the ring and said, &#34;That looks remarkably like a brooch that has been in my family in Bavaria for a long time.&#34;</p><p>I&#39;m not actually sure if it&#39;s a crest, now that I write this. And it&#39;s pretty small. If possible, I&#39;d love to figure out how to get it back to that family, but I have no idea where to begin.</p></div></div></div>
