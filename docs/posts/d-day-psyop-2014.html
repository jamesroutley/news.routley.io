    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><strong>Every time the military goes to war there are numerous D-Days and H-Hours.
  These are routine identifications of the day and time of an attack. Yet, to most Americans
  alive today, when they hear ‚ÄúD-Day‚Äù they think of 6 June 1944 when joint Allied
  forces invaded Nazi-occupied France.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The Normandy landings were codenamed <i>Operation Neptune</i> and were part of
  the Allied invasion called <i>Operation Overlord</i>. This was the greatest seaborne
  invasion in history. 5000 vessels transported over 150,000 men and nearly 30,000 vehicles
  across the English Channel to the target beaches in France. Six parachute regiments with
  over 13,000 men were flown from nine British airfields in over 800 planes. 11,000 planes,
  and nearly three million soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors was assembled in England
  for the assault. At the same time, more than 300 planes dropped 13,000 bombs over Normandy
  in advance of the invasion. The 50-mile stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into
  five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword Beach. The men landed under heavy fire
  from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with
  obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The Longest Day</strong></p>
  <p><strong>There are dozens of movies with ‚ÄúD-Day‚Äù in their title. Probably the
  best known is ‚ÄúThe Longest Day, released in 1962 and starring John Wayne and a host
  of other stars in various cameo roles. There are probably hundreds of books with
  ‚ÄúD-Day in their title. I note that Amazon.com has at least 20 pages of such books for
  sale.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In this article we will not tell of battles won and lost or ground taken and
  death on the battlefield. We will just mention some of the propaganda paper produced by
  the Allied and the enemy specifically for the invasion. There are literally thousands of
  different leaflets dropped during WWII; their total numbers somewhere in the billions. We
  will just look at those that were specifically prepared for, or mention the invasion. The
  reader should understand that I could depict dozens of paper products here. I will just
  show a few to give a general impression of what was being prepared and disseminated at the
  time.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>General Eisenhower‚Äôs Letter to his Troops</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Before the invasion, General Dwight D. Eisenhower told his troops in part:</strong></p>
  <p><i><strong>Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary
  Force!</strong></i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><i>You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven
    these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty
    loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and
    brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war
    machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and
    security for ourselves in a free world.</i></strong></p>
    <p><strong><i>Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped
    and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely‚Ä¶</i> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>‚Ä¶<i>The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together
    to Victory! I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle.
    We will accept nothing less than full Victory!</i></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><strong>Good Luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great
    and noble undertaking.</strong></i></p>

    <p><strong>CENTRAL BASE SECTION - S.O.S., ETO U.S.A </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>There was a time when I saw hundreds of these letters so they were obviously
  prepared in great numbers. Some had a raised stamp at the top or bottom, almost like a
  corporation seal. The seal said:</strong></p>
  <p><b><i>CENTRAL BASE SECTION - S.O.S., ETO U.S.A.</i></b></p>
  <p><b>The mission assigned Central Base Section was to provide all of the supplies and
  services for all American Army units in London which included the U. S. Army Forces in the
  British Isles, the European Theater of Operations U. S. Army, the Headquarters, Allied
  Force for North Africa, and the Headquarters Services of Supply, and Headquarters, 1st
  Army Group (later 12th A. G.). The ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù is Service of Supply.‚Äù The
  ‚ÄúETO USA‚Äù is ‚ÄúU.S. Army, European Theater of Operations.‚Äù </b><strong>I
  always thought those with the seal were the rarest and most interesting.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Eisenhower‚Äôs Accepts Responsibility for defeat.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>General Dwight D. Eisenhower knew that the D-Day landing could easily be pushed
  back into the sea. He prepared a letter in advance where he acknowledged the blame was his
  should the invasion fail. The paper said:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><i>Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory
    foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was
    based upon the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that
    Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is
    mine alone.</i></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>This is a wonderful note and shows the true inner strength of General Eisenhower. In
  the event of failure he could have blamed the weather, his allies, or the Navy or Air
  Forces for landing troops at the wrong place. Instead, he accepts full responsibility. We
  do not see much of that responsibility by our leaders today. Note the date at the bottom
  of the paper. Do you think the general had much on his mind? He actually wrote ‚ÄúJuly
  5‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúJune 5.‚Äù His mind was whirling and he was full of confidence
  and dread and apprehension. This is a true look into the heart and mind of a great man
  carrying all the worries of the world on his back.</b></p>

  <p><b>The British Commander-in-Chief General Montgomery, a man who often fought with
  Eisenhower about how the war should be fought and thought he should have led the invasion,
  also wrote a letter to his troops. Notice that he quotes a poem from James Graham, 1st

  <p><b>An 8-page booklet printed for the Eve of Battle Dedication Service 1944 of the
  Second Army prior to D-Day. The cover displays the cross-within-shield of the Second Army
  and the sword within printed in silver. Printed by Second Army Headquarters, Portsmouth, 4
  June 1944. Inside the booklet are prayers and hymns of protection for the coming battle. I
  quote two of the Chaplain‚Äôs comments:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Lord, we desire to place ourselves and what we are about to undertake in thy

    the oppressed, to restore freedom in Europe, and to bring peace to the world...As we stand

    God all our powers, of body, mind and spirit, so that our great endeavor may be thoroughly
    finished.</i></b></p>

  <h2><b><u>Germany to their Troops</u></b></h2>
  <p><b>There were German letters as well. As usual, Hitler ordered his men to stand and
  die. This ‚Äútop secret‚Äù letter is from Commanding General Neumann of the German
  712th Division:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><b>The Fuhrer has personally telephoned and ordered that our present main line of
    defense must be held under all circumstances; a withdrawal of units even surrounded by the
    enemy is out of the question. Orders for a withdrawal from unknown officers are on no
    account to be obeyed.</b></i></p>
    <p><i><b>We can be destroyed in our positions, but we must not give ground. If the enemy
    breaks into our main line of defense at any point he must be thrown back again by an
    immediate counter-attack.</b></i></p>
    <p><i><b>This order is to be made known verbally to every man, as far as it is in any way
    possible. The written order is to be destroyed as soon as possible and must not be allowed
    to fall into the hands of the enemy. Formations and units will report when this order has
    been circulated and destroyed.</b></i></p>

  <h2><strong><u>Allied PSYOP to Occupied Europe</u></strong></h2>
  <p><b>In the latter months of the war the Office of War Information‚Äôs Intelligence
  and Leaflet Unit, Area III, produced a <i>Leaflet News Letter. </i>Some of the data on
  this subject is:</b></p>
  <p><b><i>Leaflet Operations by the 8th Air Force between D-Day and February
  1945.</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><b>In the period from D-Day to 1 February 1945, the 406th Squadron flew 1,133
    sorties and distributed approximately 701,040,000 leaflets. An additional 43,000,000
    leaflets were dropped on tactical targets by aircraft flying in bomber formations on the
    daylight close cooperation missions detailed below:</b></em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><em>Total daylight distribution by the Eighth Air Force for the period D-Day to 1
      February 1945, was 872,818,163 leaflets. The grand total distribution for this air force
      during this period was 1,573,858,163 leaflets. The effectiveness of this type of air
      cooperation has been proven by reports from all ground echelons and above all, by
      interrogation of thousands of enemy prisoners in whose surrender it has played a part</em><i>.</i></b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Caroline Reed discussed ‚ÄúD-Day Propaganda‚Äù in an article published in <i>History
  Today</i>, dated 6 June 1984:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><b>Scant attention is given in the official histories of Operation Overlord to the
    massive propaganda operation which accompanied the initial D-day landings and then
    announced their success to occupied Europe. Specially equipped bombers carrying several
    million leaflets were the first Allied aircraft, except for airborne troop transporters,
    to fly over the Normandy beaches on June 6th, 1944. Within two days of the invasion nine
    million leaflets had been dropped, bringing the news to friend and foe alike.</b></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>By early 1944 a &#39;Special Leaflet Squadron&#39;, the American 422nd, was established
    and supplied with unarmed B-17&#39;s, camouflaged and modified for night flying. It was this
    unit which was to precede the Allied bomber force into France, ironically as daylight
    dawned on D-Day morning, dropping warning leaflets for the civilian population and special
    instructions for transport workers.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The warning leaflets appear, from several accounts, to have emerged as something
    of an afterthought to the initial invasion plans. Originally, it had been intended that an
    announcement of the Allied landings, in the form of a &#39;proclamation&#39; from Eisenhower,
    would be dropped on the night of D-Day following their success. It was only after
    considerable pressure had been exerted by French representatives in London, through the
    British Premier, that SHAEF headquarters was persuaded of the necessity for prior
    leafleting of those areas which were to be the target for Allied air and naval
    bombardment. French statisticians and Churchill estimated that the &#39;softening up&#39; process
    of bombing transport and communications centers and coastal areas in use by the Wehrmacht
    could cost some 80,000 civilian lives.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>As Churchill emphasized in a letter to Eisenhower, written in early April 1944,
    &#39;post-war France must be our friend. It is not alone a question of humanitarianism, it is
    also a question of high state policy&#39;. Eisenhower in his Crusade in Europe, first
    published in 1948, maintains that the predictions were unrealistic and that adequate plans
    for warnings by radio and other means were already well in hand before the French protests
    had been received. General Robert McClure, Chief of the Psychological Warfare Division,
    however, confided to his colleagues Frank Kaufman and Richard Crossman that it was only
    because the British Foreign Office had been &#39;getting hell from the French&#39; that the
    original leafleting plan was changed. McClure was particularly concerned by the proposed
    new timing of the warning leaflet drop as maximum security required this to be a daylight
    operation, giving only some 30 minutes&#39; notice of the coming bombardments. He feared that
    all 422nd Squadron&#39;s new, defenseless, black-painted bombers, intended to play a major
    role in the liberation campaign, would be lost without their protective cover of darkness.
    This was an opinion shared by many of their crews and it was with considerable tension
    that take-off was made after a 2am briefing on June 6th. Long hours later, after the first
    radio reports of the landings had been broadcast, the squadron returned to great scenes of
    jubilation, its mission accomplished without an enemy plane seen.</i></b></p>

	  The Erdmann Thesis</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The PSYOP plan for the invasion according to James M. Erdmann‚Äôs PhD thesis <i>Leaflet
  Operations of the Second World War</i> was:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Just prior to the assault on the Normandy beaches‚Ä¶Allied planes were to
    saturate the villages and countryside inside the invasion perimeter with millions of
    warning leaflets telling the French civilians to evacuate immediately. Other millions of
    leaflets would be dropped by airplane on Holland, Belgium and Denmark, and the rest of
    France, to announce the invasion.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The September 1945 issue of <i>ARMY TALKS</i>, an Information and Education Division
  news magazine for Allied troops mentions D-Day propaganda:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The first allied air missions over the continent in the early hours of D-Day was
    that of the British 406th Squadron with leaflets warning French civilians of the bombings
    to come. The first phase of the invasion lasted from 6 June to 27 July. Leaflet themes
    during this period stressed the unmatchable weight of Allied arms; the pincer movements
    closing in on Germany from four separate fronts, the inability of the German war machine
    to protect the coast‚Ä¶</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>During the first week after D-Day, broadcast messages emphasized the tenseness
    and urgency of the touch-and-go operations. Radio messages were accompanied in the first
    seven days by the dropping of more than 20,000,000 leaflets‚Ä¶</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Researcher Lee Richards found a wartime Top Secret document to the Chiefs of Staff,
  SHAEF, outlining covert propaganda techniques being applied in support of Operation
  Overlord. It is entitled <i>REPORT ON SPECIAL OPERATIONS DURING ‚ÄúOVERLORD‚Äù </i>It
  is several pages in length so I will just mention a few highlights:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The media for covert propaganda during operation OVERLORD have been four: The
    combined radio program of news and music for the German Armed Forces known as
    Soldatensender Calais and Kurzwellensender Atlantik; The daily newspaper for the German
    troops in the West (Nachrichten fur die Truppe); The medium-wave program of talks for the
    opposition movement: And forged documents and subversive leaflets distributed in Germany
    and occupied countries by agents and by balloon.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The enemy appears to regard as most dangerous a handbook on methods of
    malingering which has been printed under various disguises. An order from the High Command
    warning against this document and expressing concern at the spread of malingering among
    the troops is in our possession.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>Aircraft distribution of the newspaper for the troops was begun a month before
    D-day and is thought to have played a part in misleading the enemy about our military
    intentions‚Ä¶.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><b><i>
	LEAFLET OPERATIONS IN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN THEATER </i>
	prepared by Major Robert H. Garet, adds:</b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b>
	<i>
	With the Allied landings on D-Day, the leaflet campaign became a closely 
	integrated part of the military operations. From D-Day on, although the Army 
	Group and Army Psychological Warfare Units in the field produced substantial 
	quantities of leaflets for local distribution by fighter bombers and 
	artillery, the great bulk of the leaflets, approximately 90 %, were produced 
	by PWD-SHAEF, and distributed by aircraft based in the United Kingdom. For 
	the most part, they fell into two categories: tactical leaflets aimed at 
	reducing the enemy&#39;s combat strength by impairing morale and persuading the 
	individual soldier to stop fighting, and strategic leaflets, designed to 
	make civilians act favorably to the Allied military operations. During this 
	period, a total of 3,240,000,000 leaflets were distributed: 405,000,000 by 
	the Royal Air Force, 1,577,000,000 by the Special Leaflet Squadron, 
	1,176,000,000 by the Eighth Air Force. on daylight bombing missions and 
	82,000,000 on special leaflet missions by medium bombers of the Allied 
	Expeditionary Air Forces before they moved to the Continent.</i></b></p></blockquote>
	<p><b>
	Many allied commanders had little use for PSYWAR. 
	They thought of it as a waste of aircraft and ammunition to send leaflets 
	over enemy lines. General Eisenhower was not one of them. He said in the 
	SHAEF official history:</b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b>
	<i>
	In this war, which was total in every sense of the word, we have seen many 
	great changes in military science. It seems to me that not the least of 
	these was the development of psychological warfare as a specific and 
	effective weapon.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>
	From the early and humble beginnings before the landings in North Africa, 
	through the trial-and-error period of operations in North Africa, Northern 
	France and Germany, Allied psychological warfare grew from infancy to 
	vigorous maturity.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>
	The exact contribution of psychological warfare toward the final victory 
	count, of course, cannot be measured in terms of towns destroyed or barriers 
	passed. However, I am convinced that the expenditure of men and money in 
	wielding the spoken and written word was an important contributing factor in 
	undermining the enemyís will to resist and supporting the fighting morale of 
	our potential Allies in the occupied countriesÖWithout doubt, psychological 
	warfare has proved its right to a place of dignity in our military arsenal.</i></b></p>

	<h2><b><u>
	Black Operations</u></b></h2>
	<p><b>
	The SHAEF Document<i> AN ACCOUNT-OF ITS OPERATIONS IN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN 
	CAMPAIGN, 1944-</i>1945 says about black operations:</b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b><i>
	In black propaganda, an attempt is made to cause the target audiences to 
	believe that the source is something other than it really is. The media for 
	covert propaganda during Operation &#34;OVERLORD&#34; have been four. (1) a combined 
	radio program of news and music for the German Armed Forces known as 
	&#34;Soldatensender_Calais&#34; and &#34;Kurzwellensender Atlantik&#34; broadcast daily, (2) 
	a daily newspaper dropped by American aircraft; (3) talks for the opposition 
	movement within the SS; (4) leaflets distributed in occupied countries and 
	Germany aiming at undermining pro-Nazi morale. These operations were 
	generally known as &#34;black&#34; propaganda. Both before and after D-Day the main 
	tone of black propaganda was to concentrate the attention of the German 
	soldier on the enemy within his own ranks, i.e., Nazi Party authorities 
	rather than on the enemy without.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>
	Subversive or &#34;black&#34; propaganda was a separate operation which was the 
	Joint responsibility of PID and the Office of Strategic Services 
	(representing the U.S. War Department). This operation is only briefly 
	covered in this report as it was not a Psychological Warfare Division 
	responsibility, although the Leaflet Section participated in the 
	distribution of &#34;black&#34; propaganda. Black Leaflets, which purported to 
	originate from enemy sources, were the joint responsibility of PID and OSS. 
	This was a special secret operation and cannot be discussed in detail in 
	this report. Substantial quantities of this material were distributed by 
	packing approximately five percent of them into the leaflet bombs along with 
	the propaganda newspaper Nachrichten, and it is believed to have been a very 
	effective form of propaganda. Black propaganda dealt with such subjects as 
	malingering, subversion and the aiding and abetting of desertion.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>
	Purporting to come from enemy sources, these leaflets attempted to 
	accomplish their aims by subtlety and indirection. They covered a multitude 
	of themes, and in general, were designed to weaken the enemy&#39;s morale by 
	undermining the soldiers&#39; confidence in the Nazi Party and the High Command. 
	There were also special leaflets, such as forged German food and clothing 
	coupons, travel orders, etc., which were Intended to add to the enemy&#39;s 
	administrative difficulties and provide additional work for the SS and the 
	Gestapo.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>
	Small quantities of leaflets, mostly &#34;black,&#34; were regularly disseminated by 
	British agencies operating first in the United Kingdom and later the 
	Continent, using balloons especially adapted for this work, designed to 
	release bundles of leaflets at a given time after the balloons had been set 
	free.</i></b></p></blockquote>

  <p><b>The Allies prepared propaganda leaflets for almost all the European nations occupied
  by the Germans to announce the landing of troops on the Continent. The codes were usually
  &#34;Z&#34; for invasion followed by a letter for the country. Some of the leaflets are:
  ZD.1 for Denmark (The Allies&#39; landing has begun); ZH.1 for Holland (Allied troops
  land!); ZN.1 for Norway (The Allied Troops landing has begun!) and ZB.1 for Belgium (The
  Allied armies are landing).</b></p>
  <p><b>There were 12 Allied leaflets coded ZF all with the target of driving back the
  Germans from the Normandy beach-head with the help of the French people</b>. <b>The
  &#34;F&#34; indicates &#34;France.&#34; These leaflets were all designed by the

	Erdmann makes a general statement about the leafleting campaign:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
	<i>
	The D-Day drops in Normandy marked the true acceptance 
	by SHAEF and the higher staff in Eighth Air Force of the 422nd squadron and 
	the would-be operators in the Psychological Warfare Division. Their combined 
	action had, within a painfully short time limit, produced and distributed a 
	remarkable volume of leaflets and had fulfilled completely the Supreme 
	Commander&#39;s desire to give all possible warning to the French civilians. &#34;Millions of leaflets are lying in all the roads and field of France,&#34; 
	confessed the Berlin radio on 8 June, citing a German reporterís 
	observations. The &#34;Special Leaflet Squadron&#34; had demonstrated a new 
	versatility and was ready for greater 
	things. &#34;After D-Day&#34; recalled Frank Kaufman, Chief of the Psychological 
	Warfare Division Leaflet Section, &#34;We just set up to operate; we were in 
	solid with the Eighth Air Force.&#34;</i></p>

	I found this leaflet several years after I found 
	ZB.1 to Belgium. I translated some of the messages on the front and back in 
	the Belgian leaflet, so I ask the readers to look below to ZB.1 to see some 
	of what this leaflet says. </p>

  <p>Transportation and Communication Leaflet ZF.2 Back</p>
  <p>This leaflet depicts the main transportation systems in France and Belgium. The text on
  the front is:</p>
  <p><i>France and Belgium ‚Äì Main lines of communications.</i></p>
  <p><i>Frenchmen, Belgians; don‚Äôt forget the secondary lines.</i></p>
  <p>The back is all text. It says in part:</p>
  <p><i>To the key men in the Transport and Communication Services</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>To railroad personnel: railway workers, mechanics, stokers, switch-men, grade
    crossing supervisors, and assistant station masters.</i></p>
    <p><i>To the personnel of highway communications: Engineers of the bridges, roads and
    track-men</i></p>
    <p><i>To the personnel of waterways: lock keepers and their assistants, haulers (or towing
    crews) and tugboat men.</i></p>
    <p><i>You can play an extremely important part in the battle waged against enemy lines of
    communication. From now there cannot be any secondary railroads, roads or waterways. From
    the enemy‚Äôs viewpoint, all communications are vitally important. If the Germans
    attempt to reroute their traffic through so-called secondary lines, you must see to it
    that, every time, they get into a dead-end situation.</i></p>
    <p><i>Every kilometer of road, rail or canal of use to the enemy counts. Allied Air Forces
    do their share by harassing German centers and lines of communications. Help them in their
    mission‚Ä¶</i></p>

  <p>Eisenhower Proclamation ‚Äì ZF.3</p>
  <p>General Eisenhower also prepared a proclamation to the peoples of Europe coded ZF.3.
  Forty million copies were printed in in five languages. This leaflet was first dropped
  about a week after D-Day on 14 June, so I just add it to complete the picture. Some of the
  text is:</p>
  <p><i>CITIZENS OF FRANCE</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The day of liberation has dawned. Your comrades in arms are on French soil. I am
    proud to have under my command the gallant forces of France who have so long trained and
    waited for this day when they can take part in the liberation of their home country.
    United we come to settle on the battlefield the war you have continued heroically through
    years of stubborn resistance. We shall destroy the Nazi Tyranny, root and branch, so that
    the people of Europe shall have a new birth of freedom‚Ä¶.Those who made common cause
    with the enemy will be removed. It will be for the French people to provide their own
    civil administration and to safeguard my troops for the effective maintenance of law and
    order.</i></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  As Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, there is imposed 
	  on me the duty and responsibility of taking all measures essential to the 
	  prosecution of the war. Prompt obedience to such orders as I may issue is 
	  necessary. All people must continue in the performance of their present 
	  duties unless otherwise instructed. Those who have made common cause with 
	  the enemy and so betrayed their country will be removed. It will be for 
	  the French people to provide their own civil administration and to 
	  safeguard my troops for the effective maintenance of law and order. 
	  Members of the French military mission attached to me will furnish 
	  assistance to this end.</i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  The valor and extreme sacrifice of the millions who have fought under the 
	  banner of resistance have helped and will continue to help the success of 
	  our arms. The presence of the enemy among you has made tragically 
	  necessary the aerial bombardment and military and naval operations which 
	  have caused you loss and suffering. This you have accepted courageously in 
	  the heroic tradition of France, as part of the inevitable price wo all 
	  must pay to attain our goal, which is our freedom.</i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  Every resource will be required for the expulsion of the enemy from your 
	  country. Battle may inflict on you further deprivation. You will realize 
	  that munitions of war must come first, but every endeavor will be made to 
	  bring to your assistance that you need so sorely. I rely on your 
	  assistance in the final crushing Of Hitlerite Germany and the 
	  re-establishment of the historic French liberties. When victory is won and 
	  France is liberated from her oppressors the French people will be free to 
	  choose at the earliest possible moment, under democratic methods and 
	  conditions, the Government under which they wish to live.</i></b></p>
	    
	  <p><b><i>
	  The enemy will fight with the courage of despair. He will neglect no 
	  measure, however ruthless, which he thinks may delay our progress. But our 
	  cause is just, our armies are strong. With our valiant Russian allies from 
	  the east, we shall march to certain victory.</i></b></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>This is a very interesting political statement. Eisenhower threatens the
  collaborationists amongst the French but doesn‚Äôt say exactly what will happen to
  them. He talks about a French government which upset De Gaulle since the General believed
  that France had surrendered while he fought on and now De Gaulle was France. Finally, in a
  politically correct ending, Eisenhower mentions Russia which would make Stalin happy,
  although the Russians had nothing to do with this invasion. In fact, they had been
  complaining and demanding the invasion for years hoping to take some of the pressure off
  their front lines</p>

  <p><b>Invasion Warning Leaflet ZF.4 Front</b></p>
  <p><b>The warning leaflet was coded ZF.4. As the bombers left for France on D-Day the
  Allied radio told the French people:<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>‚Ä¶To all who live within 35 kilometers of any part of the coast‚Ä¶The
    Supreme Commander has directed that advance warning wherever possible shall be given to
    the towns in which these targets will be bombed‚Ä¶The warning will be given by means of
    special warning leaflets dropped by aircraft‚Ä¶Get as quickly as possible into open
    country‚Ä¶Do not gather in large groups that might be mistaken for enemy formations.</i></b></p>

    <p><b>Invasion Warning Leaflet ZF.4 Back</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>So, any Frenchman finding a warning leaflet that morning knew that he was about to
  be bombed and had better move his family inland as fast as possible. The warning leaflet
  was dropped on 16 towns in Normandy by the black-painted B-17 bombers of the 422nd Special
  Leaflet Squadron. They were the first Allied bombers over France on D-Day. The text was
  short and said in part:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Urgent message from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces to
    the inhabitants of this town‚Ä¶To win the battle against our common enemy, the Allied
    air forces will attack transportation centers and facilities of communication vital to the
    enemy. Orders have been given accordingly. You who read this leaflet live near or in a
    center vital to the enemy‚Äôs movement. It is essential that you send your family and
    remove yourselves at once for some days out of the danger zone in which you live‚Ä¶Keep
    off the highways; disperse in the open country. Start now. You have not a minute to lose.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>James Erdmann adds:</p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	The drafting of the texts and the printing of millions of leaflets would 
	require several daysí work. The heads of state of the occupied countries 
	would have to compose and record their addresses before D-DayÖThe Allies 
	desired that the broadcasts and leaflets reflected a concerted, overall plan 
	for the liberation of Western Europe. When the tactical decision to launch 
	OVERLORD was made, the entire program was to be transferred to the BBC and 
	released for broadcast. Such urgency of language was a tip-off that the 
	invasion was imminentÖ</i></p></blockquote>


  <p><b>Military documents show that these leaflets were printed by Odhams, Samuel Stephens
  and Waterlows. They first printed 9,600,000 copies; then reprinted another 10,000,000
  copies. The leaflets were originally delivered on 4 and 5 June 1944 and first disseminated
  on 6 June 1944.</b></p>
  <p><b>My favorite story of the entire PSYOP campaign concerns this warning leaflet. The
  time and place of the invasion was top secret. It was probably guarded more than any other
  D-Day secret. It could mean the life or death of 100,000 men. If this warning leaflet
  should somehow get out; perhaps from a worker hiding a valued souvenir, the location of
  the 16 towns on the leaflet would tell the Germans exactly where the invasion fleet was
  headed. How do you guarantee that this secret is kept? Easy! You lock all the printers up
  and basically refuse to let them leave. The printers were ordered into the Sun plant on 1
  June to prepare the warning leaflet. The place was sealed and the managers, engravers,
  printers and workers were locked inside for the next five days. On 6 June, the doors were
  unlocked; the workers streamed out, saw the sun, and heard that France had been invaded.</b></p>

  <p><strong>ZF.5 - General De Gaulle‚Äôs Address of 6 June 1944</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Leaflet ZF.5 (&#34;F&#34; for &#34;France&#34;) was prepared by the Allies
  and quoted in a radio broadcast given by Free-French General Charles De Gaulle, the head of
  the French Committee of National Liberation on 6 June 1944. It explained the need for the
  invasion and told the French people what to expect. The back of the leaflet was a short
  one sentence statement from De Gaulle and his signature.¬† Since France was the actual target and would be bombed and bombarded by Allied
  Aircraft and ships, it was important that they understood why this ferocious attack on
  their homeland was important. Some of the text is:</strong></p>
  </b><blockquote><b>
    </b><p><b><i><strong>The supreme battle is engaged. After so many struggles, so much fury, so
    much pain, we are now faced with the decisive blow, the blow for which we have hoped so
    much. It is, it should be understood, the battle of France, and it is the battle waged by
    France. Immense machinery of attack, that is to say machinery meant to bring us succor has
    commenced to deploy from old England. It was before this last western bastion of Europe
    that the tide of German oppression was once halted. 
	Today it is the base from which a liberation offensive is launched.</strong></i></b><i><strong> <b>France is submerged for four 
	years, but not reduced or vanquished. France is on her feet to take part in 
	this offensive. For the sons of France wherever they may be, or whoever they 
	may be, the simple and sacred duty is to fight by every means at their 
	disposal.</b> </strong></i></p><strong>
	  <p><b><i>
	  It is a question of destroying the enemy, the enemy which crushes and 
	  defiles our country. the detested enemy. the dishonored enemy, the enemy 
	  will do all he can to escape his fate and to cling to our soil as long as 
	  possible. But for some time, he is no more than a wild boast in retreat.
	  From Stalingrad to Tarnopol, from the borders of the Nile to Bizerte, 
	  from Tunis to Rome he has now acquired a habit of defeat.</i></b><i> </i></p>
	  <p><i>
	  <b>France will wage this battle with fury but she will wage it in good order. 
	  It is thus that for 1,500 years we have won all our victories; it is thus that wo shall win this victory. In good order for 
	  our forces on land, at sea and in the air. There is no problem here. Never 
	  were our military forces more ardent, more skilled, more disciplined. 
	  Africa, Italy, the Oceans, and the skies have witnessed their strength and 
	  their revived glory. Our native land will see them tomorrow! 
	  </b></i></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  For a nation which fights with feet and hands tied against an oppressor 
	  armed to the teeth good order in the struggle demands many conditions. 
	  </i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  The first is that the instructions given by the French Government and by 
	  the French leaders who have been entrusted with the duty of giving the 
	  orders on a national plane and on a local plane should be precisely 
	  followed. </i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  The second condition is that our action behind the enemy lines should be 
	  coordinated as closely as possible with that on the battle front by the 
	  allied and French armies. Everyone must now foresee that the action of the 
	  armies will be hard fought and prolonged. That is to say the action of the 
	  forces of resistance must hold out in order to develop on an increasing 
	  scale up to the moment of the German rout. </i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  The third condition is that all those who can act either by armed force or 
	  by destruction or by giving information or by refusing useful labor to the 
	  enemy should not allow themselves to be made prisoners. All these steps 
	  should be taken in advance to avoid arrest or deportation, whatever may be 
	  the difficulties. Anything is better than to be put out of the fight 
	  without fighting. </i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  The battle of France has commenced. There is no longer in the nation, in 
	  the empire, in the armies, anything but one single will, one single hope. 
	  Behind the cloud laden with our blood and with our tears we see appearing 
	  the sun of our national grandeur.</i></b></p></strong></blockquote><strong>

  <p>One again the Allies stress the importance of the transportation and communication
  people. The message is similar to others we translate here such as ZF.2, so I will just
  translate a few paragraphs:</p>
  <p><i>SECOND MESSAGE!</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>You continue to play a highly important part in the battle waged against the enemy
    lines of communication.</i></p>
    <p><i>There no longer exists, as you know, any secondary road or waterways. From the
    enemy‚Äôs point of view all communications are vitally important.</i></p>
    <p><i>Furthermore, you know the enemy is doing his best to repair the damage you have
    caused him.</i></p>
    <p><i>You, for your part will continue in your campaign of destruction and you will

  <p><b><i>A complete Index of Allied Airborne Leaflets and Magazines 1939-1945</i> makes
  some interesting points about leaflets dropped around D-Day. It appears that most of the
  normal series were stopped. We see a lack of the usual leaflet missions the week before
  and after D-Day. It is almost as if the Allies wanted to concentrate on the invasion
  leaflets and stopped much of the usual forms of communication with the occupied countries.
  We note that the Eisenhower leaflet above (ZB.1) was also dropped on Holland (ZH.1),
  Norway (ZN.1), Denmark (ZD.1) and France (ZF.1). </b></p>

  <p><b>A Message to Transportation and Communication Officers</b></p>
  <p><b>A second leaflet that was dropped on a number of different countries starting 6 June
  1944 was <i>Message aux agents des services du transport et des communications</i>,
  ‚ÄúA Message to Transportation and Communication Officers.‚Äù The back was <i>Belges
  et FranÁais ne perdez pas de vue les lignes secondaires, ‚Äú</i>Belgians and French do
  not lose sight of the secondary lines‚Äù with a map of the roads and highways near the
  invasion beaches. This is a four page leaflet in French and Dutch. This leaflet was
  dropped on Belgium (ZB.2) and France (ZF.2). <i>The Falling Leaf</i>, the Journal of the
  Psywar Society mentioned this leaflet in a special anniversary supplement dated June,
  1994. It said:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>ZB.2 and ZF.2. A message to Belgian transport workers asking them to sabotage any
    secondary roads, railways or canals that might have escaped Allied air attacks. The back
    is a map showing major lines of communications‚Ä¶dropped 6 June.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Military documents show that these leaflets were printed by the Sun Engraving
  Company in Watford. They first printed 2,000,000 copies; then reprinted another 2,000,000
  copies on 12 June. The leaflets were originally delivered on 1 June 1944 and first
  disseminated on 6 June 1944.</b></p>
  <p><b>A Belgian friend adds:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Before the landings in Normandy, the British and American air forces bombed the
    lines of communication in Normandy, Northern France, Belgium and other areas for several
    months in order to deceive the Germans about the location of the invasion site. Railway
    stations, marshaling yards, bridges, rail junctions, and important crossroads were
    severely bombed. The Allies wished to prevent the Germans from sending reinforcements,
    supplies and armored divisions to the front. This leaflet asks the partisans to continue
    that action. It tells them that the secondary roads, the secondary railways, etc., are
    also very important so they must be watched. </i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Some of the text on the front of the leaflet asks the French <b>and Belgians to
  block the roads and stop the Germans from moving their vehicles freely:</b></b></p><b><b>
  <p><b><i>Message to all the Transportation Services Men</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>You can play a key role in the battle against the enemy lines of communications.
    From now on there are no more secondary railways, nor secondary roads, nor secondary
    waterways. For the enemy ALL the lines of communication are of the highest importance. If
    the Germans try to use secondary routes, it is dependent on you that they be blocked.
    Every kilometer of railway, road, or canal which could be used by the enemy is important.
    For its part the Allied air force will bomb the lines and centers of communication used by
    the Germans. Please help them in their mission.<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When you actually think about this leaflet it seems to put the French and Belgians in
  great peril. If they obviously tie up traffic to stop German movement there is a good
  chance that the Germans will shoot them on the spot. If they back up the Germans for
  Allied air attack, they are right in the danger zone. In the military we have a term
  called ‚Äúdanger close.‚Äù That means we don‚Äôt want to fire or bomb too close
  to our own people. Bombs do not have eyes. When the fighters and bombers attack the German
  vehicles with machine guns and explosives, any French truck or civilian in the immediate
  vicinity is in great danger.</p>

  <p><strong>ZG.1 - FROM FRONT‚Ä¶Attacked! FROM BEHIND‚Ä¶Written off!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Six million copies of leaflet ZG.1 (&#34;G&#34; is for &#34;Germany&#34;)
  were dropped between 6 June and 29 June over German troops telling them of the
  hopelessness of their positions. It tells the German soldiers that they are nothing but
  human landmines left to slow the advance of the Allies. The text says in part:</strong></p>
  <p><i><strong>FROM FRONT‚Ä¶Attacked! FROM BEHIND‚Ä¶Written off!</strong></i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><i>In the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht defense plan the Atlantic wall and the 40
    kilometer wide coastal area behind it are merely a living mine field. Every soldier in the
    coastal area is only a living mine for the OKW, which is expected to delay a breakthrough
    but not to stop it.</i></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><i>THE SLAUGHTER AT THE ATLANTIC WALL IS FORGOTTEN.</i></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><strong>FROM THE SEA the artillery of the Allied ships made wide breaches in the
    Atlantic wall. After the shells came the massive waves of land troops.</strong></i></p>
    <p><i><strong>IN THE AIR the Luftwaffe fights using all avail≠able forces, against an
    overwhelming superior force. For each Allied plane shot down, ten new ones come. For each
    German plane downed, no new ones come. Everyone can see that the number of German planes
    becomes smaller daily.</strong></i></p>
    <p><i><strong>ON LAND an Allied infantry company now attacks every German platoon at all
    points of penetration.</strong></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><i>THE OKW COUNTED FROM THE START ON THE LOSS OF THE COASTAL
  DIVISIONS‚Ä¶</i></strong></p>
  <p><b>Some of the text on the back is:</b></p><b>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>They consist of men who are too old or too young for real frontline duty, men who 6
    months ago were only considered fit for garrison duty, including a high percentage of
    ethnic German foreigners and men of unreliable foreign units.</i></p>
    <p><i>What can be considered battle proven units in this zone are supposed to serve with
    these replacements and be sacrificed with them.</i></p>
    <p><i>FROM IN FRONT ATTACKED - FROM BEHIND WRITTEN OFF</i></p>
    <p><i>THAT IS THE SITUATION ON THE ATLANTIC WALL.</i></p>
    <p><i>AND THIS IS ONLY THE START OF THE TWO-FRONT WAR.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is a section written in Polish for German soldiers that speak the language or
  perhaps were from the part of Poland that had a large German population:</p>
  <p><i>Polish Speaking German Soldiers</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Appeal of Allied Armies</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>POLES!</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>1. You were drafted into the German army. Intruders are branded with the disgraceful
    name Volksdeutsch.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>SHOW THIS LEAFLET TO OUR SOLDIERS</i></p>
  <p><b>The ‚Äúhuman landmines‚Äù theme is mentioned in <i>A Report on the Activities
  of the Office of War Information in the European Theatre of Operations from January 1944
  to January 1945</i>:</b></p><b>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>First psychological warfare (PW) personnel landed on the Normandy beaches on D-day,
    a tiny group including a news photographer, a liaison officer between PW, the First Army
    and the 21st Army Group, and an intelligence officer. Although they had little
    psychological warfare to conduct during that period, the air was full of it in the form of
    broadcasts by BBC and ABSIE; and British-based∑ bomber squadrons were scattering millions
    of leaflets. Some were addressed primarily to enemy coastal divisions; Volksdeutsche
    troops with little stomach to serve as ‚Äúhuman land-mines‚Äù for the Herrenvolk
    farther back. Later interrogation indicated that the leaflets in German and in Russian and
    Polish for the German-impressed and mercenary troops-played their part in the rather
    speedy surrender of these coastal detachments. </i></p>
    <p><i>As the Allied troops pushed inland, other psychological warfare groups landed in
    France. The organization, stemming from SHAEF with control vested in the Psychological
    Warfare Division, contained British and American civilian and military personnel and
    included members from the British Ministry of Information, the British Political
    Intelligence Department, the U.S. Office of Strategic Services and the U.S. Office of War
    Information., In addition to mobile printing equipment, they brought with them tons of
    ready-printed material already rolled for firing in shells from the two most usual
    weapons, the 25-pounder on the British front and the 105mm. weapon on the American. They
    also brought key lists of leaflets available in the United Kingdom, each bearing a code
    number for reference in signals from the field to PWD-SHAEF. Thus forward PW
    operatives-filling a role similar to that of artillery spotters were able to direct
    leaflet fire by area and text.</i></p>

  <p><strong>ZG.2 - Four-Front War</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Six-hundred thousand copies of leaflet ZG.2 were prepared by the Allies to drop
  on the Germans from 6 June to 15 June 1944. The front of the large leaflet shows the
  invasion force labelled ‚ÄúWestern Front,‚Äù the ‚ÄúSouthern Front‚Äù in
  Italy, the ‚ÄúEastern front‚Äù as the Russians advance, and bombs are depicted
  dropping on Germany labelled ‚ÄúHome Front.‚Äù The back has a long message telling
  the German forces of their nation‚Äôs peril due to the Eastern Front, Home Front, and
  Southern Front. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this leaflet is that the arrow
  showing the invasion route from the British Isles depicts the invasion landing at Calais.
  Since the leaflet was dropped starting June 6, the Allies were still hoping to convince
  the Germans that the Normandy landings were only a ploy and the real invasion would land
  further east. Some of the text is:</strong></p>
  <p><i>FOUR FRONTS</i></p>
  <p><i>EAST FRONT</i></p>
  <p><i>HOME FRONT</i></p>
  <p><i>SOUTH FRONT</i></p>
  <p><i>AND NOW THE WEST FRONT</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>East Front: Two years ago Hitler chose the anniversary of the beginning of
    Napoleon‚Äôs ill-fated campaign to commence his invasion of Russia. Hitler‚Äôs
    armies have retreated as Napoleon‚Äôs army‚Äôs retreated. The Russian armies are
    already deep into Poland and Romania, and stand on the boundaries of Czechoslovakia. They
    await the order for the final offensive.</i></p>
    <p><i>Home Front: Four years ago Hitler issued his communique, ‚ÄúThe war in the West
    is over,‚Äù and began his assault on the British Home front. His assault was defeated.
    The Royal Air Force and the American Air Force have now gone over to the air offensive and
    have opened a front unique in the war, the German home front where Goering promised no
    bombs would fall. By day and by night Allied air fleets are assaulting aircraft factories,
    oil refineries, heavy industries, and the entire communications network of the Reich‚Ä¶</i></p>

  <p>ZG.4 ‚Äì WHY?</p>
  <p>The front of ZG.4, dropped from 11 to 15 June 1944, is the same ‚ÄúFour Front
  War‚Äù image as found on ZG.2 above. 2,000,000 copies of this learflet were printed.
  The back is all text with the title ‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù The text is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The Allied Expeditionary Army was landed on the British coast without the German air
    force intervening. Why?</i></p>
    <p><i>Many thousands of Allied ships were docked in the British ports without the German
    air force intervening. Why?</i></p>
    <p><i>The Allied Expeditionary Army reached the coast of France, without the German air
    force intervening. Why?</i></p>
    <p><i>The Allied Expeditionary Army broke through the first line of the Atlantic Wall, and
    created a bridgehead, without the German air force intervening. Why?</i></p>
    <p><i>Montgomery and Rommel have given the answer. Montgomery said:</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‚ÄúYou must first win the battle of the air, only then you begin the land or sea
      battle.‚Äù</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>Rommel said:</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‚ÄúAbove all German fortifications, air superiority will make the difference,
      regardless of what the opponent chooses to do.‚Äù</i></p>

  <p>ZG.5 ‚Äì FROM FRONT‚Ä¶Attacked! FROM BEHIND‚Ä¶Written off!</p>
  <p>Leaflet ZG.5 was written in German and Polish. 5,530,700 copies of this
  leaflet were printed for dissemination from 10 June to 5 July 1944. The text on the front
  and back is almost identical to that of ZG.1. The only difference is the addition of a
  line or two to the German and Polish texts.</p>
  <p>The new German text after talking about the problems at sea, in the air and on the
  ground is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>This explains: Your lack of trucks; the old age and the health of many of your
    mates; and the number of foreign troops in your ranks.</i></p>
    <p><i>What we see on the front line defenses is experienced units meant to support the
    stiffening of the weaker units, but then sacrificed along with the rest.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The single Polish language addition is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Show this flyer to our soldiers.</i></p>

	<p>
	Leaflet ZG.6</p>
	<p>
	3,510,219 copies of this leaflet were printed and disseminated from 14 June 
	to 31 December 1944. It is an odd leaflet with a long message on the front 
	blaming the Germans for forcing the Allies to invade, and a Red Cross 
	message on the back regarding notification of the families and kin of German 
	soldiers in case they were injured. I suspect side two was the important 
	side because it implied that the Allies cared about the German soldiers and 
	wanted to be sure they were treated kindly and correctly. It meant they 
	could surrender without fear of torture or death. The text is long so I will 
	just translate a few parts. Some of the message on the front telling the 
	German soldier he is not responsible, but the NAZI Party is:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	WHO WANTED THIS SLAUGHTER?</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	National Socialism ñ which in 1934 began rearmament on the largest scale ñ 
	which in 1935 gave the German people the slogan ìGuns instead of butterî ñ 
	which in six years used 90 million Reichsmarks for armaments ñ which from 
	1938 onwards annexed fresh territory every six months under threat of 
	warÖwhose leader said in November 1940: I have prepared for this war as no 
	other war has ever been prepared for ñ and it has paid a handsome dividend.î</i></p></blockquote>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	We shall see that this never happens again. We are determined to destroy 
	National Socialism, and with it the men who believed it was a means of 
	increasing their power and enriching themselves, and for that reason plunged 
	the world into war and misery.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p>
	Some of the text on the back is:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	RED CROSS LEAFLET</i></p>
	<blockquote><p>
	<i>
	To assure the most rapid notification to your next of kin through the 
	international Red Cross at Geneva, the following questionnaire should be 
	filled out. This questionnaire serves only the purpose of reporting to the 
	Red Cross and will not be sent to the home of the prisoner.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p>
	<i>
	WRITE CLEARLY</i></p>
	
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Name, Christian name, Rank, Army number, Date of Birth, and Place of Birth. 
	The name and exact address of your wife or next of kin who is to be advised 
	of your capture (with degree of relationship).</i></p>

	<p>
	Leaflet VG.7</p>
	<p>
	The promises made to enemy troops to get them to surrender have changed over 
	the years. In the 1950s, North Korean and Chinese troops were promised a 
	warm room, warm clothes, cigarettes, and a bowl of rice. That worked quite 
	well.</p>
	<p>
	In the 1960s, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army troops were offered by the 
	Chieu Hoi program: lumber for a house, payments for every member of the 
	family, job training, medical care, and a peaceful life in a protected 
	hamlet. In theory this worked out well. Although the numbers vary widely, 
	somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 enemy troops surrendered. Some 
	skeptics said they came for a hot shower and a hot meal and then returned to 
	the bush.</p>
	<p>
	During the invasion advance in France and Germany in 1944 something entirely 
	different was offered. In the leaflet above, the Allies offered various 
	educations classes, perhaps a high school diploma, and knowledge that could 
	be used to rebuild Germany. The image on the back of leaflet VG.7 depicts 
	studious German prisoners-of-war studying in an Allied prison camp. This was 
	a novel approach and I assume it worked. Rather than sit around idly, these 
	troops were able to better themselves and keep busy. The text is long on the 
	front and back so I will just translate some of the message and show the 
	image found on the back of the leaflet (edited for brevity):</p>
	<p><i>
	HERE IS WHERE THE RECONSTRUCTION BEGINS</i></p>
	<p><i>
	From an American Prisoner-of-war Camp - One of many</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Nine classes with an average of 45 men in each, prepare the students for 
	senior or intermediate clerical duties and final examinations.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	In the camp universities, lectures in the following subjects are presented: 
	law, medicine, languages, natural science, and engineering. The average 
	number of lectures each week is from 15 to 20, and in medicine 30. The 
	recognition of diplomas granted by the camp university is now in negotiation 
	with the German High School system. In addition, the agricultural course 
	which prepares students for a career as an agronomist is under 
	consideration.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	Further courses of study are English, French, Spanish, Russian, Marine 
	Construction, General technical, and Electrical engineering. The camp 
	library contains thousands of volumes. In addition, many scientific works 
	are available.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p><i>
	THEY WILL REBUILD GERMANY!</i></p>
	<p>
	The other side of the leaflet is all text, titled <i>SOLDIER&#39;S DUTY</i>, and 
	tells of the Russian advances in the East and tells the German soldier that 
	he has done his duty. The text ends:</p>
	<p><i>
	Your duty as a soldier is done, another duty remains to be done:</i></p>
	<p><i>
	THE DUTY OF LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF.</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Your family, your people and your Fatherland need healthy people to rebuild, 
	not further unnecessary sacrifices for a lost cause.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	As soldiers you are entitled to and you will receive good treatment 
	according to the Geneva Convention in case of imprisonment by the Allies.

	<p>Leaflet ZG.10</p>
	<p>
	This leaflet targets the Polish troops in the German Army that might have 
	been forced into service. 8.775,750 copies were printed and dropped from 14 
	June 1944 to January 1945. The Text is:</p>
	<p><i>
	Poles in the German Army</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Brute force has thrust you into the ranks of Poland&#39;s deadly foes, who have 
	subjected our nation to ruthless oppression. Brute force has inflicted upon 
	you the German uniform.</i></p>

	You are forced to fight against the liberating armies of the free nations 
	who are storming the western wall of the so-called &#34;European Fortress.&#34; Side 
	by side, together with the Americans, British, Canadians and French, our 
	Polish forces are fighting there.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	Most of you have already been told what Poland expects of you.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	The polish Government has the following orders to you. </i></p>
	<p><i>
	Do not shoot at your brothers, the soldiers of the Allied armies. If you 
	shoot, miss.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	At the first opportunity, come over to the Allied armies, or hide and await 
	their arrival.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	Impart of the information you possess to the Allied when you encounter 
	them.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	As soon as you are on the Allied side, report your Polish nationality, 
	request separation from German prisoners, and ask for contact with the 
	Polish military authorities.</i></p>

	Leaflet ZG.12</p>
	<p>
	
	I like this leaflet because it tries to destroy German morale by 
	telling the troops that the Allies air forces now have complete encircled 
	Germany and can bomb them from both the East and the West. 2,100,000 
	leaflets were printed and dropped 21 June 1944 about two weeks after D-Day. 
	The text is very long so I will just quote some selected comments:</p>
	<p><i>
	THE AIR ENCIRCLEMENT IS COMPLETE</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	This leaflet was dropped by an American air fleet on its way to Russia. Soon 
	the same air fleet, operating from Russian bases will attack again. The air 
	encirclement has been completed.¬† No factory, no railway, no ports, no 
	military stores, no troop concentrations in Hitlerís fortress are now safe 
	from our attack.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	The completement of the air encirclement destroys the last illusions with 
	which the Nazis are trying to conceal the inevitability of their defeat. It 
	destroys the illusion that military defeat can be avoided by separating the 
	Allies. It destroys the illusion that the German war industry can be saved 
	by moving out of the range of the bombers based in England and Italy. 11,000 
	Allied airplanes control the skies over Normandy. Thousands of Allied planes 
	control the skies of Italy, the Balkans and southern France.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	On 9 September 1939 Reich Marshall Goering declared: &#34;Our great problem has 
	always been to have to fight on two fronts. By means of Hitler&#39;s brilliant 
	pact, this danger has been removed for all time.&#34; And on 9 November of the 
	same year Adolf Hitler declared in Munich: &#34;German has never been afraid of 
	a war on one front, now we have only one front, and we shall triumph on that 
	front.&#34;</i></p></blockquote>
	<p><i>
	NOW</i></p>
	<p><i>
	LOOK EAST!</i></p>
	<p><i>
	LOOK WEST!</i></p>

	Leaflet ZG.17</p>
	<p>
	The fight on the peninsula leading to Cherbourg was bitter. The Allies 
	advanced, but very slowly. This leaflet tells the Germans that they are 
	alone and should surrender as many other German soldiers have done. It gives 
	them an excuse to surrender with honor. The leaflet is tactical for the 
	German forces directly in front of the Allied advance so just 362,000 of 
	these leaflets were disseminated on 22 and 23 June 1944. The text on the 
	front is:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	SOLDIERS</i></p>
	<p><i>
	STOP THE STRUGGLE!</i></p>
	<p>
	The back is a bit longer and tells the troops surrender is a viable option 
	because they have fulfilled their duties:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	
	NOTICE</i></p>
	<p><i>
	You are fighting alone.</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	The dock defense system of the peninsula has collapsed. Thousands of your 
	comrades who have fought the hopeless struggle will never see the Fatherland 
	again. Scores of thousands who have ceased the struggle are already in 
	safety in our hands. They are being treated as soldiers who have fulfilled 
	their soldierís pledge.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p>
	<i>
	It is already 5 minutes past 12.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	STOP THE STRUGGLE!</i></p>
	<p>
	Note: That comment about ì5 minutes past 12î is a takeoff on a common 
	propaganda slogan used by both sides, ìItís 5 minutes to 12î that implied 
	the war was nearly over so why die in the last minutes of the conflict. This 
	slight change in the slogan tells the Germans that the war is already over.</p>

	Here, General MacArthurís Psychological Warfare Branch asks the Japanese 
	occupying the Philippine Islands the same question. The reader sees all the 
	islands that have fallen to the Allies and is told that the next to fall 
	will be Japan. 
	Instead of numbers, islands where the Japanese have been defeated appear on 
	the clock face. Starting at 1 o&#39;clock: Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa 
	(Kiribati), Marshall Islands, Admiralty Islands, New Guinea, Saipan, Guam, 
	and Palau. The minute hand rests on the Philippines, indicating the current 
	battle underway there. The hour hand rests on Japan (at the 12 o&#39;clock 
	position) indicating it is the next and final target. 50,000 of these 
	leaflets were dropped on 21 November 1944. The American name for this 
	leaflet was simply ìClockî and the text on the front is:</p>

	Leaflet ZG.20</b></p>
	<p><b>
	During the invasion, the 
	port city of Cherbourg was a tough nut to crack. The capture of this French 
	city during World War II by American forces three weeks after the Normandy 
	landings of 6 June 1944 gave the Allies their first great port in 
	northwestern Europe. Cherbourg had been held by the Germans since June 1940. 
	The Germans fought stubbornly, demolished the port, and blocked the harbor 
	channels, but finally surrendered on 26 June. A vast rehabilitation program 
	put the port back into working condition several weeks later. After the fall 
	of Cherbourg, the Allies used the German surrender to motivate the Germans 
	still fighting to throw down their arms. This leaflet depicts Lieutenant 
	General von Schlieben, Commander of the Cherbourg garrison surrendering to 
	American troops. 3,600,000 of these leaflets were disseminated from 6 July to 12 July 1944 
	over German troops. The text is:</b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b>
	<em>Lieutenant-General von 
	Schlieben, the defender of Cherbourg, left his command post at Fort du Roule 
	to surrender to the Americans. The situation was hopeless. Even Schlieben&#39;s 
	death couldn&#39;t have changed anything. Why did Lieutenant General von 
	Schlieben, along with 18,000 others in the same position, disobey their 
	Fuhrer&#39;s order, which they had pledged with their signature.</em></b></p></blockquote><b>
	<p><b>
	<em>&#34;That regardless of the situation, they had to defend their place with their 
	lives to the last man and the last cartridge.&#34;</em></b></p><b>
	<p><b>
	<em>Lieutenant-General von 
	Schlieben and the 18,000 men are now in England. They are waiting for the 
	end of the war and for a Germany in which such expressive obligations are 
	impossible.</em></b></p><b>
	<p><b>
	The back of the leaflet is 
	all text, 11 paragraphs. I will translate a few lines:</b></p>
	
	<p><b>
	<em>YOU WILL BE TREATED LIKE SOLDIERS</em></b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b>
	<em>We promise you neither 
	utopia nor a paradise, if you get captured. But you can count on the 
	following facts with certainty:</em></b></p>
	<p><b>
	<em>Fair treatment, good food, 
	first rate hospital care, mail facilities, payroll status, and further

	Leaflet ZG.23</p>
	<p>
	I would not depict this leaflet but apparently the U.S. forces thought it 
	was extremely important. They produced it no less than 5 times during the 
	battle for Germany. 3,783,211 of this variation of the leaflet were 
	disseminated from 12 July to 2 August 1944 over German troops.
	The text on the front is:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	ONE MINUTE</i></p>
	<p>
	<i>
	Which may save your life</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Read the following six points carefully and thoroughly. They may mean the 
	difference between life and death for you.</i></p>
	<blockquote><p>
	<i>
	
	1. In the battle of material, valor alone cannot offset the inferiority in 
	tanks, planes, and artillery.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	2. With the breaching of the Atlantic Wall and of the Eastern Front the 
	decision has fallen: Germany has lost the war.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	3. You are not facing barbarians who delight in killing, but soldiers who 
	would spare your life if possible.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	4. But we can only spare those who do not force us, by senseless resistance, 
	to use our weapons against them.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	5. It is up to you to show us 
	your intention by raising your arms and waving a handkerchief in an 
	unmistakable manner.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	6. Prisoners-of-war are treated 
	decently, in a fair manner, as become soldiers who have fought bravely.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p><i>
	You must decide for yourself. But, if you should find yourself in a 
	desperate situation, remember what you have read.</i></p></blockquote>
	<p>
	The text on the back is an explanation of the Geneva Conventions rules for 
	Prisoner Treatment.</p>

	The second use of this leaflet was coded ZG.92K. 440,000 copies of this 
	variation of the leaflet were disseminated from December 1944 to January 
	1945. The text on the back was a message titled &#34;When is it your turn?&#34;</p>
	<p>
	The third use of this leaflet was coded ZG.96K. 1,000,000 copies of this 
	variation of the leaflet were disseminated from January to March 1945. The 
	text on the back was a message titled &#34;When is it your turn?&#34;</p>

	The fourth use of this leaflet was coded ZG.108. 11,912,000 copies of this 
	variation of the leaflet were disseminated from 7 February to 13 March 1945. The text on the back was a message titled 
	&#34;When is it your turn?&#34;</p>
	<p>
	The fifth use of this leaflet was coded ZG.115. 3,928,444 copies of this 
	variation of the leaflet were disseminated from 12 March to 2 April 1945. The text on the back was a message titled 
	&#34;When is it your turn?&#34;</p>
	<p>
	I should mention that the &#34;When is it your turn?&#34; text on the back of this 
	leaflet was found on several other leaflets.</p>

	SHAEF Headquarters said about this leaflet:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
	<i>
	One of the most successful of the general tactical leaflets. It was designed 
	for distribution to areas of stiff enemy resistance and again and again 
	proved its effectiveness in prisoner returns. Its lack of any political 
	appeal, and its short-term soldier-to-soldier language seems to have been 
	among the factors of its success.</i></p>

	Leaflet ZG.24</p>
	<p>
	I chose this leaflet not for the propaganda message on the front, although I 
	will translate some of it, but instead for the photograph on the back that 
	depicts Hitler with Rommel inspecting his Atlantic Wall and stating that 
	Churchill&#39;s troops will be pushed back into the sea within nine hours. In 
	this case I will depict the back of the leaflet instead of the front. 
	3,336,350 copies of this leaflet were dropped over German troops from 12 
	July to 2 August 1944. The ironic text of the picture at the left is:</p>
	<p><i>
	I can assure Mr. Churchill that no matter where he chooses the place to 
	start the</i></p>
	<p>
	The picture on the right shows Allied vehicles driving from the beach inland 
	into France. The text is:</p>
	<p><i>
	This photograph was taken by an Allied war correspondent nine hours after 
	the first Normandy landings.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	
	The front of the leaflet tells the Germans of the incredible ability of the 
	United States to turn out massive amounts of weaponry daily. The numbers are 
	so amazing that I am sure the Germans wondered if they were true. Some of 
	the text is:</p>
	<p><i>
	BLUFF?</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Two years ago, it was said that the Americans would produce 125,000 planes, 
	75,000 tanks, and 80,000 guns a year. To this the German leaders replied: 
	It&#39;s all a bluff. Propaganda! Today you know that it was the truth. You are 
	learning it from personal experience.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	One year ago, it was said that the Allies were producing 5 ships per day, 
	and that the submarine war had failed. To this the German leaders replied: 
	Itís all a bluff. Propaganda! Today you know that it was the truth. 
	Regularly and without interference, Allied war material is discharged on the 
	coast of Western Europe. Today more U-boats are sunk than Allied freighters.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	Today, the Allied soldiers says to the German soldier: Quit fighting! 
	Germany has lost the war! But you know it is the truth. For you are a 
	soldier and you have learned from bitter experience to face the facts and 
	draw your own conclusions. And you know the Allied soldiers treat 
	prisoners-of-war decently and fairly.</i></p></blockquote>

	Leaflet ZG.26</p>
	<p>
	I think this will be the last of the VG leaflets I will add. The article is 
	about D-Day and now we are a good month into the battle, and it becomes more 
	of just the usual slogging it out through the mud and the forests. We are 
	getting well past the actual landings. There are about 139 ZG leaflets in 
	all, being disseminated all the way to May 1945. 1,200,000 of these leaflets 
	were dropped from 10 to 27 July 1944. This leaflet is all text and once 
	makes an argument for surrender, pointing out that so many heroic Germans 
	have already surrendered and will live to return home. The text on the front 
	is:</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	HOLD OUT!</i></p>
	<p><i>
	This was the order to your comrades.</i></p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Why did 49,000 of your comrades on the Cotentin Peninsula have to surrender? 
	They were good soldiers who had been trained for years for their task. And among the prisoners are Generals, bearers of the Knight&#39;s Cross, 
	and thousands of veterans of battles in the east, the west and the south.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	They had been ordered: Hold out ñ reinforcements, tanks and air cover are 
	coming! Their reinforcements did not come. The air force was not to be seen, 
	their losses mounted, the positions couldn&#39;t be held. For the coastal 
	divisions had been written off from the beginning, their task, for which 
	they had been intended, proved to be impossible. Valor alone is insufficient 
	against armor piecing bombs, naval artillery, rocket weapons, continuous air 
	assault and an enemy who is superior in numbers.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	Are you next now, or your comrades at another part of the shattered Atlantic 
	Wall? Are the same orders, the same promises being given to you? Will you be 
	among the many thousands of dead who vainly try to hold out, or will you 
	have the good fortune of saving yourselves by becoming prisoners? Today the 
	watchword is no longer &#34;hold out.&#34;</i></p></blockquote>
	<p>
	<i>
	The watchword is &#34;Make an end to it!&#34;</i></p>
	<p>
	The back of the leaflet has the same image and text as leaflet ZG.20 above, 
	with Lieutenant-General von Schlieben, the defender of Cherbourg 
	surrendering.</p>

  <p>Leaflet WG.1</p>
  <p>The British and Americans also produced a series of about 50+ leaflets that were coded
  WG. They seem to be aimed more at civilians than the military forces. I do not want to
  mention them in depth, but I will show the first one that warns the people that the
  Germans are in retreat from the D-Day forces and will be destroyed by constant attacks.
  The leaflet is signed by the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces and dated
  26 August 1944, about 10 weeks after the invasion. Some of the text is:</p>
  <p><i>WARNING!</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>To the German civilian population in the areas west of the Rhine, in the French
    provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, and to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg:</i></p>
    <p><i>The elimination of the German 7th Army has decided the battle of France. The
    survivors of the Normandy battle and the handful of German divisions north of the Seine
    can at best fight a series of delaying actions on their retreat into Germany. The German
    areas west of the Rhine, in the French provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, and to the Grand
    Duchy of Luxemburg have, therefore become the rear areas of military operations. Very soon
    they may become a theater of war‚Ä¶</i></p>
    <p><i>‚Ä¶The rear communications of the remnants of the German Army retreating into
    Germany will be subjected to devastating air attacks. These air attacks will be the same
    scope and intensity as the bombing preceding and accompanying the invasion of
    France‚Ä¶.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>5,760,000 of these leaflets were printed and dropped from 3 to 11 September 1944 over
  16 targets.</p>

  <p>WG.19</p>
  <p>I thought I would add this leaflet from the WG series because it features Allied
  Military Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower who would later become the President of
  the United States for two terms, and explains to the German people exactly what will
  happen as the Allies take over a defeated Germany. I think the message is accurate and
  seeks to reassure the Germans that the change will be smooth and efficient and they will
  not be tortured or murdered. About 15,200,000 of these leaflets were printed with
  dissemination from 11 June 1944 to 18 February 1945. Some of the text is:</p>
  <p><em>GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER</em></p>
  <p><i>Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, and Military Governor</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>American officers of the military government lay down to German civilians the laws
    for running an evacuation camp.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>AFTER THE ENTRY OF THE ALLIES</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>On German territory, a military government was proclaimed by General Dwight D.
    Eisenhower in his capacity of Military Governor. Military government proceeds swiftly but
    justly in the occupied territory. Its main function is neither the punishment nor the
    education of Germany, but the securing of Allied communications, the earliest possible
    establishment of peace, and to that purpose the removal of the National Socialist
    leadership and the apprehending and punishment of war criminals‚Ä¶. </i></p>

  <p><b>Nachrichten f¸r die Truppe, Nr. 51, 6 June 1944</b></p>
  <p><b>I said earlier that the Allies slowed their leaflet campaign to almost a halt as
  D-Day neared. The Allied propaganda newspaper <i>Nachrichten f¸r die Truppe</i> (News for
  the Troops) is a good example. The newspaper was a joint project of the British Political
  Warfare Executive and the United States Office of Strategic Services. The newspaper was
  dropped on the Germans daily from 25 April 1944 until the end of the war. However, we see
  that no newspaper was disseminated from 30 May to 2 June. Then there was a single drop,
  and then no more until 6 June. 992,000 copies of the 6 June newspaper were printed and the
  headline story was the Allied invasion. Some of the text is:</b></p>
  <p><b><i>ATLANTIC WALL BREACHED IN SEVERAL PLACES</i></b></p>
  <p><b><i>Tanks have penetrated deep inland: bitter fighting against
  paratroopers.</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>According to latest reports, the Atlantic Wall has been breached in several
    places after the amphibious landing by Anglo-American armored units on the French channel
    coast two hours after dawn this morning. Bitter fighting is being reported from the Seine
    estuary and from Normandy. Large paratrooper units and airborne troops equipped with their
    own artillery and light armored vehicles had been dropped in advance last night where they
    successfully secured a number of Luftwaffe airfields in surprise attacks. They have joined
    forces in several places with the armored units now driving inland from the coast.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The German defenders in the bunkers of the Atlantic Wall are now being attacked
    from the sea, the air and the land.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The naval artillery of the English and American battleships and cruisers now has
    the whole area covered. The harbor installations on the coast are now also under
    bombardment. The first port to come under attack was Le Havre. The fortifications and
    defensive fighting positions from Normandy through to Calais are now being attacked from
    high and low-level by vast bomber formations protected on all sides by fighters. The few
    Luftwaffe fighters and other armed aircraft are powerless in the face of this overwhelming
    air superiority. To the rear, paratroops and airborne troops have made contact with groups
    of the French resistance.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The overwhelming air superiority is making it impossible for the German command
    to get a complete picture of the situation due to the lack of any aerial reconnaissance.
    Communication with the various coastal sectors is also problematic. Alert state 3 was
    called for the complete Atlantic Wall and the military command shortly before midnight
    yesterday as the first airborne landings were being reported.</i></b></p>
    <p><i>The actual invasion however began just after dawn. Long lines of assault boats and
    landing craft, escorted by countless numbers of destroyers, gunboats and escort ships of
    all types approached the coast under cover of smoke and a naval bombardment from cruisers
    and battleships. Fast patrol boats from Cherbourg, Le Havre and Ijmuiden were heroically
    sacrificed after being sent up against the superior allied force.</i></p>
    <p><i>What is in readiness? The 5000 kilometers of Atlantic Wall from the North Cape to
    Bayonne is being held by 60 German divisions. That is three-quarters of a million men
    spread all over the occupied West to defend attacks from all directions. On average there
    are 18 aircraft for each division in the West (during the campaign in France each division
    had 80 aircraft). The Anglo-Americans recently had 160 aircraft per division for Rome.
    Anglo-American air superiority in the west is reckoned to be 12:1. The main responsibility
    for naval defense on the high seas falls on the U-boats. The North Sea, the Channel and
    the Atlantic are defended by 60 torpedo boats, the same number of minesweepers and a few
    forward flotillas. No large German warship is situated further west than Kiel.</i></p>

  <p><b>Sternenbanner</b></p>
  <p><b><i>Sternenbanner</i> (Stars and Stripes) was a 4-page Allied propaganda newspaper
  dropped on the Germans to keep them updated on the true status of the war. We depict issue
  13, coded USG 44, dated 8 June 1944. The newspaper was dropped from 17 June to 21 June
  1944. The first page of the newspaper depicts Allied landing craft on the beaches of
  Normandy. The headline and some of the paragraph headings are:</b></p>
  <p><b><i>The opening of the Fourth Front</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The Allied landing! Heroes bring the landing craft up to hundred meters from the
    beaches of Normandy under the protection of heavy naval guns.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>It is interesting to note that in the United States this was always called ‚ÄúThe
  Second Front,‚Äù yet we find on two of these leaflets the term ‚ÄúFourth Front‚Äù
  used to demoralize the Germans military with the concept that they are being attacked on
  all sides.</b></p>
  <p><b>The British <i>Evening Standard</i> of 5 April 1944 says about the <i>Sternenbanner</i>:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>A newspaper published in London is regularly delivered to Berlin and all the
    other bombed cities throughout Germany and occupied Europe by British and United States
    bombers. It is the 4-page Sternenbanner (Stars and Stripes). The bombers drop it on
    Germany after they have deposited their bombs. The paper is published in German, Dutch,
    French and Flemish, and is prepared by a team of experienced journalists and printed on a
    special lightweight paper. Britain foots the bill for producing the paper, but it is
    produced under the auspices of the United States Office of War Information.</i></b></p>

  <p>Landser-post for the Germans in Southern France</p>
  <p>The American Armed Forces and the Office of War Information and the Office of Strategic
  Services were all printing newspapers and dropping them over Germany and the occupied
  nations. This newspaper is coded AF 125/34. Looking at my <i>Guide to Series codes used on
  Air-Dropped Propaganda Leaflets during WWII</i>, I find that they state that
  &#34;AF&#34; was for ‚ÄúGerman troops in the south of France from by Great Britain,
  the U.S and France starting in 1944.‚Äù So, this would be the Allies and the Free
  French Government-in-exile joining to raise the morale of the occupied French people. I
  chose this issue because it mentions the Allied landings in France in the center panel of
  the first page:</p>
  <p><i>Blitzkrieg in the West</i></p>
  <p><i>Encirclement threatens:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>When, on June 6, General Eisenhower‚Äôs troops landed in Normandy, and broke
    through the Atlantic Wall in a breach 100 kilometers wide, the German High Command had to
    consider the following important question: Is this the first of many planned landing
    operations in western Europe, or is this attack intended to lead up to the decisive battle
    in the West?</i></p>
    <p><i>The fate of the German reserves hangs upon the answer to this question. In this
    uncertain position, Rommel was compelled to hold back the greater part of his strategic
    reserves, so as to have them ready to meet new landing operations which had to be
    expected.</i></p>
    <p><i>Events have shown that Rommel was the victim of a mistake, and that the Normandy
    landing represented the commencement of the decisive battle for France. After putting into
    use again the Port of Cherbourg, the Americans in the Western Sector of the Cherbourg
    peninsula attacked in force, and after a successful break through near Avranches started a
    blitzkrieg which for sheer speed puts anything yet seen into the shade. Swift American
    armored units are making a lightning advance toward the southeast and southwest, and have
    reached the mouth of the Loire and cut off the peninsula of Brittany. The most important
    war ports on the Atlantic; Brest, Lorient, St. Nazaire and Nantes have already been taken
    or are immediately threatened. </i></p>
    <p><i><b>Other American tank units are advancing in the direction of Paris. They have
    taken the towns of Mayenne and Laval and are now less than 200 km from Paris. They have
    been ordered to advance on Paris as quickly as possible, circumventing the German
    fortified positions. The FFI are working with them in the closest cooperation and are
    dealing with the surrounded German positions. German resistance is completely smashed.
    There can be no more talk of organized resistance in this area.</b></i></p>
    <p><b><i>German units stationed in Southern France are threatened with encirclement by
    this advance. Occupation of the French capital would cut off their most important line of
    retreat. Just as on the East Front, the great mistake of Hitler‚Äôs policy is making
    itself felt here, where by ignoring the advice of his military experts, he is sending the
    once so great and powerful German Army from defeat to defeat.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>One might almost think from reading this critique that the Allies wanted the Germans to
  leave Paris an open city and retreat. It would have meant less Allied death and the
  salvation of the city under German rule. Of course, it would have meant the escape of most
  of the German Army, but I do not think the Allies were worried about this at the time. The
  landing and rapid advance was the most important mission.</p>

  <p>De Vliegende Hollande ‚Äì (The Flying Dutchman)</p>
  <p>The above newspaper-leaflet was printed by the Allies and dropped over Holland to keep
  them advised on the current war situation. On 22 May 1942, the first issue of 30,000
  copies was dropped over Holland in what the Allies call the ‚ÄúWeekly Magazine
  Distributed by the Allied Air Forces.&#34; In this 8 June 1944 edition, two days after
  the invasion, the Dutch are told of the ‚ÄúLanding of the Allies in Normandy.‚Äù </p>
  <p><b>Erdmann says that the Allies dropped about nine million leaflets supporting D-Day.</b></p>
  <p>Carl Berger mentions the enormous numbers of leaflets produced after D-Day and the
  introduction of leaflet artillery in <i>An Introduction to Wartime Leaflets, </i>
  Special Operations Research Office, operating under contract with the 
  Department of the Army. 
	Some of his comments are:</p>
	<blockquote><p><i>
	Early in 1944, after the office which became the Psychological Warfare 
	Division (PWD) was created at SHAEF in England, plans were initiated for the 
	leaflet phase of OVERLORD, the invasion of Western Europe. For the guidance 
	of Allied propagandists, a general memorandum was published on 11 March 
	1944--SHAEF Operation Memorandum Number 8. Several days after this, a 
	planning paper was prepared describing the objective of the leaflet plan: 
	&#34;to prepare the populations of the occupied countries in North-West Europe 
	for an eventual invasion.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	This early planning paper discussed several of the problems involved in 
	setting up a leaflet program. For example, care had to be taken not to 
	encourage premature action on the part of the occupied peoples. They were 
	simply to.be given instructions on how to behave in the event of invasion 
	and on ways to assist the defeat of the enemy at the appropriate moment 
	after D-Day.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	In March 1944 an attempt was made to estimate the airlift required to 
	implement the propaganda plan for the invasion. It was estimated that 312 
	sorties would be required to drop 131,600,000 leaflets over a three-month 
	period; of these, 120,000,000 were to be dropped over France and the rest 
	over Belgium, Holland, Norway, and Denmark.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	On April 22 a revised leaflet production and dissemination program was 
	prepared calling for distribution of 320,000,000 leaflets each month until 
	D-Day, about 85 per cent to be addressed to civilian populations, and 15 per 
	cent directly to German troops.</i></p>
	<p><i>
	
	As D-Day approached, the Psychological Warfare Division took over more and 
	more of the leaflet program. On 2 June 1944, in preparation for the actual 
	landings, two printing presses in England were put under security control to 
	print the invasion leaflets themselves. These D-Day leaflets included an 
	invasion address from General Eisenhower to the peoples of the occupied 
	countries, telling them what to expect and do, and supporting leaflets 
	signed by the exiled governments in London. In addition, special leaflets 
	were prepared for the French and Belgian transport workers, for German 
	troops in the actual landing zone, and for the German reserves who were 
	moving up. A last-minute, special warning leaflet also was produced for the 
	French population in the zone of operations and dropped on D-Day, one hour 
	before the intensive Allied bombings began. During the operations that 
	followed an estimated 34,000,000 leaflets were disseminated in direct 
	support of the Normandy landings. In the entire invasion month of June 1944, 
	a total of over 87,000,000 SHAEF leaflets in French, German, Polish, 
	Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, and Czech were dropped over Europe.</i></p></blockquote>

    <p><i>The major effort was made by the Special Leaflet Squadron, whose standard aircraft
    were the heavy bombers, B-17&#39;s and B-24s. Between D-Day and 1 February 1945 it new 1,133
    sorties, mostly at night, and distributed 701,040,000 leaflets.</i></p>
    <p><i><b>From the Allied landings on D-Day until V-E Day on 7 May 1945, a total of
    3,240,000,000 leaflets were distributed from English bases: 405,000,000 by the Royal Air
    Force; 1,577,000,000 by the Special Leaflet Squadron; 1,176,000,000 by the Eighth Air
    Force on daylight bombing missions, and 82,000,000 by medium bombers of the Allied
    Expeditionary Forces before they moved to the continent.</b></i></p>
    <p><i>From D-Day through April 1945, a total of over 3,500,000,000 leaflet units, covering
    a-range from single-unit leaflets to 48-page booklets, were set, printed and
    dispatched--the largest percentage of them being rushed through to meet delivery dates.</i></p>
    <p><i>The lessons of the Mediterranean experience were used in planning for leaflet
    operations in support of the D-Day landings. As a consequence, an artillery liaison
    officer was attached to the first propaganda unit which landed after D-Day and, by the end
    of June 1944, some 900 rounds of propaganda shells had been fired on the First U.S. Army
    front alone. When the usefulness of the leaflet shell had been demonstrated, the idea was
    quickly accepted, and leaflet dissemination by Allied artillerymen increased on all
    sectors of the Western front until the end of the war in Europe.</i></p>

  <p><b>You Have Been Trapped!</b></p>
  <p><b>The second German leaflet warns the Allies that they are fighting for a cause that
  will ultimately destroy their own countries. Notice that the leaflet is coded E114 / 3.44.
  The ‚ÄúE‚Äù is believed to stand for ‚ÄúEnglander.‚Äù The 3.44 indicates that
  the German prepared this leaflet as early as March. Apparently, it was stored awaiting the
  invasion and disseminated in June 1944. There are a whole series of such leaflets, and we will mention more below. Some
  of the text on the front of this leaflet is:</b></p>
  <p><b><i>YOU HAVE BEEN TRAPPED!</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>You have landed on the Continent to face the armed might of Germany ‚Äì but
    not for the benefit of Britain!...The Bolsheviks alone will profit from your sacrifices.
    You have been trapped into risking your life for but one purpose ‚Äì The Bolshevization
    of Europe‚Ä¶</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b><i>WHY SHOULD <u>YOU</u> FIGHT FOR STALIN?</i></b></p>
    <p>
	The back of the leaflet is even more interesting from the point of the 
	message, which mentions the invasion. Some of the text is:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <p><b><i>
	  INVASION ñ WHY?</i></b></p>
	  <p><b><i>
	  Have you any idea of the purpose of the attempted invasion of Western

  <p>When you left your Wife</p>
  <p>This leaded is coded SW5 and we know that the SW codes was used by the German Skorpion
  propaganda unit in Normandy against both Allied troops and French civilians. This leaflet
  seems aimed at the British because it depicts a British Corporal saying goodbye to his
  wife. The general theme of the propaganda on the front and back is that the Allies are no
  longer facing third-rate soldiers. They are now on the Continent and up against highly
  trained and well-armed German soldiers who will fight to the death to protect their wives
  and families. The leaflet ends with:</p>
  <p><i>Did you write home already?Do it at once! A few hours from now, it
  may be too late!</i></p>

  <p><b>Why die for Stalin? Why die for the Jews?</b></p><b>
  <p>With the single exception of E108, all of the leaflets the Germans prepared in advance
  of the invasion are text only. I have added this leaflet because it is the only one that
  has an image on the front. The image depicts John Avery sitting in front of a typewriter.
  Your first impression is that this must be a well-known and trusted writer or broadcaster.
  In fact, he was a British Fascist who proposed to the <i>Wehrmacht</i> the formation of a
  British volunteer force (the British Free Corps) and made recruitment efforts and
  propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany. </p>

  <p>British Free Corps patch and sleeve insignia</p>
  <p>Adolf Hitler was impressed by Amery and allowed him to remain in Germany as a guest of
  the Reich. During WWII the Germans authorized a number of foreign ‚ÄúLegions‚Äù made
  up of Croatian, Belgian, Estonian, Latvian anti-Communists among others. Somewhere between
  300,000 and 500,000 men joined these anti-communist legions. The British were not quick to
  join the Nazis and research has found less than 60 men who admit to being a member at one
  time or another. At no time did it reach more than 27 men in strength, a bit smaller than
  a German Army platoon.</p>
  <p>Amery made a series of pro-German propaganda radio broadcasts, attempting to appeal to
  Britons to join the war on communism. After the war he was put on trial and on the first
  day, 28 November 1945, Amery pleaded guilty to eight charges of treason. He was
  immediately sentenced to death. The entire proceedings lasted just eight minutes.</p>
  <p>The text on this leaflet once again blames the Communists and the Jews for WWII,
  conveniently ignoring the fact that Hitler started the war by invading Poland, declared
  war of the United States for no reason, and attacked their ally, the USSR, without
  warning.</p>

  <p><b>CAUGHT LIKE FOXES IN A TRAP</b></p>
  <p><b>The third German leaflet is all-text with a divide and conquer message by the
  Germans trying to convince the Allied that they are fighting for the Soviet Union. The
  leaflet asks why the Germans have held back their secret weapons. Of course, the American
  soldiers did not know that the Germans were fooled by Allied deception, that the Germans
  believed that Calais was the actual invasion target, and that Hitler would not release his
  panzers wanting to save them for the real attack at the Pas de Calais, the closest area of
  France to Britain. Some of the text is:</b></p>
  <p><b><i>CAUGHT LIKE FOXES IN A TRAP</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Why has Jerry waited ten days after the landings to use his so-called secret
    weapon behind your back? Doesn‚Äôt that strike you as queer? It looks very much like
    after waiting for you to cross the Channel; he had set a TRAP for you‚Ä¶Meanwhile the
    robot planes, flying low, scatter over London and Southern England explosives, the power
    and incendiary efficiency of which are without precedent‚Ä¶.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The back of the leaflet quotes stories from six newspapers. For instance:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Daily Telegraph ‚Äì An incredible stream of German pilotless bombers is
    dropping a rain of high explosives over southern England. There is widespread destruction
    in many places‚Ä¶.</i></b></p>

  <p>The Second Invasion‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>This German leaflet uses an interesting argument. It implies that when the British
  first went to the Continent to help France fight the Germans that was an invasion. Of
  course, it was not. It then says that this second invasion, in reality the first real
  invasion, is also doomed for failure and great loss of life. This leaflet is coded
  Kr-013-d-44. It is one of a series that uses various arguments, mostly the economic
  destruction of the Empire, to convince the British that the war has been lost already or
  will lead them to ruin. It also reminds the British that Rommel who so often beat them in
  North Africa is in charge of the defense of France. It casually mentions German bombers
  and the V weapons without actually naming them, and even brags that like Napoleon, Hitler
  was a corporal. It is a bit worn after about 75 years, but the propaganda argument is
  still interesting.</p>
  <p><img src="https://psywarrior.com/DdayDeathDay1324.jpg" width="392" height="552" alt="DdayDeathDay1324.jpg (119366 bytes)"/></p>
  <p>D-Day means Death-Day</p>
  <p>I added this German leaflet at the last moment because it doesn‚Äôt quite make
  sense. First of all, it was dropped in Italy not in Western Europe, and secondly, D-day
  was 6 June 1944 and this leaflet is dated March 1945. Why wait eight months to drop a
  D-day leaflet? The back of the leaflet depicts a calendar of 1944 and 1945 with a red
  question mark and the text:</p>
  <p><i>D-Day in Italy too?</i></p>
  <p><b>I assume that the Germans are saying to the Allies that thousands died during the
  Invasion of Europe and once again thousands will die in Italy. The leaflet was designed
  and disseminated by the SS organization ‚ÄúKurt Eggers,‚Äù section <i>Sudstern </i>(Southeast),
  for British and American troops in Italy in March 1945. After the attempt on Hitler‚Äôs
  life by the Army Generals, the fuhrer gave the propaganda operation to the SS and his
  trusted Heinrich Himmler.</b></p>

  <p><b>Proclamation‚Ä¶</b></p>
  <p>This interesting German proclamation to the occupied Channel Island of Jersey is dated
  6 June 1944 and sent by Colonel Heine. The Commander of ‚ÄúFortress Jersey‚Äù
  worries that his subjects will get overly excited. He tells that that if that happens he
  will take hostages and if necessary, execute them.</p>
