    <h1>SQLite Slaps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Fun fact: SQLite is the most deployed and most used database. There are over one trillion (1000000000000 or a million million) SQLite databases in active use.</p><p>It is maintained by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/crew.html">three people</a>. They donâ€™t allow <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">outside contributions</a>.</p><h2 id="it-is-everywhere">It is everywhere</h2><p>SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines combined. Billions and billions of copies of SQLite exist in the wild. SQLite is in:</p><ul><li>Every Mobile (Android, iOS, Windows) device</li><li>Every Mac or Windows10 machine</li><li>Every Web browser</li><li>Every instance of Skype, iTunes, and Dropbox client</li><li>PHP and Python</li><li>Most TV, set-top cable boxes and automotive multimedia systems</li><li>Countless millions of other applications</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-they-cook">How do they cook?</h2><p>There are over 600 lines of test code for every line of code in SQLite. Tests cover 100% of branches in the library. The test suite is extremely diverse, including fuzz tests, boundary value tests, regression tests, and tests that simulate operating system crashes, power losses, I/O errors, and out-of-memory errors.</p><hr/><p><small>This writing is not my own. The first section is a rehash of the words from <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">SQLite Most Deployed</a> page. The testing section paragraph entirely taken verbatim from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3554821.3554842">SQLite: past, present, and future</a> paper.</small><br/></p></article></div></div>
