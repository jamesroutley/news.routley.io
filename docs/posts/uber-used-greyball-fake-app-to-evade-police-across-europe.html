Its licence was restored with conditions attached, including that it promised to notify Transport for London (TfL) of occasions on which staff in its London office had been aware that Greyball was being used. Uber said it had done this.</p><p>An Uber spokesperson said: “Greyball was … considered in depth as part of our licence appeal to the magistrates court in 2018. At that appeal, the court ultimately <a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/uber-licensing-appeal-final-judgment.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">found Uber to be a fit and proper operator</a>. Greyball was never misused in the UK, and external law firms conducted investigations into the potential misuse of Greyball in other countries, as required by TfL. In 2022, TfL itself found Uber to be a ‘fit and proper’ operator and granted a 30-month licence to operate in London.”</p><p>They added: “We stopped using these tools in 2017 when Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO and, as we have said many times, they should never have been used.
