    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>By <!-- -->Sam Lambert<!-- --> | <time datetime="2025-09-22">September 22, 2025</time></p><p>PlanetScale for Postgres is now generally available and out of private preview. To create a Postgres database, <a href="https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up">sign up</a> or log in to your PlanetScale account, create a new database, and select Postgres. If you are looking to migrate from another Postgres provider to PlanetScale, you can use our <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/imports/postgres-imports">migration guides</a> to get started. Finally, if you have a large or complex migration, we can help you via our sales team at <a href="mailto:postgres@planetscale.com">postgres@planetscale.com</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-planetscale-for-postgres"><a href="#what-is-planetscale-for-postgres">What is PlanetScale for Postgres?</a></h2><p>Our mission is simple: bring you the fastest and most reliable databases with the best developer experience. We have done this for 5 years now with our managed Vitess product, allowing companies like Cursor, Intercom, and Block to scale beyond previous limits.</p><p>We are so excited to bring this to Postgres. Our proprietary operator allows us to bring the maturity of PlanetScale and the performance of Metal to an even wider audience. We bring you the best of Postgres and the best of PlanetScale in one product.</p><h2 id="customers-on-planetscale-for-postgres"><a href="#customers-on-planetscale-for-postgres">Customers on PlanetScale for Postgres</a></h2><p>Hundreds of companies already trust PlanetScale for Postgres to power their production workloads. We say this every time we launch something, but we prefer you hear about real-world usage straight from our customers.

Built by the team behind Vitess combining the best of Vitess and Postgres. Neki is not a fork of Vitess. Vitess’ achievements are enabled by leveraging MySQL’s strengths and engineering around its weaknesses. To achieve Vitess’ power for Postgres we are architecting from first principles and building alongside design partners at scale. When we are ready we will release Neki as an open source project suitable for running the most demanding Postgres workloads.
