<p data-block-key="rol2n">I frequently notice folks asking or answering questions like &#34;how many contributors does this open source project have?&#34; or &#34;how much contribution is this project getting?&#34; Here&#39;s an example of why those aren&#39;t simple questions.</p><p data-block-key="65pa0"><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/"><code>ffmpeg</code></a> is a mindbendingly powerful command-line tool to play and transform audio and video files. There are a zillion commands and flags you can use and it&#39;s hard to memorize them. So, several years ago, <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2015/11/28/ffmprovisr-at-amia-number-avhack15/">Ashley Blewer started</a> a great website called <a href="https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/">ffmprovisr</a>. It&#39;s a cookbook of useful <code>ffmpeg</code> recipes, like <a href="https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/#join_files">&#34;join 2 files of the same type&#34;</a> and <a href="https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/#compare_video_fingerprints">&#34;compare two video files for content similarity using perceptual hashing&#34;</a>. It&#39;s grown into an open source project with many users and multiple committers, <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2017/10/31/ffmprovisr-redesign/">gotten redesigned</a>, and even inspired imitators.</p><p data-block-key="1456s">So. Would you call ffmprovisr a contribution to <code>ffmpeg</code>? It&#39;s useful documentation for <code>ffmpeg</code>, but doesn&#39;t live in the <code>ffmpeg</code> repository/repositories. It helps more people use <code>ffmpeg</code> (and probably reduces the number of support queries its maintainers get). By creating ffmprovisr, has Blewer become a contributor to <code>ffmpeg</code>? Should we have a category like &#34;indirect contribution&#34;, and, if so, how would we delineate that?</p><p data-block-key="ffb41">Let&#39;s go older. In the mid-2000s, the biggest ad for the Ruby programming language was the Rails web framework. Rails was the gateway through which a ton of programmers started to learn and love Ruby. So every Rails committer, documenter, trainer, and bug reporter also ended up doing a favor for Ruby. Can we say that Rails is a contribution to Ruby? Is it <i>useful</i> to say that?</p><p data-block-key="eqt3h">It depends on what further question you&#39;re trying to answer. We ask &#34;what is a contribution?&#34; as part of asking &#34;how much contribution are we getting?&#34; &#34;how many contributors do they have?&#34; or &#34;who are this project&#39;s contributors?&#34;. And those questions have different answers depending on what you want to <b>do</b> with the answers, because <b>these</b> questions have different answers:</p><ul><li data-block-key="5hfev">We just had a breach. Whose credentials need to get rotated?</li><li data-block-key="9drg3">Next week we&#39;ll host a livechat to work on the roadmap. Whom should we invite?</li><li data-block-key="4ocum">We&#39;re moving the trunk branch from &#34;master&#34; to main&#34;. Who needs notification and maybe training?</li><li data-block-key="ba5k0">Should our company keep putting energy into this as an open source project for the recruiting and marketing benefits, or take it proprietary?</li><li data-block-key="altnt"><a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift</a> has money available for our project. How should we split it up?</li><li data-block-key="fhd9b">If we give your project a financial grant, are we investing in a group that&#39;s more gender-diverse than the average open source project?</li><li data-block-key="a3gco">A conference wants us to give a talk. Who can speak authoritatively about the project? And who can speak on the project&#39;s behalf?</li><li data-block-key="4ho74">Should we recruit more user support/bug triage people who have specific experience with [a popular topic]?</li><li data-block-key="cd4n4">Should we make the effort of having this developer documentation translated into Chinese?</li><li data-block-key="3m864">If we participate in <a href="https://www.outreachy.org">Outreachy</a>, which includes both code and process contributions, how many people might be able to mentor the apprentices?</li><li data-block-key="43u4r">Which projects should my project integrate with/support/depend on?</li><li data-block-key="ben7b">Of these five projects, which is the most likely to <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2021/12/17/why-zulip-will-stand-the-test-of-time/">still be around</a> in five years?</li></ul><p data-block-key="4jq6t">And so on. (These questions range through most of <a href="http://changeset.nyc/stuckness/">the five major ways projects get stuck</a>.) For some of those questions, answers for a project like <code>ffmpeg</code> change depending on whether you ignore ffmprovisr, or catalog it as something like a plugin or extension to <code>ffmpeg</code>, a contribution to the <code>ffmpeg</code> ecology. And some answers for a language, framework, or operating system -- something like Ruby, where usage depends on people making useful tools built on top of the foundation you provide -- <b>only</b> make sense if you incorporate data about ecology inhabitants like Rails.</p><p data-block-key="8mpsl">Sometimes you can answer those questions just by checking some pre-compiled stats in a GitHub repository. Sometimes you can&#39;t, because the answers aren&#39;t there; they&#39;re in a different repository altogether, or on StackOverflow, on mailing lists, or in a mix of places including individuals&#39; private conversations.</p><p data-block-key="1lgin">If you want to dive deeper, I don&#39;t know who&#39;s thought more about them than <a href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics Open Source Software)</a>, and as such, <a href="https://chaoss.community/software/#fws_627bd742414fa">GrimoireLab tries to actually gather information from lots of sources</a> instead of just the GitHub API. And even so, any quantitative measure will probably need to be supplemented by a qualitative assessment that can catch ecology-level factors, as in the case of ffmprovisr, if you want to make a significant choice based on it.</p><p data-block-key="4cptl">If you want to work in the general area of quantitative contributor metrics, CHAOSS will welcome you. But if you&#39;re not, then instead of looking for the One Grand Definition of &#34;contributor&#34; or &#34;contribution&#34;, get more concrete about the questions you want to answer so you can go from there.</p>
