<p>Integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT directly into your .NET app. Use a single powerful component model to handle all your web UI needs with Blazor. Deploy your mobile applications to the latest version of iOS and Android with .NET MAUI. Discover new language enhancements that make your code more concise and expressive with C# 12.  </p>
<p>Let’s look at what’s new in .NET 8. </p>
<h2 id="unparalleled-performance-experience-the-fastest-net-to-date">Unparalleled Performance – Experience the fastest .NET to date</h2>
<p>.NET 8 comes with thousands of performance <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/">improvements</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-8/">across</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-8-performance-improvements-in-dotnet-maui/">the</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/this-arm64-performance-in-dotnet-8/">stack</a>. A new code generator called Dynamic Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) that optimizes your code based on real-world usage is enabled by default and can improve the performance of your apps up to 20%. The AVX-512 instruction set, which is now supported, enables you to perform parallel operations on 512-bit vectors of data, meaning you can process much more data in less time. The primitive types (numerical and beyond) now implement a new formattable and parsable interface, which enable them to directly format and parse as UTF-8 without any transcoding overhead.</p>
<p>Every year we talk about the performance gains across .NET. This year we continue our quest to push the performance of .NET to new heights. From the latest TechEmpower benchmarks with .NET 8, we’re seeing improvements in the JSON API scenario of 18%, hitting nearly one million requests per second with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/"><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/Performance2.png" alt="TechEmpower requests per second (RPS)"/></a></p>
<p>The Fortunes scenario is closer to a real-world workload, including database access and server-side HTML rendering. In this test, we see an even larger improvement of 24%, now over 300K requests per second with ASP.NET Core.</p>
<h2 id="net-aspire-an-opinionated-stack-to-build-observable-production-ready-cloud-native-applications">.NET Aspire – An opinionated stack to build observable, production-ready cloud-native applications</h2>
<p>.NET Aspire is a stack for building resilient, observable, and configurable cloud-native applications with .NET. It includes a curated set of components enhanced for cloud-native by including telemetry, resilience, configuration, and health checks by default. Combined with a sophisticated but simple local developer experience, .NET Aspire makes it easy to discover, acquire, and configure essential dependencies for cloud-native applications on day 1 as well as day 100. The <a href="https://aka.ms/aspireannouncement">first preview</a> of .NET Aspire is available today.</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/aspireannouncement"><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/Aspire-CTAs.png" alt=".NET Aspire"/></a></p>
<h2 id="net-8-container-enhancements-more-secure-compact-and-productive">.NET 8 Container Enhancements – More secure, compact, and productive</h2>
<p>Package your applications with <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/securing-containers-with-rootless/">containers more easily and more securely than ever with .NET</a>. Every .NET image includes a non-root user, enabling more secure containers with one-line configuration. The .NET SDK tooling publishes container images without a Dockerfile and are non-root by default. Deploy your containerized apps faster due to smaller .NET base images – including new experimental variants of our images that deliver truly minimal application sizes for native AOT. Opt-in to even more security hardening with the new Chiseled Ubuntu image variants to reduce your attack surface even further. Using Dockerfiles or SDK tooling, build apps and container images for any architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/securing-containers-with-rootless/"><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/Containers2.png" alt="Modern containers"/></a></p>
<h2 id="native-aot-journey-towards-higher-density-sustainable-compute">Native AoT – Journey towards higher density sustainable compute</h2>
<p>Compile your .NET apps into <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot">native code</a> that uses less memory and starts instantly. No need to wait for the JIT (just-in-time) compiler to compile the code at run time. No need to deploy the JIT compiler and IL code. AOT apps deploy just the code that’s needed for your app. Your app is now empowered to run in restricted environments where a JIT compiler isn’t allowed.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot"><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/AOTOptimizations3.png" alt="Before and After AOT"/></a></p>

<h2 id="blazor-build-full-stack-web-applications-with-net">Blazor – Build full stack web applications with .NET</h2>
<p>Blazor in .NET 8 can use both the server and client together to handle all your web UI needs. It’s full stack web UI! With several new enhancements focused towards optimizing page load time, scalability, and elevating the user experience, developers can now use <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly</a> in the same app, automatically shifting users from the server to the client at run time. Your .NET code runs significantly faster on WebAssembly thanks to the new “Jiterpreter”-based runtime and new built-in components. As a part enhancing the overall <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-with-identity-in-dotnet-8/">authentication, authorization, and identity management in .NET 8</a>, Blazor now supports generating a full Blazor-based Identity UI.</p>
