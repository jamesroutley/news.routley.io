    <h1>Oxidizing Ubuntu: adopting Rust utilities by default</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>

<h2>[LWN subscriber-only content]</h2>
</p><div>

<p>If all goes according to plan, the Ubuntu project will soon be
replacing many of the traditional GNU utilities with implementations
written in Rust, such as those created by the <a href="https://uutils.github.io/">uutils</a> project, which we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1007907/">covered</a> in
February. Wholesale replacement of core utilities at the heart of a
Linux distribution is no small matter, which is why Canonical&#39;s VP of
engineering, Jon Seager, has released <a href="https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr?tab=readme-ov-file#oxidizr"><tt>oxidizr</tt></a>. It
is a command-line utility that helps users easily enable or disable
the Rust-based utilities to test their suitability. Seager is calling
for help with testing and for users to provide feedback with their
experiences ahead of a possible switch for Ubuntu 25.10, an <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle">interim release</a>
scheduled for October 2025. So far, responses from the Ubuntu
community seem positive if slightly skeptical of such a major
change.</p>

<h4>Next 20 years of Ubuntu</h4>

<p>Ubuntu celebrated 20 years since its <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/107267/">first release</a> in
2024 last year. Seager reflected on that milestone and <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/engineering-ubuntu-for-the-next-20-years/55000">published
his vision</a> for the next 20 years of Ubuntu in February. One of his
themes for the future is modernization, calling on the project to
constantly assess the foundations of the distribution against the
needs of its users:</p>

<blockquote>
We should look deeply at the tools we ship with Ubuntu by default -
selecting for tools that have resilience, performance and
maintainability at their core. There are countless examples in the
open source community of tools being re-engineered, and re-imagined
using tools and practices that have only relatively recently become
available. Some of my personal favourites include command-line
utilities such as <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a>, and <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a>, the new <a href="https://ghostty.org/">ghostty</a> terminal emulator, and more
foundational projects such as the uutils rewrite of 
coreutils in Rust. Each
of these projects are at varying levels of maturity, but have
demonstrated a vision for a more modern Unix-like experience that
emphasizes resilience, performance and usability.
</blockquote>

<p>On March 12, Seager published a <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995">a follow-up</a> to introduce his plan to start
adopting some of the tools as defaults—with an eye to having
them in place for the next Ubuntu long-term support (LTS) release,
26.04. The rationale for the switch is primarily &#34;<q>the
enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust
ports</q>&#34;. He cited a <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/">blog
post</a> by <a href="https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html">Rust
core developer</a> Niko Matsakis. The post, in a nutshell, is about
Matsakis&#39;s vision for using Rust to write (or rewrite) foundational
software; that is, &#34;<q>the software that underlies everything
else</q>&#34;.</p>

<blockquote>
The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make
our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/daroc2/claim">becoming one of them</a>?
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have been following the continuing debates and
discussions about using Rust will find familiar themes in
Matsakis&#39;s arguments in its favor: Rust provides the performance of
C/C++ without demanding perfection from developers, it
provides reliability, and it makes developers more productive regardless
of experience level. Its reliability makes it particularly suitable
for foundational software because &#34;<q>when foundations fail,
everything on top fails also</q>&#34;. Given Ubuntu&#39;s widespread
adoption, Seager wrote, &#34;<q>it behooves us to be absolutely certain
we&#39;re shipping the most resilient and trustworthy software we
can</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Seager also thinks that embracing Rust will help meet another of
his goals for Ubuntu, increasing the number of contributors. Not
because Rust is necessarily easier to use than C, but because it
provides a framework that makes it harder for contributors to commit
potentially unsafe code. Presumably, though it was unsaid, that would
make Rust a more attractive language for those interested in
contributing but not interested in programming in C for whatever reason.</p>

<h4><tt>oxidizr</tt></h4>

<p>The abstract possibility that Rust utilities would be better, or
even feasible, for Ubuntu is no substitute for hands-on
experience. To that end, Seager created <tt>oxidizr</tt> as a way to quickly
swap in (and out) Rust utilities in place of the traditional
counterparts with relatively low risk. He released the first version, <a href="https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>,
on March 7. It is available under the Apache 2.0 license
and, as one might expect, written in Rust.</p>

<p>The project is not yet packaged for Ubuntu, nor does Seager have a
<a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">personal package
archive</a> (PPA) set up for users to install <tt>oxidizr</tt> with
APT. There are <a href="https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr/releases">binary releases</a>
on GitHub, or users can install the tool using <tt>cargo</tt>:</p>

<pre>    $ cargo install --git https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr
</pre>

<p>The binary releases may be the easiest way to get started, as <tt>oxidizr</tt> requires the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.exists.html"><tt>exists</tt></a>
function in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html"><tt>fs</tt></a> module,
but <tt>exists</tt> was added in Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/09/05/Rust-1.81.0.html">1.81.0</a>
(released in September 2024) while the Rust version in
Ubuntu 24.10 is still at 1.80.1. I used
<tt>rustup</tt> to install the most recent stable version of Rust, and
then used <tt>cargo</tt> to install <tt>oxidizr</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>oxidizr</tt> utility calls a set of utilities that can be
independently replaced an &#34;experiment&#34;. Experiments are Rust modules
that define the packages to be installed (or removed) and handle
renaming of the utilities to enable or disable use of the Rust
versions. The current <a <a="" href="https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr/tree/main/src/experiments">set
of experiments</a> include 
replacing GNU <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/">findutils</a>, or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/">diffutils</a> with the uutils 
<a href="https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/">coreutils</a>, <a href="https://uutils.github.io/findutils/">findutils</a>, or <a href="https://uutils.github.io/diffutils/">diffutils</a>, as well as
replacing traditional <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/"><tt>sudo</tt></a> with the Rust-based <a href="https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#sudo-rs"><tt>sudo-rs</tt></a>.</p>

<p>For instance, to try out <tt>sudo-rs</tt> a user would run this
command:</p>

<pre>    # oxidizr enable --experiments sudo-rs
</pre>

<p>That will install the <tt>sudo-rs</tt> package from the Ubuntu
package repository, back up the <tt>sudo</tt> binary, and create a
<tt>/usr/bin/sudo</tt> symbolic link that targets the Rust binary
(<tt>/usr/lib/cargo/bin/sudo</tt>). To enable all experiments, a user
would use the <tt>all</tt> target instead:

</p><pre>    # oxidizr enable --experiments --all
</pre>

<p>Finally, to revert the system to the traditional utilities and
remove the replacement packages from the system:

</p><pre>    # oxidizr disable --all
</pre><p>

According to
Seager, </p><tt>oxidizr</tt><p> works on all versions of Ubuntu after
24.04 LTS, but the uutils diffutils experiment is only supported
on Ubuntu 24.10 or later. He did urge users to start testing on a
virtual machine or other machine that is not their production
workstation or server for safety&#39;s sake. Seager reported that he
hasn&#39;t had many problems, but he has run into one incompatibility:
the uutils </p><tt>cp</tt><p>, </p><tt>mv</tt><p>, and </p><tt>ls</tt><p> replacements </p><a href="https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/2404">don&#39;t support
the <tt>-Z</tt> flag</a><p> yet, which is used to set the SELinux context
of a file or (in the case of </p><tt>ls</tt><p>) print a file&#39;s security
context.</p>

<p>In my brief testing, I did not run into any problems with the
uutils versions of the utilities or the changes <tt>oxidizr</tt> made
to the system in order to swap them in. However, I did note that
<tt>oxidizr</tt> does not make any changes to the system&#39;s man
pages. Even when the GNU utilities have been replaced with the uutils
versions, the GNU man pages are left in place, so &#34;<tt>man cp</tt>&#34;
still displays the GNU version. It would be good to switch the man
pages too in order to expose users to any gaps in the uutils
documentation as well as the utilities themselves.</p>

<h4>Reactions</h4>

<p>Fern Dziadulewicz <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/10">asked</a>
if the move toward uutils meant that &#34;<q>Ubuntu is actually kind of
heading towards GNUlessness</q>&#34;, as with some other Linux
distributions that shy away from GNU components. Seager <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/11">responded</a>
that people should not read too much into the change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not symbolic of any pointed move away from GNU components -
it&#39;s literally just about replacing coreutils with a more modern
equivalent.</p>

<p>Sure, the license is different, and it&#39;s a consideration, but it&#39;s
by no means a driver in the decision making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That response did not satisfy Joseph Erdosy, who <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/21">wrote</a>
that he would migrate to Fedora or Rocky Linux if Ubuntu goes through
with the change. He said that he liked Rust and the idea of better,
memory-safe alternatives, but that he was unhappy that the biggest
&#34;oxidized&#34; project was an MIT-licensed rewrite of GPL-licensed code.</p>

<blockquote>
This decision seems to align with a broader trend of companies
deprecating GPL software in favour of more permissively licensed
alternatives, often under the guise of &#34;modernization.&#34; However, the
real-world impact is clear: free software is increasingly co-opted
into proprietary ecosystems, weakening the principles that made Linux
successful.
</blockquote>

<p>A few other users quickly agreed with Erdosy, then Ian Weisser <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/24">announced</a>
that he was putting 
the topic into &#34;Slow Mode&#34; to &#34;<q>prevent piling-on until the
developers have a chance to respond and keep this topic
constructive</q>&#34;. Shortly after, Seager <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/26">responded</a>
that he did not agree that this potential move posed a threat to
Ubuntu, or its community. He reiterated that it was not
indicative of a political agenda or wider move away from GPL&#39;ed
software, and said that most of Canonical&#39;s own software is and would
continue to be GPL&#39;ed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu is a collection of software that we curate to build a
distribution. It&#39;s a project dedicated to shipping the latest, and
best open source we can find. There is no evidence of foul play, bad
practice or poor intentions from the uutils maintainers - they&#39;re a
thoughtful, dedicated community who are building their own software,
and even contributing back to GNU coreutils in some cases. They are
achieving things I think we should aspire to with Ubuntu in the coming
years, and I remain committed to giving this a chance at success -
noting that we and others will need to work closely with them to
resolve issues with locales, selinux support and other issues.</p>

<p>If the current situation changes and we believe that the interests
of the uutils project are no longer aligned with those of Ubuntu, we
can change the coreutils package we choose to ship with Ubuntu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergey Davidoff <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/3">wondered</a>
why the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianAlternatives">Debian
alternatives system</a>, which is used to designate default
applications when multiple programs with the same function are
installed, was not sufficient for experimenting with Rust
utilities. Julian Andres Klode <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/8">replied</a>
that the alternatives system would not be suitable because the
existing package would need to cooperate. He also responded to
another user, &#34;rain&#34;, who had <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/7">floated
the idea</a>
of allowing users to switch out individual commands. Klode said that
it was a bad idea to allow users to select between Rust and non-Rust
implementations on a per-command level, as it would make the resulting
systems hard to support.</p>

<p>Liam Proven <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/13">asked</a>
about support on versions of Ubuntu for architectures other than
x86_64 and Arm, such as s390 and ppc64le, since &#34;<q>the LLVM Rust
toolchain is still a little immature and code generation for other
architectures is lacking</q>&#34;. Uutils project founder and Ubuntu
developer Sylvestre Ledru <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995/14">asked</a>
if Proven had any bug reports to share, since Firefox had been using
the LLVM Rust toolchain to ship Firefox on those architectures for
years. He pointed out that uutils had been successfully building on Debian and
Ubuntu with those architectures as targets for a few years as well.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Seager said that he had met with Ledru to discuss the idea of
making uutils coreutils the default in Ubuntu 25.10, and Ledru
felt that the project was ready for that level of exposure. Now it is
just a matter of specifics, he said, and the Ubuntu Foundations team
is already working up a plan to implement this in the next release
cycle. He did acknowledge that there was a need for caution and was open to
the possibility that he would need to &#34;<q>scale back on the
ambition</q>&#34; if making the switch meant compromising stability or
reliability in an Ubuntu LTS release. If the switch doesn&#39;t work
out, it should be easy enough to revert in time for next year&#39;s LTS release.</p>

<p>To date, Ubuntu seems to be the first major Linux distribution that
has seriously considered a switch to uutils. If Ubuntu 25.10
ships with uutils coreutils, it will be a significant win for the
uutils project that grants exposure to a much larger user base than it
has enjoyed so far. The &#34;oxidize Ubuntu&#34; experiment has the
potential to accelerate Rust&#39;s adoption and inspire further attempts
to replace C-based utilities with Rust, or it might have a chilling
effect if Ubuntu runs into serious problems. Either way, the project
should be instructive for the larger community.</p>
