    <h1>OpenSSH 9.5 released with keystroke timing obfuscation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
OpenSSH 9.5 is out.  Significant changes include a transport-level ping
mechanism and keystroke timing obfuscation:
</p><blockquote>
	This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending
   	interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when
   	there is only a small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake
   	&#34;chaff&#34; keystrokes for a random interval after the last real
   	keystroke. These are controlled by a new ssh_config
   	ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.

</tbody></table><pre>OpenSSH 9.5 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">https://www.openssh.com/</a> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Changes since OpenSSH 9.4
=========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * ssh-keygen(1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
   are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
   specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
   (January 2014).
    
 * sshd(8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
   subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
   configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
   (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.

New features
------------

 * ssh(1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
   to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
   fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
   amount of data being sent. It also sends fake &#34;chaff&#34; keystrokes for
   a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
   controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    
 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
   a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
   implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the &#34;local
   extensions&#34; number space and are advertised using a &#34;ping@openssh.com&#34;
   ext-info message with a string version number of &#34;0&#34;.
    
 * sshd(8): allow override of Sybsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.

Bugfixes
--------

 * scp(1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
   directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
   the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. bz3611
    
 * ssh-keygen(1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
   sshsig signature files.
    
 * ssh(1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
   originally requested a tty.
    
 * sshd(8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    
 * sshd(8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
   and don&#39;t delay at all for the &#34;none&#34; authentication mechanism.cw
    bz3602
    
 * sshd(8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
   verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
   get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    
 * sshd(8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
    to be sent less frequently than configured.
    
 * ssh(1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused
   multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances.

Portability
-----------

 * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which
   for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream
   clang version numbers. bz#3584

 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. bz3604
