<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1991 I was working at Microsoft as a programmer, writing
programming
utilities for use by other programmers, such as a dialog editor used in
the development of Word and Excel. I programmed mostly in C for
OS/2
(back then that was a Microsoft product, and supposedly the wave of the
future). Deciding it was time to learn Windows programming
(Windows
3.0 had just come out) I jumped right in and did a graphical version of
my old VAX/VMS skiing game for VT100 terminals.
</p>

<p>The VAX version had looked something like this:
</p>

Ski for VAX/VMS
</center>

<p>The &#34;^&#34; signs are trees, and &#34;//&#34; is the skier turning slightly
right. <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski.for">The program was written in Fortran</a>, 
and used a combination of 
VT100 escape sequences and ordinary text scrolling to achieve its 
animation. I made several text-terminal video games like this in 
college (at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington) 
and they were fairly popular among the computer nerds.
</p>

<p>VAX Ski was itself inspired by an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing_(Atari_2600)">Activision game</a>
for the Atari 2600
console, which I enjoyed playing in my youth. I remember very little of 
the Activision game, but I think it looked pretty much like SkiFree.
</p>

<p>I wrote SkiFree in C on my home computer, entirely for my own
education and entertainment. One day while I was playing with it at 
work, the program manager for Windows Entertainment Pack happened to 
look over my shoulder and immediately decided he had to have this game. 
I called it WinSki, but the Microsoft marketroids hated that and decided, 
for inscrutible marketroidal reasons, to call it SkiFree. After some 
token resistance I let them have their way. Since the program was not 
originally a Microsoft product, Microsoft licensed it from me and paid 
me some trivial one-time fee (something like 100 shares of MSFT stock, 
no royalties) for its use.
</p>

<p>SkiFree was intended to run on a 386 PC with VGA display. Such
computers were not very powerful, nothing like modern PCs that can do
3-D rendering at millions of textured polygons per second.... No, in
those days there wasn&#39;t even any such thing as a &#34;video accelerator&#34; --
the VGA was just a dumb pixel buffer hanging off the excruciatingly
slow ISA bus. This made it pretty challenging to get good performance
out of even simple sprite-oriented animation! Windows didn&#39;t help
matters any by introducing several layers of abstraction between the
program and the video hardware.... I discovered that it was worth 
almost any amount of preprocessing (on the &#34;fast&#34; 386 CPU) to reduce 
the amount of video I/O (over the <b>slow</b> ISA), so I designed a 
fairly clever algorithm to combine overlapping objects/erasures and 
blt minimal regions in each frame. The result was perfectly flicker-free
transparent sprite animation at reasonable speed even on very slow 
computers, such as an old 286/EGA machine I found in the testing lab. 
Nowadays one would probably just render the sprites back-to-front in 
a memory buffer and blt the entire window on each frame.
</p>

<p>In 1993 I started working on Version 2 of SkiFree, which would have
slightly more realistic physics, multi-player, network play, robot
opponents, and sounds. I got about half of those things done (split
screen/keyboard multiplayer, very crude robots, and sound), but managed 
to get the physics completely screwed up to the point where it was no 
longer playable.  At about the same time I also lost the original 
source code and got distracted by other projects, so SkiFree sort of 
went into permanent stasis at version 1.0.
</p>

<p>In April 2005 I found the source code for SkiFree 1.03
and compiled it, so now we have a real 32-bit version that should
run on any Windows XP system, even the new 64-bit XP. It also is
more CPU-friendly (uses 1% of the CPU instead of 100%) so it won&#39;t
drain your notebook battery. There are a few other changes from 1.0 -- see
if you can spot them!
</p>

<p>In October 2005 I fixed a few bugs and released version 1.04.
(Some of the bitmap colors were wrong, and ski slope didn&#39;t 
&#34;wrap around&#34; like in 1.0.)

<h2>SkiFree on the Web</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=skifree">Google search</a>
actually returns a lot of pages about SkiFree now, and not so many
promotional &#34;buy one lift pass get one free&#34; adverts any more. Most of them
are warez download sites and &#34;cheat code&#34; lists, but there are a few gems
like this 
<a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/216/21605.html">SkiFree
clone for the TI 92 calculator</a> 
(!!). There&#39;s an 
<a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?lastnode_id=32619&amp;node_id=814916">amazingly
long article on Everything2</a> 
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree">Wikipedia entry</a>
(though some of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SkiFree&amp;oldid=51172559#Mushrooms">
more philosophical passages</a> have been deleted).
There&#39;s even a 
<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/game/SkiFree/">SkiFree Fan Fiction</a> 
site!
</p>

<p>I&#39;ve received plenty of fan mail over the years, but 
<a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/fanmail.txt">this one</a> is my favorite.</p>
<p>I even got a <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski-call.mp3">fan message</a> on my answering machine!
(Sorry about the lousy sound quality. 
Here&#39;s <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski-call.txt" target="_blank">my best guess</a>
at what he&#39;s saying.  <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/hola.html">Let me know</a> if I got it wrong.)

<p>On February 10, 2010, fragments of the 
<a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/sigfried.txt">lost diaries of my cousin SigFried</a> 
were discovered in a curio shop in Istanbul. SigFried went missing 
sometime in 1991 while doing field research for SkiFree. We still haven&#39;t 
found SigFried himself, but now we have some further clues about what 
happened to him....</p>

(39409-byte ZIP containing one 118784-byte Windows 32-bit EXE).</p>
<p>This is the latest version (1.04) compiled for 32-bit Windows, which
should also work on Wine and 64-bit Windows. </p>
<p>If for some reason that ZIP file doesn&#39;t work for you, try downloading
the uncompressed 118784-byte <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski32.exe">EXE file</a> instead.

<h3>ANTIVIRUS WARNINGS</h3>
<p>I am told that some malware scanners are reporting these EXE
files as &#34;infected&#34; or &#34;malware&#34;. I am 99.99999% sure this is a
false positive, but I of course I can&#39;t prove anything, and the
companies that produce the malware scanners have not responded 
to my inquiries.</p>
<p>The 16-bit EXE is the original one published by Microsoft in
1991. The 32-bit EXEs were compiled by me on a reasonably secure
Windows NT machine in 2005, and never set off any
warnings until very recently. I have confirmed against old
backups that the files have not been modified.</p>
<p>For the sake of utter thoroughness, I have installed a fresh
copy of Windows 2000 and Visual Studio 6.0 from original Microsoft
CDs on a blank computer not connected to any network, loaded the
SkiFree source code by floppy disk, and recompiled. The new EXE
file is here: 
<a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski32-rebuild-vs6.exe">ski32‑rebuild‑vs6.exe</a></p>
<p>And I&#39;ve also recompiled with Visual Studio 2019 (downloaded
from Microsoft) on a Windows 7 machine: 
<a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski32-rebuild-vs2019.exe">ski32‑rebuild‑vs2019.exe</a></p>
<p>Please <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/hola.html">let me know</a>
if these newly rebuilt EXEs are (or are not)
setting off malware scanners. I think I can pretty well guarantee 
that the VS6 one is clean!</p>
<hr/>
<p>For historical interest, you could download the original 
16-bit <a href="https://ski.ihoc.net/ski.zip">SkiFree 1.0</a> 
that shipped as part of the Windows Entertainment Pack in 1991.
It does work on most 32-bit Windows systems, but not very well.
If you can&#39;t get it to work in Windows XP, try this:
<a href="http://www.worldstart.com/tips/tips.php/1453">
Configure Windows XP to run 16-bit Windows programs.</a>
That has fixed the problem for a few people so far.  Most likely
you want to get the latest 32-bit version instead.
