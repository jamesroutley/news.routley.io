                      <p>If you send email through an email marketing platform or email delivery provider; you&#39;ll need to setup DKIM records for those providers as well.</p>

                        <p>DMARC records allow senders to indicate their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and give instruction if neither of those authentication methods passes. Please be sure you have SPF and DKIM records setup before using DMARC. Becoming DMARC compliant involves more than just adding a TXT record to your DNS records. It&#39;s a process that can take several weeks to months, depending on your sending volume, email marketing platform or email delivery provider who send email on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>
                          If you&#39;re setting up DMARC for the first time, we recommend setting a policy of p=none and collecting aggregate data with a DMARC monitoring service. You can then monitor reports and slowly bring your domain into compliance over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>DMARC compliance will prevent malicious actors from abusing your domain reputation which can in turn impact your deliverability. This is what a typical DMARC compliance process looks like:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <span>Add a DMARC record to your domain host records with a policy of <strong>p=none</strong></span>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <span>Collect data from DMARC reports using a monitoring service for several weeks or months depending on your organization</span>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <span>Perform an audit and adjust your SPF &amp; DKIM records if neccessary to bring your domain into alignment</span>

                          <li>
                            <span>Collect more data from DMARC reports for several weeks or months depending on your organization</span>

                          <li>
                            <span>Continue collecting data from DMARC reports for several weeks or months depending on your organization</span>
                          </li>

                            <span>Perform a final audit, adjust your SPF &amp; DKIM records if neccessary and enforce the strictest DMARC policy of <strong>p=reject</strong></span>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <span>Continue collecting DMARC reports and monitoring your sending habits</span>

                        </ol>
                        <p>The goal of becoming DMARC complaint is to eventually enforce a policy of <strong>p=reject</strong>. Setting a reject policy will ensure that all malicious email is stopped. The recipient of the intended malicious email will never become aware of the email in the first place, as it will never get sent to a spam or quarantine folder. Since it&#39;s completely blocked, emails are never delivered and end-users cannot be tricked into clicking on a malicious link or opening a dangerous attachment.</p>
                        <p>The downside is if legitimate emails are failing authentication and emails get rejected, the receiver will never know they are not receiving the intended email. For organizations not actively using a reporting system to monitor authentication, it could take months to discover that legitimate email is not being delivered, potentially hurting marketing programs or other opportunities to engage with prospects, customers and partners. This is why it&#39;s important to take DMARC compliance step-by-step, use a monitoring service and incrementally enforce a stricter DMARC policy.</p>

                        <p>Similar to SPF and DKIM, DMARC records are created by adding a TXT record to your DNS records. Since you now have experience adding a TXT record you should already know what to do. Below is an example DMARC record to guide you.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://www.helloinbox.email/images/cloudflare-dmarc-example.png" title="DMARC record example" alt="DMARC record example"/></p>

                        <p>PTR records are used for security and verification. Most email providers use anti-spam filters that use reverse DNS. This ensures the domain names in the email addresses are connected to those IP addresses.</p>
                        <p>Start by using <a target="_blank" href="https://mxtoolbox.com/ReverseLookup.aspx">MX Toolbox&#39;s Reverse Lookup tool</a> to determine if your IP address has a valid PTR record. Email marketing platforms &amp; email delivery providers will already have PTR records for their sending IP addresses.</p>
                        <p>
                          Most hosting providers automatically create PTR records for their customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the result of the reverse lookup reveals you don&#39;t have a PTR record, you&#39;ll have to create one yourself. If that is the case; use the form below to generate a PTR record and add it to the DNS records managed with your hosting provider (PTR records need to be added at the IP address provider level which is usually your hosting provider).</p>
                        <div>
                          <div>

                      <p>If you&#39;re sending promotional emails find an email marketing platform with the ability to schedule batched emails, because it&#39;s a game-changer. Scheduling batched delivery is how you prevent emails from landing in your customers promotions tab or junkmail folder. Depending on the number of subscribers/contacts you have in your list, slowly drip out the emails over a duration of days or weeks instead of sending them all at once. Here&#39;s an example from MailChimp.</p>
                      <p><img src="https://www.helloinbox.email/images/mailchimp-batch-delivery-example.png"/>

A shared IP is used by multiple senders while a dedicated IP is reserved just for you. If you send less than 50,000/month then a shared IP will be fine, though many lower volume senders switch to a dedicated IP address to control their reputation. If you send more than 50,000/month you should get a dedicated IP or several, depending on your sending volume. Most email marketing platforms &amp; email delivery providers offer the option to purchase dedicated IP addresses for a small monthly fee.</p>

                        <p>Promotional emails (also called broadcast or bulk email) is email that&#39;s sent to more than one person that contains the exact same content and is not triggered by an event. A promotional email would be anything a customer did not specifically trigger, for example, a weekly newsletter, a marketing email, or an announcement about your site&#39;s recent updates.</p>
                        <p>Transactional emails are emails that your customer triggers. A welcome email after a customer signs up, an alert email a customer has set up in your app, an invoice email, and a comment notification all qualify as transactional emails.</p>
                        <p>The reputation of the IP address, domain, and email address all play a role in getting emails into your customer&#39;s inbox rather than the spam folder. Or, in the case of Google, one of the inbox sub-categories like &#34;Promotional&#34;. Email providers know that customers want and expect transactional emails, but it&#39;s not always easy for them to tell what&#39;s transactional and what&#39;s better classified as promotional.</p>
                        <p>Using different email and IP addresses for each kind of mail makes it much more likely that your important transactional emails will get to your customers. Shared IP addresses that only send one type of mail will always have a better reputation than shared IP addresses that send a mix of promotional and transactional messages.</p>
                        <p>Another good reason to seperate the two is to prevent transactional emails from being negatively impacted by promotional email campaigns that accidentally lead to a negative sender score or negative IP reputation.</p>
                        <p>A good solution to avoid this problem is to use an email marketing platform with a good IP reputation to send your promotional emails. Here&#39;s an example scenario:</p>

                      <p>Custom tracking domains are important if you use an email marketing platform to send emails. Instead of using your email marketing platform&#39;s domain to track actions (opens, link clicks &amp; unsubscribers), custom tracking domains use your domain to track actions and isolate your reputation from other users who use the same provider.</p>
                      <p>For example, if a spammer uses MailChimp, and the spammer&#39;s emails contain the default MailChimp tracking domain, and this causes the default tracking domain to be listed by a domain-based spam blacklist, and if your emails contain the same tracking domain, the deliverability of your emails could be affected.</p>
                      <p>Creating a custom tracking domain involves adding a CNAME record to your DNS records. Most email marketing platforms will give you the ability to create a custom tracking domain and will provide step-by-step instructions. Example from <a href="https://docs.mailshake.com/article/138-how-do-i-customize-link-tracking" target="_blank">MailShake</a>.</p>

                        <p>Having these two role email accounts is a best practice and a requirement by some email providers. They are used to receive abuse complaints so you should check them regularly and resolve all issues as soon as possible.</p>

                        To give your email the best possible chance to reach the inbox, don&#39;t use a free webmail address as your &#34;From&#34; address. For example, email addresses from Yahoo, AOL, Outlook.com/Hotmail or Gmail. Instead, use an email address registered at your organization&#39;s own domain. When an email is sent through an email marketing platform, receiving email providers view free webmail &#34;From&#34; addresses as more suspicious than those from custom domains, increasing the chance emails from those addresses will be rejected.

                        <p>Before sending high volume email, it helps deliverability to warm up the sending IP addresses tied to your domain with the objective of building good IP &amp; domain reputation with email providers. If you just migrated to a new email marketing platform, email delivery provider or your open rates aren&#39;t what they used to be, you need to start with low volume and increase the sending rate gradually over time (some email marketing platforms offer automatic warmup services for an additional fee). Below is an example 12 week warmup strategy from <a target="_blank" href="https://bentonow.com/tools/email-warmup-calculator">Bento&#39;s IP and Domain Email Warmup Calculator</a> to achieve a final send rate of 20,000 emails per hour. Combining this with scheduled batch delivery is how you achieve high deliverability and high open rates.</p>

They are available on public websites but hidden within the site&#39;s code. The purpose of pristine traps is to identify email marketers who use poor list building practices such as scraping sites for emails or purchasing contact lists.</td>

                                <td>These spam traps were once valid email addresses but have since been repurposed by their provider. Someone could have used this address to opt in at one time, but the address has since been abandoned. Recycled spam traps might be on your sending list if: 1) Your list is more than one year old. 2) You don&#39;t email your list frequently or 3) There are mistyped or invalid addresses on your list.</td>

                        <p>The impact of spam traps varies depending on the type. Hitting a pristine spam trap is more severe than hitting a recycled trap. If you&#39;ve emailed a pristine spam trap, your domain or sending IP address could be immediately blocklisted. If you send email to recycled spam traps regularly, you could start to see your emails being routed to the junk folder. To avoid spam traps, be sure to regularly clean up your contact lists.</p>

                      Too many bounced emails have the same effect as spam complaints: they hurt your reputation which affects email deliverability. If you send an email to a fake email address it will be returned with a hard-bounce message. If you remove fake and bounced email addresses when you clean your email list, the number and percentage of bounces will go down the next time you send. There are two types of bounced email: Hard and Soft. Hard bounces happen because the domain name doesn’t exist, the email address doesn’t exist or delivery is blocked by the email server. Most email marketing platforms will automatically clean hard-bounced email addresses from your list but they will keep soft-bounces. Soft-bounces usually happen because the recipient reached the maximum storage quota for their email account. It&#39;s worth noting that if soft bounces happen regularly, then they&#39;ll eventually become hard bounces.

If you&#39;re sending outbound email marketing campaigns (cold marketing) we recommend creating very simple email content with links only.

                      When including links to images or sites in your email body, only use secure HTTPS links. If you link to images or sites without secure links, emails could be considered insecure by email providers and blocked or sent to the junkmail folder.

                      <p>Signatures featuring your logo and links to social media is fine for regular correspondance but not for transactional email or promotional email campaigns. Keep it simple with a few lines inluding your name, position title, company and link to your website. You want to keep the number of links in your email body to a minimum. Below is an example format we&#39;ve used in the past. In order to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, you&#39;ll also need to include a opt-out or unsubscribe link beneath your signature or at the bottom of your emails, as well as your physical or mailing address.</p>

                      While it&#39;s common practice to include attachments in emails to people you communicate with on a regular basis, doing so in bulk will trigger spam filters. That&#39;s because actual spam emails typically contain harmful attachments. In turn, spam filters are designed to detect and remove emails with attachments. Spam also increases the size of your email – making them longer to load. All the information you need to include should be in the body of the email. If you wish to incorporate any additional material, do so with a secure link to another page rather than an attachment.

                      <p>Never use spammy words in any portion of your emails. Below is a list of words in either your subject line or body that will trigger spam filters. If any of your emails require the usage of any of these terms (like when running a promotion), try to use synonyms. Spam filters have become much more sophisticated in recent years and using one or two phrases won’t hurt you so long as you use email marketing best practices and use spam trigger words within context.</p>

                      Personalization is an important best practice to reach high open rates by including the recipients first name in the subject line. If recipients see emails are addressed to them personally, with a compelling subject line that&#39;s relevant to them, they&#39;re more likely to open and read your emails. Open rates are also an important engagement signal for email providers. If they see recipients opening and replying to your emails, they&#39;re more likley to send your emails directly to the inbox and increase your sender score and reputation.

                      If you send in bulk, email providers will expect you to include an opt-out or unsubscribe link. Otherwise, your emails can land in the spam folder and you can eventually be blacklisted. They&#39;re also important to avoid having your emails marked as spam as they give recipients the opportunity to opt-out of receiving your emails and ensures you&#39;re only sending to people who want to hear from you. Unsubscribe links are also required in order to comply with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003">the CAN-SPAM Act</a> (the Act gives email recipients the right to unsubscribe).

                      Spammers use shared domain url shorteners to hide the domain names they use for scams and viruses from spam filters. Because of this some email providers filter our emails containing URL shortners. As an alternative try using the original URL link to a website or file and linking it to text that describes exactly where it&#39;s taking the reader. This puts the link in the background HTML, which both looks better and can help with potential filtering problems.

                      Sending from a no-reply address comes across as uncaring to subscribers. It can also be frustrating if they need to reach you about something, and it may even be bad news for delivery rates in the long-term. The way a user engages with your email — including replying — can help determine where you end up in the inbox. If people respond to your email campaigns, via reply email, this is seen as a good signal and helps improve your reputation with some email providers.

                      To assist with subscriber trust, it&#39;s a good idea for your &#34;From&#34; name to be similar to your &#34;From&#34; email address. For example, if a subscriber receives an email from ABC Widgets Support, they would expect it to be linked with an email address similar to <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b6c5c3c6c6d9c4c2f6d7d4d5c1dfd2d1d3c2c598d5d9db98">[email protected]</a>

                      If you send both promotional and transactional emails, give recipients an idea of what you&#39;re sending them by fitting the &#34;From&#34; email address to the purpose. For example: <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="96f8f3e1e5faf3e2e2f3e4e5d6">[email protected]</a>, <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="34474144445b464074">[email protected]</a> or <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2d4f44414144434a6d03">[email protected]</a> This splitting of function also allows subscribers to manage your emails using their own client filters however they see fit. It also ensures that if they, for example, write a rule that deletes all emails from <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="422c2735312e27363627303102">[email protected]</a>, they will still receive emails from <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e881869e87818b8d9ba8">[email protected]</a> or <a href="https://www.helloinbox.email/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fe8d8b8e8e918c8abed0">[email protected]</a> If you&#39;re worried about managing too many email addresses, you can use a different reply-to address when sending a campaign to redirect replies.

                      <p>While it&#39;s good for deliverability reasons to use a &#34;From&#34; address that invites recipients to contact you, you may want responses to go to a different address. If you have a large subscriber list you could end up receiving tens of thousands of out-of-office emails that you&#39;d prefer to go somewhere other than your main email address. Most email marketing platforms will give you the ability to set a different email address for replies when sending a campaign.</p>

                  <p><strong>Second</strong>, find out exactly where your emails will land. Navigate to GlockApps <a target="_blank" href="https://glockapps.com/inbox-email-tester/">Inbox Email Tester</a> and send an email to the address generated for you (again, the email body should contain the content you want to send your contacts). Then, wait a few seconds and click to see the results.</p>
                  <p><strong>Your goal is to get a Good score of 80/100 or more</strong>. If you get less than 80/100, go back and fix what&#39;s missing, then test again.</p>
                  <p>
                    You should perform these tests each time you send an email campaign.

                      Email providers do not monitor your sending behavior beyond a period of 30 days. If you stop sending emails for more than 30 days you&#39;ll need to warm up your domain and IP again and rebuild your sender repuation, so it&#39;s important to send a consistent number of emails using either a warmup service or schedule delivery of batched emails.

                      If some of your contacts haven&#39;t opened any of your emails after several months or email campaigns, it means they&#39;re probably not interested. Purge these contacts from your list to maintain a healthy sender reputation with email providers. Removing inactive contacts means you&#39;re sending to fewer contacts but they&#39;re more likely to open your emails and engage with your campaigns, which will have a positive impact on your overall deliverability.
