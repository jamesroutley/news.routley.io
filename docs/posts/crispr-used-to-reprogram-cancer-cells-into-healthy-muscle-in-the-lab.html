<p>Scientists have transformed cancer cells into healthy muscle tissue in the lab using <a href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"><u>CRISPR</u></a> gene-editing technology — and they hope new cancer treatments can be built on the back of this experiment.</p><p>In a study published Aug. 28 in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303859120" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303859120"><u>PNAS</u></a>, researchers found that disabling a particular protein complex in cells of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/rhabdomyosarcoma-treatment-pdq" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/rhabdomyosarcoma-treatment-pdq"><u>rhabdomyosarcoma</u></a> (RMS) — a rare cancer in skeletal muscle tissue that mainly affects <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/rhabdomyosarcoma/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/rhabdomyosarcoma/about/key-statistics.html"><u>children under age 10</u></a> — in the laboratory causes the tumor cells to turn into healthy muscle cells.</p><p>Although the research is still in its early days, this process of &#34;resetting&#34; cancer cells into healthy cells, broadly known as differentiation therapy, has already been tested in other types of cancer, such as <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/stopping-a-rare-childhood-cancer-in-its-tracks/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/stopping-a-rare-childhood-cancer-in-its-tracks/"><u>bone</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8643352/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8643352/"><u>blood</u></a> cancer. <a href="https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2020.262121" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2020.262121"><u>Four drugs</u></a> have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the latter disease and generally work by inhibiting a specific protein in the cancer cells.</p><p>The protein complex pinpointed in the new research could serve as a target for such a therapy, the study authors wrote, and with further development, it could be a promising new treatment option for patients with RMS, which is normally treated with surgery, radiation and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"><u>chemotherapy</u></a>.</p><p>&#34;This technology can allow you to take any cancer and go hunting for how to cause it to differentiate,&#34; or cause it to stop multiplying uncontrollably and turn into normal, noncancerous cells, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/chris-vakoc/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/chris-vakoc/"><u>Christopher Vakoc</u></a>, lead author and professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, said in a <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/once-rhabdomyosarcoma-now-muscle/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/once-rhabdomyosarcoma-now-muscle/"><u>statement</u></a>. &#34;This might be a key step toward making differentiation therapy more accessible.&#34;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/meet-fanzor-the-1st-crispr-like-system-found-in-complex-life"><u><strong>Meet &#39;Fanzor,&#39; the 1st CRISPR-like system found in complex life</strong></u></a></p><p>Differentiation is a process in which <a href="https://www.livescience.com/65269-stem-cells.html"><u>stem cells</u></a> divide and form the various types of cells in the body, such as muscle or fat cells, which each have a unique pattern of gene expression that enables them to carry out particular functions. In RMS, however, patients have genetic mutations that cause their cells to make a specific protein, called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575376/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575376/"><u>PAX3-FOXO1</u></a>, which stops differentiation from happening in skeletal muscle cells. So instead of turning into muscle, the cells form a mass of cancerous tissue.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers used CRISPR to disable, or &#34;knock out,&#34; different genes to see which ones make proteins that work together with PAX3-FOXO1 to stop RMS cells from differentiating. Their analysis revealed that, if RMS cells lose the ability to make <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744014/#:~:text=Highly%20conserved%20between%20human%20and,cycle%20and%20various%20human%20diseases." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744014/#:~:text=Highly%20conserved%20between%20human%20and,cycle%20and%20various%20human%20diseases."><u>nuclear factor Y</u></a> (NF-Y) — a protein that regulates gene expression — the cells instead differentiate into muscle cells. Knocking out PAX3-FOXO1 directly has the same effect.</p><p>&#34;The tumor loses all cancer attributes,&#34; Vakoc said in the statement. &#34;They&#39;re switching from a cell that just wants to make more of itself to cells devoted to contraction.&#34;</p><p>Although deactivating PAX3-FOXO1 and NF-Y has similar effects, the researchers discovered that the proteins don&#39;t physically interact with each other. Instead, in RMS cells, NF-Y switches on the genes needed to make PAX3-FOXO1 by binding to a specific sequence of DNA. So by blocking NF-Y, the researchers also blocked production of PAX3-FOXO1.</p><p>The findings are still a long way from being translated into a treatment for RMS. However, drugs that inhibit NF-Y are already being developed, including those that stop the protein complex from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31539186/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31539186/">forming</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33138093/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33138093/">binding to DNA</a>.</p><p>One hurdle that will need to be overcome is that NF-Y also regulates important processes in healthy cells, such as <a href="https://www.livescience.com/metabolism">metabolism</a> and the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Cell-Cycle" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Cell-Cycle">cell cycle</a>, the series of steps that cells go through as they grow and divide. However, Vakoc and team hypothesize that because RMS cells are &#34;highly sensitive&#34; to changes in PAX3-FOXO1 expression, there could be a &#34;window of opportunity&#34; in which a drug inhibits NF-Y long enough for RMS cells to differentiate but not so long that healthy tissues get damaged. More research will be needed to confirm that this is a viable treatment strategy, they wrote.</p>
