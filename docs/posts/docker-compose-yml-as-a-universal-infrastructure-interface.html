<p>At <a href="https://ergomake.dev">Ergomake</a>, we believe that <code>docker-compose.yml</code> is a perfectly fine format to describe most applications. It&#39;s so good we could use it as a universal infrastructure language, even for Kubernetes.</p>
<p>In fact, compose files are so good they &#34;<em>solve</em>&#34; platform engineering.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we&#39;ll explain what we mean by a universal interface, why compose files are a much better alternative, and how they can &#34;solve&#34; platform engineering.</p>
