    <h1>Do Metaprojects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Publish that novella, build an OS, converse in Mandarin, release an indie game,
publish that other novella, dominate a continent --</p>
<p>It&#39;s not enough to breathe -- my gluttonous heart wants to impose its
imagination on Earth and all its inhabitants.</p>
<p>I want freedom, money, affection, play, power, validation, fulfillment, etc.</p>
<p>Of course I already have these things, but enough never seems enough.</p>
<p>These desires manifest themselves as an endless backlog of ideas and projects.</p>
<p>My backlog grows; my lifespan dwindles. I feel powerless against this trickle of
time. When my optimism hits its limits, I mourn so many stillborn dreams --
breaking my back to bury impossible futures.</p>
<p>I want to want fewer futures, but I&#39;m often too weak to put possibilities out of
their misery. I&#39;m learning to let go, but maybe letting go takes a lifetime.</p>
<p>My brain came pre-installed with Human OS;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion</a> will squander CPU
until I install security patches (e.g.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism">Taoism</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen">Zen</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">stocism</a>).</p>
<p>But I think I&#39;m allergic to enlightenment. Meditation is difficult, quiet is
boring, courage is scary, desire is addicting, etc.</p>
<p>&#34;Dream themes&#34; are my spiritual duct-tape. When desire outpaces optimism, I
distill my projects into metaprojects [sic].</p>

<p>A metaproject is an itch which scratches many itches.</p>

<p>So many bites. Scratching harder, clawing at skin, fighting flesh -- loss is
inevitable under these conditions. Ignore that immediate irritation and erect a
mosquito net. If your net works, it&#39;ll crowd with friends, finally finding
relief from similar itches.</p>
<p>Metaprojects agglomerate. Your nets&#39; threads tend to tangle together into an
anti-mosquito tapestry. In those chaotic quilting patterns, you develop
vocabulary to describe/distinguish distinct itches.</p>
<p>Your ultimate metaproject is precisely <em>you</em> and inevitably whoever you choose
to become. It never feels that way. It feels like you&#39;re building an OS,
learning Mandarin, writing another novella -- no, no -- you&#39;re writing an
autobiography with blood.</p></div></div>
