    <h1>On Replacing My MacBook Air M1 with a ThinkPad T480</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently replaced my 2020 MacBook Air M1 with 8GB of RAM with a Lenovo Thinkpad T480.</p><p>It&#39;s not as insane of a downgrade as it sounds.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maxrozen.com/assets/replacing-my-macbook-m1-with-thinkpad-t480/t480-desktop.png" alt="My T480&#39;s desktop"/></p><h2 id="specs"><a href="#specs" aria-label="replacing my macbook m1 with thinkpad t480 permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Specs</h2><p>My Thinkpad T480&#39;s specs:</p><ul><li>Intel® Core™ i5-8350U CPU @ 1.70GHz × 8</li><li>Internal 24wh battery + external 24wh battery (6 hours 15 minutes default battery life on linux, upgradeable to 92wh total)</li><li>16 GB RAM (upgradeable to 32GB officially, 64GB unofficially)</li><li>1366x768 LCD screen (upgradable to anything from a 1920x1080 screen to a 4k screen, more on that later)</li><li>Windows 10 Pro installed w/ OEM key</li><li>256GB Samsung NVMe drive</li><li>WiFi/Bluetooth module: Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 (WiFi 5), again, upgradeable</li><li>Ports:<ul><li>Two USB-C ports</li><li>Two USB 3.1 ports, with one Always On</li><li>One HDMI 1.4b port</li><li>Ethernet port</li><li>3.5mm headphone jack</li><li>SD card reader</li></ul></li></ul><p>I don&#39;t know if you noticed a theme in the specs, but <em>everything</em> in this laptop is upgradeable.

(one quick boot into Windows to check specs before blowing it all away)</p><p>So I ordered a replacement 1920x1080 IPS screen (Innolux N140HCE-EN1 Rev.C2), followed the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+ThinkPad+T480+LCD+Screen+Replacement/140589">ifixit guide</a>, and had a decent screen after 30 minutes of tinkering.</p><p>Unfortunately upgrading the screen cut battery life to about 4 hours 15 minutes (with the screen set to high brightness), so I&#39;ve ordered a 72wh battery, which should bring that back up to around 8 hours. I can also undervolt the CPU to cut power consumption further, but 8 hours is enough for me when traveling.</p><p>While upgrading the LCD screen, I noticed I had a spare 16GB RAM stick lying around my home office, so I also upgraded to 32GB RAM. Not that I need that much as a web developer/writer (VS Code, GitKraken and Chrome take up 8GB), but it&#39;s nice to have. (It takes two DDR4 2666 MHz SO-DIMM sticks)</p><p>The trackpad is <em>good</em>, compared to other Windows laptops, but terrible compared to the MacBook Air. I&#39;ve ordered a glass trackpad that comes with the Thinkpad X1 Extreme (and is compatible with the T480), so I&#39;ll update this article once I&#39;ve installed that.</p><p>I&#39;ve also ordered an Intel® Wi-Fi 6 AX200 card for WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.</p><h2 id="but-why"><a href="#but-why" aria-label="replacing my macbook m1 with thinkpad t480 permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>But... why?</h2><p>You might be thinking, &#34;wtf, isn&#39;t the M1 significantly faster?&#34; - and it is!</p><p>I ran Geekbench:</p><ul><li>T480 scored 1136 on single core, and 2522 on multi core</li><li>T480 with <a href="https://github.com/erpalma/throttled">throttling removed</a> scored 1180 on single core, and 4024 on multi core</li><li>M1 scored 2355 on single core, and 8241 on multi core</li></ul><p>But is it <em>noticeably</em> 2x slower than the M1? Nope.</p><p>It&#39;s <em>enough</em>.</p><p>Hot reloads of <a href="https://onlineornot.com/">OnlineOrNot</a>&#39;s development server take &lt; 1 second, alt-tabbing doesn&#39;t lag (it did on my Intel-based MacBook Pro 2019), and booting up is as fast as my MacBook Air. So far, none of my development workflow is slower on the T480.</p><p>I installed Pop!<!-- -->_<!-- -->OS 22.04 LTS as I&#39;ve had quite enough of Microsoft&#39;s constant nagging to upgrade to Windows 11, and honestly, I like it?</p><p>Everything works out of the box. I haven&#39;t had to screw around with <em>anything</em>. The user experience isn&#39;t as polished as macOS, but this is the first time I&#39;ve installed a distro where it Just Works. For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve been trying to get a stable Linux development machine since at least 2010, and I always ended up back on a MacBook.</p><p>You can get a Thinkpad T480 for around $200 USD, and upgrades will cost you around $150 total on AliExpress. If any individual part fails, there&#39;s a freely available <a href="https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/t480_hmm_en.pdf">Hardware Maintenance Manual</a>, complete with part numbers that you can look up and order from 3rd party suppliers.</p><p>Having experienced Apple&#39;s wrath through the 2011 15&#34; MacBook Pro dGPU problem (the motherboard is an overheating time bomb, that will inevitably fail and require replacement - I had two motherboards fail on me after four years, asked for a refund, had to quote Australian Consumer Law at them to get a fair deal), I&#39;m happy to have a way out.</p><h2 id="no-really-why"><a href="#no-really-why" aria-label="replacing my macbook m1 with thinkpad t480 permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>No really, why?</h2><ul><li>I can&#39;t tell the difference in performance or build times as a web developer, my dev server is just as fast on Pop!<!-- -->_<!-- -->OS 22.04 as macOS 13.2</li><li>I once spilled an entire can of beer onto a Thinkpad X220. The fix involved a screwdriver, a sponge, a $50 replacement keyboard, and 15 minutes of my time (there are drainage holes on the bottom of Thinkpads).<ul><li>for contrast, a little bit of dust can break an Apple butterfly keyboard</li></ul></li><li>I&#39;m tired of Apple&#39;s ecosystem, Apple ID, not being able to change any individual part of my laptop, being charged $200 USD for 8GB of RAM, being charged $200 for 256 GB of SSD, and so on</li><li>I wanted a cheap travel laptop I could replace without blinking an eye at the price. I live in Europe, Thinkpads are the most common enterprise laptops I see while traveling. I might even slap an asset tag sticker on the cover to make it even more inconspicuous.</li><li>I felt like it? I&#39;m not telling you what to do here, I&#39;m just telling you my experience.</li></ul></div></div>
