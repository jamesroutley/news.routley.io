That&#39;s why it mentions &#34;students&#34; in the slide above.)</i></p><p>People want to do level design. They grow up playing games like Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite — all 3D games with 3D worlds. And to create 3D worlds, supposedly you need this thing called “level design.” Then when you search YouTube, you&#39;ll be told that level design is about implanting <i>secret lines</i> that &#34;guide the player&#34; into walking down hallways. <i>Such is the power of ARCHITECTURE! </i></p><p>But this is not how architecture works, nor how level design works. Imaginary invisible shapes cannot mind control players, and even if they could, no one needs to be mind controlled to walk down a hallway. </p><p>No one plays games like this, but why do we think we do? What&#39;s going on here?</p><p>It starts with a shred of truth: level design often has architectural aspects, and architecture can influence behavior. </p><p>Our main duties as working level designers often involve making game spaces by drawing layouts and building blockouts (simple rough draft 3D levels), which both resemble floor plans and architectural models. This also reflects the basic division of labor in most game studios, where level designers design and environment artists decorate.</p><p>So from there, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that good level design requires an architectural understanding. We&#39;re doing so much work that looks like architecture. <b>A better layout drawing and a better blockout model = a better level?</b></p><p>Here the typical level designer skill progression tends to follow this viral meme image below:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEii6AL6SyeOfqCZS9SBvfytze6kiFL0sWU69mq_EsVaXKm1YSxiedTFVER2CGwBTCrwP-ImDtXUzrocNluUW23bA-D9zcoDptpEGf-Whj63pvjylGW4t_ujYupgGitAv5krTocqWLcP19IhogMf35dqMItztizeqOI7PR1YMAYSqEgB2pygmp_2zV6z__I/s960/rethinking3.png"><img data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEii6AL6SyeOfqCZS9SBvfytze6kiFL0sWU69mq_EsVaXKm1YSxiedTFVER2CGwBTCrwP-ImDtXUzrocNluUW23bA-D9zcoDptpEGf-Whj63pvjylGW4t_ujYupgGitAv5krTocqWLcP19IhogMf35dqMItztizeqOI7PR1YMAYSqEgB2pygmp_2zV6z__I/w640-h360/rethinking3.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>Here the (supposedly) BEGINNER level designer spams disorganized shapes everywhere, while the (supposedly) INTERMEDIATE level designer organizes intentionally but adheres to an axis-aligned grid and room-hallway-room pattern. Then the (supposedly) ADVANCED level designer adopts minimalism and elegance, making efficient use of walls and verticality, to plan spaces that flow into each other. And so on.</p><p>This popular meme image represents a very real phenomenon in level design culture: ideally, your level resembles a plausible real-life building. </p><p>I know this because, dear reader, <i><a href="https://x.com/radiatoryang/status/765976617378349056" target="_blank">I am the one who made this meme</a>.</i></p><p>But I now regret making it. Even if it&#39;s real, it&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s like some sort of secret imaginary invisible line that&#39;s mind controlling us, misleading and misguiding us along the wrong corridor...</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEircMkDB4lxpOHtDV_hryCzrXn2-X3Qn170Zzv3GJXlAiVxAKnt2UtC1PyoU6CTR9XzGiFgjpqBQmxCILwANFnUW2yjK1I-mNkY7qqGl49smV6mWmxiDzkPgmkZfpUkKwYPsPhsqujzapn-97McmOkrYW_BnrH1tSi5cyXoaO4p5MD3EDfrkj2Zr6KfIjQ/s960/rethinking4.png"><img data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEircMkDB4lxpOHtDV_hryCzrXn2-X3Qn170Zzv3GJXlAiVxAKnt2UtC1PyoU6CTR9XzGiFgjpqBQmxCILwANFnUW2yjK1I-mNkY7qqGl49smV6mWmxiDzkPgmkZfpUkKwYPsPhsqujzapn-97McmOkrYW_BnrH1tSi5cyXoaO4p5MD3EDfrkj2Zr6KfIjQ/w640-h360/rethinking4.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>For instance, the so-called <strike>“BEGINNER”</strike> level design works great in Stalker or Fortnite, where a systemic chaotic world matters more than individual room design. Maybe less organization facilitates more improvisation, like this gameplay is operating at a different scale.</p><p>The supposed <strike>“INTERMEDIATE”</strike> level design is great for Fallout vaults, which adopt boxy grids for a clean retro bunker kit aesthetic. If you want a space to feel more mechanical, more prefabricated, then a visible grid helps bring out that modular vibe.</p><p>And the <strike>“ADVANCED”</strike> level design makes sense for Halo / Destiny multiplayer maps with sleek elegant sci-fi spaces that push constant smooth flowy movement. (Conversely, I sort of hate these layouts in something like Stalker, the clean chokepoints often expose the AI&#39;s limitations.)</p><p>Don&#39;t let architectural envy do your thinking for you. Organization, realism, and minimalism are just tools. Instead, think critically about what your specific game experience needs, and design for that.</p><p><a data-darkreader-inline-color="" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgue81fjll9HUHdzs6hJ9C5OvX8NJeuDCWphzWAqmQPPDhwQ-nCDRQNqooMrV8_Q6UzsF6Nxkchuq6mcIlzVceNnIdrqsUJULWQJRXdZyDFd-oDs1vMx9F2PInJ38lshV4w7OVHQChrqPvzwKKay0uEjkYXEGaDQ1b9paZr_Ly7wxAN0cM-SolqusDlRA/s960/rethinking5.png"><img data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgue81fjll9HUHdzs6hJ9C5OvX8NJeuDCWphzWAqmQPPDhwQ-nCDRQNqooMrV8_Q6UzsF6Nxkchuq6mcIlzVceNnIdrqsUJULWQJRXdZyDFd-oDs1vMx9F2PInJ38lshV4w7OVHQChrqPvzwKKay0uEjkYXEGaDQ1b9paZr_Ly7wxAN0cM-SolqusDlRA/w640-h360/rethinking5.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>Because that&#39;s the true material that level designers are actually working with: game experience, possibility, and space. Not floors or walls, but concepts and ideas and behaviors.</p><p>Why must level designers stop at doing bad architecture? We can also do bad economics, bad military tactics, bad wedding planning, and bad comedy! In levels, this looks like planning out quest arcs, pacing setpiece beats, balancing spreadsheets, and choreographing battles. </p><p><b>These non-architectural level design tools are often more effective than architecture at shaping player behavior. </b></p><p>What sounds more effective for pulling the player to the exit of a non-linear level?...</p><blockquote data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-top=""><p><b>(a) scripting, pacing, combat, economy:</b> have an NPC brief the player on how to find the level exit, then place a ranged enemy turret, valuable item, and side-quest destination near the level exit</p><p><i><b>(b) the raw power of architecture</b>:</i> rotate a rock, pray the player approaches that rock from a direction that coincidentally forms a secret imaginary invisible line that mind controls them into hallucinating a path toward one of three skybox mountains in the far distance</p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlfF7M8gV1sMAg60r4CmLBjGYnlXYa5OiiuaH-BUWkaWVVetdm4Jbi8dFbubfuzZ3XTzWjb6KmB-i5rw39_lZprI1YeIAMYf1M0igA2WK8WE0h43N8txtTDaMjUahzr4IT-gyIF8xZrnnGHOxmlUF9Fr92iYVqpm4p5zyQ5IGiCFEP_9LKispxwhhcC9I/s1500/ceci_nest_pas_un_niveau.jpg"><img data-original-height="1125" data-original-width="1500" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlfF7M8gV1sMAg60r4CmLBjGYnlXYa5OiiuaH-BUWkaWVVetdm4Jbi8dFbubfuzZ3XTzWjb6KmB-i5rw39_lZprI1YeIAMYf1M0igA2WK8WE0h43N8txtTDaMjUahzr4IT-gyIF8xZrnnGHOxmlUF9Fr92iYVqpm4p5zyQ5IGiCFEP_9LKispxwhhcC9I/w640-h480/ceci_nest_pas_un_niveau.jpg" width="640"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>&#34;Ceci n&#39;est pas un niveau&#34; (&#34;This is not a level&#34;) is a play on &#34;Ceci n&#39;est pas une pipe&#34; (&#34;This is not a pipe&#34;) from the famous painting The Treachery of Images by Rene Magritte.</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
