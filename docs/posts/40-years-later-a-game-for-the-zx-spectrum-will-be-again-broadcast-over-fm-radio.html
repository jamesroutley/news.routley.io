<p>There were times when Sinclair ZX Spectrum games were copied over the radio waves across Slovenia. <a href="https://radiostudent.si/" title="">Radio Študent</a> broadcast screeching, beeping and whining, which we recorded on tape and played a game a few hours later. Those times are long gone, but we can take a walk through the past today. Radio Študent, which is celebrating its 55th anniversary this week, will invite two members of the legendary Software editorial team to the microphone.</p>

<p>Today at 20:30 the guests will be Žiga Turk, who we know as the co-founder of the magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moj_mikro" title="">Moj Mikro</a>. As one of the pioneers of the Internet in Slovenia, he wrote the Virtual Shareware Library and Wodo. Together with another guest, Matevž Kmet, he also wrote the famous “Kontrabant”, a cult Slovenian text adventure, and its successor “<a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/software?id=0021603" title="">Kontrabant 2</a>“. The talk will take place in the <a href="https://www.racunalniski-muzej.si/en/home-english/" title="">Computer Museum</a> until 21:30.</p>



<p>This will be followed by a nostalgic broadcast of the game Kontrabant 2 via radio waves at the frequency of 89.3 MHz, which will begin around 21:30. Anyone who still has a working Spectrum ZX will then be able to test the game. Those who do not have one can do so at the Computer Museum or online.</p>
