<h4>What I Did</h4>

</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>

<li><a href="https://charm.sh/blog/intro-to-terminals/">A Brief History of Terminal Emulators</a></li>



<li>For my CS50P final project I am thinking of doing some sort of data analysis with Python on a large list of URLs I’ve saved over the past few months with the <a href="https://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> browser extension. I think that could give me some good practice with file I/O and regexes. Still kind of figuring it out though! I’m also interested in experimenting with some third-party libraries.</li>



<li>Spent a bit of time wrangling with my uv setup, making sure it was using the Python version I wanted when creating a virtual environment, etc. but maybe this time I actually figured it out?</li>
