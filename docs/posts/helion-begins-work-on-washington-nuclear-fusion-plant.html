    <h1>Helion begins work on Washington nuclear fusion plant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Microsoft-backed nuclear fusion company Helion has begun work on its first fusion power plant in Chelan County in the US state of Washington.</p>
<p>The Orion plant is set to deliver power to Microsoft data centres in the state by 2028, should development remain on track. </p>
<p>Microsoft signed what it said was the world’s first power purchase agreement (PPA) for nuclear fusion in May 2023, with the company expected to offtake up to 50 MW of capacity following a one-year ramp-up period.</p>
<p>Privately owned Helion, founded in 2013, has said the planned operational date for this “first of its kind” facility is significantly sooner than typical projections for deployment of commercial fusion power.</p>
        </div><div>
            <p>The project will connect to Washington’s primary power delivery networks, allowing it to connect to the same grid just upstream of the Microsoft data centres.</p>
<p>“The development of a commercial fusion power facility is a crucial step in the transition to a sustainable energy future and will not only help Microsoft to achieve its goal of being carbon negative by 2030, but will also support the development of a new clean energy source for the world,” Helion said.</p>
<p>According to Helion, it seventh-generation prototype, Polaris, is expected to demonstrate the first electricity produced from fusion. With its previous prototype, Trenta, Helion was the first private company to achieve a fuel temperature of 100 million degrees Celsius, which is generally considered the required operating temperature for a commercial fusion power plant.</p>
<p>“Today is an important day – not just for Helion, but for the entire fusion industry – as we unleash a new era of energy independence and industrial renewal,” said David Kirtley, Helion’s co-founder and chief executive officer. </p>
<h3><strong>Company Says It Is On Track For Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>“Since we founded the company, we have been completely focused on preparing fusion technology for commercialisation and getting electrons on the grid. Starting site work brings us one step closer to that vision.”<br/></p>
<p>The fusion firm still needs to secure the final permits from the state government to allow for the project&#39;s energisation, but said it remains on track to deliver power by 2028.</p>
<p>Helion is also backed by OpenAI founder Sam Altman. In January, the company announced <a href="https://www.nucnet.org/news/us-nuclear-startup-backed-by-tech-billionaires-secures-usd425m-in-race-for-fusion-1-3-2025">the successful raise of $425m</a>
(€371m) in a Series F round. Last year, OpenAI was reportedly in talks to purchase “vast quantities” of power from Helion.</p>
<p>Helion has now raised more than $1bn and has a valuation of $5.4bn, including the latest fundraising round.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nucnet.org/news/google-signs-deal-to-buy-fusion-energy-from-bill-gates-backed-nuclear-startup-7-3-2025">Google signed a 200 MW PPA</a>
with rival fusion firm Commonwealth Fusion Systems. The power will be supplied from Commonwealth’s inaugural ARC nuclear plant. The plant has a planned capacity of 400 MW, and is projected to deliver its first power to the Virginia grid in the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Unlike nuclear fission, which generates energy by splitting heavy atomic nuclei, nuclear fusion produces energy by merging light nuclei into heavier ones. If made commercially viable, fusion could offer an almost unlimited long-term energy source.</p>
