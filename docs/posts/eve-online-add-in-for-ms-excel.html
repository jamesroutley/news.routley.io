Gain a competitive edge by harnessing the power of data, as access to and the understanding of data can spell the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p font-size="18,22" font-weight="400">For a long time, EVE Online has been lovingly referred to as “Spreadsheets in Space”. Well, your chance to excel in New Eden can now become reality with the official Microsoft Excel add-in for EVE Online. You can now quickly and efficiently arm yourself with the information and knowledge to reach your goals and aspirations. Easy access to in-game data facilitates decision making and brings added fairness and accessibility to everyone, without requiring coding knowledge or dependence on player-developed third-party tools.</p><p font-size="18,22" font-weight="400">The add-in was developed in collaboration with the Excel team, including some in-house capsuleers who have been invaluable to the project. EVE Online is the first and only video game to have developed an Excel add-in leveraging this type of data integration.</p><blockquote><p font-size="18,22" font-weight="400">“CCP Games has extensive experience in the MMO space, so it’s only natural that we collaborate with them to launch the first-ever native Microsoft Excel add-in for a video game,” said <b>Catherine Pidgeon, Microsoft Head of Product, Excel</b>. “With the add-in, the EVE Online player base can seamlessly export and manage data without third-party tools. Through this collaboration, we’re excited to see how players of EVE Online of all skill levels can use Excel to streamline data management and take their in-game experience to new heights.”</p></blockquote><h2 font-size="22,26" font-weight="500" id="h2-2"><b>MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS</b></h2><p font-size="18,22" font-weight="400">This is an indispensable tool for any player striving to reach new heights.
