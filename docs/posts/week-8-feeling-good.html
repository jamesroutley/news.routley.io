    <h1>Week 8: Feeling good</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Photo credit: </span><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nina_Simone_(1965).jpg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a></p><p><span>Since I wrote a blog post toward the end of last week, </span><strong>I donâ€™t have tons to report currently, other than my refined strategy is working</strong><span>! </span><strong><span>I started on the </span><a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">great CSS course by Josh W Comeau</a></strong><span> that a few Recursers recommended, and </span><strong>itâ€™s been really great so far</strong><span>! Mostly stuff I already knew a decent amount about â€” the box model, selectors, classes, etc. â€” but with a lot more detail and depth, so I feel like Iâ€™m really starting to understand them. The playgrounds and exercises are really great too for cementing my understanding. And it feels great â€” Iâ€™m definitely physically excited to keep going through the lessons, and </span><strong>Iâ€™m stoked to try using what Iâ€™ve learned on my IMDB app soon</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>Also, </span><strong>I got to do a bit more mentoring / encouragement since that post</strong><span>, so I can confirm that that part is just as awesome and exciting as it has been! Any Recursers out there reading this, feel free to hit me up for that anytime!</span></p><p><span>And </span><strong>category theory</strong><span>, as it gets into </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">products</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">coproducts</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">exponential objects</a><span>, </span><strong>remains exciting too</strong><span>! Its relatively slow pace is just the right speed for my learning. Iâ€™m the kind of person that has typically learned best by having real-world examples, so learning category theory, where the most important things are relationships and where you try as much as possible NOT to see what the objects are, has been a real growth exercise. </span><strong>Itâ€™s weird and unsettling to move away from the solid ground of concrete examples into the heady world of abstractions built on abstractions, but I feel like itâ€™s slowly starting to feel more OK for me</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>One last thing</strong><span>, just to highlight that Recurse is about more than just crazy coding all the time. </span><strong>Have a picture of the blueberry muffins</strong><span> </span><strong>I made</strong><span> along with a few other Recursers today:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1941,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:3307712,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60f188dc-19dd-42ab-b5ae-0b47d753bb2f_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>As you can see by the already-missing muffin, </span><strong>they turned out great</strong><span>. ðŸ™‚</span></p><p><strong>Next time</strong><span>: More CSS learnings!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
