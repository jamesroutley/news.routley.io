<p>An antimeme is <i>an idea with self-censoring properties</i>; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.</p>

<p><strong>Antimemes are real.</strong> Think of any piece of information which you wouldn&#39;t share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...</p>

<p>But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can&#39;t record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you&#39;re at war?</p>

<p>Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.</p>

<p>No, this is not your first day.</p>

              <div>Yes, &#34;CASE HATE RED&#34; is the planned title of the next part. As a general rule I will not lie directly to you readers about what&#39;s going on in the story. There isn&#39;t, like, a kayfabe thing going on here.

It&#39;s disappointing about the conversation with SCP-8473, but you wouldn&#39;t believe how much material I throw out for most of these chapters. Actually, what&#39;s most disappointing is that that segment was intended more as sad than silly, highlighting that Wheeler doesn&#39;t really have a personal life, or any friends or loved ones. They are all gone, and she&#39;s retroactively been a total loner for years and years, and she doesn&#39;t even realise how much she&#39;s lost.

Anyway, what with the rest of the chapter, that prologue was irrelevant and distracting. Sometimes you have to get brutal and cut perfectly good content because it isn&#39;t appropriate to the tone of everything else. Film editors make equally tough calls all the time.

It may come back in some form. I&#39;m working on it.</div>

              <div>The SCP Foundation wiki has an RSS feed of most recently-created pages here:

But it&#39;s high-volume feed and statistically very few of those new entries will be Antimemetics stuff or by me.

You can also follow me on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/qntm

But again I tweet about a lot of things which aren&#39;t new Antimemetics Division stuff.

If you have an SCP Foundation Wiki account, you could try &#34;watching&#34; this page for changes:

http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub

This will send you emails, not put anything into an RSS feed. But recently I&#39;ve found that watching pages doesn&#39;t seem to work...?

              <div>oh yeah i definitely got that the 8473 conversation was supposed to be tragic. i just found it darkly humorous because i&#39;m a bad person.

and I understand needing to be brutal in editing. All this month, for nanowrimo, i&#39;ve been realizing which fun things will probably not survive a revsion shortly after i&#39;ve churned them out.</div>

              <div>Well, there&#39;s the better part of 4500 main-list &#34;objects&#34; by now, and a huge scad of various canon and not-quite-canon add-on tales, all of which can vary from about one printed page of text to the equivalent of a short novel... not to mention all the joke, explained and decomissioned articles, the logs of extranormal items/events/places, personnel files, everything to do with the non-foundation Groups Of Interest, all the international divisions, etc. And of course the List Of Things Dr Bright Is No Longer Allowed To Do At The Foundation. It can be pretty daunting even for a longtime fan trying to keep up with it, let alone a newbie.

There is a &#34;top rated&#34; list on the site, however, IIRC, as well as a curated page dedicated to &#34;the classics&#34; which are largely those items which kicked off the whole idea when they started appearing on 4chan&#39;s /x/ board.

Some of them are grimdark, others come under just plain weird, or even kinda funny, as well as some that are pretty deep psych horror and really shouldn&#39;t be read late at night when you&#39;re alone in a dark house unless you have a strong mental constitution. Though thankfully the one which had a flavour image which did something bizarre and primal to my hindbrain and induced instant inhuman terror has long since been consigned to the bin because the attached article was actually a bit shit.

I might have a little troll through later on and pull out some of the lighter or easier to grok favourites... but, honestly, if your intent IS to read the entire thing, that WILL be a Homestuck level mission because of the sheer amount of material. I&#39;m nowhere near close to that and don&#39;t intend to ever get there. The sheer amount of stuff being written and added to the site on a weekly basis would take up most if not all of a typical person&#39;s free reading time.</div>

              <div>Great stories. I await CASE HATE RED. Also I notice something.
55 is the first antimemetic by publication date, and 3125 is 5^5.
Did you plan this?</div>

              <div>SCP-055 was written in 2008. I didn&#39;t start work on the Antimemetics Division concept until 2015, so the connection with Fifthism, the number 5 and the number 3125 must not have happened until some time after then.

So it&#39;s just a happy coincidence. It was just the earliest unassigned number which was available at the time. It could very easily have been SCP-067 or whatever (and that wouldn&#39;t have affected anything).</div>

              <div>I was amused by the surname of Bart *Hughes*.

But that name is from 055, so it has to be a coincidence. Right?

Do you even recall ever having met the author who picked out that name?

On an unrelated note, there&#39;s only one Bart Hughes famous enough for Wikipedia, and he&#39;s famous for self-trepanation.</div>

              <div>I&#39;m back, QNTM. Just call me AGM or The Apocalyptic.
I have a K-class scenario idea.
RK-class 682 Invulnerability Events happen when the aforementioned SCP survives one of the following: a nuclear blast, a gravitational singularity, direct contact with antimatter, or another sufficiently dangerous K-class scenario, such as GK-class Hostile Greenhouse or QK-class Quantum Degeneracy.
By definition, an Omega-K-class End of Death scenario would be the ideal situation in which an RK-class occurs, since the former causes the latter to be more easily resolved.</div>

              <div>I just binged through the whole thing in one sitting. It is, without an iota of exaggeration, the best thing on that site. I was hooked from the moment Wheeler first explains what an antimeme is to the moment that she becomes the nuke. How you managed to make compelling a story where half the chapters end with the characters forgetting the chapter is beyond me, but you did it

The ending in particular, with the &#34;Kill an idea with a better idea&#34; thing, is absolutely brilliant. the SCP Foundation can be a bleak, cynical place, but this story is a reminder that it is ultimately hopeful. It&#39;s right there in the Secure, Contain, Protect. It is a noble mission, a good idea, an idea that can beat 3125. An idea that Marion believes so powerfully that she can be the seed of the meme nuke. And in the end, it is Adam&#39;s belief in Marion, and her ideas, that make the meme nuke real.

The one problem I had with it were the ghosts. The ghosts were a pretty brilliant addition that initially made me go &#34;Really? Meme ghosts?&#34; but eventually I got sold on. Soon my mind was soon racing to &#34;Ghost Marion! Ghost Marion!&#34; and seeing her get to Heaven while brain-damaged was gut-wrenching&#34;. Sadly in the end they were left kinda inconsequential, shunted out of the story when Sam took the reins back, serving only to relay some instructions to Adam. I suppose that is par for the course for the antimemetics division, but still, I feel the story ultimately suffered slightly for their inclusion. I understand this is a side effect of the multiple authorship, but as a unified work it leaves some aspects of the whole thing lacking.

Let me sandwich that criticism with more praise. I loved the meta aspects, from the way that Adam goes on an extended Wiki Walk that will mirror most readers&#39; introduction to the Foundation to the way that the only way to defeat this ultimate embodiment of hopelessness and defeat is with the very idea of the Foundation itself. You are clearly a man who understands the appeal of the Foundation. Thank you for the good words.</div>

https://ashberyhouse.yale.edu/blessing-disguise

It&#39;s a poem, in particular it has these two passages:

&#34;      That seem to shine at me through a lattice toward you.
	If the wild light of this January day is true
	I pledge me to be truthful unto you
	Whom I cannot ever stop remembering.

        Remembering to forgive.  Remember to pass beyond you into the day
	On the wings of the secret you will never know.
	Taking me from myself, in the path
	Which the past girth of the day has assigned to me.&#34;

This really reminds me of that final scene where Wheeler becomes WILD LIGHT. Coincidence or intentional?</div>

              <div>Hello qntm, I wanted to leave a review for your work because I just finished reading it (even though I started years ago, this is my 6th rereading but this time, finally, your work is done):

I loved your work from the beginning, but now that I&#39;ve read the end, it really left a bitter taste in my mouth. I want to offer sincere criticism and references, so I&#39;m sorry if this ends up being a bit too long.

In storytelling there are themes, plot devices and characters. Your plot devices are certainly fantastic and attractive. The idea of antimemetics is delicious food for thought and you manage to keep it fresh through unreliable storytelling and scattered exposition that makes the reader feel like a detective, only empowered by the interlinked nature of SCP as a whole. Reading is never just &#34;reading your story&#34; but also going to 055 and 033 and Conterconceptual tales and Nootropic explanations in a way that I suspect only came to you down the road. But this is as far as my praises go.

The themes of hopelessness and unknowable horror are at their strongest when hinted, I personally felt like the hellscape you described in the post apocalyptic chapters of your exposition turned out rushed and raw. Where I expected a feeling of loss and grief, the only thing conveyed was boredom and lostness. This ultimately boils down to your intentional killing of every &#34;meaningful&#34; character to the point where only Adam survives. And I recognize and appreciate it, but still think you made a fatal flaw in characterizing him. Where his tenacity and uniqueness could have made him the perfect antihero, representative of The Foundation&#39;s monotonous approach to protagonism and protection, a nearly perfect stand-in for their lifeless, gray and brutalist take on heroism; he just is booed as irrelevant, insufficient and &#34;weird&#34;. That&#39;s it, just weird. How is a viewer supposed to take &#34;weird&#34; at face value when they&#39;ve been exposed to digitized gored people, invisible mammoths and the most over-the-top end-of-the-world you could possibly come up with?

Nonetheless, that point is well made. Let me move on to the unresolved plot hooks well exposed by others in comments before, such as the origin of the arachnids, the survival of Bart Hughes, the entire existence of the Conterconceptual Division and the creation of phlebotiniums such as mnestics, DROs and Ghosts. I understand the limitations of writing as a writer myself, but after everything is said and done, you leave behind a body of work more held together by duct tape and good feelings than a coherent sci fi story that can be studied and understood as is. It is a shame and I can only wish you develop your themes better in the future.

Finally, characters suffer from flashback syndrome not in that there are too many flashbacks, but rather in that they shine hardest through flashbacks. You have managed to do the opposite of what Asimov did with his Foundation, where he set up strong characters to save mankind in key moments of history by sacrificing pacing, you set up a strong pacing where mankind is saved across generations of &#34;survivalistic defeats&#34; by sacrificing what could have been of your characters, trading their lives and charm to set up your big bad which, truth be told, didn&#39;t need all that sacrifice when it already stands on such a strong argument/premise.

I am saddened to agree with Amazon reviewers on this one. Your work is a promise of great things to come, but the ending feels so rushed and the building of themes falls so flat in the end that despite all my love for your epic work, I can&#39;t claim it left a strong enough sensation for me to forgive everything I have communicated to you in this review. 

I hope this comment finds you in good health and that you gain useful insight from my words. I&#39;ll add a PS in a next comment so as to not make this behemoth any larger, thank you for reading.</div>

              <div>Thank you for your constructive feedback. I do appreciate it.

Adam is intended to be a relatively privileged moderate -- an Arthur Dent-style middle-class everyman who is oblivious to the oncoming apocalypse because nothing in his life has ever really affected him negatively. He&#39;s *intended* to be a weak character, who lacks the tools to do anything meaningful about what happens to his world. He&#39;s never needed to fight for anything in his life. So the best he can do is find a stronger character to do it for him.

Almost all of the unresolved plot hooks you mentioned have been left that way intentionally. I could easily explain all of this -- for example, the arachnids are, like SCP-2256, a naturally-occurring component of Earth&#39;s antimemetic biosphere which SCP-3125/Red took and put to work -- but these explanations would mostly just take up word count and add little to the story. Where mnestics come from, how they were developed, isn&#39;t relevant to the story. Some of these omissions are intended to give the reader the same sensation that the characters have, the feeling of being thrown into a situation without necessary context, and having to sink or swim -- learn fast or die from confusion. By the way, you mentioned the Counterconceptual Division as an unresolved plot hook -- in fact I never mentioned the Counterconceptual Division in the book (I wanted to, but never found the appropriate moment for it), and I don&#39;t know what a DRO is. I think you may have confused some other SCP contributors&#39; content with my own?

As for Amazon reviews... I try to avoid reading reviews. Reviews are not directed at authors, they&#39;re directed at fellow readers. It&#39;s not a dialogue, and it&#39;s not generally appropriate for an author to respond directly to a review, so reading the review without being able to respond can be intensely frustrating, so I just don&#39;t.

Please can you elaborate further on the trigger warnings you&#39;d like to see on this story? Or rather, what content in the book you think needs to be flagged. As I say, because I don&#39;t read reviews, this is the first I&#39;m hearing of this.</div>

              <div>thank you for the fast reply. Your synopsis on Amazon indicates nothing of the gore and horror to be found within your body of work. Thus, readers come in expecting a psychological thriller but end up finding visceral macabre eldritchian nightmare fuel. Warning them of it would be appreciated.

I must fight your understanding of Adam, though. He becomes quite the charming damsel-in-distress through your exposition, less &#34;a privileged, average nobody&#34; and more &#34;the one that got away&#34;. It&#39;s almost as if the story itself is trying to oppose him from being protagonistic. If this were the pataphysics division, he&#39;d certainly be Archetypal. He resists all attempts the big bad throws at him to delete him from the story, survives because of that unique mutation he possesses from birth, and has just enough know-how (camping, logic, emotional intelligence) to be a worthy recipient of luck and every last effort the Foundation can bequeath through his doomed timeline. 

Thus, even if you say he&#39;s &#34;intended&#34; to be weak, he is in practice your last protagonist, and by the virtue of so, gains the second-strongest characterization of any of your characters (first is his wife, obviously). To the reader, it really feels like he&#39;s a hero of legend, an acceptable stand-in for all of us common people, a perfect vantage point for mankind as a whole to the point all Foundation personnel feels anomalous/alien. I  beg of you to reconsider his standing, if not through retcons and tweaks, at least for future works his legacy within your mindscape may inspire. He really does deserve more credit, you have done wonderfully by him, save the ending.

PS: DRO being related to 3125 was an assumption of mine, sorry if I was mistaken. There are just so many similarities i couldn&#39;t help myself, the link is as follows: https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/apas/offset/4</div>

              <div>I really truly do think that any great work of fiction only works by generating emotions and catharsis in its viewers. Of course the plot and the characters are the medium, but both of them, every single component in a story, is a slave to the themes.

Theming is the art of finding real problems and narratives that our minds, souls and hearts desperately need to relate to. Loss is a theme. Death is a theme. Passion and hubris are themes. But in your case, the antimemetics storyline deals with the theme of existential dread.

There exists a question so unknowable, so unfathomable that the mere event of contemplating it seriously breaks through all of our defenses, leaves us naked, mad, wounded against it and the only thing we can do is forget it and hide by doing our best to never remember the fact it is there. This question is &#34;what is the meaning of my life&#34; or &#34;what am i going to do with my life&#34; or &#34;why am i alive&#34; or however resonates the most with you. This is the question of  existential dread.

To depressed/anxious people (such as myself), the thought of life during a depressive/anxious episode sends us into panic/suicidal attacks by the sheer magnitude of our failures, of our insignificance in the face of &#34;being worthy&#34; of life. I can&#39;t speak for other people&#39;s experiences for I do not truly know them (I have not lived them) but I really truly do believe everybody experiences existential dread to some degree. 

And just as well, I really truly do believe that the only way to deal with existential dread, that unanswerable question, is to focus on the IDEA that we are enough. We will never &#34;truly&#34; be enough. But those of you that manage to defeat existential dread do it by creating an idea stronger than the fact that life is infinitely bigger and scarier than any of us, the idea that you are just as big and bad and can deal with it all.

But those of us who haven&#39;t been able to muster such an idea yet, all we can do is hide in videogames or drugs or sleep trying desperately to forget about it over and over and over. Knowing we are defenseless and desperately in pain about it, knowing there can be no answer, only suffering, from facing that truth.

I really truly do think that works of fiction that eschew their theming and lose sight of what they&#39;re supposed to talk about (catharsis, deep feelings) are cheapened by the emotional disconnection and fail to move in comparison to those that are well themed. I hope this makes sense to you, and that you like all the great science fiction authors before you, realize that both the way to write bestsellers AND the way to better the world you were born in is to talk about reality. Even through fantasy, fiction, science or horror. Thank you for all the feelings.</div>

              <div>Thank you so much for the Antimemetics series - by far my favorite thing I&#39;ve read on the SCP wiki. I loved the creativity, clarity of style and characterization of all the stories. The horror elements were incredibly well done and will stick with me for the rest of my life. I know I&#39;ll never be able to read the word &#34;digitized&#34; the same way again. Marion and Adam&#39;s story was perfectly heartbreaking, and I loved their goodbye scene especially. Bravo on making something so excellent!</div>

              <div>I read this many years ago, before it was complete, and followed it as it was updated. It captivated me- it&#39;s something I recommend to friends and catch myself thinking about at the oddest times. It&#39;s one of my favorite works of science fiction. I&#39;m commenting now because I just finished reading Philip K Dick&#39;s &#34;Ubik&#34; and I was wracking my brain wondering why the plot felt so engaging in such a familiar way. Then I remembered this work! Did you happen to draw inspiration from this work, or have you read it at all? If not, I highly recommend it.</div>

              <div>I am so late to the party, but I shotgunned There Is No Antimemetics Division and 55555 in one sitting. And then Mr. 3125 showed up in my dreams. Survived it though.

I think I have met one or two men like 3125&#39;s avatar — and lost loved ones to them — which is part of why it resonated with me. Powerfully magnetic and utterly disgusting cult leaders, small-time demagogues with egos the size of extradimensional memeplexes. Then you turn on the news and you realize these people are heads of state, military leaders, celebrities, right-wing talking heads... the fascism allegory hits like a sack of bricks, and I mean that in a good way.

Also, you really hit the nail on the head with your depiction of grief and trauma, and how they will just utterly destroy your memory. You don&#39;t remember anything at all until all of a sudden something triggers just the right synapse, and all your repressed memories come tumbling out, and all of a sudden it&#39;s far far too much for your monkey brain.

But after the second wave of grief bowls you over, you find that person isn&#39;t gone, they&#39;re an idea you carry with you to fight through the next day of hell. And the next.</div>

              <div>According to the timeline on the wiki, and also Where Have You Been All My Life, Adam and Marion have been married for 17 years as of 2015. In We Need to Talk about Fifty-Five, also dated to 2015, O5-8 noted that Marion is the mother of two children, both boys. Presumably they’re both minors unless both children were born prior to their marriage, which would put the upper limit on their age at 20. Adam never mentioned either of their children at the time, and I’m reasonably confident there are no other references to them in the work. Should I imagine the worst?</div>
