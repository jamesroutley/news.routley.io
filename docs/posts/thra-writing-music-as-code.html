    <h1>Show HN: ÆTHRA – Writing Music as Code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN</p><p>I’m building ÆTHRA — a programming language designed specifically for composing music and emotional soundscapes.</p><p>Instead of focusing on general-purpose programming, ÆTHRA is a pure DSL where code directly represents musical intent: tempo, mood, chords, progression, dynamics, and instruments.</p><p>The goal is to make music composition feel closer to writing a story or emotion, rather than manipulating low-level audio APIs.</p><p>Key ideas:
- Text-based music composition
- Chords and progressions as first-class concepts
- Time, tempo, and structure handled by the language
- Designed for ambient, cinematic, emotional, and minimal music
- Interpreter written in C# (.NET)</p><p>Example ÆTHRA code (simplified):</p><p>tempo 60
instrument guitar</p><p>chord Am for 4
chord F for 4
chord C for 4
chord G for 4</p><p>This generates a slow, melancholic progression suitable for ambient or cinematic scenes.</p><p>ÆTHRA currently:
- Generates WAV audio
- Supports notes, chords, tempo, duration, velocity
- Uses a simple interpreter (no external DAWs or MIDI tools)
- Is intentionally minimal and readable</p><p>What it is NOT:
- Not a DAW replacement
- Not MIDI-focused</p><p>Why I made it:
I wanted a language where music is the primary output — not an afterthought. Something between code, emotion, and sound design.</p><p>The project is open-source and early-stage (v0.8). I’m mainly looking for:
- Feedback on the language design
- Ideas for musical features worth adding
- Thoughts from people into PL design, audio, or generative art</p><p>Repo: &lt;<a href="https://github.com/TanmayCzax/AETHRA" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/TanmayCzax/AETHRA</a>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for reading — happy to answer questions or discuss ideas.</p></div></td></div></div>
