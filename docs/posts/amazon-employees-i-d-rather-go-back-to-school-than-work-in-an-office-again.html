    <h1>Amazon employees: &#39;I&#39;d rather go back to school than work in an office again&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a> employees are slamming the company’s return-to-office policy and plotting their exit less than 24 hours after CEO Andy Jassy announced that they must return to the office five days a week from January.</p><div>



<p>While some Amazon workers are ripping into the company’s toughened RTO policy on social media, others are even blasting their employer in the company’s internal Slack channel.</p>



<p>“Please do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-COVID,” one staffer wrote on Slack, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-workers-blast-strict-rto-mandate-five-days-week-2024-9" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-workers-blast-strict-rto-mandate-five-days-week-2024-9" rel="noopener"><em>Business Insider.</em></a></p>



<p>“This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backwards.” </p>



<p>Another employee suggested they’d rather be put on the company’s aggressive <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/">performance improvement plan</a> than comply with the mandate: “Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me… Take my money and leave?”</p>



<p>Employees aren’t just talking about quitting, a small few have already changed their status on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/">LinkedIn</a> to #opentowork as they openly search for more flexible jobs.</p>



<p>“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the networking platform.</p>



<p>“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”</p>



<p>A <span>commentator on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" rel="noopener">Reddit</a> who claims to have worked at Amazon for three years sai</span>d that they’re mentally checking out of their current role while they hunt for another.</p>



<p>“Probably going to soft quit and get a new job. F—k Jassy,” the user wrote, describing the measure as a “swift kick to the nuts.”</p>



<h2>Amazon’s latest RTO mandate</h2>



<p>Amazon veteran, Jassy—who took the helm after Jeff Bezos <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/">stepped down</a> in 2021—issued a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" rel="noopener">memo</a> to all staffers yesterday that said they will be required to work in the office “the way we were before the onset of COVID.”</p>



<p>“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,” Jassy, who started working at the $1.94 trillion tech giant in 1997, wrote.</p>



<p>Of course, many people moved to the suburbs and made childcare arrangements according to the company’s current 3 day in-office policy—or as Jassy puts it “set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments.”</p>



<p>That’s why the 56-year-old said that the new stricter enforcement will not kick in until the new year to “help ensure a smooth transition.”</p>



<p>The CEO added that moving forward remote working will be reserved for emergency scenarios like “if you or your child” is sick.</p>



<h2>‘What better way to cut jobs’</h2>



<p>Jassy positioned the changes at Amazon—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work.</p>



<p>“We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another,” Jassy insisted.</p>



<p>However, some disgruntled proffesionals have suggested that the new policy is designed to reduce its current 1.5 million-plus headcount.</p>



<p>“This is a layoff in disguise,” one user complained on Reddit. “Return to the office or you’re fired and we don’t have to pay any severance or unemployment.”</p>



<p>“What better way to cut jobs than to force everyone back into the office and watch people quit in droves,” another wrote.</p>



<p>Amazon didn’t respond to <em>Fortune’s</em> request for comment, including whether the policy is a thinly veiled headcount reduction.</p>



<p>However, the company has previously used its in-office mandate to cut out defiant workers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Amazon managers were given the green light to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/">fire employees</a> who fail to show face three days a week in the office. </p>



<p>Meanwhile the company’s “return-to-hub” mandate in July forced remote workers to pick working (and in some cases <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" rel="noopener">relocating</a>) to the closest office to them—or resign.</p>
