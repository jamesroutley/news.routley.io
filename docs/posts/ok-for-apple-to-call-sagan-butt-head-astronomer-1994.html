<p>The Computer Lawyer</p>

<p>SECTION: CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS; Tort; Vol. 11, No. 8; Pg. 32</p>



<p>Apple Computer Inc. did not defame the prominent scientist Carl Sagan by
calling him a &#34;Butt-Head Astronomer,&#34; a Central District of California
court ruled, because the term did not imply any assertion of an objective
fact such as professional incompetence.  Carl Sagan v. Apple Computer,
Inc., CV94-2180 LGB (C.D. Cal. 1994).</p>

<p>Apple Computer&#39;s project managers routinely assign code-names to
products in development.  In 1993, one of Apple&#39;s project managers assigned
the code name &#34;Carl Sagan&#34; to a personal computer it was developing.  After
learning that his name was being used, Sagan had his attorneys write a
letter to Apple demanding it cease.  In response, the project manager
changed the computer&#39;s code-name to &#34;Butt-Head Astronomer.&#34; Sagan filed
suit in federal court for libel, infliction of emotional distress, invasion
of privacy, unfair competition, and violation of the Lanham Act and
California law on the use of likenesses.</p>

<p>Apple argued that the term was an opinion, protected under the First
Amendment.  Judge Lourdes G. Baird agreed.  She noted that a statement of
opinion can only form the basis of a libel action if a reasonable
fact-finder can conclude that the statements imply an assertion of
fact. Judge Lourdes [sic] held that &#34;one does not seriously attack the
expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase &#39;butt-head,&#39;&#34; and that
a reader aware of the context would understand the project manager was
retaliating in a humorous and satirical way.</p>

<p>Judge Baird also ruled that Sagan could not recover for infliction of
emotional distress, noting Sagan is a public figure and that a public
figure could only recover for infliction of emotional distress by showing
that the publication contains a false statement of fact made with actual
malice.</p>

<p>However, Apple lost its motions for a more definite statement of Sagan&#39;s
Lanham Act claim.  Apple had argued that Sagan&#39;s complaint had admitted
that his name was only used internally at Apple, and could not, therefore,
have been &#34;in commerce&#34; as required by the Act.  Judge Baird noted that
Sagan&#39;s complaint only asserted that Apple&#39;s attorneys had stated that the
name was only used internally.  Finally, Judge Baird denied Apple&#39;s motion
to strike Sagan&#39;s invasion of privacy count as redundant in light of the
right of publicity claim.  She noted that the former asserted an additional
request for punitive damages, and that the other redundant elements did not
prejudice the defendant in any way.</p>
