    <h1>Scheme H: “Kora Theory”</h1>

    <p>I don&#39;t know much about musical instruments, but I know even less about string theory, which is what I was going to title this scheme at first. This isn&#39;t even an article about music, or koras, but I love the kora, and I guess this is a good time to plug it (why not.)</p>
<p>The kora is a stringed instrument, usually 21 strings. You can play chords, by holding down multiple strings, but oftentimes you&#39;re playing one string at a time in quick succession - think harp - and creating beautiful, harmonious pieces.</p>
<p>This scheme is about how I&#39;ve been trying to approach life in the last few months. It&#39;s officially the blog post I&#39;ve procrastinated on the longest, and it&#39;s difficult to write, because I&#39;m still figuring it out.</p>

<p>Focus on the harmony, not the individual strings you&#39;re pulling.</p>

#</a>The story</h2>
<p>Last year, I moved to the Netherlands in order to be more present with my grandma. We&#39;re very close, and she is at an age where it&#39;s important for me to make memories with her while I still can. </p>
<p>In doing so, I took a big pay cut -- around 40%, even though I got promoted from associate to mid-level. My employer couldn&#39;t employ me in France, which is where my grandma lives, so I moved to the closest office, which was Amsterdam (even though I&#39;d never even visited before), and got put onto the pay bands for the Amsterdam office.</p>
<p>For the first 6 months, I traveled to my grandma&#39;s house one week per month. It never felt like enough, but we made some great memories. I also traveled to see my other family members a lot. Keep in mind, I don&#39;t have a car, so this is all public transportation (praise the European railway system).</p>
<p>In November, I felt my body start to get... weird. I won&#39;t go into detail, but it was pretty serious, and kind of freaking me out. The Dutch healthcare system is very reluctant to get you to specialists, so I had to do a lot of self-advocacy, while knowing very little about the system, not speaking the language, and also... living alone. Going to appointments alone, and coming home alone. With health problems that had no answers.</p>
<p>In late November, I came home from staying at my parents&#39; house totally drained. My parents were traveling, so I&#39;d been taking care of my family dog who was recovering for cancer, and helping my sister-in-law plan her wedding. I felt thoroughly neglected. I barely had the energy to sit through meetings. </p>
<p>After much back-and-forth with my sister, who is truly my biggest advocate, I took one week of sick leave, and decided I needed to learn to chill. 3 weeks later, of course, I was in conversations to join a different team at work (to further my career), and was spending Christmas at my grandma&#39;s, having just installed a new floor in the guest room. </p>
<p>But I did chill. For my birthday, instead of visiting or hosting the family that was requesting it, I asked a dear friend to watch Pixie for a long weekend, and treated myself to a mini-trip in Copenhagen. In March, instead of visiting my grandma, I hosted her and my brother at my apartment. I did yoga. I set boundaries. I put a hold on being vegetarian, because being intentional enough about my diet to fulfill all my needs was taking up too much energy. I used Ubers, because it was the most convenient for me. In short, I decided to let go of my responsibilities a little, and also, to do some stuff that made me feel good.</p>
<p>In June, I wasn&#39;t feeling fulfilled enough at work, so I decided to take a sabbatical, and join the Recurse Center (see post). And friend, it&#39;s only last week that I was able to see that I&#39;m a little burnt out. </p>
<p>Recurse is all about being in the moment and taking things one step at a time. You make sure you&#39;re challenging yourself, but also balancing that with enjoyment. And that balance looks different every day. That was an incredible perspective.</p>
<p>Looking back at the last few months, I can see everything&#39;s been a series of balancing acts. I exchanged money for time with my family, and family time for health, and health for career progression, and career progression for enjoyment... but they weren&#39;t total exchanges, it&#39;s just that I kept assessing the harmony of things, and putting effort into what was more needed at any given point. </p>

#</a>My plan</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t think this was consciously a plan, as it was happening, but rather a series of smaller plans. So it is kind of cheating to refer to Kora Theory as a plan. But it is becoming clearer to me that there kind of is a meta-plan: a lot of my smaller plans come together in a sort of harmonious system. So now that I am aware of that, I think my plan is not to sweat consistency much, or expect to be able to maintain specific commitments and routines for long. Rather, I just want things to feel harmonious, overall, and to keep adjusting which strings I pull based on that. It&#39;s fine if that means taking a step back from my career, or eating a little less healthy, or not seeing my grandma for 2 months, as long as things feel, overall, right. </p>

<p>YEESH. This was long! and personal. Thanks so much for reading! I am arriving at my train destination, just on time, and going to go enjoy my day trip!</p>

<p>I just remembered. I was going to share a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6cnzw_mnNo">live performance of my favorite kora song</a>, Lampedusa, by Toumani and Sidiki Diabaté, two of the best-known kora players, who are father and son from one of the oldest kora player lineages in history (over 70 generations.) Sidiki is also kind of a massive pop star. Enjoy!</p>
