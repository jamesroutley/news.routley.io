    <h1>An interactive core memory electronic kit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Core64 (and Core16) unites authentic Core Memory and LEDs in a unique and interactive way. Core memory is a magnetic memory technology from the 60’s and 70’s. It was used in the Apollo Guidance Computers and several other down-to-earth applications. It is made of tiny rings of ferrite material which can be magnetized in one of two polarities: clockwise or counter-clockwise. The polarization is assigned a binary “0” or “1” status and the polarity can be written and read back into a computer. This fundamental trait makes Core Memory usable as RAM or ROM. An additional benefit is persistent polarity - cores do not require power to maintain the polarity. It is similar to more recent forms of magnetic memory like floppy discs and hard drives. In the Core64 kit, the core memory is visible as the array of wires suspended over the top of multicolor LEDs. The stylus has a magnet in the tip which enables  interaction with the LEDs by way of the core memory. In practice, you can think of it as a magnetic touch screen.</p><p>The Core64 kit includes many more features with a lot of room for interactive learning and creative expansion. A wide range of experimentation is unlocked with this kit - you can think of it as a Dev Kit for Core Memory!</p><p>My video of the unboxing and overview is <a href="https://youtu.be/jW8P9HuTATo">here</a>.</p><p>Youtuuba has a much more thorough walk through of the kit <a href="https://youtu.be/7K6Qu-mNDms">here</a>.</p><p>This unique kit has created some unique quotes:</p><p><strong><em>&#34;The first time I’ve put together an electronic kit and didn’t get bored!&#34; - Austin</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>&#34;The most tedious and most rewarding project I&#39;ve ever done.&#34; - Drew</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“Thank you for making this kit a reality!” - Anonymous</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“I finally get to weave my own core memory!” - Simen</em></strong></p></div></div></div>
