<p>It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Shadowcat co-founder, Matt S. Trout. Matt started Shadowcat Systems with Mark Keating in 2005 after a few years of each of them working for other people’s profit. In recent years Matt had taken a sabbatical from work and from his online community projects due to a battle with health. Matt was just 42 years old.</p>



<p>Sadly he was unable to return to the work that was his passion in life though he kept a strong interest in the modern world and was excited for how we might evolve the systems we all work with each day.</p>



<p>There are no further details to share at this time but you can drop a message to us via the usual channels.</p>

<h2>Update 10/07/2025</h2>



<p>There have been many people who have reached out to give a comment about how they knew Matt, or how this affected them. Many beautiful words and sentiments, memories and reflections are in the comments on this page. However many of those have been placed on other public sites. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since there are so many I have repeated those from publicly available posts below. I have used the maxim “it is easier to ask forgiveness than to seek approval” in regards to putting them here as there are so many and I am responding to so many people who have reached out to share their condolences. If you would like to have your comment removed, or updated/corrected, then please let me know. </p>

<p>Matt gave me a chance when I was 19 years old and needed to find an internship as part of my course. He took me in with 0 work experience and threw me right into the deep end, and somehow I survived. He’s an amazing mentor and even though I only worked for him for one year, I learned more in that year than some people can learn in 5. If I were to say I owe my career to somebody, it would be Matt.</p>



<p>Even though he was only my boss for that short period, we remained friends until the very end and I always shared programming or even personal issues with him.</p>



<p>He was deeply loved by all his colleagues and friends, and he was an amazing asset to the Open Source community. He will be greatly missed by all.</p>



<p>Rest in Peace friend, we love you.</p>
