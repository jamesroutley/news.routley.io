<p>It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Shadowcat co-founder, Matt S. Trout. Matt started Shadowcat Systems with Mark Keating in 2005 after a few years of each of them working for other people’s profit. In recent years Matt had taken a sabbatical from work and from his online community projects due to a battle with health. Matt was just 42 years old.</p>



<p>Sadly he was unable to return to the work that was his passion in life though he kept a strong interest in the modern world and was excited for how we might evolve the systems we all work with each day.</p>



<p>There are no further details to share at this time but you can drop a message to us via the usual channels.</p>
