            <p>KNOCK-KNOCK.NET</p>
	    <p>Set up an unprotected server on the net, and the bots start swarming!</p><p> This site shows bots attempting (unsuccessfully) to break into an ordinary internet server.</p>
            <p>This constant chatter of bots knocking on the doors of machines on the net has been referred to as <em>&#34;the background radiation of the Internet&#34;.</em></p>
	    <p>Knock-knock.net is a visualization of this bot traffic.
	    It shows the bot activity in real-time, and provides historic stats of the bot attacks over time: where they are coming from, the most common usernames and passwords attempted, the worst offending ISPs, and in some cases, why the password or username was chosen.</p>
