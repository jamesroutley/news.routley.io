                        <p>It&#39;s an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It&#39;s a TXT file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.</p>

                        <h2>Why a TXT?</h2>
                        <img src="https://humanstxt.org/img/Illustration-home/02-why-a-txt.png" alt="Why a TXT?" width="161" height="160"/>
                        <p>Because it&#39;s something <em>simple and fast</em> to create. Because it&#39;s <strong>not intrusive with the code</strong>. More often than not, the owners of the site don&#39;t like the authors signing it; they claim that doing so may make the site less efficient. By adding a txt file, you can prove your authorship (not your property) in an external, fast, easy and accessible way.</p>

                        <p><strong>In the site root</strong>. Just next to the robots.txt file.</p>

                        <p>You don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want. The only aim of this initiative is to know who <strong>the authors of the sites</strong> we visit are.</p>

                        <h2>Meta Name or humans.txt?</h2> 
                        <p>This is not a fight, you don&#39;t have to choose one or the other. Humans.txt is just a way to have more information about the authors of the site.</p>

                        <h2>The internet is for humans...</h2> 
                        <p>We are always saying that, but the only file we generate is one full of additional information for the searchbots: robots.txt. Then why not doing one for ourselves?</p>

                        <h2>Looking for a standard</h2> 
                        <p>We like the things well done, and this is why we want to provide some guidelines to make the humans.txt as standard as possible. <b>Abel Cabans</b> set the grounds in his own <a href="http://humanstxt.org/humans.txt" target="_blank">humans.txt file</a>.</p> 
                        <p>But, of course, you are free to add any information you want.</p>
