It’s now available in Google Search, starting with <a href="http://google.com/ai">AI Mode</a> — marking the first time we’ve brought a Gemini model to Search on day one. Gemini 3 brings incredible reasoning power to Search because it’s built to grasp unprecedented depth and nuance for your hardest questions. It also unlocks new generative UI experiences so you can get dynamic visual layouts with interactive tools and simulations — generated specifically for you.</p><p data-block-key="1bk46">Here’s how Gemini 3 is supercharging Search.</p><h2 data-block-key="faful">Gemini 3: Our most intelligent model, right in Search</h2><p data-block-key="c7ejj">Starting today, <a href="https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/">Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers</a> in the U.S. can use Gemini 3 Pro, our first model in the Gemini 3 family of models, by selecting “Thinking” from the model drop-down menu in AI Mode. With Gemini 3, you can tackle your toughest questions and learn more interactively because it better understands the intent and nuance of your request. And soon, we’ll bring Gemini 3 in AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. with higher limits for users with the Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.</p></div>

Now, not only can it perform even <i>more</i> searches to uncover relevant web content, but because Gemini more <i>intelligently</i> understands your intent it can find new content that it may have previously missed. This means Search can help you find even more credible, highly relevant content for your specific question.</p><p data-block-key="brjoe">And in the coming weeks, we’re also enhancing our automatic model selection in Search with Gemini 3. This means Search will intelligently route your most challenging questions in AI Mode and AI Overviews to this frontier model — while continuing to use faster models for simpler tasks. This will be rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S.</p><h2 data-block-key="o6a5">Generative UI: Visual layouts, interactive tools and simulations in AI Mode</h2><p data-block-key="4o56v">Gemini 3’s unparalleled multimodal understanding and powerful agentic coding capabilities are also unlocking more bespoke generative user interfaces. Now, Gemini 3 in AI Mode can dynamically create the ideal visual layout for responses on the fly — featuring interactive tools and simulations — tailored to your query.</p><p data-block-key="7cnck">To do this, Gemini 3 analyzes your question and creates the most helpful layout, building a custom response with visual elements — like images, tables and grids — so the final output isn’t just informative, but clear and actionable. When the model detects that an interactive tool will help you better understand the topic, it uses its generative capabilities to code a custom simulation or tool in real-time and adds it into your response.</p></div>
