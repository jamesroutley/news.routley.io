And, a few months ago, the production designer for </span><em>Turning Red</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/the-nostalgic-90s-anime-series-turning-red-was-influenced-by" rel="">said this</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>For us, it was really cherry-picking what we loved because anime is a huge range. </em><span>[...] </span><em>So, we were on the whole spectrum of anime, we were just kind of picking, “We like this, and we like this, and we like this. Okay, now, let’s put it all in the pot and put it into </em><span>Turning Red</span><em>.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>It’s not just animated films and TV. Eleven in </span><em>Stranger Things</em><span> was </span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-stranger-things-the-duffer-bros-on-how-they-made-the-tv-hit-of-the-summer" rel="">heavily influenced</a><span> by anime.

The director of </span><em>The Bad Guys</em><span> suggested as much in an interview last month, saying that the influence of anime helped to make his film “slightly different from what we usually see in animation in Hollywood, in the big CGI movies from Hollywood.”</span></p><p>It feels new.

As the magazine </span><em>Keyframe</em><span> pointed out a few years ago, </span><a href="https://keyframemagazine.org/2020/08/14/the-influence-of-anime/" rel="">the influence of anime</a><span> predates the current moment. It touched </span><em>Steven Universe</em><span>, </span><em>How to Train Your Dragon</em><span> and </span><em>Teen Titans</em><span> — but predated </span><em>them</em><span>, too. </span></p><p><span>“In creating the flying sequences for 2002’s </span><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em><span>, Director Dean DeBlois recalls drawing on [the] influences of films like </span><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em><span> and </span><em>Porco Rosso</em><span>,” reported </span><em>Keyframe</em><span>. And </span><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em><span> itself was late to the party.</span></p><p><span>In fact, by that time, anime had been an overriding influence at Disney for more than a decade. The iconic animator Glen Keane </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110715150314/movies.radiofree.com/interviews/tangled_glen_keane.shtml" rel="">said in 2010</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… it’s hard to ever separate the huge influence that Japanese animation has had on me. I was just in awe of Miyazaki’s work, and have emulated his sensitivity, his approach to staging. That had a gigantic impact on our films starting with </em><span>Rescuers Down Under [1990]</span><em>, where you saw the huge Japanese influence on our work. That’s part of our heritage now, which we don’t back away from.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Anime has even informed Keane’s drawing — </span><em>The Art of Wreck-It Ralph</em><span> notes that he added “an anime flair” to the character Sergeant Calhoun. The look of </span><em>Tangled</em><span> has a lot of anime in it, too. </span></p><p><span>And Keane is far from the only Disney veteran of that era to cite anime as an influence. It was a hot topic at the company by the ‘80s and early ‘90s. </span><em>TaleSpin</em><span>’s co-creator Mark Zaslove once wrote, “I’d always felt that Hayao [Miyazaki] was lookin’ at our stuff […] God knows we were looking at his.” </span></p><p><span>Co-creator Jymn Magon </span><a href="https://www.animationsource.org/talespin/en/custom_questions/Porco-Rosso-likeliness/232.html&amp;nump=1338" rel="">agreed</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Mark’s right. We all owe a huge debt to Miyazaki. In fact, the day that Art Vitello was brought in to direct </em><span>Gummi Bears</span><em> </em><span>[… he]</span><em> said, “I want you to watch two movies before we even talk. Then you’ll know what is possible.” He showed me </em><span>Nausicaä</span><em> and </em><span>Laputa</span><em>... in Japanese! I didn’t have a clue what was going on, but I couldn’t get over the aerial scenes! I was an instant convert.</em></p><p><em>Then when I hired Mark a year or two later, I did the same thing — showed him Miyazaki. He was blown away, as well. Obviously it influenced us when it came time to create </em><span>TaleSpin</span><em>.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Even </span><em>TaleSpin</em><span> was a latecomer to anime, though. Before his rise to and fall from grace, John Lasseter was a young fan of</span><em> The Castle of Cagliostro</em><span>, showing it around California in the early-to-mid-1980s. “Technically, artistically, story-wise, this movie was a tremendous inspiration for me, and it had a profound impact on me,” </span><a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-culture/dating-advice-john-lasseter-win-girl-anime-153223.html" rel="">he’s said</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>One person who saw Lasseter’s copy of </span><em>Cagliostro</em><span> was the Disney artist Michael Peraza (</span><em>The Great Mouse Detective</em><span>). “When John Lasseter brought that film among others to show in the Disney theater I was really blown away,” he later </span><a href="http://michaelperaza.blogspot.com/2010/03/basil-of-baker-street-part-2.html" rel="">wrote</a><span>.

Anime wasn’t yet mainstream in America, but</span><em> artists </em><span>already knew about it.</span></p><p><span>Which blurs the traditional battle lines between “anime” and “Western animation.” By the early ‘90s, a huge portion of the ideas in American cartoons </span><em>came</em><span> from anime and manga.</span></p><p><span>That was true beyond the confines of Disney and Pixar. As researcher Raz Greenberg has </span><a href="https://blog.alltheanime.com/books-batman-the-animated-series/" rel="">written</a><span>, “The link between </span><em>Batman: The Animated Series</em><span> and anime is stronger than that of any other American show that came before it.” Its creators have </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/563410/batman-and-akira-connections/" rel="">spoken themselves</a><span> about that influence, and were “well aware” that the Japanese outsource artists on </span><em>Batman</em><span> had worked on </span><em>Akira</em><span> and the like. They were fans.</span></p><p><span>It was a trend even outside animation. Todd McFarlane was “</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-05-16-ca-59197-story.html" rel="">influenced by the gorier manga</a><span>” and anime for his </span><em>Spawn</em><span> franchise. Frank Miller (</span><em>Sin City</em><span>) had started taking from manga by the early ‘80s. Both artists helped to define the ‘90s vision of “cool” — violent, dark, grim and stylish. It’s hard to leave Japan out of that discussion.</span></p><p><span>So it went for Hollywood’s live-action directors — and not just the Wachowskis, who modeled </span><em>The Matrix</em><span> on </span><em>Ghost in the Shell</em><span>. Guillermo del Toro has </span><a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/97020-exclusive-interview-guillermo-del-toro-shifts-to-animation" rel="">recalled</a><span> “watching Japanese anime with Jim Cameron, because we used to show each other the latest anime back in the ’90s.” Cameron’s </span><em>Terminator 2</em><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gamespot/status/1490375988781404166" rel="">borrowed heavily</a><span> from </span><em>Akira</em><span> (one staffer </span><a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/making-nuclear-apocalypse-iconic-sequence-terminator-2-created-141209.html" rel="">remembered</a><span> using an </span><em>Akira</em><span> scene “almost like a storyboard”).</span></p><p><span>As for del Toro, he’s readily admitted that anime appears in his films. “You can see the enormous love I have for all things Japanese in everything I do,” </span><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement" rel="">he said</a><span>, citing directors like Miyazaki, Katsuhiro Otomo and Satoshi Kon.</span></p><p><span>Another devoted anime fan back then was Quentin Tarantino. “I love anime, but Quentin kept turning me on to anime I’d never seen before,” actress Chiaki Kuriyama (</span><em>Kill Bill</em><span>) </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/japaneseschoolgi0000ashc/page/56/mode/2up" rel="">once said</a><span>. “His knowledge was amazing.&#34;</span></p><p><span>The influence of anime permeated American film and TV during the ‘90s and 2000s. It was in </span><em>The Powerpuff Girls</em><span> and </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>. It was in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yqru5UXWGY" rel="">No Doubt</a><span> music videos. Gorillaz was a British band, but it was hard to escape on American TV during the 2000s — and it was openly inspired by anime. (“I’ve watched that film [</span><em>Castle in the Sky</em><span>] so many times,” </span><a href="https://gorillaz-news.livejournal.com/125028.html" rel="">said</a><span> the band’s artist Jamie Hewlett.)</span></p><p>Since then, anime’s influence has only grown — not just in America, but all around the world. By the ‘90s, anime was more popular in Europe than it was in the United States. Its biggest non-Japanese market for many years has been China. The global impact continues today.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png" width="1456" height="1095" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1095,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:1819256,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ec057c9-9b7e-459c-9fa6-6f8e19c9f843_1500x1128.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption><em>TaleSpin</em><span> (left) and </span><em>Batman: The Animated Series</em><span> — “Americanime” before most people in America knew what anime was</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>All of this raises a strange possibility. For a long time, anime has been positioned as the </span><em>next thing</em><span>. Something fresh, new and here to change the status quo. Artists took from it to upgrade their work. </span></p><p>And yet this process has been ongoing for three or four decades. The world’s been taking from anime since at least the early ‘80s.

On another level, though, they’re new entries in a long tradition. Pixar, and by extension Hollywood 3D animation, is attached to anime at the root. </span></p><p><span>As Lasseter </span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1999/1029/p18s1.html" rel="">said</a><span> in 1999, “When we have a problem […] we often watch a copy of one of Mr. Miyazaki’s films for inspiration.

Roger Ebert was </span><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/director-miyazaki-draws-american-attention" rel="">accusing</a><span> </span><em>Tarzan</em><span> of copying Miyazaki’s design sensibility by 1999, the same year that </span><em>Mulan</em><span>’s directors called Miyazaki “like a god to us.” </span><em>Big Hero 6</em><span>, </span><em>Tangled</em><span> and </span><em>Frozen</em><span> got even closer.</span></p><p>Today, Disney’s past and present are both entrenched in anime.
