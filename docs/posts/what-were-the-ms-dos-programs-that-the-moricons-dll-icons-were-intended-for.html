            <p>Last time, we looked at <a title="What were the MS-DOS programs that Windows used the progman.exe stock icons for?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250506-00/?p=111149"> the legacy icons in <tt>progman.exe</tt></a>. But what about <tt>moricons.dll</tt>?</p>
<p>Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the original Windows 3.1 <tt>moricons.dll</tt> file (in file order) and the programs that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in <tt>progman.exe</tt>, these icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the <tt>APPS.INF</tt> file.</p>

<p>Maybe seeing these program names will bring back a wave of nostalgia. Or maybe you’d rather forget that any of these ever existed.</p>
