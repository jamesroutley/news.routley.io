      <span>Abstract:</span>  Apache Kafka addresses the general problem of delivering extreme high volume
event data to diverse consumers via a publish-subscribe messaging system. It
uses partitions to scale a topic across many brokers for producers to write
data in parallel, and also to facilitate parallel reading of consumers. Even
though Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not
strictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into
partitions. The well-formulated fine-tuning that is needed in order to improve
an Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this
paper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given
topic. Then, given the set of brokers, constraints and application requirements
on throughput, OS load, replication latency and unavailability, we formulate
the optimization problem of finding how many partitions are needed and show
that it is computationally intractable, being an integer program. Furthermore,
we propose two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem: the first
tries to minimize and the second to maximize the number of brokers used in the
cluster. Finally, we evaluate its performance via large-scale simulations,
considering as benchmarks some Apache Kafka cluster configuration
recommendations provided by Microsoft and Confluent. We demonstrate that,
unlike the recommendations, the proposed heuristics respect the hard
constraints on replication latency and perform better w.r.t. unavailability
time and OS load, using the system resources in a more prudent way.
