<p data-block-key="3t1i7">One of my closest friends here in New York City has a newborn and I&#39;ve been coming by to help out when I can. I&#39;ve gotten quite a lot better at changing dirty diapers, but one time, just after I&#39;d finished, my friend looked at my handiwork and said, &#34;I&#39;m going to make an edit,&#34; and refastened it while explaining what she was doing to ensure a securer fit.</p><p data-block-key="7q07n">What a marvelous phrasing for a correction. I&#39;m going to remember that.</p>
