    <h1>Writing a Gimp 3.0 Plugin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>
GIMP 3.0 is almost out, and I&#39;m thrilled. Not only will this version bring new
features and improvements, but it finally modernizes the technology stack in two important ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It will use GTK 3

</li><li>
It will use Python 3

</li></ul>
<p>
This will make it easier and more sustainable to develop plugins for GIMP. The
old Python 2 plugins will not work anymore, but the new Python 3 plugins will
be more future-proof. I have a few ideas for plugins I want to write, so the
end of last year I started to dig into it. And while I&#39;m far from the only one 
with this idea, information on writing GIMP 3 plugins is naturally still sparse.
So I decided to write down some collected resources and notes. If you have more
resources or tips, feel free to contact me, I&#39;ll happily update the article.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Plugins can be written in C, Python 3, Scheme, JavaScript and Vala. I will
  focus on Python 3.

</li><li>
As with GIMP 2.10, GIMP 3.0 ships with a Python interpreter embedded and will not use the system Python.

</li><li>
It currently ships Python 3.11

</li><li>
The C-API documentation is available at <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/">https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/</a>

</li><li>
The Python API documentation is not yet available to read online, but can be
  found in a tarball in on the download page:
  <a href="https://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v3.0/api-docs/">https://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v3.0/api-docs/</a> It is however of limited
  benefit, since it doesn&#39;t contain any information not in the C-API
  documentation, except for the exact Python-method names, that can be guessed
  easily form the names for their C counterparts.

</li><li>
A basic tutorial on how to write a plugin in Python 3 can be found at
  <a href="https://testing.docs.gimp.org/3.0/en/gimp-using-python-plug-in-tutorial.html">https://testing.docs.gimp.org/3.0/en/gimp-using-python-plug-in-tutorial.html</a>

</li><li>
Your plugin should be placed in a subfolder of <code>~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/</code>
  and the main file must be named the same as the subfolder.

</li><li>
GIMP contains a Python REPL that can be started with
  <em>Filters -&gt; Development -&gt; Python-Fu -&gt; Console</em> or quicker with the search feature (<em>/</em> and then type Python)

</li><li>
The Python REPL has some code limited completion that sadly only works for classes not for instances.

</li><li>
You don&#39;t need to restart GIMP, when you edit your plugin. It&#39;s loaded from disk on every run.

</li><li>
Run GIMP from terminal to see errors and stdout output of your plugin.

</li><li>
The GIMP source code repository contains several plugins that can be used as
  examples. They are located in the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/tree/master/plug-ins">plug-ins folder</a>.

</li><li>
If you want to use any Python modules, other than the standard library, you
  have to bundle them with your plugin. You can install them in the plugin
  folder with <code>pip install --target /path/to/plugin somepackage</code>. You
  can use the <code>site</code> module to add additional paths to the Python search path.

</li><li>
If you got stuck, you can ask for help on the IRC channel <code>#gimp-dev</code> on
  <code>irc.gimp.org</code>.
