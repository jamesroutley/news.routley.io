    <h1>Woman who had pioneering cancer treatment 18 years ago still in remission</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>A woman treated with a pioneering type of immunotherapy for a solid tumour has been in remission for more than 18 years with no further treatments, experts have revealed.</p><p>The therapy involves taking T-cells, a type of white blood cell, from a patient and genetically engineering them to target and kill cancer cells. These modified T-cells are grown in a laboratory and then infused back into the patient.</p><p>Known as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy, the approach has proved particularly successful in treating <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/advanced-therapy-medicinal-products/car-t-therapy/" data-link-name="in body link">certain types</a> of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/15/cancer-extraordinary-results-t-cell-therapy-research-clinical-trials" data-link-name="in body link"> blood cancers</a>. Next-generation forms of the therapy have been approved for such cancers in countries <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/car-t-cell1.html#:~:text=CAR%20T%2Dcell%20therapies%20are,of%20treatment%20have%20been%20tried." data-link-name="in body link">including the US</a> and UK.</p><p>However, response rates have been less encouraging in solid tumours, with long-term outcomes unclear.</p><p>Now researchers have reported the longest known survival after CAR T-cell therapy for an active cancer, revealing a woman who was treated as a child 18 years ago has remained cancer free. Crucially, the therapy was given for a type of solid tumour called neuroblastoma, a rare cancer of the nerve tissue that develops in children.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/02/cancertcells-zip/giv-45596LJ53HJZ2NrO/&#34;,&#34;scriptUrl&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&#34;,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Diagram showing how T-cell therapy works&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:0,&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0},&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;4d8ac27f-fd87-4e99-ba3d-0999e25bf6eb&#34;,&#34;isMainMedia&#34;:false}"><figure id="4d8ac27f-fd87-4e99-ba3d-0999e25bf6eb" data-alt="Diagram showing how T-cell therapy works" data-testid="interactive-element-Diagram%20showing%20how%20T-cell%20therapy%20works" data-spacefinder-role="inline"><div data-name="placeholder"></div><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/02/cancertcells-zip/giv-45596LJ53HJZ2NrO/">Diagram showing how T-cell therapy works</a></figure></gu-island><p>Prof Helen Heslop, co-author of the research from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says the trial was one of the earliest to use CAR T-cell therapy for cancer.</p><p>“It’s nice to have such long-term follow-up and to see that even if it was a very early CAR T-cell – and there’s been a lot of work to make them better – we were still able to see a clinical remission that’s been sustained for this long, so that she’s grown up and is leading a normal life,” Heslop says.</p><figure id="3ad0bdc8-f674-4a95-b091-37acd5f8c285" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:8,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;First patients of pioneering CAR T-cell therapy ‘cured of cancer’&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;3ad0bdc8-f674-4a95-b091-37acd5f8c285&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/first-patients-pioneering-car-t-cell-therapy-cured-of-cancer&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:0,&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-8 | 8" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03513-0" data-link-name="in body link">Writing in the journal Nature Medicine</a>, Heslop and colleagues report how they recruited 19 children to take part in a phase 1 clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy for neuroblastoma between 2004 and 2009.</p><p>Over seven years that followed the therapy, 12 patients died due to relapsed neuroblastoma. Among the seven that survived beyond this point, five were cancer-free when given the CAR T-cell therapy but had previously been treated for neuroblastoma using other approaches and were at high risk of relapse. All five were disease-free at their last follow-up, between 10 and 15 years after the CAR T-cell therapy, although the team note they may already have been cured when the therapy was administered.</p><p>The other two surviving patients had cancer that was actively growing or spreading when they received CAR T-cell therapy, but subsequently went into complete remission. One of these patients stopped participating in follow-up sessions eight years after treatment, but the other continued and has remained cancer-free more than 18 years.</p><p>“She has never required any other therapy and is likely the longest-surviving patient with cancer who received CAR-T therapy,” the team write. “Encouragingly, she has subsequently had two full-term pregnancies with normal infants.”</p><p>The team add the modified T-cells were still detectable in some patients after more than five years. Heslop says that, while it is not known for sure, it could be that CAR T-cells that persist are able to tackle the cancer should it return.</p><p>Heslop adds that newer forms of CAR T-cell therapy have shown <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37018492/" data-link-name="in body link">a greater response in recent trials for neuroblastoma</a>, and may also help tackle some types of brain tumour in children.</p><p>Karin Straathof, the associate professor in tumour immunology at UCL’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Institute, who was not involved in the new study, says the results are beyond encouraging.</p><p>“This is really a solid demonstration that in solid cancers you can achieve complete responses, but also what we want really – and particularly for children’s cancers – long-lasting complete responses,” she says.</p><p>But Straathof says further work is needed, adding: “What we now are trying to focus on is understanding why does it work in some patients and why [it] doesn’t work in others, and what we can learn from that to make better designs of these chimeric antigen receptors.”</p></div></div></div>
