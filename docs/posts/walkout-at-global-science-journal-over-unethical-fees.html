    <h1>Walkout at global science journal over ‘unethical’ fees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>More than 40 leading scientists have resigned en masse from the editorial board of a top science journal in protest at what they describe as the “greed” of publishing giant Elsevier.</p><p>The entire academic board of the journal <em>Neuroimage</em>, including professors from Oxford University, King’s College London and Cardiff University <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdc77/status/1647971370473607169?s=20" title="" data-link-name="in body link">resigned</a> after Elsevier refused to reduce publication charges.</p><p>Academics around the world have applauded what many hope is the start of a rebellion against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science" title="" data-link-name="in body link">huge profit margins</a> in academic publishing, which outstrip those made by Apple, Google and Amazon.</p><p><em>Neuroimage</em>, the leading publication globally for brain-imaging research, is one of many journals that are now “open access” rather than sitting behind a subscription paywall. But its charges to authors reflect its prestige, and academics now pay over £2,700 for a research paper to be published<strong>.</strong> The former editors say this is “unethical” and bears no relation to the costs involved.</p><p>Professor Chris Chambers, head of brain stimulation at Cardiff University and one of the resigning team, said: “Elsevier preys on the academic community, claiming huge profits while adding little value to science.”</p><p>He has urged fellow scientists to turn their backs on the Elsevier journal and submit papers to a nonprofit open-access journal which the team is setting up instead.</p><p>He told the <em>Observer</em>: “All Elsevier cares about is money and this will cost them a lot of money. They just got too greedy. The academic community can withdraw our consent to be exploited at any time. That time is now.”</p><p>Elsevier, a Dutch company that claims to publish 25% of the world’s scientific papers, reported a <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/strong-revenue-and-profit-growth-at-relx-as-exhibitions-business-recovers-profitability#:~:text=RELX%2C%20the%20parent%20company%20of,%C2%A32.2bn%20in%202021." title="" data-link-name="in body link">10% increase in its revenue to £2.9bn</a> last year. But it’s the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-academic-publishing-disastrous-capitalism" title="" data-link-name="in body link">profit margins, nearing 40%</a>, according to its 2019 accounts, which anger academics most. The big scientific publishers keep costs low because academics write up their research – typically funded by charities and the public purse – for free. They “peer review” each other’s work to verify it is worth publishing for free, and academic editors collate it for free or for a small stipend. Academics are then often charged thousands of pounds to have their work published in open-access journals, or universities will pay very high subscription charges.</p><p>Stephen Smith, professor of biomedical engineering at Oxford University and formerly editor-in-chief at <em>Neuroimage</em>, said: “Academics really don’t like the way things are, but individuals feel powerless to get the huge publishers to start behaving more ethically.</p><p>Researchers put up with it because they want to publish in prestigious journals that will help their careers and ensure their work is widely read and cited.”</p><p>But he warned publishers, “Enough is enough. By taking the entire set of editors across to start the new journal, we are taking the reputation with us.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Elsevier said: “We value our editors very highly and are disappointed [with the resignations], especially as we have been engaging constructively with them over the last couple of years.”</p><p>He said the company was “committed to advancing open-access research” and its article publishing charges were “below the market average relative to quality. The fee for <em>NeuroImage</em> is below that of the nearest comparable journal in its field.”</p><p>Meanwhile, university libraries are angry about the cost of the online textbooks they say students now overwhelmingly want to read – often many times more expensive than their paper equivalent. Professor Chris Pressler, director of Manchester University Library, said: “We are facing a sustained onslaught of exploitative price models in both teaching and research.”</p><p>According to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix8AkrDisZnQ9TEPD0wFtPdG8to9WQ28l0qAqJ9ZOI0/edit#gid=0" title="" data-link-name="in body link">spreadsheet</a> of costs quoted to university librarians, Manchester University gave a recent example of being quoted £75 for a popular plant biology textbook in print, but £975 for a three-user ebook licence. Meanwhile <em>Learning to Read Mathematics in the Secondary School</em>, a textbook for trainee teachers published by Routledge, was £35.99 in print and £560 for a single user ebook.</p><p>A spokesperson for Taylor and Francis, which owns Routledge, said: “We strive to ensure that book prices are both affordable and a fair representation of their value.” He said a print book could be checked out for weeks at a time whereas ebooks could be checked in and out rapidly and had a much wider distribution.</p><p>He added: “Academic publishers provide services that are essential to a well-functioning research and scholarly communication ecosystem, and most researchers recognise this is a valuable service worth paying for. “</p><p>Caroline Ball, librarian at Derby University and co-founder of the academic campaign <a href="https://academicebookinvestigation.org/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">EbookSOS</a>, said: “This is creating a digital hierarchy of haves and have-nots. There are institutions that just can’t afford these prices for texts.”</p></div></div></div>
