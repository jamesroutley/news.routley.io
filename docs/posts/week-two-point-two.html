        <div><p>Week two! I spend a lot less time shaving yaks, which is good. Though I am
still trying to get around to a few more improvements there...</p>
<p>This week was both frustrating and satisfying... frustrating because I don&#39;t
feel like I really <em>completed</em> anything, but satisfying because I managed to
get unstuck a few times off really big challenges.</p>
<p>I spent a fair bit of time trying to implement parser combinators and made it
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/jspc/blob/main/main.ts#L47-L55">quite far</a>, but get
stuck on recursive definitions blowing the stack or failing signature checks. I
know this is possible, it&#39;s a solved problem after all, so I&#39;m going to
continue to try and figure that out next week.</p>
<p>More exciting is that I managed to build a simple sine wave program in zig that
uses <a href="http://libsound.io/">libsoundio</a> to interface directly with the audio
hardware on my computer. In the past I&#39;ve <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/how-rust-do/">played with
audio</a> by building a .wav file and then
playing it back, but real time output opens up a lot of possibilities for
synthesis and other types of processing. I am hoping this will be one of my
major projects next week, and I plan to write about it a lot.</p>
<p>Notably, I was also able to <em>build</em> that in both C and zig <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html"><em>using zig</em></a>.
This is one of zig&#39;s killer features, and though I had some trouble getting it
set up initially (my locally built zig was dynamically linked to my system llvm
and needed to be linked statically, for the curious), it basically just worked
like magic. Very excited about that!! Thanks to Rippy for unsticking me on that
and showing me some pretty excellent C land debugging tricks.</p>
<p>On the negative side, I didn&#39;t write any more posts other than this short one
here. I have many drafts but I am always fighting my desire to write really
long things. I am working on that, perfect is the enemy of the good etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known about this book for a long time but it&#39;s always sounded interesting.
It came up recently and I decided to put it back on my list.</p>
