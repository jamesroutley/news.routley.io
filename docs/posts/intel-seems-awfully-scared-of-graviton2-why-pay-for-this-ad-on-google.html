<h2>1. Performance for all workloads</h2>

<p>That might be true for some scenarios, but not for many common workloads. For example, Intel Xeon M5 instances outperform Graviton2 M6g in database, web/Java, and single-threaded computations up to 1.8x.<sup>1</sup> Intel has the speed your business needs.</p>

<h2>3. Just say NO to single-cloud porting</h2> 
<p>You may have heard that it’s no big deal to port your code from one architecture to another. However, porting takes time and money. It’s a complicated, intense process. Plus, ARM doesn’t run every software program out there, so when you’re ready to add new functionality from Intel, you’ll be stuck with the limitation of ARM and the long-term cost and hassle of managing multiple code bases.</p>

<h2>4. Multicloud improves business stability</h2> 
<p>No one wants to limit their business agility by locking into a specific solution. Instead, build in flexibility by using common code that runs easily across many vendors and on prem. Intel-based instances ensure compatibility and supportability across multiple cloud solutions to help reduce business risk and keep your options open.</p>

<h2>9. Scale to the skies</h2> 
<p>There are over 50,000 Intel-based instance types across multiple cloud platforms.<sup>7</sup> That makes it easy to scale. And when you need the latest features, like integrated AI and crypto acceleration, that’s easy to scale too. These advanced platforms also include massive memory capacity, fast networking and storage with PCIe Gen4, plus 39% more memory bandwidth<sup>8</sup> than previous generations. When you’ve got that kind of scalability in your cloud instances, the sky’s the limit.</p>
