          <p>A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University&#39;s <a href="https://luddy.indiana.edu/">Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering</a>, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.</p>
<p>He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/serious-ios-bug-makes-it-easy-to-steal-users-icloud-passwords/">here</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/ios-and-android-weaknesses-allow-stealthy-pilfering-of-website-credentials/">here</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/flawed-sign-in-services-from-google-and-facebook-imperil-user-acconts/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>&#34;None of this is in any way normal&#34;</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, Wang&#39;s email account, phone number, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241205182256/https://cs.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?XiaoFeng_Wang">profile page</a> at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/nianli-ma">Nianli Ma</a>, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university&#39;s Library Technologies division.</p>

They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/fbi-searches-home-in-carmel-indiana-seizes-boxes-of-evidence/531-969e30e2-e599-4c08-b72c-3ba6227cdb89">reported</a> that a second home owned by Wang and Ma and located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.</p>
