      <p>I’m currently working on a macOS app that’s built with Racket and
allows the user to write small scripts to process and filter some
data.  While Racket is definitely <em>my</em> preferred language and I could
easily use it for these scripts, my target audience for this app would
probably appreciate a more familiar language.  I decided to use <a href="https://lua.org">Lua</a>.
So, last weekend I was faced with a choice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> between writing FFI
bindings for Lua or implementing a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Module_Syntax.html#%28part._hash-lang%29">#lang</a> in Racket.  Of course, I
picked the harder option.  Partly because it seemed like the more fun
option, and partly because this way I don’t have to worry about making
two (three? did I mention Swift’s also in the mix?) very different
runtimes cooperate.</p>
<p>It’s pretty far along at this point, though some Lua standard library
functionality is still missing and a couple things are still missing
lexer support (long brackets, scientific notation for numbers).  If
you want to play around with it, you can get it from the package
server by installing <code>lua-lang</code> or <code>lua-lib</code> if you don’t want the
docs.  You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Bogdanp/racket-lua">on GitHub</a> and the docs <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/lua-manual@lua-lang/index.html">on the
package server</a>.</p>
