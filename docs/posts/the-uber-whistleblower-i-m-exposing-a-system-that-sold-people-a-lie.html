It includes company presentations, briefing notes, security reports and tens of thousands of emails and WhatsApp, iMessage and chat exchanges between the company’s most senior staff at the time.</p><p>They include Travis Kalanick, Uber’s combative co-founder and then chief executive, David Plouffe, a former Barack Obama campaign aide who became a senior vice-president at Uber, and Rachel Whetstone, a British PR executive who has also held senior roles at Google, Facebook and now Netflix.</p><p>When MacGann departed Uber in 2016, Whetstone described him as “a wonderful leader”. Plouffe called him a “talented public policy professional” and “terrific advocate for Uber”.</p><p>The one-time cheerleader-in-chief for Uber in Europe, MacGann now looks set to become one of its sharpest critics.</p><p>His profile as a senior executive and political insider make him an unusual whistleblower. So, too, does the fact he actively participated in some of the wrongdoing he is seeking to expose – and the fact it took him more than five years after leaving the company to speak out.</p><p>The process through which he came to re-evaluate what he witnessed at Uber was a gradual one, he says. “When I decided I had an obligation to speak up, I then went about finding the most effective, impactful way in which to do that. Doing what I am doing isn’t easy, and I hesitated. That said, there’s no statute of limitations on doing the right thing.”</p><p>MacGann is understood to have recently reached an out-of-court settlement with Uber after a legal dispute relating to his remuneration. He said he was prohibited from discussing his legal dispute but acknowledged he had had personal grievances with the company, which he alleges undervalued his role as an interlocutor with government and failed in its duty of care to him.</p><figure id="80fbf403-b0d7-4826-979d-2b7d7ac77444" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=feb9b6580d4aa2f76304f02cd7d9bebe" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7a3b2031203c792b36b0620228515d6c" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0581be3ab8e063586320b9b48762d316" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b1649d2f33a249d2ebd32ea92f7f7a43" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=9399c25baad977f4753cc4e2adc10d74" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ce4ed843becebdd2cae601abde7b6321" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="MacGann and Kalanick" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720c248ae394d69be69fc127a0c23264ceb2c53d/0_118_1024_650/master/1024.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7a3b2031203c792b36b0620228515d6c" height="650" width="1024" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>MacGann (right) and Travis Kalanick</span></figcaption></figure><p>He accuses Uber under Kalanick’s leadership of adopting a confrontational strategy with opponents in taxi industries, that left him personally exposed. As a public face of Uber in Europe, MacGann bore the brunt of what became a fierce backlash against the company in countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Spain.</p><p>Amid threats to his life, he was given bodyguard protection. His experience of working at Uber, he says, took a mental toll and contributed to a subsequent diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p><h2>Brazenly breaking the law</h2><p>A Brussels insider, MacGann was an obvious pick to lead Uber’s government relations in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region in 2014. Born in Ireland, he speaks several languages and possessed an impressive contacts book built up over two decades in lobbying and public affairs.</p><p>MacGann had worked at established public policy firms such as Weber Shandwick and Brunswick, and had run DigitalEurope, a trade association that advocated for companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Sony. His most recent job had been as senior vice-president at the New York Stock Exchange on a salary of $750,000 a year.</p><p>MacGann took a significant salary cut to work at Uber for €160,000. But like all senior executives joining the company back then, the financial reward was in the promise of stock options that could be worth millions if Uber realised its global ambitions.</p><figure id="39b6e6bf-5879-4fa8-864e-bd97f9e9e5ce" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:30,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-files-leak-reveals-global-lobbying-campaign&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Uber broke laws, duped police and secretly lobbied governments, leak reveals&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;39b6e6bf-5879-4fa8-864e-bd97f9e9e5ce&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:1,&#34;theme&#34;:5,&#34;design&#34;:8}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-30 | 30" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Uber and its investors were eyeing vast returns if the tech company succeeded in its mission to deregulate markets, monopolise cities, transform transit systems and one day even replace drivers with autonomous vehicles. The plan, MacGann acknowledges, required Uber to flout the law in cities in which regulated taxi markets required hard-to-get licences to drive a cab.</p><p>“The company approach in these places was essentially to break the law, show how amazing Uber’s service was, and then change the law. My job was to go above the heads of city officials, build relations with the top level of government, and negotiate. It was also to deal with the fallout.”</p><p>MacGann started work for Uber around the summer of 2014, when he worked on contract for a European lobbying consultancy that Uber had hired to oversee government relations outside the US. In October 2014, Uber brought him in-house and put him in charge of public policy for the EMEA region.</p><p>On his first day on staff, MacGann was in an Uber from London City airport when he got his first taste of the startup’s laissez-faire approach to privacy. After emailing a senior executive to tell them he was in traffic, MacGann received the reply: “I’m watching you on Heaven – already saw the ETA!”</p><p>“Heaven”, otherwise known as “God View”, was the codeword Uber employees used at the time for a tool that allowed staff to surreptitiously use the app’s backend technology to surveil the real-time movements of any user in the world.</p><p>“It felt like children playing around with powerful surveillance technology,” said MacGann. “Even back then it was dawning on me this was a rogue company.”</p><p>In its statement, Uber said tools such as God View, which it stopped using in 2017, “should never have been used”. A spokesperson for Kalanick said it would be false to suggest he ever “directed illegal or improper conduct”.</p><figure id="a12b11da-6ce2-43ea-8dae-cd67ce9a301a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=ffb8d06147b3024131a6e7ad8748aba0" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1957f39e92673250c3b427b9d1d59a1d" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0e424730c4ce758fc71e053f3fec6686" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=30f204e27db3e7e6c1eee59ddc94ad6d" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=415942d60ddd3c2898e8378b9b03ba66" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=553a77de499a5bd88a474e0a89364fe4" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Travis Kalanick in 2018" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af0b60bb857b22b1e32c0e75ca9760a87c6308/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1957f39e92673250c3b427b9d1d59a1d" height="1800" width="3000" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Travis Kalanick in 2018.</span> Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The Uber files contain some instances in which MacGann pushes back at the company’s operations and decisions.

Taxi drivers snapped surveillance-style photos of MacGann outside a hotel with friends and uploaded them to the internet.</p><figure id="a45bfaa7-acf0-4a4d-9cda-4196505cc8a5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a8559552b91493f47949d642adf0c55c" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=317c9404f5083066eeba652867ed6938" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6e28a2dcfc12e060a9ac04a611d7aab2" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=863573fc8cabf6cd4a85693b65693f89" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f3250ec35993fe77468c780b9df6a131" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=10614515fa7c0c5003f994266e550d9e" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Surveillance photos uploaded to the internet of MacGann outside a hotel in Brussels" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925eecb6ba611696a1292d92576f9f5dc82daaec/306_21_1989_1428/master/1989.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=317c9404f5083066eeba652867ed6938" height="1428" width="1989" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Surveillance-style photos uploaded to the internet of MacGann outside a hotel in Brussels</span></figcaption></figure><p>In August that year, a security report commissioned by Uber mentioned rumours that MacGann and another Uber executive were going to be “taken off the streets by a core group of taxi drivers”.</p><p>Uber gave MacGann a personal team of bodyguards.

They displayed photos of MacGann and two other Uber executives. The caption read: “International criminals.”</p><p>In October 2015, MacGann emailed a colleague: “I have had bodyguards full-time now for five months and it is becoming very stressful.” A week later, he told Plouffe and Whetstone of his intention to resign. He officially departed four months later, on 12 February 2016.</p><p>It seemed an amicable split. Publicly, he expressed no regrets and used his Facebook page to lavish praise on Kalanick.</p><p>“Toughest boss I ever had and I’m a stronger leader for it,” he said, adding there was “no thing” he would change about his time at Uber. “Forget the hyperbole in the media; forget the intrigue; think about how pushing a button and getting a ride makes your life better.”</p><p>In his departure email to colleagues, MacGann described himself as “a strong believer in Uber’s mission”. </p><p>Uber publicly commended MacGann’s work and asked him to stay on as a consultant.</p><p>He was given a new job title – senior board adviser – and retained his Uber-provided emails, laptops and phones.</p><p>That role ended in August 2016, after which MacGann took on a new job at a telecoms company and started his own business venture.

MacGann called the police. A security report commissioned by Uber questioned whether the taxi drivers had recognised him. But he recalls the drivers yelling: “MacGann, we will get you, we know where you live.”</p><p>He recalls them thumping on the windows and rocking the car from side to side. Three taxi drivers were taken to the police station, but no further action was taken.</p><p>MacGann said he was left fearing for his life – and that of his Uber driver, who “was shaking and in tears, scared for his life”. “These taxi drivers had his licence number, they could come after him again. It just seemed to me that Uber viewed this guy as expendable supply – not an employee with rights.”</p><p>Shortly afterwards, MacGann received an anonymous threat on Twitter: “One day police won’t be there and you’ll be alone. And we will see if money will help you.”</p><p>MacGann held his former employer responsible. “I felt that Uber had caused this, by its ‘success at all costs approach’ that encouraged confrontations between Uber and taxi drivers … I started to feel it was indicative of Uber’s wider relationship with drivers, putting them in harm’s way for their own financial interests.”</p><p>By mid-2018, MacGann said, the death of a close friend contributed to a deterioration in his mental health. A medical report from March 2019 said a subsequent diagnosis of PTSD was “evidently linked and impacted by the professional stress he had to endure” during his time at Uber.</p><p>MacGann said that months of treatment and therapy between 2018 and 2019 – and an enforced period of personal reflection – led him to reassess his time at Uber. “I’d stepped off the corporate hamster wheel for the first time in decades. I emerged with a new sense of clarity about everything at Uber.”</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false&#34;,&#34;scriptUrl&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&#34;,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Get in Touch embed&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:1,&#34;theme&#34;:5,&#34;design&#34;:8},&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;e7466f35-13d9-42b3-8556-0b3c34ea1dca&#34;,&#34;isMainMedia&#34;:false}"><figure id="e7466f35-13d9-42b3-8556-0b3c34ea1dca" data-alt="Get in Touch embed" data-cypress="interactive-element-Get%20in%20Touch%20embed" data-spacefinder-role="inline"><div data-name="placeholder"></div><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false">Get in Touch embed</a></figure></gu-island><p>No longer living the fast-paced life of a corporate executive, MacGann had time to listen more carefully to the stories of Uber drivers who were ferrying him around. He credits those conversations with changing his understanding of what the company used to call “driver economics”.</p><p>In its statement, Uber’s spokesperson said “driver earnings globally are at or near all-time highs today” and that Uber’s interests were “aligned with drivers, ensuring they have a positive experience earning on the platform”. If drivers were dissatisfied with its platform, she added, “they can and do choose to earn somewhere else”.</p><p>In the statement released after MacGann identified himself as the whistleblower, Uber said his litigation against the company was “an attempt, among other things, to get paid a bonus he claimed to be owed for his work at Uber. That lawsuit recently ended with him being paid €550,000. It is noteworthy that Mark felt compelled to ‘blow the whistle’ only after his cheque cleared.”</p><p>MacGann first contacted the Guardian five months before his legal dispute with Uber was settled and placed no restriction on when journalists could use the leaked data. He disputes Uber’s claim that he has been paid €550,000, and said he was still awaiting his full payout from the settlement. </p><figure id="b7a21bc4-de9e-4626-81bb-b4bb6cb0f2d0" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e9383644d44b6fa20d6ba2beb6a58bdc" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c0ffc484a47325f1d29bbb44aba234da" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f7975e8c6944d7e2e2a288f781b5642a" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ed785a119e3c29ae784d85e6140332d3" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=cd23673c82c9ee8228efca4c52421103" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ad17c2ced63bc1852d8ac7d28993ea8e" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6134a28a1e58551439798c159a4c7628" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e7819f408102ef0d17f127733801e9f9" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=18f1d9d0a643fe67e6eea26857192a4e" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6ef61513d3d8f3de0e71cbc797740d7d" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=94bed43d6e7ca5323f352b8eab6c692d" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6378d8448c43a8ac27336e7c5d1327b8" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="A phone displaying the Uber app in front of a taxi rank at Waterloo station in London." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a55e003b08fa85bb216a3cdd1dbcdb6d564be6/0_0_7630_5077/master/7630.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c0ffc484a47325f1d29bbb44aba234da" height="5077" width="7630" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A phone displaying the Uber app in front of a taxi rank at Waterloo station in London.</span> Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2>Sharing secrets</h2><p>In February 2020, MacGann, increasingly angered by what he viewed as the mistreatment of drivers, tried to take action. Uber was appealing against a decision by Transport for London (TfL) to refuse the company a licence in the capital, on the grounds it failed to meet the “fit and proper” test.</p><p>Emailing the mayor’s office, MacGann explained he was a former Uber executive with information to share in a “private and non-sensationalist manner, given my intimate knowledge of the company”. MacGann said he felt “frustrated” when his attempt to formally raise concerns about Uber did not receive a reply.</p><p>In February 2021, MacGann went a step further. After reading about a French lawyer who was bringing a class action lawsuit against Uber on behalf of drivers, MacGann got in touch and offered to provide information to help their case. The lawyer visited him at his home and MacGann allowed him to take photographs of a small sample of Uber documents he had stored on his old computer.</p><p>His relationship with the French lawyer turned out to be short-lived. But the dam had been broken. MacGann realised quite how many of Uber’s secrets he was sitting on.</p><p>In January 2022, Uber’s former top lobbyist travelled to Geneva and met with reporters from the Guardian.</p><p>He opened two suitcases and pulled out laptops, hard drives, iPhones and bundles of paper. He warned it would take a few days, at best, to explain everything he knew. “I’ve seen some really shady shit, to use one of the Silicon Valley expressions.”</p></div></div></div>
