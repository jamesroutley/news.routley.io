(short for “terminal mux” (short for “multiplexer”))
is
<a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>
for your terminal.
Oh, it’s so much more than that, and I recently discovered with
some joy that it is installed by default on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
but its fundamental value add to any programmer who has to
SSH into servers more than once a week is it allows you to
split your screen up into multiple independent shells
<em>without needing a graphical environment at all</em>.
If you want to walk the path of true digital minimalism,
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vanilla Vim</a>
and tmux or its spiritual grandfather
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
are all you need.</p><p>So it’s always been interesting to me that a developer as
seasoned as
<a href="https://kovidgoyal.net/">Kovid Goyal</a>,
developer of the ePub powerhouse calibre and
my current teminal emulator of choice
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>,
has gone on record a number of times saying he is not a fan
of tmux. He has
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-am-using-tmux-and-have-a-problem">a whole section in his FAQ about it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[T]erminal multiplexers are <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745">a bad idea</a>, do not use them, if at all possible. kitty contains features that do all of what tmux does, but better, with the exception of remote persistence.</p></blockquote><p>(I don’t use remote persistence. I’m aware I’m a
caveman.)</p><p>And from the linked Git comment:</p><blockquote><p>[Terminal m]ultiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of windows/sessions. […] Energy/performance wise they are poison, every byte has to be parsed twice, once by the middleman and once by the terminal. And they act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get any new features. […] Terminals [themselves] are fine, certainly better than any other interface paradigm I have ever seen.</p></blockquote><p>I’m not here to incur Goyal’s wrath. He knows way more
about this space than I do, and I’m clearly a very
satisfied user of kitty at home, where I have the
ability to tweak my environment to be exactly what
I want it to be.</p><p>Therein lies the rub. At home, I run UNIX on my metal.
At work, I use Windows. And so, the multiple times a
day I find myself SSHing into one of our many, many
quasi-embedded Linux boxes, I find myself typing out
“tmux” as the first command I run. Because it’s always
going to be there, and it does the one thing I actually
need it to no matter what: Let me run multiple shells
at once, without SSHing in multiple times, regardless
of whatever funky terminal emulator I’m actually using
to get the job done. Alacritty, Windows Terminal,
whatever.</p><p>kitty has to run on what I’m remoting <em>from</em>.
tmux can work on what I’m remoting <em>into</em>.
And that makes
all the difference.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jerseay_style">Worse is better</a>
is more of a product managment philosophy than a
software philosophy, IMO, but it basically underlines
the idea that whatever your software’s killer app is,
you want to get that <em>really</em> right for the most common
use cases, even if it means living with a suboptimal
approach.
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-vms-in-hacker-pedagogy/">I love VMs for a lot of reasons</a>,
and I even maintain
<a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu">a set of 3 shell scripts</a>
which turns a vanilla Ubuntu VM into my personal software
development workhorse, complete with LazyVim, ripgrep,
tmux, and - yes - Kitty as the default terminal.
But even with that it’s
rare these days that I am doing such prolonged development
work that I feel it’s worth actually working in
such a VM. The perils of becoming a middle manager, alas.</p><p>So, for the most part, I remote in directly
from Windows. Which means I’m going to use tmux on
my servers. Which is why I have <code>C-b %</code> and <code>C-b &#34;</code>
memorized and not … <em>checks kitty docs</em> … wait,
is it really <code>C-S-Enter</code>?</p><p>That’s so <em>nice</em>. Man. We are missing out.</p></div></article></div></div>
