    <h1>Goodbye to the C&#43;&#43; Implementation of Zig</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="how-we-used-webassembly-to-annihilate-80000-lines-of-legacy-code">How we used WebAssembly to annihilate 80,000 lines of legacy code</h2><p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>It’s funny - I have shared this story a handful of times with friends of mine
who are qualified, competent software engineers, and each time the response was
confusion about why any of this would be necessary or even remotely helpful. <em>WebAssembly</em>?!</p><p>After ten minutes of puzzled expressions, furrowed brows, and intense
questioning, something clicks, and everything makes sense - but it takes patient
explanation and reasoning from first principles to follow along.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot of GitHub Pull Request depicting many lines deleted" src="https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/github-pr-lines.png"/></p><h3 id="the-problem-statement">The Problem Statement</h3><p>Before this change, the Zig codebase consisted of two compilers:</p><ul><li>The old one, written in 80,000 lines of C++, plus sharing Zig code with the new one.</li><li>The new one, written in 250,000 lines of Zig.</li></ul><p>The new one was faster, used less memory, and was actively maintained and
enhanced. Meanwhile, nobody wanted to touch the old one, but it was required to
build the new one from source.</p><p>This means that <strong>new Zig language features had to be implemented twice</strong> - once in
the new codebase, and then again in the old codebase. This was a huge pain,
especially as the design of these two compilers diverged.</p><p>Furthermore, the C++ implementation of Zig originally used the same strategy as
the D compiler - not freeing memory until process exit. This design
decision <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped being practical</a>
as compile-time code execution became one of the flagship features of the
language, and projects grew larger combined with Zig using one compilation unit
for everything.</p><p><img src="https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/oom.png" alt="The DOOM logo but with ‘D’ removed, humorously indicating Out Of Memory"/></p><h3 id="the-solution-space">The Solution Space</h3><p>This problem is fascinating, and there are many solutions to it, each with
their own set of tradeoffs. In all the conversations I mentioned above, once the
problem was clear in the person’s mind whom I was talking to, the discussion
turned to a rapid-fire brainstorming session about different possibilities.
Each idea had a different set of concrete benefits as well as downsides.</p><p><strong>Don’t self-host</strong> - This is the approach taken by
<a href="https://odin-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Odin</a>, for example.</p><p>It entirely solves the problem, but the downside, obviously, is that we would
have to use C instead of Zig. I’m not willing to do that because the
improvements offered by the language are too great to miss out on. For example,
some of the <a href="https://media.handmade-seattle.com/practical-data-oriented-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Oriented Design techniques that I
used</a> are
impractical in C/C++ because of language footguns.</p><p><strong>Use a prior build of the compiler</strong> - This is the approach taken by
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a> as well as many other languages.</p><p>One big downside is losing the ability to build any commit from source without
meta-complexity creeping in. For example, let’s say that you are trying to do
<code>git bisect</code>. At some point, git checks out an older commit, but the script
fails to build from source because the binary that is being used to build the
compiler is now the wrong version. Sure, this can be addressed, but this
introduces unwanted complexity that contributors would rather not deal with.</p><p>Additionally, building the compiler is limited by what targets prior binaries
are available for. For example, if there is not a riscv64 build of the compiler available,
then you can’t build from source on riscv64 hardware.</p><p>The bottom line here is that it does not adequately support the use case of
being able to build any commit on any system.</p><p><strong>Compile the compiler to C code</strong> - This is the approach taken by
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nim</a>, for example.</p><p>The upside compared to the previous strategy is that committing generated
C source code to source control <em>feels</em> less yucky than committing machine code,
but it is effectively the same if the C code is target-specific.</p><p>I’m not sure how target-independent <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/csources_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nim’s generated C
code</a> is, for example, but I see in
the description it says “Supports more CPU/OS combinations than the older
csources repository” which implies that, while it has many handy combinations in
there, it is not truly portable C code. It is also in a separate repository than
the main compiler, so it suffers from the same problems as the previous
strategy.</p><p>In Zig’s case, I explored this possibility, and found the generated C code to
not only be target-specific, but also large. For us it was an 80 MiB C file,
and, while this could be improved with C backend enhancements, this is orders
of magnitude larger than I would feel comfortable with when it comes to
committing a binary file to a Git repository.</p><p><strong>Compile the compiler to C code exactly once, but clean it up and maintain it
directly from then on</strong> - This is what I <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5246#issuecomment-685172360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to do for
years</a> until
I actually started investigating implementing the approach. This has the
obvious downside that cleaning up a massive amount of auto-generated C source
code is a task straight from Computer Science Hell, and plus from that point on
we’re still stuck with two compiler implementations, making contributors less
motivated to help out since they would have to do all the work twice, once in
Zig, and once in C.</p><p><strong>Compile the compiler to a simple virtual machine</strong> -
Occasionally, I talk shop with <a href="https://drewdevault.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drew DeVault</a>
since he’s working on <a href="https://harelang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hare</a>. We started chatting
about compiler bootstrapping and he mentioned <a href="https://ocaml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCaml</a>’s
strategy off the cuff:</p><pre><code>&lt;andrewrk&gt; do you care about the &#34;stage 0&#34; bootstrapping process?
&lt;ddevault&gt; marginally
&lt;andrewrk&gt; idea is to start with literally only a text editor and get up and running
&lt;ddevault&gt; text editor? pfft! back in my day we used a magnetized needle and a steady hand
&lt;andrewrk&gt; classic xkcd
&lt;andrewrk&gt; did I say text editor? I meant hex editor
&lt;ddevault&gt; anyway, there&#39;s a bootstrapping path taken by, uh, ocaml I think
&lt;ddevault&gt; which is kind of interesting
&lt;ddevault&gt; they have a backend for a tiny VM target
&lt;ddevault&gt; you implement that VM on your desired platform and you can then compile ocaml proper
&lt;andrewrk&gt; ooooooh
</code></pre><p>This got my creative juices flowing. A bespoke backend just for bootstrapping
is a neat idea, but I think the sweet spot for Zig looks different than what it
does for OCaml.</p><p>There is exactly one VM target available to Zig that is both OS-agnostic and
subject to <a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLVM</a>’s state-of-the-art optimization passes,
and that is <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a>, using
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WASI</a> as the operating system abstraction layer.</p><h3 id="exploring-the-idea">Exploring the Idea</h3><p>The idea here is to use a minimal wasm binary as a <em>stage1 kernel</em> that is
committed to source control and therefore can be used to build any commit from
source. We provide a minimal WASI interpreter implementation that is built from
C source, and then used to translate the Zig self-hosted compiler source code
into C code. The C code is then compiled and linked, again by the system C
compiler, into a stage2 binary. The stage2 binary can then be used repeatedly
with <code>zig build</code> to build from source from that point on.</p><p>The wasm binary is produced with <code>zig build update-zig1</code> which uses the LLVM
backend to produce a
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.10.0/#ReleaseSmall">ReleaseSmall</a> binary
that targets <code>wasm32-wasi</code> with a CPU of <code>generic+bulk_memory</code>. <strong>All backends in
this binary are disabled except for the C backend</strong>. This produces a 2.6 MiB
file. It is then further optimized with <code>wasm-opt -Oz --enable-bulk-memory</code>
bringing the total down to 2.4 MiB. Finally, it is compressed with
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zstd</a>, bringing the total down to 637 KB.
This is offset by the size of the zstd decoder implementation in C, however it
is worth it because the zstd implementation will change rarely if ever, saving
a total of 1.8 MiB every time the wasm binary is updated.</p><p>Thus, instead of 80,000 lines of C++, there are now 4,000 of portable C. This code
only uses standard libc functions, and does not depend on any POSIX headers or
windows.h. The OS interop layer has been completely abstracted into a handful
of WASI functions to be implemented in the WASI interpreter:</p><pre><code>(import &#34;wasi_snapshot_preview1&#34; &#34;args_sizes_get&#34; (func (;0;) (type 3)))

</code></pre><p>This is the entire set. In order for the Zig compiler to compile itself to C,
these are the only syscalls needed.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jacobly0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Young</a> and I worked together on this
WebAssembly/WASI interpreter over in
<a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/zig-wasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">andrewrk/zig-wasi</a>. I created the first
version in Zig, swiftly exploring the idea by taking advantage of Zig’s rich
standard library and safety mechanisms. This interpreter did not preemptively
decode the wasm module; instead it used the file offset directly as the program
counter. It worked fine, but was too slow, taking several hours to interpret
a run of the compiler that, in native machine code, takes about 5 seconds.</p><p>Jacob enhanced the project by introducing a different instruction set more
optimized for interpretation, as well as a myriad of other techniques that
brought the performance within acceptable limits. Meanwhile, I got to work on
converting the codebase from Zig to pure C.</p><p>We worked side by side on this project for two weeks, using IRC to communicate,
cherry-picking commits from each other’s branches and sharing frustrations,
celebrating victories, and generally having a blast hacking with each other. I
really can’t give enough credit to how much work Jacob did on this project,
especially considering he was responsible for <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.10.0/release-notes.html#C-Backend">improving Zig’s C
backend</a>
enough to make this a possibility.</p><p>Once the concept was proved, Jacob realized it could be made even faster by
converting the WebAssembly code to C code rather than interpreting it directly.
This is effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JIT
compilation</a>, but
taking advantage of the fact that our basic bootstrapping tool is the system C
compiler.</p><p>There is already a general-purpose wasm2c tool out there as part of the
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly Binary Toolkit</a> project, but
instead of porting or forking it, Jacob created a wasm2c implementation from scratch.
This alternate implementation intentionally lacks general usefulness; it only
contains implementations of WASI functions that the compiler actually calls
when it builds itself!</p><p>Among other benefits, this allows our happy little wasm2c implementation to be
4,000 lines instead of 60,000, have no dependency on C++, and take simplifying
shortcuts such as not implementing any sandboxing or security measures.</p><h3 id="the-new-build-process">The New Build Process</h3><p>Here is what we finally landed on:</p><pre><code>Building CXX object CMakeFiles/zigcpp.dir/src/zig_llvm.cpp.o

byte-for-byte. In other words, <code>zig3</code> and <code>zig4</code> are identical, and therefore
we are finished and name this final binary <code>zig</code> without any suffix.</p><p>The wasm binary only needs to be updated when a breaking change or new feature
affects the compiler <em>when building itself</em>. For example, a bug fix that the
compiler does not trigger when building itself can be ignored. However, if the
bug fix is required for Zig to build itself, then the wasm binary needs to
be updated. Similarly when the language is changed and the compiler wants to
use the changes to build itself, the binary needs to be updated.</p><p>Updating <code>stage1/zig1.wasm.zst</code> looks like this:</p><pre><code>zig build update-zig1
</code></pre><h3 id="performance">Performance</h3><p>I collected two measurements:</p><p><strong>Measurement #1</strong>, compiling from source with <code>make -j8 install</code>, configured with
<code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</code>:</p><pre><code>old: 8m12s with 11.3 GiB peak RSS
new: 9m59s with  3.8 GiB peak RSS
</code></pre><p><strong>Measurement #2</strong>, compiling from source with <code>ninja install</code>, configured with
<code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</code>:</p><pre><code>old: 13m20s with 10.3 GiB peak RSS
new: 10m53s with  3.2 GiB peak RSS
</code></pre><p>I took these measurements racing against each other, and one of them while
<a href="https://twitch.tv/andrewrok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streaming on Twitch</a>, so the times are a bit
volatile, but you get the idea. The important thing to note here is the amount
of memory required to build. It’s the difference between a person with 4-8 GiB of
RAM being able to contribute to Zig or not. It’s the difference between being
able to <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/13802" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a GitHub-provided Actions
runner</a> or not.</p><h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3><p>I want to be clear that while this change landing in Zig is a net win, it does
represent the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regression of a particular use
case</a>: the ability to bootstrap Zig
from only source code in a fixed number of steps. Until now, the building from
source process did not involve any binary blobs, except for a system C/C++
compiler. Now, there is this WebAssembly binary, which is not source code, but
is in fact a build artifact. Some people, rightly, take these things very seriously - see
for example the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianFreeSoftwareGuidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.</p><p>I openly acknowledge that this cost is being paid, however, I strongly believe
that it is worth it in the end. I suspect that combined with an official language specification
and a growing popularity of Zig, we will see a third-party project start an
alternate Zig implementation in C, similar to how
<a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mrustc</a> exists for Rust (despite not
yet having a spec). This would fill the necessary role to solve O(1) source
bootstrapping again.</p><p>I <em>am</em> willing to tag 1.0 without this use case solved, and there is no current
plan to take on this alternate compiler implementation project within the scope
of the <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">Zig Software Foundation</a>. Of course, things may change, but this
is the plan as it stands.</p><p>Furthermore, this change represents the removal of the <code>-fstage1</code> flag, which allowed
users of Zig to opt out of the new compiler and use the old one. This was the only way to
take advantage of async functions, an experimental language feature that is
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not yet implemented in the new
compiler</a>.</p><p>I recommend users of <code>-fstage1</code> to stick with 0.10.0, and then upgrade to
0.10.1 when it is released, and then finally upgrade to 0.11.0, which will
have async function support. Note that Zig follows <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semantic
Versioning</a> and so everything described in this blog post
will <em>not</em> be included in the 0.10.1 release, which will <strong>only contain bug
fixes</strong> cherry-picked from master branch.</p><h4 id="language-mobility">Language Mobility</h4><p>On a more positive note, this change means swift progress on all those planned
language changes that we have been sitting on. Without the legacy compiler
codebase to hold us back, you can expect major progress towards completing the
Zig language during the Zig 0.11.0 release cycle.</p><p>This allows us to dogfood language changes immediately by using them in the
compiler as well as the standard library. And before I am accused of designing
the language to be overfit to writing compilers, I am happy to report that I
have started taking Fridays to work <em>with</em> Zig instead of <em>on</em> Zig. That is,
Fridays for me are for side projects where I act as a regular user of the
language rather than as a compiler developer.</p><p>When this change landed in master branch, there were 650 <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astage1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open issues with the
“stage1”
label</a>,
indicating a problem with a now deleted codebase! So in theory, we could
instantly close all of these issues, which would be ever so satisfying.
However, I have instituted a policy that to close one of these issues, one must
either add test coverage for it, or identify test coverage that already covers
it. Perhaps this is more effort than it is worth, but for now this is what we
are doing.</p><p>Finally, I want to leave you with my <a href="https://twitter.com/leonard_ritter/status/879737741986103298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-time favorite
