The song has the scratchy, low quality vibe of a bootlegged demo; and the vocals are sometimes slurred and glitchy - likely to be artefacts of the AI process.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Neither artist has responded to the song yet, but Drake recently expressed displeasure at his voice being cloned.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This is the final straw AI,&#34; he posted on Instagram, after stumbling across a fan-made video in which he appeared to be rapping the Ice Spice track Munch (Feeling U).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Drake&#39;s complaint came after Universal Music Group wrote to streaming services including Spotify and Apple Music, asking them to prevent artificial intelligence companies from accessing their libraries. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is thought companies have been using the music to &#34;train&#34; their software.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;We will not hesitate to take steps to protect our rights and those of our artists,&#34; UMG warned in the email, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aec1679b-5a34-4dad-9fc9-f4d8cdd124b9">first obtained by the Financial Times</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Several websites already offer fans the ability to create new songs using soundalike voices of pop&#39;s biggest stars. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>French DJ David Guetta recently used a site called uberduck.ai to mimic the voice of Eminem and add it to one of his instrumentals.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;I&#39;m sure the future of music is in AI,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64624525">he told the BBC</a>. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he said the technology could only be useful &#34;as a tool&#34; - like the drum machine and the sampler before it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Nothing is going to replace taste,&#34; he said. &#34;What defines an artist is, you have a certain taste, you have a certain type of emotion you want to express, and you&#39;re going to use all the modern instruments to do that.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Guetta was named producer of the year at the Brits 2023</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Other faked tracks that have gone viral recently include a &#34;deepfake&#34; of <a href="https://twitter.com/Nevernyny/status/1646571616267059200">Rihanna singing Beyoncé&#39;s Cuff It;</a> and a cloned <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroraPeakYT/status/1644526570952962054">Kanye West singing</a> the acoustic ballad Hey There, Delilah.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The rapid rise of the technology has rattled the music industry. Heart On My Sleeve, for example, does not infringe copyright, as it appears to be an entirely original composition. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The author has also made it explicit that Drake and The Weeknd were not involved in the making of the song, which should (in theory) protect them from a &#34;passing off&#34; claim, where they profit from misleading the audience into believing it is genuine.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In response, a broad coalition of musicians and artists have launched a &#34;Human Artistry Campaign&#34;, whose aim is to ensure artificial intelligence will not &#34;erode&#34; human creativity.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Backed by the Recording Industry Association of America, the Association for Independent Music and the BPI - which organises the Brits - the group has outlined seven principles advocating AI best practices, and stressed that copyright protection should only be afforded to music created by humans.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There is so much potential with AI but it also presents risks to our creative community,&#34; said Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr, launching the initiative. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s crucial that we get this right early on so we don&#39;t risk losing the artistic magic that only humans can create.&#34;</p></div></article></main></div></div>
