I don’t know enough Rust to hint any kind of analogy between Ruby Ractor’s <code>move:true</code> with Rust’s ownership concept. Just want to share some interesting thoughts while reading about Ruby’s <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/ractor_md.html#label-Send+a+message+by+moving">Ractor</a>.</p>

<p>
The name “Ractor” already gives away, it’s Ruby’s “experimental” implementation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrIjfIjssLE">Erlang-style Actor model</a>. Think of an Actor as individuals each with their own mailbox, they talk to each other by putting messages into each other’s mailboxes, no one waits for anyone for response, it’s all <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/202">202</a>, actors just leaving messages and then move on to do what’s in their own mailboxes.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/">Erlang Beam</a> has the magical capability to spin up thousands of actors each running their own isolated super lightweight processes, and talk to each other via message passing. Ruby’s Ractor does similar but with real system processes (Ruby version 3.4.1 as time of writing), although <strong>I am not sure the performance impact when running too many Ractors as it spins up real system processes</strong>. This makes Ractor very useful for running parallel CPU intense things and Ractor also provides a <a href="https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-4.9.1/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html">Erlang-style-supervision-tree</a> way to manage the processes, if a process node finishes/terminates, all of its child node processes will be terminated.</p>
<p>
Also note that inside each Ractor processes, we can run multiple threads.</p>
<p>
Ruby being Ruby, Ractors not only offers the usual push-style send-receive paradigm for actors, there’s also <a href="https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-4.9.1/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html">pull style</a> communication. To provide more flexible topology for Rubyists I assume.</p>
<p>
We create Ractors and pass messages between them like so,</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>  sender <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>new <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>5</span><span>.</span>times <span>do</span> <span>|</span>i<span>|</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>p</span> <span>&#34;sender: sending message </span><span>#{</span>i<span>}</span><span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>yield<span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>yield<span>(</span><span>:alrighty</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span># pass sender into reader&#39;s process to receive message from it</span>
</span></span><span><span>  reader <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>new sender <span>do</span> <span>|</span>sender<span>|</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>      message <span>=</span> sender<span>.</span>take
</span></span><span><span>      <span>break</span> <span>if</span> message <span>==</span> <span>:alrighty</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>p</span> <span>&#34;reader: received message </span><span>#{</span>message<span>}</span><span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>p</span> <span>&#34;reader: done&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  reader<span>.</span>take
</span></span><span><span>  <span>p</span> <span>&#34;main: all done&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>

Messages passed between Ractors are just normal Ruby objects, same as passing object into functions, there’s a difference between passing things by reference v.s. passing by copy. It’s usually the things that’s passed by reference, like passing an array of integers, that’s causing race-condition-like concurrency problems, and <strong>move:true</strong> is Ractor’s way to help.</p>
<p>
When passing messages that’s passed-by-reference objects, setting <strong>move:true</strong> while passing the message ensures that the passed message transfers its ownership to the receiving Ractor. If the sending Ractor wants to touch the passed message again, an <code>Ractor::MovedError</code> would be raised. And as message passing between Ractors is always one-to-one, only one Ractor will have ownership.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><span><span>  alist <span>=</span> <span>[[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]]</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  receiver <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>new <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>    res <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>      msg <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>receive
</span></span><span><span>      res <span>+=</span> msg<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span>yield res
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  alist<span>.</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span>li<span>|</span>
</span></span><span><span>    receiver<span>.</span>send li<span>,</span> <span>move</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>p</span> receiver<span>.</span>take
</span></span><span><span>    li <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>123</span> <span># This would cause MoveError to be raised</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>

Ractor’s <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/ractor_md.html#label-Send+a+message+by+moving">documentation</a> provides a perfect example. Once things are moved, it’s no longer there. Cool~ :)</p>
