    <h1>Evolving the Infinite Canvas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <div><div><p>In the digital world, especially on the web, we’re used to things being stacked
					vertically. Scrolling, scrolling, through boxes of content,</p>  <p>Things are always arranged linearly — top-to-bottom. Or, if we’re feeling spicy,
					left-to-right.</p> <p>This is all great for neat, orderly content. But what about when thoughts are complex,
					unsorted, exploratory? Enter: <a href="https://infinitecanvas.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infinite canvas</a>.</p></div> </div>  <p>The ability to position content anywhere leverages our spatial skills. In the physical world,
			we’re constantly relying on spatial skills:</p> <ul><li><strong>For organizing relationally</strong>: We know the cups are next to the plates.</li> <li><strong>For organizing in groups</strong>: We group together similar condiments in the
				fridge.</li> <li><strong>For remembering</strong>: We remember where we left our keys.</li></ul> <p>But moving things physically is hard! We don’t have inifite space to <em>move things left</em>
			to make space for something new or <em>duplicate</em> something to make a copy or
			<em>zoom out</em> to see the big picture. Infinite canvases marry the easy manipulation of the
			digital world with the spatial strengths of the physical world.</p> <p>Given these strengths, it’s no surprise that we often use infinite canvases for complex,
			unsorted, or exploratory tasks. But the concept has been fairly static for a while now. How
			can we push it even further?</p></div> <div><div> <div><p>As we manipulate content on an infinite canvas, we’re constantly organizing it in common
						ways. What if we could hardcode these behaviors into the canvas itself?</p></div></div>  <div><div><div><svg style="width: 10.1092%;" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><path d="M 0 0 L 0 1.06 L 1 1"></path></svg> <h3>Preventing overlap</h3> <div><div slot="description"><p>We spend a lot of time making sure our items aren’t overlapping. What if this behavior was
				built in?
				</p></div></div></div></div>  </div>   <div><div><div><svg style="width: 14.479%;" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><path d="M 0 0 L 0 1.06 L 1 1"></path></svg> <h3>Grouping</h3> <div><div slot="description"><p>What if our items group themselves automatically? Like magnets, pull fast enough and they
				detach.
				</p></div></div></div></div>  </div>  <div> <div><p>Once the content is organized, we view the canvas as a reference point. If we want to
						use the information elsewhere, we have to manually extract it. But there are simple,
						Gestalt-like rules that we use to organize content. What if we could hardcode these
						rules into the exported data?</p></div></div>  <div><div><div><svg style="width: 3.83998%;" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><path d="M 0 0 L 0 1.06 L 1 1"></path></svg> <h3>Similarity</h3> <div><p>We’re hard-wired to notice similarities between items and mentally organize them into
				groups. What if we could hardcode this in exported data?</p></div></div></div>  </div>   <div><div><div><svg style="width: 9.9917%;" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><path d="M 0 0 L 0 1.06 L 1 1"></path></svg> <h3>Linear order (horizontal and/or vertical)</h3> <div><p>We tend to &#34;read&#34; from left to right and top to bottom. What if we could hardcode this in
				exported data?</p></div></div></div>  </div>   <div><div><div><svg style="width: 5.86032%;" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><path d="M 0 0 L 0 1.06 L 1 1"></path></svg> <h3>Grouping (proximity)</h3> <div><p>We tend to group items that are close together. What if we could hardcode this in exported
				data?</p></div></div></div>  </div>  <div> <div><div><p>Most apps choose an interface and run with it! Are we going to give users a text
						document, a spreadsheet, a timeline, or a canvas? But what if we didn’t have to choose?</p> <p>Each interface has its own strengths, weaknesses, and stored information. Here’s a
						simple illustration of how the same data might be represented in different interfaces.
						Try grouping dogs on the canvas or changing their height in the grid, then see how the
						other interfaces update.</p></div></div></div>  <p>While none of this is revolutionary, I would love to see more experiments evolving infinite
				canvases! Especially further exploring strengths from both the physical world (adding
				physical forces) and the digital world (malleable contents). If you have any fun ideas or
				examples, I&#39;d love to hear at <a href="https://twitter.com/wattenberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@wattenberger</a>.</p> </div></div></div>
