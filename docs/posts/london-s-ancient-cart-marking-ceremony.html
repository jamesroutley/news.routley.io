<p>Date for your diary, as over 40 historic and interesting road vehicles will roll into Guildhall Yard next month to take part in an ancient ceremony.</p>
<p>They will be there to take part in <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/cart-marking-287/">Cart Marking</a>, a 500+ year old tradition where the Sheriffs and ritually robed Carmen brand each ‘cart’ with a red-hot iron – the origin of vehicle licensing.</p>

<p>In past times, each year the carts licensed to use the road in the City of London would have an annual mark branded into them to show they are roadworthy and have paid their fees. The need to brand a hot iron into a vehicle has long since ceased to be a legal requirement, much to the relief of motorists, but each year, a selection of vehicles still perform the ancient ceremony.</p>

<p>The main difference today is that plank of wood is attached to the vehicle, and it’s that which gets the hot iron. They also pay the same 25p (five shillings) license fee as was set in 1838, which is when licensing passed from the Worshipful Company of Carmen to The Keeper of Guildhall.</p>
<p>The ceremony is free for anyone to watch and is one of the highlights of the City’s annual ceremonial calendar. Normally, it’s held during the week, but they’ve recently switched to hosting on a Saturday, which means more people are able to turn up and watch.</p>

<p>The range of vehicles can be anything from a Smithfield meat cart to old wagons, steam engines, and buses to the very latest in electric cars and lorries. It’s a very eclectic mix.</p>
<p>Carried out by the <a href="https://www.thecarmen.co.uk/">Worshipful Company of Carmen</a>, the cart marking takes place on <strong>Saturday 22nd July 2022</strong> from 10am and lasts around 2.5 hours — there’s usually seating in the Guildhall Yard so get there early if you want to grab a chair. A catalogue is usually produced so bring some cash, and commentators on the day will bring to life the history of this ancient ceremony and its relevance to London. You don’t need to book in advance.</p>

<p>SUPPORT THIS WEBSITE</p>

<div>

<p>This website has been running now for over a decade, and while advertising revenue contributes to funding the website, it doesn&#39;t cover the costs. That is why I have set up a facility with <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide">DonorBox</a> where you can contribute to the costs of the website and time invested in writing and research for the news articles.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very similar to the way The Guardian and many smaller websites are now seeking to generate an income in the face of rising costs and declining advertising.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s a one-off donation or a regular giver, every additional support goes a long way to covering the running costs of this website, and keeping you regularly topped up doses of Londony news and facts.</p>

<p>If you like what you read on here, then please support the website <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
