    <h1>Electric fan car shatters the Goodwood hill climb record</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A McMurtry Speirling piloted by former F1 and IndyCar racing driver Max Chilton broke the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/paraplegic-motogp-champion-rides-at-goodwood-on-modified-yamaha-superbike">Goodwood</a> hill record Sunday, crushing the previous record set by the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/32333/this-is-how-much-quicker-the-electric-vw-i-d-r-is-than-a-mclaren-720s">VW ID.R</a> by nearly a full second. The electric fan car rocketed—<em>almost literally</em>—up the hill in a staggering 39.08 seconds, compared to the <a href="https://www.goodwood.com/grr/event-coverage/goodwood-speedweek/2020/9/volkswagen-id.r-gunning-for-circuit-lap-record-at-speedweek/#:~:text=R%20clocked%20a%20time%20of,the%20line%20in%2041.18%20seconds." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electric prototype&#39;s 39.90</a>.</p><p>The Speirling is the creation of a British-Irish startup that set out to build a ridiculously powerful and lightweight car that could be driven on the track and on the streets (a road-legal version of the Goodwood fan car is <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mcmurtry-launch-road-legal-version-speirling-fan-car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works</a>). The batmobile-looking machine reportedly weighs less than 1,000 kilograms (less than 2,200 pounds), yet boasts over 1,000 horsepower courtesy of its dual electric motors.</p><div><p itemprop="associatedMedia"><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JYp9eGC3Cc?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>While boasting a power-to-weight ratio of 1,000 bhp per ton surely played a role at the Goodwood Festival of Speed over the weekend, it&#39;s the car&#39;s twin fans hidden within the bespoke chassis that really helped it achieve that record-setting time. Much like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38534/the-t-50-supercars-rear-fan-explained-in-detail-by-gordon-murray-himself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gordon Murray&#39;s T.50 supercar</a>, the Speirling&#39;s fans essentially suck the car to the ground and provide it with other-worldly downforce. Factor in the massive rear wing and other external bodywork, and the EV is essentially glued to the road while cornering at high speed.</p><p>The video above shows the stubby race car powering through Lord March&#39;s estate in violent fashion. In fact, it&#39;s so quick that it almost looks like the video is set on fast-forward. The in-cabin footage shows a wide-eyed Chilton, who appears to not even have time to blink, wrestling the nimble supercar up the hill.</p><p>Impressive stuff.</p><p><em>Got a tip?
