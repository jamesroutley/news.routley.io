You would have thought that with time, fresher and newer Metal acts would take over and become more popular, but despite Sabbath’s retirement, the band remains as one of the most popular Metal bands to this day.&#34;</p><p>He said their influence, stemming mostly from their first five albums, has &#34;stood the test of time&#34;. </p><p>&#34;Ozzy Osbourne’s vocal style and skill was an integral part to what made Black Sabbath so successful,&#34; he added.  </p>
