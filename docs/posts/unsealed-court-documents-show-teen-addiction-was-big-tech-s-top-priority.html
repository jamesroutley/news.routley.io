                <p><i>New documents show the tactics Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok execs used to disrupt learning, prey on minors, and co-opt the PTA to control the narrative with parents</i></p>
<p><b>WASHINGTON, DC –</b> Today, The Tech Oversight Project published a new report spotlighting newly unsealed documents in the 2026 social media addiction trials. The documents provide smoking-gun evidence that Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok all purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens with no regard for known harms to their wellbeing, and how that mass youth addiction was core to the companies’ business models. The documents contain internal discussions among company employees, presentations from internal meetings, expert testimony, and evidence of Big Tech coordination with tech-funded groups, including the National Parent Teachers Association (PTA) and Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), in attempts to control the narrative in response to concerned parents.</p>
<p>“These unsealed documents prove Big Tech has been gaslighting and lying to the public for years, and it’s high time parents and young people get their day in court,” <b>said Sacha Haworth, Executive Director of The Tech Oversight Project.</b> “Disrupted learning and social media addiction are core to Big Tech’s business model, and while the JCCP and MDL cases have the potential to chip away at their wrongdoing, Congress needs to make good on their years-long promise to pass the Senate’s version of the <em>Kids Online Safety Act</em>.”</p>
