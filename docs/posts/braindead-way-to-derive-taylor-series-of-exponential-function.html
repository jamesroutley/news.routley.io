    <h1>Braindead Way to Derive Taylor Series of Exponential Function</h1>

  <p>\(e^x\) was first defined by a formula for continuous compound interest:</p>

\[e^x := \lim_{N \to \infty} (1+ \frac{x}{N})^N\]

<p>Let’s use this to get that \(e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{N}{\frac{x^n}{n!}}\)</p>

<p>First, remove the limit and replace it with an unlimited<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> integer \(N\).</p>

<p>That gives us the expression \((1+ \frac{x}{N})^N\). Which is just a polynomial with an unlimited number of terms. We can expand it by the binomial theorem.</p>

\[(1+ \frac{x}{N})^N = \sum_{n=0}^{N}{\binom{N}{n} (\frac{x}{N})^n \cdot 1^{N-n}}\]

<p>\(1^{N-n}\) is just 1, so we can drop it because it’s the identity for multiplication. Which gives us</p>

\[\sum_{n=0}^{N}{\binom{N}{n}  (\frac{x}{N})^n }\]

<p>We can expand \(\binom{N}{n}\) by using its definition and move the \(n\) exponent into each term.</p>

\[\sum_{n=0}^{N}{\frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!}  \frac{x^n}{N^n} }\]

<p>Cancel \((N-n)!\) from \(N!\) to get</p>

\[\sum_{n=0}^{N}{\frac{N\cdot N-1 \cdot \dots N-n+1}{n!}  \frac{x^n}{N^n} }\]

<p>Now for the only real bit of cleverness. N is unlimited, so \(\frac{N - k}{N}\) where k is limited is infinitely close to 1. Infinite closeness is an equivalence relation, which is almost as good as true equality. In this case, we use it to cancel out \(\frac{N}{N}, \frac{N-1}{N} \dots \frac{N-n+1}{N}\). This leaves behind</p>

\[\sum_{n=0}^{N}{\frac{x^n}{n!}} \blacksquare\]

<p>I read Euler recently and it turns out this is how he found the Taylor Series in the first place<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
