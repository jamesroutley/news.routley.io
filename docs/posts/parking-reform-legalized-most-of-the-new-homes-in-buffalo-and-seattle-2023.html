			<p><span data-contrast="auto">What comes after repealing parking mandates? Lots of newly legal homes. Studies from two cities observed that in the years following reform, </span><span data-contrast="auto">60 to 70 percent of new homes would previously have been illegal to build.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The new data add to the heap of evidence that parking mandates—local rules that ban new homes and businesses unless they have a pre-determined number of off-street parking spaces—are a binding constraint on housing construction. While only a few buildings opted out of providing parking entirely, most new homes in the studies ultimately benefited from the increased flexibility. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It isn’t surprising,” said researcher C. J. Gabbe, who authored one of the studies. According to Gabbe, homebuilders have been saying for a long time that demand for off-street parking was lower than what zoning rules required. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both of these cities’ policy changes provided a natural experiment for measuring the effects of parking policy.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s impossible, really, to tie a specific code change to changes in the market,” explained Brennan Staley, a strategic advisor for Seattle’s Office of Planning and Community Development. Other local regulations, housing prices, and international finance markets all play a part in the real estate market. Michael Hubner, who works on long range planning in Seattle, agreed: “It’s very difficult to point to a causal relationship.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What is clear to Hubner is that the market chose to use the flexibility the city began offering. Not just on the margins, but by a lot. During the first five years after Seattle’s reform, a total of 35,388 new homes in Seattle ended up benefiting from the freedom to not build excess parking. Today, those homes account for 9.4 percent of the city’s entire housing stock. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Staley pointed out other benefits of the flexible code. “It’s not just the supply of those units that may be increased, but also that there are cheaper units because they didn’t have parking,” he said. One parking space can add </span><a href="https://www.reinventingparking.org/2015/06/how-much-does-one-parking-spot-add-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">over $200</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to monthly rents.

In the six-month period before the zoning reform, one in three new homes in Buffalo were permitted through that variance process. Once allowed by right, that ratio flipped, with two in every three homes opting to use the new code’s flexibility.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Seattle, whose reforms were concentrated in the most urban parts of the city, new buildings provided 40 percent less parking than would have been required before the reform. While that sounds like a dramatic drop, the change merely right-sized parking to match existing demand. In fact, it was exactly in line with a separate 2012 study that had observed 40 percent of the parking spaces in King County, where Seattle is located, </span><a href="https://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/right-size-parking/pdf/rsp-final-report-8-2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">never get used</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:1,&#34;335551620&#34;:1,&#34;335559685&#34;:0,&#34;335559737&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The 2020 study of Seattle also found reason to believe that parking flexibility would be useful in other parts of town, too. Forty-three percent of buildings in Seattle still subject to parking mandates built the minimum number of spaces required, suggesting that these projects might have opted to build more homes per parking space if allowed. That also suggests that an unknown number of homes would exist today if not for the parking mandates still in place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Lessons for other cities</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For most cities, the chilling effects of parking mandates remain largely invisible. Few builders end up taking on the risk and expense of requesting a variance from zoning codes. But thanks to these vanguard cities, the significance of parking reform is finally coming to light. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Far from affecting just a handful of buildings, these studies suggest that a wide array of housing projects would use flexibility around parking minimums if given the opportunity. For cities and states searching for solutions to their own housing shortages, eliminating parking mandates is a simple action that seems likely to help create a lot of new homes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
