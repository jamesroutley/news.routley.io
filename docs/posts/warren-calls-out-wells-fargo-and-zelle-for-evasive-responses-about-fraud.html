of Letter to EWS/Zelle (PDF)</a></p><p><strong>Washington, D.C. </strong>– U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),
a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (BHUA) Committee,
today sent a letter to Wells Fargo and a letter to Early Warning Services
(EWS), the parent company of bank-owned peer-to-peer payment platform Zelle,
about rampant fraud and scams on Zelle. Senator Warren’s recent investigation,
based on data provided by the banks that own Zelle, found alarming rates of
fraud and scams on the platform and <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-wells-fargos-fraud-and-scams-on-zelle-are-higher-than-other-banks-and-increasing-rapidly-renews-call-for-missing-data">that
fraud for Wells Fargo customers is higher than that of other banks and is
increasing rapidly</a>. Senator Warren criticized both companies’ responses to
her report as misleading and false, and called on them to release all data on
fraud and scams on Zelle to back up their rhetoric disputing her
findings. </p><p>“If Wells Fargo and EWS really want to set the record straight about fraud
and scams on Zelle, then they should change course and provide the American
people with complete data,” <strong>said Senator Warren. </strong>“Customers
who were defrauded and scammed on Zelle deserve full transparency.”</p><p>Senator Warren wrote to Wells Fargo in October after her analysis of the
limited data Wells Fargo provided revealed that the frequency of Zelle fraud
and scams reported by Wells Fargo customers was more than twice as high as it
was for comparable banks and that the frequency of fraud and scams reported by
Wells Fargo customers was more than 2.5 times higher this year than it was in
2019. Wells Fargo responded to Senator Warren on October 20.</p><p>“I asked you a series of questions about these issues, and your response was
wholly inadequate given the scope of the problems. And Wells Fargo still –
despite numerous requests – has failed to provide data on how frequently it
reimburses its customers when they are defrauded or scammed on Zelle. Overall,
your response reveals that Wells Fargo appears to be unable to protect its
customers from fraud and scams, unwilling to come clean about the scope of its
problems, and incapable of providing a satisfactory explanation for these
failures,” <strong>wrote Senator Warren in her letter to Wells Fargo. </strong></p><p>In her letter to EWS, Senator Warren noted that the company’s statements
about her findings on fraud and scams for Wells Fargo customers were inaccurate
and inconsistent with the data provided by Wells Fargo and other banks that are
a part of the Zelle network. <strong>Senator Warren continued, </strong>“I was
pleased to see that EWS is now prepared to engage in a public manner regarding
concerns about rampant fraud on the Zelle network. When I previously wrote to
you, you refused to provide me with information on the extent to which Zelle is
used to defraud and scam users, and the degree to which Zelle was providing
reimbursements to affected customers.”</p><p>To set the record straight about fraud and scams on Zelle and to inform
Congress, the public, and federal regulators about the scope of the problem,
Senator Warren is asking Wells Fargo to provide full data about the volume of
Zelle fraud and scams reported by customers since 2017 and the refunds it has
provided to its customers, and for EWS to provide full data about fraud and scams
on the entire platform since 2017, by November 21, 2022. </p><p>Senator Warren has led congressional oversight of Zelle and the banks that
own it to protect consumers who were victims of frauds and scams: </p><ul>
 <li>In October 2022, Senator Warren <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-alerts-cfpb-to-extensive-fraudulent-activity-on-zelle-ramps-up-call-for-stronger-rules-to-prevent-banks-from-mistreating-customers">sent
     a letter</a> to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, summarizing the
     findings of her investigation revealing high rates of fraud and scams on
     Zelle and that the banks are not refunding the vast majority of defrauded
     consumers, breaking their promises to their customers and potentially
     violating federal law. </li>
 <li> In July 2022, Senators Warren, Bob Menendez
     (D-N.J.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-menendez-reed-colleagues-demand-answers-from-big-banks-on-widespread-fraud-on-zelle-instant-payment-application">sent
     letters</a> to each of the banks that own EWS, requesting information
     about the Zelle scams and frauds its customers have reported to them. With
     the exception of Truist, the relevant banks testifying provided little to
     none of the information the lawmakers requested, until Senators Warren and
     Menendez again pressed bank CEOs for this information at the September
     BHUA Committee <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/after-todays-hearing-warren-and-menendez-call-out-big-bank-ceos-for-failure-to-provide-promised-data-on-consumers-defrauded-by-zelle">hearing</a>. </li>
 <li> In April, Senators Warren, Menendez, and Reed <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senators-warren-menendez-reed-blast-zelle-parent-company-on-failure-to-address-consumer-fraud-and-scams">sent
     a letter </a>to EWS, asking the company to disclose how many reports of
     fraud it had received from users since the beginning of 2018. Early Warning
     Services provided little data on the volume of fraudulent transactions
     occurring on Zelle.</li>
