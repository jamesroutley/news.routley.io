              <p>Hi, the reviewer is saying &#34;Policy	Paid apps must not have unreasonably high prices. (The price $10 is too high.)</p>
<p>[Defect]</p>
<p>[Procedure]</p>
<p>[Expected Result]</p>
<p>[Defect]</p>
<p>[Procedure]</p>
<p>[Expected Result]</p>
<p>This is a niche, unique and professionally made app which is a one time purchase - I believe the reviewer hasn’t even read the documentation.</p>
<p>In light of this I searched for similar things and the store brings up apps with descriptions like “I made this for my son, do not take it seriously ($4.07 AUD)” and others that look like they’ve been thrown together as a school project or something.</p>
<p>I also note this exact same app is already available on the Apple App Store for the same price.</p>
<p>Do I need to have a back and forth with the reviewer, or perhaps Ron can look into this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Crazy, you should be able to price at the strategy you want,  the market will decide if it’s too high.</p>
<p>Can you price it low  then once it’s approved  make a price change.  I know for themes and watch faces on the store, pricing can be changed without Samsung reviewing.</p>

            <p>Exactly, I’ve tried to resubmit with a lowered price and get “The binary in ‘Certification Failed’ cannot be registered. Please modify or delete the binary.”, so presumably would need to bump the version number and wait another 5 days or so just to get it through which makes no sense.  I’ve opened a support ticket with all the information they need including a link to the App Store where it’s live and listed for the exact same price, let’s see what happens.  What a headache.</p>

<p>It can be a bad user experience. I think that mobile users are used to getting cheap or free apps and download without considering the price then ask for a refund when they get the credit card bill.</p>

              <p>Lowered the price by $5, politely explained the uniqueness of the app and invited them to read and understand the docs, which they didn’t do and rejected again for the exact same reason.</p>
<p>To be clear we’re talking about a &lt; $20 app that is properly made and engineered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile browse for firefox on the store, see the attached for what comes up:<br/>

<p>That’s right $300+ for a thing that just displays a pdf, from a seller in Nigeria using a US company somehow.  Yet I’m being jerked around.  <strong>What a total joke this is!</strong></p>
<p>edit: that $300 pdf app’s required permissions look pretty legit too:</p>

              <p>Lowered the price again, which actually goes against my business model - but now it seems like they’re taking their sweet time doing the device test.  Each other time was about a day and no issues found except they took exception with the price, now the device test is taking a lot longer.  Let’s see what excuse I get this time!</p>

            <p>update: rejected again when trying to add more countries - they seem really stuck on the $10 or less price point.  The only way the previous one was approved is if I set the price to $9.99.  The tor scam app is still up for around $300, even though Ron reported it over 5 days ago.  See plenty of other paid apps on there for $20+ (amongst all the microtransaction games, adware and scams)  Ridiculous!</p>
