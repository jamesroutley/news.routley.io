<p>The M3 Max in the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is around 45% faster than the M2 Max chip in the previous-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro, according to the Geekbench website. This is within the ballpark of Apple&#39;s claim that the M3 Max is up to 50% faster than the M2 Max, especially given variance in early Geekbench results.</p>
<p>Geekbench 6 multi-core scores for CPU performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>M2 Ultra: 21,182 (Mac Pro, averaged)</li>
<li><strong>M3 Max: 21,084 (16-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</strong></li>
<li>M2 Max: 14,495 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li>
<li>M1 Max: 12,185 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li>
<li>M3: 11,836 (14-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufactured with TSMC&#39;s 3nm process, the M3 Max has up to a 16-core CPU with 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It also has up to a 40-core GPU and can be configured with up to 128GB of unified memory.</p>

<p>The first Geekbench 6 results for the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">surfaced earlier today</a>, revealing that it is up to 20% faster than the standard M2 chip. Benchmarks provide a useful reference point, but real-world performance can vary.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro models are now available to order, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will be available later in November.</p>
