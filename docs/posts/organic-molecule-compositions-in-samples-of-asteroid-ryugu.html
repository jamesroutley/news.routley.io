    <h3>The Initial analysis of the asteroid Ryugu samples </h3>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
     The sample from asteroid Ryugu returned to Earth by the asteroid explorer, Hayabusa2, on December 6, 2020, initially underwent a cataloguing description (Phase-1 curation) at the facility established at JAXA’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. Part of the returned sample was distributed to the Hayabusa2 Initial Analysis Team, consisting of six sub-teams, and two Phase-2 curation institutes at Okayama University and JAMSTEC Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research. The initial analysis is designed to reveal the multifaceted features of the sample through a plan of high-precision analysis, with specialized sub-teams assigned to tackle the science objectives of the Hayabusa2 mission. Meanwhile, the Phase-2 curation institutes have specific specialties that are utilized to catalogue the sample based on a comprehensive analysis flow, and clarify the potential impact of the sample through measurement and analysis appropriate to the characteristics of the returned particles.

     Soluble organic molecules in the sample of asteroid Ryugu brought back by Hayabusa2 were analyzed mainly by sequential extraction using hydrophobic to hydrophilic solvents. Ryugu is a dark primitive asteroid classified into the C-type asteroid, which is the most common in the asteroid belt, and is rich in hydrous minerals such as carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Primitive carbonaceous chondrites are known to contain a variety of soluble organic molecules, including amino acids, and might have supplied prebiotic organic molecules to the primitive Earth and other celestial bodies. In this study, organic molecules in Ryugu surface samples obtained from the first touchdown sampling site were analyzed by the international research team from Japan, the U.S., and Europe. Wide variety of organic molecules such as amino acids, amines, carboxylic acids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds were detected (<a href="#pic01">Figure 1</a>). These organic molecules may be released from Ryugu&#39;s surface and transported to other celestial bodies in the Solar system.

<div>
  <p>
     The main analyses and results performed by the Soluble Organic Matter (SOM) Team of the Hayabusa2 Sample Initial Analysis Team are as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
     First, elemental analyses and isotopic ratio measurements were performed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), sulfur (S) and pyrolytic oxygen (O) to evaluate the average of Ryugu regolith composition. The Ryugu aggregate sample (A0106) contained about 3.8% C, 1.1% H, 0.16% N, 3.3% S, and 12.9% pyrolytic O. The total of these volatile light elements CHNOS was about 21.3%. These elements constitute inorganic minerals such as hydrous silicates, carbonates, and sulfides, as well as soluble and insoluble organic matter. To date, these elemental abundances are the highest profiles among the previous descriptions of carbonaceous meteorites, indicating that Ryugu is rich in volatile elements (<a href="#pic02">Figure 2</a>). The stable isotopic composition (<a href="#note01">Note 1</a>) of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C)δ13C is about -0.6 permil, nitrogen (<sup>15</sup> N/<sup>14</sup>N), δ15N is about +43 permil, hydrogen (D/H), δD is about +250 permil, sulfur (<sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S)δ<sup>34</sup>S is about -3 permil, and the closest comparison to the meteorite is the CI (Ivuna type) carbonaceous chondrite meteorite.

<p>
     The methanol extract of the Ryugu sample was analyzed using electrospray ionization (ESI) (<a href="#none02">Note 2</a>) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) (<a href="#note03">Note 3</a>) coupled with a Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR/MS) (<a href="#note04">Note 4</a>), which revealed about 20,000 organic molecular ions up to about 700 Da consisting of CH, CHO, CHN, CHS, CHNO, CHOS, CH, CHO, CHN, CHS, CHNO, CHOS, and CHNOS (<a href="#pic03">Figure 3</a>). Many of these constitute a series of homologous compounds, indicating a series of chemical reactions of organic molecules, such as methylation and hydroxylation. The diversity of these organic molecules is greater than that of carbonaceous meteorites, suggesting that they formed in a relatively low-temperature environment.

<p>
     Hot water extracted and acid-hydrolyzed fractions from the Ryugu sample were subjected to amino acid analysis by two independent analytical methods. Firstly, liquid chromatography fluorescence detection/high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-FD/HRMS) was used for total D,L-amino acid analysis. Secondly, 3D-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (3D-HPLC/FD) was used for sensitive analysis specialized for separation of optical isomers of D,L-amino acids. As a result, 15 types of amino acids were detected, including proteinogenic amino acids such as α-alanine, glycine, and valine, which are common molecules in terrestrial life, and non-proteinogenic amino acids such as β-alanine, aminobutyric acid, and isovaline. The detected optical isomers (<a href="#note05">Note 5</a>) were racemic, existing almost 1:1 ratios (<a href="#pic04">Figure 4</a>). Non-proteinogenic amino acids and their presence in racemic form indicates that they were synthesized in the prebiotic molecular evolution on Ryugu. The amino acid concentrations were typically less than 1 nanomole/g and as low as a few ppb and ultra-trace amounts. Much less than the Murchison meteorite, where a comparative wide variety of amino acids were detected, and less than the CI chondrite meteorite (Orgueil meteorite).

  <p>Figure 4. Enantiomeric amino acids detected in hot water extracted and hydrolyzed fraction of the Ryugu sample.</p>
</div>

<p>
     In addition to amino acids, low molecular weight amines such as methylamine and carboxylic acids such as acetic acid were present in the hot water extract. For example, the boiling point of the free form of methylamine is -6.3℃ at 1 atm (1013 hPa), which is very volatile. On the Ryugu surface, it is shown to exist as a salt (e.g., the boiling point of methylamine hydrochloride is about 230℃ at 20 hPa). In addition to methylamine, ethylamine and propylamine were also present, but isopropylamine (branched) was more abundant than straight-chain propylamine. This indicates that they were either formed by radical reactions or were present after thermal decomposition. Butylamine, which is present in the Orgueil meteorite, was not detected. These amine salts may be related to the absorption band ~3.1µm (NH bonding) observed on the Ryugu surface. Acetic acid and formic acid were also present as carboxylic acids, but the higher carboxylic acids were not detected. The finding of only smaller carboxylic acids is consistent with the characteristics found in carbonaceous meteorites that have undergone hydrothermal alteration.
  </p>

<p>
     Aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the fractions extracted with organic solvents. Alkylbenzenes and other alkyl chains to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ranging from 2-ring naphthalene to 4-ring pyrene and fluoranthene, and their alkylated forms were detected. PAHs are thought to be ubiquitous in interstellar space, and are also abundant in carbonaceous meteorites.　In particular, pyrene and fluoranthene are structural isomers with the same chemical formula (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) and are present at nearly 1:1 in many carbonaceous meteorites such as Murchison. However, pyrene was more abundant than fluoranthene in the Ryugu sample. This peculiar PAH distribution was also found in CI-type Ivuna carbonaceous meteorites, and it is possible that the PAHs were separated during water-rock mineral interaction (i.e., asteroidal chromatography) due to differences in solubility within the Ryugu parent body. The presence of alkylbenzenes and an excess of pyrene relative to fluoranthene have also been found in hydrothermal crude oils on Earth. Hence, indigenous hydrothermal crude oil-like organic matter may exist on Ryugu.
  </p>

<p>
     Nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds were present as a series of extensively alkylated (-CH<sub>2</sub> -) homologues, which may have been synthesized on the parent body from formaldehyde and ammonia. Nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds are commonly detected in carbonaceous meteorites, but the carbon number distribution of the alkylpyridine homologues (C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub><sub>-4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>) found in Ryugu differs from that of the well-studied Murchison meteorite. While the Murchison meteorite had an abundance distribution of C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub> with a maximum of C<sub>11</sub>, the Ryugu meteorite had a distribution of C<sub>11</sub> to C<sub>22</sub> carbons with a maximum of C<sub>17</sub>. This indicates that the synthesis of organic molecules (elongation of carbon bonds) is affected by thermal and aqueous alteration history. The distribution of organic molecules was also examined by methanol-spraying the surface of approximately 1 mm-sized particles of the Ryugu sample (A0080) for the imaging mass spectrometry. These nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds were found to have different spatial distributions on the micrometer scale in the particles, depending on the carbon number and different chemical compositions (<a href="#pic05">Figure 5</a>). Such differences in the spatial heterogeneity of organic molecules may be due to the interaction among water, organic molecules, and minerals on the Ryugu.

</div>

<div>
  <p>
     The diversity of soluble organic molecules detected in the Ryugu samples is comparable to the diversity of organic molecules found in carbonaceous meteorites. However, the molecular distribution of low-molecular-weight organic compounds is relatively low, similar to the distribution of organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites that have been strongly affected by aqueous alteration. This is also consistent with mineralogical characteristics revealed by the initial analysis teams. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Asteroid surfaces are exposed to solar heating, ultraviolet, and high-energy cosmic rays under a high vacuum condition. However, this study shows that organic molecules are present on the regolith surface, probably protected by the shielding effect of minerals. Collisions and perturbations would eject organic material from the surface of carbonaceous asteroids, which would be transported to other bodies in the solar system as meteorites or cosmic dusts.
