To figure out what’s next, I’ve joined the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> (RC) for the Fall 1 ‘24 batch.</p><h2 id="whats-recurse">What’s Recurse?</h2><blockquote><p>The Recurse Center is a retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow.</p></blockquote><p>Pick me! I’m a curious programmer and I’m looking forward to some recharging and growth! They did.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-hoping-to-achieve">What are you hoping to achieve?</h2><p>By the end of RC, I’d like to have overcome some of my skill issues, made interesting new friends, and expanded my comfort zone.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-planning-to-work-on">What are you planning to work on?</h2><ol><li>I have some ambitious project ideas for <a href="https://gianluca.ai/bottom-up-bio">AI-driven bioinformatics</a> that I’d like to begin exploring.</li><li>I’d like to spend a significant amount of time working on improving my abilities in:<ul><li>Compiled backend / systems languages (C, Go, Rust, Zig)</li><li>High-performance simulation and graphics (WebGL, Unreal Engine)</li><li>Webdev (try make useful SPAs with Svelte, Vue, etc.)</li></ul></li><li>I’d love to spend some of my RC time working with other Recursers on weird and fun projects completely out of left field:<ul><li>How about a VST plugin for digital audio processing that turns MIDI input into generative graphics with multi-modal LLMs?</li><li>Write an audio-only game engine from scratch in Zig?</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id="how-can-i-follow-along">How can I follow along?</h2><p>In support of both my own writing goals and RC’s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">self-directive</a> to <em>learn generously</em>, I’ll be posting about the process and my projects. As usual, I’ll be using my blog’s <a href="https://gianluca.ai/tags">tagging system</a>, so you can follow all my progress at RC by filtering for posts with the <a href="https://gianluca.ai/tags/recurse">#Recurse</a> tag.</p><p><code>&lt;shoutouts&gt;</code>
Thanks to Thomas for putting RC on my radar back in 2019, Oliver for encouraging me to apply (and endorsing me), and the Recurse team and cohort for a fantastic onboarding and welcome!
