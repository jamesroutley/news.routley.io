<p>Microsoft is investigating an ongoing and widespread outage impacting the users of its Teams communication platform and causing connectivity issues, login problems, and message delays.</p>
<p>While Redmond is still working on addressing these ongoing problems, it revealed that a networking issue might be the root cause of this outage.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;ve identified a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service and we&#39;re performing a failover to remediate impact. Additional information can be found under TM710344 in the admin center,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750931051210228178" target="_blank">tweeted</a> the official Microsoft account for updates on Microsoft 365 service incidents.</p>
<p>Affected customers have reported login and server connection issues, desktop and mobile Teams apps freezing on the loading screen, and message delivery problems.</p>
<p>Other reports mention chat history not being available and images no longer displaying in chat, as well as being left in the waiting room after joining Teams meetings.</p>

<p>On impacted systems, customers see &#34;We&#39;ve run into a server error. Some functions might not work right now but you can continue to use the app&#34; errors.</p>
<p>According to the TM710344 incident report in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the outage was first acknowledged by Redmond at 10:37 AM EST and it impacts customers across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions.</p>
<p>The outage affects users performing a cold boot, who may not be able to log into teams and will see an &#34;oops&#34; page. It also causes users attempting to log into their accounts and unlocking devices to see missing messages.</p>
<p>&#34;Our review of service telemetry indicates a portion of database infrastructure that facilitates multiple APls is experiencing a networking issue, resulting in impact,&#34; Microsoft said.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re continuing our investigation to isolate the underlying cause of the networking issue and develop remediation actions.&#34;</p>
<p><em>Update January 26, 12:55 EST: </em>Added TM710344 incident report info.</p>
<p><em>Update January 26, 13:28 EST:</em> Microsoft says it&#39;s working on addressing the server issues and is seeing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;ve completed the failover in the EMEA region and service telemetry is showing some improvement. The failovers for the North and South America regions are ongoing and we continue to monitor,&#34; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750947382588571976" target="_blank">tweeted</a>.</p>
