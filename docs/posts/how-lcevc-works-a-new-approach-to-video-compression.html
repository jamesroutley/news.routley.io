    <h1>How LCEVC works – A new approach to video compression</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><p>The examples below (magnified to better show the impact on fidelity of small details) illustrate the difference between the source input, the decoded base at half-resolution, the same decoded base upsampled with state-of-the-art Lanczos upsampling and the LCEVC-enhanced full resolution reconstruction. Notice (e.g., from number “8” or letter “R”) that the LCEVC-enhanced reconstruction includes high-frequency details that could not be inferred from just decoding and upsampling the lower resolution encode, however smart and complex the upscaling method.</p></section><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Figure 2. Half-resolution decoded base</em></p></div></section><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Figure 3. Base upsampled to full resolution with FFmpeg Lanczos </em></p></div></section><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Figure 4. Full resolution LCEVC-enhanced output with typical large-scale distribution bitrates</em></p></div></section><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>Thanks to residual sub-layers, LCEVC uniquely combines the world of smart upsampling/super-resolution with the world of traditional coding: for the areas where smart upscaling is enough for high-fidelity reconstruction, LCEVC does not need to transmit residual data; for the areas where smart upscaling fails, LCEVC allows the encoder to efficiently send the corrections that reconstruct fidelity to the source.</p><p>The LCEVC tools have been designed to efficiently compress the sparse residual information left by the picture decomposition and recomposition process. In particular, LCEVC’s low-complexity requirement meant that the tool definition process accounted for the availability of hardware acceleration for graphics processing available in existing chipsets and it’s very amenable to optimised implementations (e.g. using SIMD CPU, GPU and heterogeneous parallel processing).</p><p>LCEVC adds an additional degree of freedom in implementations that can exploit the bitrate allocation and tool calibration of two separate coding schemes (the base and the enhancement) to produce more efficiencies than the single parts individually. Overall rate control accuracy can also be increased, with consequent benefits for real time low-latency use cases.</p><p>The LCEVC specification also enables a stream to signal adaptive dithering post-processing (which reduces banding and aliasing impairments) as well as providing a platform for future enhancement extensions. It allows for the customisation of the upsampling kernels and the inclusion of user data within the bitstream at a transform block level, effectively allowing for the adoption of evolving upsampling/super-resolution techniques and image manipulation within the standard, while still offering an efficient method of encoding residual data and providing up to mathematically lossless image reconstruction.</p></div></section></div>
