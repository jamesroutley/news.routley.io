<p>Want to learn something new?</p>
<p>Get a personal teacher as soon as possible. If you don&#39;t have enough money to pay someone, find a mentor among your friends or a local club.</p>
<p>Show them what you already can do and receive their feedback with an open mind and open heart. Every course correction they show you is a shortcut to success you haven&#39;t been aware of.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t listen to people telling you that you can learn everything by yourself. I mean, sure, you could. But it takes way longer and it&#39;s easier to quit for a bunch of reasons (lack of accountability and progress, for example).</p>
<p>Use the resources others praise as a substitute for a teacher as complementary study material. Use them to ask more questions. Use them to fail more often. Use them to engage in dialogue with your teacher.</p>
<p>If there are seven proven ways to success and your teacher can only show you the fourth best way, that still beats the two hundred ways leading to nowhere presented to you on the Internet.</p>
