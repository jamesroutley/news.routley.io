    <h1>TSMC Risk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>You probably think, given this title, you know what this Article is about. The most advanced semiconductors are made by TSMC in Taiwan,<sup id="rf1-18153"><a href="#fn1-18153" title="Yes, there are chips made in Arizona, but only a portion, and they need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging and testing." rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and Taiwan is claimed by China, which has not and will not take reunification-by-force off of the table.</p>



<p>Relatedly, AI obviously has significant national security implications; at Davos, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei reiterated his objection to the U.S. allowing the sale of Nvidia chips to China. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/anthropic-ceo-says-selling-advanced-ai-chips-to-china-is-crazy">From Bloomberg</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei said selling advanced artificial intelligence chips to China is a blunder with “incredible national security implications” as the US moves to allow Nvidia Corp. to sell its H200 processors to Beijing. “It would be a big mistake to ship these chips,” Amodei said in an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I think this is crazy. It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The nuclear weapon analogy is an interesting one: a lot of game theory was developed to manage the risk of nuclear weapons, particularly once the U.S.S.R. gained/stole nuclear capability, ending the U.S.’s brief monopoly on the technology. Before that happened, however, the U.S. had a dominant military position, given we had nuclear weapons and no one else did. Perhaps Amodei believes the U.S. should have advanced AI and China should not, giving us a dominant military position?</p>



<p>The problem with that reality, however, is Taiwan, as I explained in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/ai-promise-and-chip-precariousness/">AI Promise and Chip Precariousness</a>. AI, in contrast to nuclear weapons, has a physical dependency in Taiwan that can be easily destroyed by Chinese missiles, even without an invasion; if we got to a situation where only the U.S. had the sort of AI that would give us an unassailable advantage militarily, then the optimal strategy for China would change to taking TSMC off of the board.</p>



<p>Given this dependency, my recommendations in the Article run counter to Amodei: I want China dependent on not just U.S. chips but also on TSMC directly, which is why I argued in favor of selling Nvidia chips to China, and further believe that Huawei and other Chinese companies ought to be able to source from TSMC (on the flip side, I would ban the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese fabs). <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/trump-allows-h200-sales-to-china-the-sliding-scale-a-good-decision/">I think it’s a good thing</a> the Trump administration moved on the first point, at least.</p>



<p>However, this risk is not what this Article is about: there is another TSMC risk facing the entire AI industry in particular; moreover, it’s a risk the downside of which is already being realized.</p>



<h3>The TSMC Brake</h3>



<p>There was one refrain that was common across Big Tech earnings last quarter: demand for AI exceeds supply. Here was Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835958-amazon-com-inc-amzn-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript">the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here was Microsoft CFO Amy Hood on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here was Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript">the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models, and core GCP infrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics. As I’ve mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment in Q4 and 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here was Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript">the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To date, we keep on seeing this pattern where we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption. And then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business in ways that we think would be quite profitable than we end up having compute for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this month, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei admitted that the shortage was a lack of chips, not power; from <a href="https://investor.tsmc.com/english/encrypt/files/encrypt_file/reports/2026-01/51d09df96cd89ac19d65af39032b038dc2896a24/TSMC%204Q25%20Transcript.pdf">the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Talking about to build a lot of AI data center all over the world, I use one of my customers’ customers’ answer. I asked the same question. They told me that they planned this one, 5-6 years ago already. So, as I said, those cloud service providers are smart, very smart. So, they say that they work on the power supply 5-6 years ago. So, today, their message to me is: silicon from TSMC is a bottleneck, and asked me not to pay attention to all others, because they have to solve the silicon bottleneck first. But indeed, we do get the power supply, all over the world, especially in the US. Not only that, but we also look at, who support those kind of a power supply, like a turbine, like, what, nuclear power plant, the plan or those kinds of things. We also look at the supply of the rack. We also look at the supply of the cooling system. Everything, so far, so good. So we have to work hard to narrow the gap between the demand and supply from TSMC.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The cause of that gap is obvious if you look at TSMC’s financials, specifically the company’s annual capital expenditures:</p>

<p>After a big increase in CapEx in 2021, driven by the COVID shortages and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398927-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-ceo-c-c-wei-on-q4-2020-results">a belief in 5G</a>, TSMC’s annual CapEx in the following years was basically flat — it actually declined on a year-over-year basis in both 2023 and 2024. Note those dates! ChatGPT was released in November 2022; that kicked off a massive increase in CapEx amongst the hyperscalers in particular, but it sure seems like TSMC didn’t buy the hype.</p>



<p>That lack of increased investment earlier this decade is why there is a shortage today, and is why TSMC has been a de facto brake on the AI buildout/bubble; <a href="https://stratechery.com/2026/tsmc-earnings-the-tsmc-brake-revisited-why-ai-needs-foundry-competition/">I wrote last quarter</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To put it another way, if Altman and OpenAI are the ones pushing to accelerate the AI infrastructure buildout, it’s Wei and TSMC that are the brakes. The extent to which all of Altman’s deals actually materialize is dependent on how much TSMC invests in capacity now, and while they haven’t shown their hand yet, the company is saying all of the right things about AI being a huge trend without having yet committed to a commensurate level of investment, at least relative to OpenAI’s goals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That Update was about the future, but it’s important to note that the TSMC brake has — if all of those CEO and CFO comments above are to be believed — already cost the biggest tech companies a lot of money. That’s the implication of not having enough supply to satisfy demand: there was revenue to be made that wasn’t, because TSMC didn’t buy the AI hype at the same time everyone else did.</p>



<h3>TSMC’s CapEx Plans</h3>



<p>TSMC is, finally, starting to invest more. Last year’s CapEx increased 37% to $41 billion, and there’s another increase in store for this year to $52–$56 billion; if we take the midpoint, that represents an increase of 32%, a bit less than last year:</p>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1330" height="618" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-3.png?resize=1330%2C618&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-3.png?w=1330&amp;ssl=1 1330w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-3.png?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-3.png?resize=768%2C357&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"/></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, $54 billion is a big number, one that Wei admitted made him nervous:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You essentially try to ask whether the AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it. Yeah, you bet, because we have to invest about USD52 billion to USD56 billion for the CapEx, right? If we did not do it carefully, that will be a big disaster to TSMC for sure. So, of course, I spent a lot of time in the last three-four months talking to my customers and then customers’ customers. I want to make sure that my customers’ demands are real.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wei made clear that he was worried about the market several years down the line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you build a new fab, it takes two and three year, two to three years to build a new fab. So even we start to spend $52 billion to $56 billion, the contribution to this year is almost none, and 2027, a little bit. So we actually, we are looking for 2028-2029 supply, and we hope it’s a time that the gap will be narrow…So 2026-2027 for the short-term, we are looking to improve our productivity. 2028 to 2029, yes, we start to increase our capacity significantly. And it will continue this way if the AI demand megatrend as we expected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>First off, this delayed impact explains why TSMC’s lack of CapEx increase a few years ago is resulting in supply-demand imbalance today. Secondly, notice how this year’s planned increase — which again, won’t really have an impact until 2028 — pales in comparison to the CapEx growth of the hyperscalers (<em>2025 numbers are estimates; note that Amazon’s CapEx includes Amazon.com</em>):</p>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1330" height="812" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-2.png?resize=1330%2C812&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-2.png?w=1330&amp;ssl=1 1330w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-2.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsmc-risk-2.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"/></figure>



<p>Remember, a significant portion of this CapEx growth is for chips that are supported by TSMC’s stagnant CapEx growth from a few years ago. It’s notable, then, that TSMC’s current and projected CapEx growth is still less than the hyperscalers: how much less is it going to be than the hyperscalers’ growth in 2028, when the fabs being built today start actually producing chips?</p>



<p>In short, the TSMC brake isn’t going anywhere — if anything, it’s being pressed harder than ever.</p>



<h3>TSMC Risk</h3>



<p>TSMC is, to be clear, being extremely rational. CapEx is inherently risky: you are spending money now in anticipation of demand that may or may not materialize. Moreover, the risk for a foundry is higher than basically any other business model: nearly all of a foundry’s costs are CapEx, which means that if demand fails to materialize, costs — in the form of depreciation — don’t go down as they might with a business model with a higher percentage of marginal costs. This is exacerbated by the huge dollar figures entailed in building fabs: $52–$56 billion may drive revenues with big margins, but those big margins can easily flip to being huge losses and years of diminished pricing power thanks to excess capacity. Therefore, it’s understandable that TSMC is trying to manage its risks. Sure, the company may be foregoing some upside in 2028, but what is top of Wei’s mind is avoiding “a big disaster.”</p>



<p>What is important to note, however, is that the risk TSMC is managing doesn’t simply go away: rather, it’s being offloaded to the hyperscalers in particular. Specifically, if we get to 2028, and TSMC still isn’t producing enough chips to satisfy demand, then that means the hyperscalers will be forgoing billions of dollars in revenue — even more than they are already forgoing today. Yes, that risk is harder to see than the risk TSMC is avoiding, because the hyperscalers aren’t going to be bankrupt for a lack of chips to satisfy demand. Still, the potential money not made — particularly when the number is potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars — is very much a risk that the hyperscalers are incurring because of TSMC’s conservatism.</p>



<p>What the hyperscalers need to understand is that simply begging TSMC to make more isn’t going to fix this problem, because begging TSMC to make more is to basically ask TSMC to take back the risk TSMC is offloading to the hyperscalers — they already declined! Rather, the only thing that will truly motivate TSMC to take on more risk is competition. If TSMC were worried about not just forgoing its own extra revenue, but actually losing business to a competitor, then the company would invest more. Moreover, that extra investment would be stacked on top of the investment made by said competitor, which means the world would suddenly have dramatically more fab capacity.</p>



<h3>If You Want a Bubble</h3>



<p>In short, the only way to truly get an AI bubble, with all of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/the-benefits-of-bubbles/">the potential benefits that entails</a>, or, in the optimistic case, to actually meet demand in 2028 and beyond, is to have competition in the foundry space. That, by extension, means Samsung or Intel — or both — actually being viable options.</p>



<p>Remember, however, the number one challenge facing those foundries: a lack of demand from the exact companies whom TSMC has deputized to take on their risk. I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/">U.S. Intel</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our mythical startup, however, doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it exists in the same world as TSMC, the company who has defined the modern pure play foundry. TSMC has put in the years, and they’ve put in the money; TSMC has the unparalleled customer service approach that created the entire fabless chip industry; and, critically, TSMC, just as they did in the mobile era, is aggressively investing to meet the AI moment. If you’re an Nvidia, or an Apple in smartphones, or an AMD or a Qualcomm, why would you take the chance of fabricating your chips anywhere else? Sure, TSMC is raising prices in the face of massive demand, but the overall cost of a chip in a system is still quite small; is it worth risking your entire business to save a few dollars for worse performance with a worse customer experience that costs you time to market and potentially catastrophic product failures?</p>



<p>We know our mythical startup would face these challenges because they are the exact challenges Intel faces. Intel may need “a meaningful external customer to drive acceptable returns on [its] deployed capital”, but Intel’s needs do not drive the decision-making of those external customers, despite the fact that Intel, while not fully caught up to TSMC, is at least in the ballpark, something no startup could hope to achieve for decades.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Becoming a meaningful customer of Samsung or Intel is very risky: it takes years to get a chip working on a new process, which hardly seems worth it if that process might not be as good, and if the company offering the process definitely isn’t as customer service-centric as TSMC. I understand why everyone sticks with TSMC.</p>



<p>The reality that hyperscalers and fabless chip companies need to wake up to, however, is that avoiding the risk of working with someone other than TSMC incurs new risks that are both harder to see and also much more substantial. Except again, we can see the harms already: foregone revenue today as demand outstrips supply. Today’s shortages, however, may prove to be peanuts: if AI has the potential these companies claim it does, future foregone revenue at the end of the decade is going to cost exponentially more — surely a lot more than whatever expense is necessary to make Samsung and/or Intel into viable competitors for TSMC.</p>



<p>This, incidentally, is how the geographic risk issue will be fixed, if it ever is. It’s hard to get companies to pay for insurance for geopolitical risks that may never materialize. What is much more likely is that TSMC’s customers realize that their biggest risk isn’t that TSMC gets blown up by China, but that TSMC’s monopoly and reasonable reluctance to risk a rate of investment that matches the rest of the industry means that the rest of the industry fails to fully capture the value of AI.</p>
