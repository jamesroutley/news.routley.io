    <h1>Zettlr: Note-Taking and Publishing with Markdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editors are a dime a dozen. Cheaper than that, actually,
since many of them are open‑source software. Despite the sheer number of
options, finding an editor that has all of the features that one might want can
be tricky. For some users, <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a>
might be the right tool. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM">What You See is What You
Mean</a> (WYSIWYM) editor that stores its work locally as plain Markdown
files. The project is billed as a &#34;<q>one-stop publication
workbench</q>&#34;, and is suitable for writing anything from blog posts to
academic papers, maintaining a personal journal, or keeping notes in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettlekasten</a>. It
is simple to get started with, but rewards deeper exploration and
customization.</p>

<h4>Zettlr history</h4>

<p>The project was <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/history">started in 2017</a>, by
Hendrik Erz, and its name comes from the German word for note,
Zettel. According to the <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/about">about
page</a> for Zettlr, Erz was unhappy with existing tools for academic
writing, so he began work on the editor, which developed a following
among academics and students. Since its inception it
has had two major updates, <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/post/zettlr-200-released">version 2.0</a>
released in 2021, and <a href="https://zettlr.com/post/zettlr-300-released">3.0</a>
released in 2023. The most recent version, <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/releases/tag/v3.2.0">3.2.0</a>,
was released on June 11.</p>

<p>The project&#39;s web site has a <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/features">feature table</a> that compares
Zettlr to other popular open-source and proprietary note-taking tools
such as <a href="https://www.obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://www.logseq.com/">Logseq</a>, <a href="https://www.typora.io/">Typora</a>, and <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a>. The table
might be a bit biased, seeing as the project hand-picked the features
for comparison, but it does give a clear picture of which features the
project sees as important and how Zettlr stacks up.</p>

<p>Zettlr is a cross-platform <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application written in
JavaScript/TypeScript, and uses <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> as its embedded editor.
It&#39;s licensed under the GPLv3 with <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/getting-started/setup/#installing-zettlr">downloads</a>
for Linux, Windows, and macOS. The project offers native packages for
Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, as well as an AppImage bundle, and a Flatpak version.
Arch Linux also has a Zettlr package available in its repositories,
though the Zettlr project has a mild disclaimer in its documentation
that it is not responsible for Arch&#39;s package. Note that the Flatpak
version <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/3366">does not
have access</a> to the full filesystem by default, so it may be
necessary to use <a href="https://github.com/tchx84/flatseal">Flatseal</a> or another Flatpak
permission manager to provide access.</p>

<p>Electron tends to be a popular option for creating cross-platform
applications, but it also has a bad reputation for poor performance, and
for its applications having a non-native &#34;feel&#34;. However, the
Zettlr developers have taken pains to ensure that the application <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/post/zettlr-200-released">appears native on
each platform</a>. (&#34;Native&#34; on Linux means that it&#39;s designed to fit
in with GNOME&#39;s human interface guidelines, so mileage may vary on
other desktop environments.) Its performance is also good, at least in my
experience, using native packages on Fedora 40 and
Linux Mint 22 (using the Ubuntu package).</p>

<h4>Getting started</h4>

<p>There is a <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/get-started/">tutorial</a> that&#39;s
worth exploring before getting started on any real
work. While it is possible to be productive right away without it, the tutorial
will likely help save time in the long run. For example, it will guide
users to <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/installing-latex/">install
LaTeX</a> to create PDFs using XeLaTeX. That step is not
obvious without reading the documentation or following the tutorial,
and attempts to export using XeLaTeX will error out instead. When
using Simple PDF, Zettlr first exports to HTML and converts that to
PDF. XeLaTeX has <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex">more
options</a>, including setting the page size and setting document
classes.</p>

<p>Zettlr ships with a built-in version of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> for <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/import/">importing</a>, converting, and <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/export/">exporting</a> files to or
from Markdown <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/1552">so that users
don&#39;t have to install it separately</a>. (As of this writing, Zettlr
includes Pandoc 3.1.13, while the most recent version is <a href="https://pandoc.org/releases.html#pandoc-3.3-2024-07-28">3.3</a>.)</p>

<p>If Pandoc can convert a file correctly to Markdown, it can be edited
in Zettlr. Its export function is a bit more limited, however, as it
only exposes a handful of formats that Pandoc supports. For example,
Pandoc happily supports converting Markdown files to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB format</a>, but that
option is not available by default via Zettlr&#39;s export menu. Options that
are available include HTML, rich text format (RTF), OpenDocument Format (ODF),
LaTeX, plain text, Microsoft Word (docx), simple PDF, and LaTeX PDF.
Users can even use Zettlr for creating presentations by exporting from
Markdown to the <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a>
presentation format.</p>

<p>If the default options are insufficient, all of Zettlr&#39;s
import/export profiles are stored as YAML files and exposed through its
<a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/assets-manager/">Assets
Manager</a>. Users can tweak the settings for each format, or create new
ones. Finally, it is also possible to add custom export commands, so
users are not limited to Pandoc for exporting Markdown to other
formats.</p>

<p>It is possible to simply open or create a text file and start
editing, but Zettlr&#39;s design is centered around <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/workspaces/">workspaces and
folders (directories)</a>. The distinction is a bit fuzzy, but the
short of it is that workspaces are meant to organize one or more
folders where work is stored. Zettlr allows opening multiple
workspaces at one time, so a user might have one for a book project,
another for notes, and so on. Folders and workspaces can be converted
to <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/advanced/projects/">projects</a>. The
benefit of a project in Zettlr is that all of the files in a project can
be exported to a single document, such as a PDF. For instance, one might
work on each chapter of a book as a single Markdown file and then export
the entire book to PDF or another format with a single click.</p>

<p>The project export implementation is a bit limited, however. It
<em>only</em> supports lumping all of the files in a workspace together as
a single piece of work. It would be nice if Zettlr also supported, for
example, rendering content in a workspace as separate HTML files for a
web site or knowledge base. But, since everything is stored on disk as plain Markdown
files, it should not be difficult to use something like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for that last step if desired.
This is unlike some other open-source note-taking applications, such
as <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>, that will allow users to work in
Markdown but store files in an <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/where-are-my-notes-md-files/33435">obfuscated
format</a> that makes it difficult to use with other tools.</p>

<h4>Editing</h4>

<p>As a WYSIWYM editor, Zettlr does not try to provide an exact preview
of the final document in real time, but it does provide options for
real-time Markdown rendering that make it more like working in a word
processor than a plain-text editor. For example, users can choose to
render links, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italicized</em> text,
headers, images, and <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid
diagrams</a> inline. It also has a <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/print-preview/">quick preview
feature</a>, which will bring up a print preview of the current
document.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/984633/#split">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/zettlr-split-sm.png" alt="[Zettlr editor]" title="Zettlr editor"/></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Zettlr&#39;s user interface is quite flexible. Users can open multiple
documents in tabs and/or split windows. (The screenshot above shows
Zettlr with several documents open in split windows and tabs.)
Naturally, it has a full-screen mode, which expands the editor to fit the entire screen and hides most
of the editor interface. The distraction-free mode hides sidebars, tabs,
split windows, and grays out all text except the current paragraph. It
also has a typewriter mode, which highlights and centers the current
paragraph in the middle of the editor. This is extremely useful, as it
keeps the cursor in the middle of the screen instead of it creeping
further and further down as one writes more text. All of those modes can
be combined, if desired, which writers may find helpful to stay in
the flow while working.</p>

<p>No doubt some readers will want to know whether Zettlr has the
all-important dark mode. The answer is &#34;yes&#34;. It has five default themes that
change the color scheme and font face. Each of the themes has a
corresponding dark mode as well. Users can even set a schedule to switch
from light mode to dark mode, and back again. Its interface is also
customizable via CSS, so users can tweak the interface to their liking
if the default themes are not quite right.</p>

<p>For those who feel most at home in Emacs or Vim, the application has
the option of Emacs or Vim modes. These are implemented by
CodeMirror plugins and provide only a subset of each editor&#39;s
keybindings. For example, Emacs users are used to control-k deleting
everything from the cursor to the end of a line. However, in Zettlr,
control-k is bound to &#34;insert link&#34; instead. Even an imperfect
implementation may still help users who have developed muscle-memory for
one or the other editor, though. See the <a href="https://codemirror.net/5/demo/emacs.html">Emacs</a> and <a href="https://codemirror.net/5/demo/vim.html">Vim</a> documentation on
the CodeMirror site to learn more.</p>

<p>Speaking of keybindings, Zettlr&#39;s developers deserve kudos for
having <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/reference/keyboard-shortcuts/">shortcuts</a>
for almost every menu option. The only disappointment is that the shortcuts
are not configurable, though <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/818">they have
explored</a> making them configurable. Apparently this is a <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/818#issuecomment-1002283566">major
limitation of using Electron</a>, and users should not hold their
breath for this feature.</p>

<h4>Prose tools</h4>

<p>As a writer&#39;s workbench, Zettlr provides tools for tracking writing
progress, text replacement, citations, spell checking, syntax linting for Markdown,
and optional grammar/style checking using <a href="https://languagetool.org/">LanguageTool</a>. Its <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/statusbar/">status bar</a>, at the
bottom of the editor, shows the cursor position, how many words and
characters are in the document, the editor mode (if in Vim or Emacs
mode), and has a tally of possible errors in the right-hand diagnostics
tab. Clicking the diagnostics tab in the status bar opens up a small
panel at the bottom of the editor with a list of spelling mistakes,
grammar errors, and so forth. Grammar and style checking require an
account with the LanguageTool service or a <a href="https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server">self-hosted instance</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool">LanguageTool
open-source project</a>.</p>

<p>For some reason, Zettlr <em>really</em> cares about smart quotes,
which it also refers to as &#34;magic quotes&#34;. Its <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/autocorrect/">auto-correct
settings</a> tab calls out the quote settings alone at the top of the
page, separate from all of the other text-replacement options.
It even has status-bar buttons for enabling, disabling, and
customizing smart quotes. Aside from smart quotes, it
also provides a number of text-replacement options for things like
converting double hyphens to an <a href="https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/en-dash.html">en dash</a> (–)
or inserting a Euro currency symbol (€) by typing <tt>:eur</tt>.</p>

<p>Writers will find a few tools for tracking productivity in Zettlr as well.
The statistics button in the top toolbar brings up a quick view of
how many words have been written in the past
month, the daily average, and a count of how many words have been
written that day. Clicking &#34;More statistics&#34; gives several views
for word-count statistics and a <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/academic/graph/">graph view</a> to show
links between files. Zettlr provides a <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/advanced/pomodoro/">Pomodoro timer</a>
in the toolbar as well, to help break down writing sessions into
manageable chunks.</p>

<p>The graph view is particularly interesting if one is using Zettlr as
a personal knowledge database or Zettlkasten. As one might expect from
the name, Zettlr has <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/academic/zkn-method/">a few
features</a> specifically geared at managing a Zettlekasten or similar
note-keeping scheme, and has a settings page dedicated to
that purpose. Specifically, it has support for creating <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/add-identity/">unique IDs for Zettel
notes</a>, for cross-referencing between files, and for <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/advanced/zkn-method/#tagging">tags</a>.
For example, one might add a <code>#blog</code> tag to every document
that contains a blog post.</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>

<p>Markdown is a decent markup language that handles basic text
formatting well, but editing tables in Markdown becomes tedious
quickly. The formatting for tables in Markdown requires separating cells
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-pipe_tables">using
a vertical bar</a> (<tt>|</tt>) or <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-grid_tables">ASCII
art</a>. Tables with more than a few rows and cells are no
fun at all to wrangle using many text editors. Zettlr, though, has a
table editor that makes working with basic tables easy.</p>
<p>The &#34;Insert Table&#34; button lets users specify the desired number of
columns and rows, and then displays a graphical table editor with simple
controls to manage text alignment, and create or delete columns and
rows. The table editor is only capable of the basics, though. More
complex layouts, such as splitting a single cell into multiple columns,
are not supported. It is, of course, still possible to represent more
complicated layouts using Markdown or HTML.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, Zettlr is less helpful when
it comes to inserting images into a document. A user might expect that
the image button would bring up a file dialog to pick an image and
insert the proper Markdown markup to include the image, but it does not.
Instead, it simply inserts the raw code for an image (e.g.,
<tt>![description](/path/to/image.jpg)</tt>) and whatever link might
be in the clipboard as the URL for an image (whether it is an image link
or not). If the clipboard does not have an image link, then it is left as
an exercise to the writer to insert it manually. Zettlr does,
however, support dragging and dropping images into a document. In fact,
while it <a href="https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/217">does not
have a web-clipper</a>, as many other note-taking applications do,
Zettlr does handle copy and paste from a web browser
(including formatting) reasonably well.</p>

<h4>A handy workbench</h4>

<p>At first glance, Zettlr seems like a fairly simple Markdown editor,
but it&#39;s capable of doing a great deal more. It really depends entirely
on what a user wants to do, and how deep they&#39;re willing to dig to
customize Zettlr for their use case(s).</p>

<p>If a user is motivated to bend Zettlr to their will, they will find
that the <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/">documentation</a> for the
project is well-written and comprehensive. Some documentation and
screenshots are either outdated or platform-specific (e.g., <a href="https://docs.zettlr.com/en/reference/settings/">the settings
reference</a> features macOS screenshots), but it is generally quite
good. Each page has a link to edit the documentation on GitHub, should
one encounter errors or outdated text.</p>

<p>The editor is mature and full-featured, but the community governance
is still in a formative stage. In July, Erz <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/post/introducing-the-zettlr-steering-committee">announced</a>
the formation of a three-person (including himself) steering committee
to &#34;<q>better plan and guide the development process</q>&#34;. This is
described as a first step toward opening up the project and sharing
responsibility but Erz says that &#34;<q>I still carry the entire
responsibility and accountability for the project</q>&#34;, albeit now with
help in decision-making. He also committed to transparency through
frequent communication via the <a href="https://go.zettlr.com/discord">project&#39;s Discord server</a>. It
will be interesting to see how the project&#39;s governance and community
evolves along with the project itself.</p>

<p>Overall, Zettlr offers a comprehensive set of features for working
with prose in Markdown format, and for keeping a personal notes
database. Editor preferences are highly subjective, of
course, but I&#39;ve found it more usable than some of its counterparts
like Obsidian and Logseq. It is well worth taking for a spin for
anyone looking for a good, open-source Markdown tool.</p>
