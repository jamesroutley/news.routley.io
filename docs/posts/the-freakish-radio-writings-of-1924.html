    <h1>The &#39;Freakish Radio Writings&#39; of 1924</h1>

					<p>Mars was a lively destination in early science fiction because of its proximity. When H. G. Wells needed a danger from outer space, <em>The War of the Worlds</em> naturally looked toward Mars, as a place close to Earth and one with the ability to provoke curiosity. Closely studied at opposition in 1877, Mars provoked in Giovanni Schiaparelli the prospect of a network of canals, surely feeding a civilization that might still be alive. No wonder new technologies turned toward the Red Planet as they became available to move beyond visible light and even attempt to make contact with its inhabitants.</p>

<p>All this comes to mind this morning because of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/science/mars-aliens-radio-signals.html">intriguing story</a> sent along by my friend Al Jackson, whose work on interstellar propulsion is well known in these pages, as is his deep involvement with the Apollo program. Al had never heard of the incident described in the story. It occurred in 1924, when at another Martian opposition (an orbital alignment bringing Earth and Mars as close as they’ll get during its 26-month orbit), the U. S. Navy imposed radio silence nationwide for five minutes once an hour from August 21 to 24. The plan: Allow observatories worldwide to listen for Martians. </p>
<p><strong>Image:</strong> The cover of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel that would have been on Mars enthusiasts’ shelves when the 1924 opposition occurred. Burroughs’ depiction of Mars was hugely popular in its day.</p>
<p>This was serious SETI for its day. A dirigible was launched from the U. S. Naval Observatory carrying radio equipment for these observations, with the capability of relaying its signals back to a laboratory on the ground. A military cryptographer was brought in to monitor the situation, as attested by a provocative <em>New York Times</em> headline from August 23 of that year: “Code Expert Ready for Message.; RADIO HEARS THINGS AS MARS NEARS US.”</p>
<p>All this was news to me too, and thus I was entranced by the new article, a <em>Times</em> essay from August 20 of this year, written by Becky Ferreira. Because something indeed happened and was reported in August 28 of 1924, again in the <em>Times</em>: “SEEKS SIGN FROM MARS IN 38-FOOT RADIO FILM; Dr. Todd Will Study Photograph of Mysterious Dots and Dashes Recently Recorded.”</p>
<p>As Ferreira explains::</p>
<blockquote><p>A series of dots and dashes, captured by an airborne antenna, produced a photographic record of “a crudely drawn face,” according to news reports. The tantalizing results and subsequent media frenzy inflamed the public’s imagination. It seemed as if Mars was speaking, but what was it trying to say?</p>
<p>“The film shows a repetition, at intervals of about a half hour, of what appears to be a man’s face,” one of the experiment’s leaders said days later.</p></blockquote>
<p>You may recall that when Frank Drake began Project Ozma at Green Bank in 1960, he homed in on nearby stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. And relatively soon he got a strong signal, causing him to ponder whether detecting other civilizations might be easy if you just pointed your antenna and began to listen. But the signal turned out to be from an aircraft in the skies of West Virginia, an early SETI frustration, for radio frequency interference (RFI) is a source of constant concern, as witness the stir caused briefly in 2019 by what appeared to be a signal from Proxima Centauri, but was not.</p>
<p>I don’t think the 1960 RFI experience got much media play, if any, though Project Ozma itself received a certain degree of coverage. But the ‘face’ found in the Mars radio reception of 1924 would have caused newspaper readers in that year to recall Guglielmo Marconi’s 1920 claim that he had detected signals “sent by the inhabitants of other planets to the inhabitants of Earth.” This was an era bristling with the new exploration of radio wavelengths, which if they could offer communications across a continent or ocean, could surely make possible a signal from one planet to another. </p>
<p>The interest was international, as another <em>Times</em> headline makes clear, this one from August 23, 1924: “RADIO HEARS THINGS AS MARS NEARS US; A 24-Tube Set in England Picks Up Strong Signals Made in Harsh Dots. VANCOUVER ALSO FAVORED At Washington the Translator of McLean Telegrams Stands by to Decode Any Message.” </p>
<p>Back to the ‘face’ found in the research effort on the American side of the Atlantic, dug out of data relayed from the dirigible. It was an astronomer named David Peck Todd who went to work with inventor Charles Francis Jenkins, using a radio from the National Electrical Supply Company designed to support troops in combat. Jenkins would use it to pick up any signals from Mars as detected by the airship. He had for his part built a ‘radio camera’ that would convert the radio data into optical flashes that would be imprinted on photographic paper, and it was within the result that what seemed to be a face emerged. But it was one that not everyone saw. </p>
<p>Jenkins himself was unimpressed, as I learned from a story titled “Freakish Radio writings on Mars Machine” that ran in the <em>Daily News</em> on August 27. Let me quote the small piece in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p>C. Francis Jenkins, Washington inventor, is investigating to ascertain cause of a series of freakish writings received on his special machine designed to record any possible radio signals from Mars. </p>
<p>The film record shows an arrangement of dots and dashes and pictures resembling a human face. </p>
<p>“I do not think the results have anything to do with Mars,” Jenkins said.</p></blockquote>
<p>A little more digging in the newspaper archives revealed that Jenkins told Associated Press reporters, as recorded in the <em>Buffalo Evening Times</em> that same day (“Radio Signals Shown on Films, Puzzle Savants at Capital”) that he thought the results came from radio frequency interference, saying what appears to be a face is “a freak which we can’t explain.” The image was indeed part of a repeating pattern recorded on Jenkins’ machine, but people were reading into it what they wanted to see.</p>

<p>So where is the 38-foot long roll of photographic paper that caused the ‘detection’ of a face from Mars? The original, according to Ferreira’s research, seems to have been lost, but Yale University Library <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/digcoll/4345925">lists three images from its collection</a> of materials on David Peck Todd under the title “Martian signals recorded by Jenkins.” So we have at least three photographs of Jenkins’ work, but to me at least, no face seems apparent. </p>
<p>Also in Buffalo, the <em>Buffalo American</em> ran a much longer piece titled “Astronomers Scan Mars To Discover Human Life” for its August 28, 1924 issue, which looks at the whole issue of studying Mars, though without mention of Jenkins’ work. It includes this interesting paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>…perhaps Mars does see what is happening on the earth. If you were on Mars and looked at the earth you would see a star twice as large as Mars appears to Buffalo, as the earth is double Mars’ size. In the far distance on the same side of the sky would be the sun but it would only be two-thirds as large as it appears here. On the other wise would be discerned a huge mass of vapor 1,300 times as large as the earth. That would be Jupiter, which has not solidified yet. You would also see a couple of moons. They light Mars at night and are responsible for the tides on its oceans.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>Buffalo American</em> article takes us right into the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ imagination, which at that time had reached, in its 10-book series, <em>The Chessmen of Mars</em> (1922). If you’re a hard-core Burroughs fan, you may remember the chess game (known on Mars as Jetan) in which humans play the role of the chess pieces and fight to the death (Burroughs loved chess). Despite the <em>Buffalo American</em>’s mention of oceans, even in John Carter’s day Barsoom was depicted as a place where water resources were rare and tightly controlled.</p>
<p>And just why study Mars in the first place? The newspaper article explains: </p>
<blockquote><p>They want to know if the earth is the only celestial globe on which the Creator put human beings and if the planets and stars beyond were designed merely for the people on Earth to admire.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Mars of the day was an extraordinary place. In researching this piece, I came across this from an article on the 1924 opposition by Rowland Thomas that ran in the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some time astronomers all over the world have been preparing to get close-ups of Mars with their telescopes. The observers at Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., where the late Percival Lowell carried on his lifelong study of the planet which confirmed his belief that intelligent life exists on it, reported that on the southern hemisphere of Mars, where the polar ice cap is now melting under the rays of what is there a spring-tide sun, vast areas of what may be continents, marshland, prairies and the beds of dired-up oceans are constantly changing in appearance.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Image:</strong> Mars as conceived by astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916) and discussed by him in three books: <em>Mars</em> (1895), <em>Mars and Its Canals</em> (1906), and <em>Mars As the Abode of Life</em> (1908). The canals are here shown filled, with the vegetation in vigorous growth. Painting by H. Seppings Wright (1850-1937).</p>
<p>We’re still fourteen years from Orson Welles’ “War of the Worlds” broadcast in October of 1938, which gave plenty of time for early SETI interest to grow along with magazine science fiction, which in the US began in the pages of Hugo Gernsback’s radio magazines starting with <em>The Electrical Experimenter</em> and moving on to <em>Science and Invention</em>, but would soon claim its own dedicated title in <em>Amazing Stories</em>, whose first issue appeared in April of 1926. A nod as well to a sprinkling of earlier SF stories in Street &amp; Smith’s pulp <em>The Thrill Book</em>.</p>
<p>Ferreira’s article is terrific, and I’m glad to hear that she is working on a book on SETI. It took Mariner 4’s flyby in 1965 to finally demonstrate what the surface of Mars was really like, and by then the interstellar SETI effort was just beginning to get attention. I wonder how the Mars enthusiasts of 1924 would have reacted to the news that despite the SETI efforts of the ensuing 100 years, we still have no proof of intelligence or indeed life of any kind on another world?</p>
