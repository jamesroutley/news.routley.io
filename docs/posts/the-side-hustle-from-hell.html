I understood‚Äîas (probably) the next Zuckerberg, you need to be careful with your ideas around me.</p><p>We got on great. I briefed him on my credentials and showcased my passion for startups, and he told me I‚Äôd be a great fit for the team. It was a done deal. I‚Äôd taken the first step to fulfilling my destiny as the next great startup (advisor).</p><p>Fixr was the operating system for your car.

The cofounders didn‚Äôt have access to the code repo, so I had to spend more time battling the relationship manager for access.</p><p>And eventually, I got it.</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúFar, far below the deepest delving of FAANG and big consultancies, the world is gnawed by nameless devs. Even Bill Gates knows them not.

I whipped up a quick live-demo of a modern iOS map app, with custom photo location pin, plus an input form and photo capabilities.</p><p>In one Monster-and-Elvanse-fuelled night of passion, I was light years ahead of a build that had taken 3 years. They were sold.</p><p>In order to justify the extra time investment, I was provisionally brought on as cofounder and CTO. But we had a marketplace to build, and two platforms to serve. We needed an ‚ÄúAndroid guy‚Äù. I knew just the person: Gus. </p><p>Like me, he was keen on the idea, and in the market for a new side project. At a pre-lockdown party, I sold the dream: this product lives or dies via the traction we get in the next couple of months.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dragging my good friend into the blender is a regret, but we kept each other sane through the subsequent 9 months.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Despite being late to the party, the team valued our potential contributions at 10% apiece‚Äîthe level required to get into Y Combinator. </p><p>To make things official, and certify our equity stakes, Kim drew up contracts, which were quite obviously rehashed drafts of the contracts they gave the original ill-fated dev agency, plus a very spicy clause pertaining to equity shares.</p><blockquote><p><em>The Management Team may terminate this agreement and reduce or fully remove the equity held by the Developer where the Development Services are not sufficiently met. This clause is to be carried out at the discretion of the Management Team.</em></p></blockquote><p>I was about to sign, when Gus cleverly consulted his dad who, in a brilliant blaze of prescience, suggested we run a mile and block our teammates‚Äô phone numbers. Gus and I knew better, and simply pushed the team to change the wording to ‚Äúgross negligence‚Äù.</p><p>We were officially cofounders. </p><p>It was go-time.</p><p>The prevailing months flew by in a COVID-tinged haze. While everyone else was baking bread and remunerating nursing staff via saucepans, Gus and I spent every free minute turning Fixr into a serious product.</p><p>Our weekly Zoom calls had a regular push-and-pull. Gus and I presented the latest flows. Kim and Jimmy praised our progress, while pushing to expand the scope. We had to add more features to win the market as a one-stop-shop.</p><p>Engineering busywork complete, we turned to our operators.</p><ul><li><p>Kim shared her latest dream for our upcoming ‚Äúviral marketing campaign‚Äù that would land thousands of sign-ups on launch day.</p></li><li><p>Mike spitballed when we might start to acquire mechanics. Perhaps we‚Äôd hook into local apprenticeship schemes once we had demand from customers. Achieving liquidity would be straightforward.</p></li><li><p><span>Jimmy went through his latest tinkering with the financial model‚Äîthe cornerstone of our investment thesis‚Äîand talked us through the latest couple of emails from VC analysts who asked us to </span><a href="https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/yes-actually-means-no-the-curious" rel="">‚Äúget in touch when we had traction‚Äù</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>This early traction would be everything. </p><p>After months of neglecting our families, Gus and I had the MVP ready for prime-time, with a single robust user flow: </p><ul><li><p>Users on the Customer apps can post local repair jobs.

Turns out it‚Äôs not that important‚Äîit‚Äôs for illustrating your runway and spending plan, not to justify an imaginary revenue number. </p></li><li><p>No clandestine activity with contracts. We hashed it out on SeedLegals over beers.</p></li></ul><p>I tendered my resignation to my cofounders and relinquished my equity. </p><p>Gus quickly followed, immediately landing on his feet as an engineer in the banking sector. With no developers to keep the pretence of activity afloat, Fixr and the team soon dissolved.</p><p>This was cathartic, but bloody hard to write. </p><p>The earliest draft of this article began on August 18, 2023. I wanted to do right by you, and waited until I could tell my story properly.</p><p><span>The temptation to annotate each paragraph with commentary was excruciating.

I was in my element. I had my finger in every pie. I was </span><em>doing</em><span> a startup.

Even if you are all very driven, if your cofounders aren‚Äôt obviously A-players, your chances of outsized startup success are low (</span><em>but you might still learn a lot).</em></p></li><li><p><span>If your equity share is contingent on being cut in on a business loan, you are being asked to invest your own money. </span><em>Run</em><span>. </span></p></li><li><p>If there is political infighting between cofounders, consider whether you want to raise funds and become legally bound to these people for several years.</p></li><li><p><span>There are 2 jobs at a startup: building and selling. If you aren‚Äôt sure what your cofounders are doing, trust your </span><em>git instinct</em><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Building native on multiple platforms is an extremely inefficient allocation of resources when pre-product-market-fit. Building </span><em>two</em><span> apps on each platform is just mad.</span></p></li><li><p>Startup pitch competitions are mostly a waste of time‚Äîvalidation comes from talking to users and iterating, not from impressing a judge. This iterating is the hard part‚Äîeveryone will tell you they like your app, and most will say they‚Äôd pay for it. Unless you have deep domain knowledge, talking to 300 technicians without a working product will not yield useful validation.</p></li><li><p><span>Did I mention that I never met Kim or Mike in person? COVID aside, nothing beats the magic of hacking side-by-side to bring your dream to life. It‚Äôs not a great sign if </span><em>all</em><span> your communication is remote.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Marketplace startups are often considered the hardest software startups to build, because you have to create two markets at once. They work best with </span><strong>frequent </strong><span>and </span><strong>inexpensive </strong><span>transactions (from which you can reasonably take a 20% cut).</span></p></li><li><p><span>When VCs tell you ‚Äú</span><em>talk to us again when you have traction‚Äù</em><span>, they mean </span><em><a href="https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/yes-actually-means-no-the-curious" rel="">‚Äúif you prove there is a market opportunity and that you can execute as a management team, then we might consider you.
