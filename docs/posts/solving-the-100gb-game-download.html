                Venusoft is not directly affiliated with Valve or Steam.
                Via&#39;s integration with the Steam frontend and backend is done through good faith
                reverse engineering. At no point do we step outside of what Valve would find appropriate
                when it comes to encrypted game data and user account information. Steam and the Steam
                logo are trademarks of Valve Corporation.
