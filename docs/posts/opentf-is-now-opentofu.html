    <h1>OpenTF is now OpenTofu</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
<div>
          <p dir="auto">Along the lines of <code>tofu</code>, but is still easy to say/type:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>tuff</code></li>
<li><code>taff</code>/<code>taffy</code></li>
<li><code>toff</code></li>
<li>Or if you&#39;re a fan of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <code>toph</code></li>
<li><code>tiff</code> has been taken for <em>decades</em></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Remember: We engineers don&#39;t like to type. I&#39;m hesitant to support a name that is either too long, too hard to remember to spell, or doesn&#39;t have a good/short acronym. Even typing <code>terr[tab]</code> resulted into too many matches, and I&#39;d have to type more letters to filter further. <code>tf</code> is/was a short alias.</p>

<p dir="auto">More thoughts:</p>
<p dir="auto">When folks decided to try to develop a well-defined specification for Markdown, they first called the project <em>Standard Markdown</em> (kind of like <em>OpenTF</em>). They went back and forth with John Gruber (creator of Markdown), and settled on the non-trademark-infringing <em>Commonmark</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It was just so <em>obvious</em> that we&#39;d call it that, and it provided a clarity about its purpose. The name was perfect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Perhaps instead of leaning into the TF part, we lean into the fact that this project is trying to be more forward-looking and community-facing. <em>Our</em> version of the <em>Common</em> in <em>Commonmark</em>. The binary is <code>cmark</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Also, one of the core tenets of UX is &#34;clarity over cleverness&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129165343/https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1213-ui-sighting-clear-over-clever-on-mobileme" rel="nofollow">Signal v Noise</a>, by Jason Fried:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I just noticed Apple changed the logout feature in the MobileMe app UI. It used to be a power button icon. Now it just says “logout.” Another triumph of clarity over cleverness.</p>

<p dir="auto">From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210203185921/https://www.quotes.net/mquote/1059036" rel="nofollow">Ron White</a>, a standup comedian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This guy walks over to the tree, he scratches the bark with his thumb, walks back over to me, and he says this, and I quote:</p>
<p dir="auto">“The core of this tree is still alive.”</p>
<p dir="auto">I said, “Let me tell you what I&#39;m looking for in a f***in‘ tree. I&#39;m looking for a tree that you can tell is alive even if you don&#39;t know shit about trees.”</p>

<p dir="auto">Not knocking <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/samuel-phan/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/samuel-phan">@samuel-phan</a>, <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/dvaumoron/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/dvaumoron">@dvaumoron</a>, or any of the other suggestions (they were just the most recent ones I read), but looking through the UX lens, I&#39;m skeptical that <em>Declade</em> or <em>Neuromutate</em> drive <strong>clarity</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">IMO, we&#39;ll know it when we say it/read it/write it, and it&#39;s just <em>obvious</em> that we&#39;d call it that. Like touch interfaces on mobile phones. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve found it yet.</p>
