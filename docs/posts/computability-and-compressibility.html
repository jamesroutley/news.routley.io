<p>Is the statement &#34;most numbers are incompressible&#34; equivalent to &#34;most numbers are incomputable&#34;?</p>
<p>A compressible number is one that can be reduced to a smaller number by some algorithm. The algorithm as a whole must be smaller than the original number.</p>
<p>A computable number is one that can be computed by some algorithm. It would not do to label a number &#34;computable&#34; if the only algorithm to compute it were longer than itself, because the algorithm could be replaced by that number. So computable numbers must be compressible.</p>
<p>Conversely, compressible numbers, since they are expressed by an algorithm, are computable.</p>
<p>So these two seemingly disparate concepts, computable and compressible, describe the same set of numbers.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Thinking about it further, I think I have this wrong. 2 is incompressible because there is no shorter representation, but it is not incomputable, it can be computed in all sorts of ways. All compressible numbers are computable, but not all computable numbers are compressible. In addition there are some numbers, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant">Chaitin&#39;s constant</a>, that can be described simply but cannot be computed. I am not sure if these count as compressible, they are not algorithmically compressible but in some sense logically compressible.</p>
