    <h1>Tell HN: I probably spend more on piracy than if I just paid for content</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I have a confession, I pirate a lot of content. Mostly TV/Movies. That being said, piracy is pretty expensive.<p>I built a computer with ~30TB of hard drive space. That, conservatively, cost me $1200. It&#39;s an older computer, with a lot of hard drives and it&#39;s probably costing me around $45 per month in power. I&#39;m going to want to add more storage space soon, and have about $500 slated for that. I pay a usenet subscription, and subscription to indexers, for let&#39;s say $10 per month...</p><p>So if I stopped pirating I&#39;d have saved $1200 and still have a budget of $55 per month for streaming services.</p><p>So why do I still pirate? Well one thing is show availability. There are some must-have shows that simply aren&#39;t available in my region (not the US), so I already have to have the piracy infrastructure in place if I want to watch them.</p><p>I also very much appreciate having a local copy. It&#39;s not like steam where I can just download whatever I want and play it offline (I do mostly buy steam content, if it&#39;s on steam I probably don&#39;t bother to pirate).</p><p>Streaming services still have significant service problems that need to be addressed.</p></td></div></div>
