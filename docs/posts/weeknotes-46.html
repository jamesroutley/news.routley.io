<li>hey! welcome!</li>
<li>i haven&#39;t been practicing cycling, partly because of the weather, mostly because i&#39;m scared i&#39;ve forgotten everything. i might sign up for lessons through my work borough council as well and see if that kickstarts me.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been reading <em>the undersea network</em>. it&#39;s about subsea cables and so far i&#39;m really enjoying it. it&#39;s more academic in tone than i would strictly like, but hyperfocuses know no impediment!</li>
<li>my <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes blog</a> is back up! i&#39;m gonna try and &#34;append-mostly&#34; approach and try to avoid moving blogs wholesale from there to here, so it&#39;s less confusing and feels less disjointed to my brain. i may even link over there if it&#39;s been said already, oooh!</li>
<li>been finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_doubling">body doubling</a> really useful at the minute.</li>
<li><a href="https://olu.online/no">no</a> did numbers/went low-key viral for my level of readership, which was scary and cool and interesting to see! i don&#39;t think it&#39;ll lead to an ongoing bump in readership, so i think all i&#39;ve taken from the experience is that while &#34;ha ha, number go up&#34; is fun it may not translate into anything! i knew this on many levels, but now i know it in my bones.</li>
<li>i finally updated my <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai</a> page.</li>
<li>i also wrote about the <a href="https://olu.online/online-safety-act">online safety act</a>. next post in <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> is &#34;p&#34; so i&#39;m sticking with the zeitgeist and going for &#34;payments&#34;. should be up in the next week or so!</li>
<li>feeling a lot more interested in coding now i&#39;m more clear on my vision for my life a bit. i did a bunch of exercises, and i kind of wanted a more 10,000 foot &#34;whole life&#34; view and most of them focused on the next few years, so i gave into my teachers eventually lol. i think i do need more backend skills for the <a href="https://notes.olu.online/coding-stuff">coding stuff</a> i am most interested in, but there&#39;s also loads in ux/ui, css, accessibility and design to learn. pumped!</li>
<li>speaking of visions for the future, i might make a <a href="https://someday.page/">someday</a> and/or <a href="https://taylor.town/wish-manifesto">wishes</a> page, and generally try and think of a more sensible way to lay out all the various <a href="https://slashpages.net">slash pages</a>. some people have a sitemap or just link to the pages on the nearest relevant page, so maybe i&#39;ll have a load more links from my <a href="https://olu.online/about">about page</a>? we shall see. i also keep meaning to add a blogroll!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating figs with goat&#39;s cheese and prosciutto, roasted aubergines, lemon shortbread, as well as a bacon cheeseburger. i&#39;ve been drinking room temperature tap water, hot chocolate, and lots of yorkshire tea with whole oat milk.</li>
<li>see you next time maybe? have a beautiful week either way! ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
