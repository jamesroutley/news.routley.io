          <p><em>Research Scientist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute</em><br/></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/images/bio-photos/_squareThumb2x/Igor-Siwanowicz.jpg" width="120"/></p><p><a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/people/dr.-igor-siwanowicz">Igor Siwanowicz</a> began his career in biochemistry, but his love for animals and nature, and a desire to see the bigger picture, drove him to refocus his scientific discipline on neurobiology. This transition was facilitated by his expertise in invertebrate morphology, which he developed through macro photography. A confocal microscope became his key tool of trade, allowing for even more intimate insight into natural forms than a macro lens. Dr. Siwanowicz’s images have placed a total of <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/people/dr.-igor-siwanowicz">25 times in the Nikon Small World</a> and other scientific imaging competitions. In 2020, he received an award from the Royal Photographic Society for scientific imaging. For the past 10 years, Dr. Siwanowicz has been studying the anatomy and biomechanics of movement in invertebrates at the <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/organizations/howard-hughes-medical-institute-hhmi">Janelia Research Campus of Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> in Ashburn, Virginia.</p>
