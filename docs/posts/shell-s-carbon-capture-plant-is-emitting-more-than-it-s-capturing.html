Scotford refines oil from the Alberta tar sands.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But a <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/shell-hydrogen-true-emissions" target="_blank">new report </a>from human rights organization Global Witness found the hydrogen plant emitted 7.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in the same timeframe—including methane, which has<a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight" target="_blank"> 80 times the warming power</a> of carbon during its first 20 years in the atmosphere, and accounts for about a quarter of man-made warming today. </p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>To put that in perspective, the “climate-forward” part of the Scotford plant alone has the same <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88np3v/what-is-carbon-footprint-net-zero-greenwashing-emissions-guide">carbon footprint</a> per year as 1.2 million fuel-powered cars, Global Witness said. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We do think Shell is misleading the public in that sense and only giving us one side of the story,” said Dominic Eagleton, who wrote the report. He said industry’s been pushing for governments to subsidize the production of fossil hydrogen (hydrogen produced from natural gas) that’s supplemented with carbon capture technology as a “climate-friendly” way forward, but the new report shows that’s not the case. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In an email, Shell said the facility was introduced to display the merits of carbon capture technology, but didn’t directly respond to the allegation that its hydrogen component emitted 7.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Quest was originally designed as a demonstration project to prove (carbon capture) technology and overall has met or exceeded our expectations,” said Shell Canada spokesperson Stephen Doolan. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Doolan also said that as of today, Quest has captured 6 million tonnes of carbon, but Global Witness noted that as time passes and the facility captures more carbon, it will also emit more. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Quest is the world&#39;s first commercial-scale carbon capture facility and one of few like it around the world today. But Global Witness’ findings throw into question whether carbon capture and storage technologies are as green as oil companies claim, or whether they amount to “greenwashing.” Lately, industry players have been saying that carbon capture technology is a key component in reaching net-zero.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Shell has described the carbon capture facility at its Alberta plant as showing that carbon capture technology is an effective way of reducing carbon emissions, whereas our investigation shows that’s clearly not the case,” Eagleton said. “This should be a wake-up call for governments, not just in Canada, but across the world.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Quest has already inspired a separate carbon capture project <a href="https://www.shell.no/presserom/nyhetsoversikt-artikler-og-nyhetsarkiv/2020/historisk-investeringsbeslutning-for-transport-og-lagring-av-co2.html#eng" target="_blank">in Norway</a>, and <a href="https://www.shell.ca/en_ca/media/news-and-media-releases/news-releases-2021/shell-proposes-large-scale-ccs-facility-in-alberta.html" target="_blank">another </a>large-scale project in the Alberta Scotford facility. Meanwhile, Germany<a href="https://www.theenergymix.com/2022/01/19/germanys-massive-boost-for-hydrogen-leaves-out-fossil-derived-blue-variety/" target="_blank"> announced this week </a>that even though it’s opting to subsidize clean hydrogen, it won’t foot the bill for “blue hydrogen,” which uses fossil fuels during production and then sequesters carbon emissions using carbon capture technology (the same type of hydrogen production at Shell’s Scotford plant).  </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Global Witness’ report also notes that Canada’s federal and Alberta governments spent hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds—at least US$654 million—to pay for the billion-dollar Quest project.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Alberta’s Ministry of Energy declined to comment because it hadn’t yet seen the report.  </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Meanwhile, Canada’s Ministry of Natural Resources said they were unable to comment on the report, but Joanna Sivasankaran, the press secretary for the Minister of Natural Resources, said, “Carbon capture utilization and storage is not a silver bullet to the climate crisis but it is an important tool on the pathway to reaching Canada’s ambitious climate goals and reducing emissions in many industries, including oil and gas.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sivasankaran noted the government is currently developing a cap on emissions for the oil and gas sector as part of Canada’s strategy to hit net-zero by 2050. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5q573/the-worlds-only-coal-carbon-capture-plant-is-regularly-breaking">Motherboard reported last week</a> how Canada’s sole coal carbon capture plant keeps breaking.
