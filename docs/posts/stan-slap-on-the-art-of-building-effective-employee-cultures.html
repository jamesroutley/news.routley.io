Stan is also the author of two books: Under The Hood and Bury My Heart in Conference Room B.<br><br>This podcast dives into Slap&#x2019;s ideas about understanding, managing and shaping effective employee cultures. His model for culture is the first coherent model that I&apos;ve found that is useful and tested at scale; it is therefore more powerful than most other formulations of employee culture that you&apos;ll find.</p><p><em>Note: you may also read a </em><a href="https://commoncog.com/under-the-hood/"><em>summary of Stan&#x2019;s 2015 book Under The Hood</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkkLt05FUEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Stan Slap on the Art of Building Effective Employee Cultures"></iframe></figure><h2 id="podcast">Podcast</h2>
