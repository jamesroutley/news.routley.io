      <p>With so many twitter alternatives, the death of forums, the explosion of chats / video platforms and the reddit shenanigans, we are once again facing this decades old question.</p>
<p>So far, only Hacker News has stood the test of time, and you cannot really discuss random topics, it’s more about link sharing. “Ask HN” is not the main dish, so to speak, and the heavy curating that keeps the quality up also limit the volume of interactions by design. Lobster is basically a mini HN.</p>
<p>So where do you go when you want to geek out?</p>
