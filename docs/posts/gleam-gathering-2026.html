      <h2>About the Gathering</h2>
      <p>Welcome - you&#39;ve found the information hub for the Gleam Gathering 2026.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to register their interest in the Gathering. The feedback we
        got was insightful and honest, and we will listen to it as much as possible going forward with the event. And
        due to the volume of responses, we can confirm that GLEAM GATHERING 2026 IS A GO! We will be gathering on
        <strong> Saturday 21 February 2026 in Bristol, UK</strong>!
        We are truly honoured to announce our first keynote speaker: <strong>Louis Pilfold</strong>
        The interest forms made it clear that a key attraction would be seeing the main Gleamlin in person and he has
        kindly agreed to join us.

          <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Louis, the creator of the Gleam programming language, a friendly language for building type-safe
            systems that scale! It runs on the Erlang virtual machine, as well as on JavaScript runtimes. Most
            importantly, it has a lovely and vibrant community, so come say hi!</p>

      <h2>Venue</h2>
      <p>
        We are really excited to be hosting GG26 at Origin Workspace in the heart of Bristol. A co-working space during
        the week, Origin was built to encourage innovation and community.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I get there?</h3>
      <p>
        Bristol is a really well connected city, with lots of opportunities to use public transport.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Bus - there are National Express buses from London to the heart of Bristol</li>
        <li>Planes - Bristol Airport receives international flights and has great connections to the city</li>
        <li>Train - Bristol Temple Mead is the main train station - Origin is about a 30min walk from there. There&#39;s
          also a frequent local bus service between the station and the part of town Origin is in.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If taking the train anyone 30 years old or younger may be able to save 1/3 off a ticket price using a <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/railcards/national-railcards/">railcard</a>.

      <h2>ðŸŽ¤ Call for talks</h2>
      <p> Weâ€™re now accepting talk proposals for Gleam Gathering 2026. Whether youâ€™re an experienced speaker or new to
        presenting, we want to hear your ideas. This is your chance to contribute to the community, share knowledge, and
        inspire others. Gleam welcomes everyone and we want to ensure this is continued in the GG26.</p>
      <p>As this is a dedicated Gleam conference, we are targeting more technical, advanced talks. However, we want
        <strong>everyone</strong> to feel included, whether you&#39;re an old hand with Gleam or a newcomer.
        We will ensure that we have a section in the agenda for lightning talks, so if you think your talk would be
        better
        suited to that structure, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to sign up on the day.
      </p>

      <h2>What Weâ€™re Looking For</h2>
      <p>

        We welcome talks that are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are about Gleam. For our first Gathering, we want to be as heavily focused on Gleam as possible.</li>
        <li>About Gleam in production â€“ whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not, what have you discovered?</li>
        <li>Using Gleam to solve real world problems</li>
        <li>Pushing the use of Gleam to the extreme â€“ what novel approaches have you taken?</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- <p>
        What we arenâ€™t looking for this time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product/language update (we will have this covered, and we want your talks to demonstrate real innovation
          within the community)</li>
        <li>Beginner demos â€“ we absolutely welcome Gleam novices, but we will be diving into more detail in the long
          form talks. Please consider a lightning talk format if youâ€™d love to share anything on this topic.</li>
        <li>Keynotes (we are really fortunate to already have this one sorted)</li>
      </ul> -->

      <h2>Formats accepted:</h2>
      <p>Talks of either:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>30mins (20-25 min presentation with 5-10 min Q&amp;A session)</li>
        <li>45mins (30-35 min presentation with 10-15 min Q&amp;A session)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Organisers&#39; Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        Weâ€™re committed to supporting every speaker who submits a proposal. Hereâ€™s what you can expect from us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fair Review Process: All submissions will be reviewed by an anonymous committee of experienced speakers and
          Gleam users.</li>
        <li>Clear Communication: Youâ€™ll hear back from us whether your talk is accepted or not.</li>
        <li>Respect for Your Work: Your content remains your intellectual property. However, if you are selected as a
          speaker, we will be recording all sessions and making them available after the event.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Key Details</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submissions open: August 01 2025</li>

        <li>Deadline for submissions: Midnight UK time, 30 September 2025</li>

        <li>Notifications sent: 01 November 2025</li>

        <li>Event date: Saturday 21 February 2026</li>

        <li><strong>Can I submit more than one talk?</strong> Absolutely.</li>

        <li><strong>Should I buy a ticket if I submit a talk?</strong> Yes, all accepted speakers will be refunded the
          full ticket price.
          However it is helpful to have your place booked in the case your talk is not accepted and you still wish to
          attend?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Meet the organiser</h2>
      <p>Better known as Crowdhailer online, I&#39;ve been coding for over a decade. As an early contributor to Gleam, I&#39;ve
        always been excited about the possibilities that Gleam offered to the coding community
        and I&#39;m thrilled to be able to organise this event for the first time. When I am not using Gleam in production,
        I&#39;m working on my own language, EYG. Can&#39;t wait to see you all in Bristol.</p>
