        <p>You asked for it, and now you’ve got it. It’s taken more than a decade of accumulated complaining, but this gigantic 555 timer IC has finally gathered enough psychokinetic energy to take corporeal form and demand fealty from the readers of Hackaday.</p>
<p>Or not. The less exciting explanation is that creator [Rudraksha Vegad] was looking for a way to combine his interests in discrete electronic components and woodworking. The result is an incredible build that’s more than just a conversation starter; this <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/182863-giant-555-timer" target="_blank">desktop-sized version of the iconic integrated timer circuit is fully functional</a>. You can even hook it up to a breadboard, assuming you’ve got some alligator clips handy.</p>

He’s even gone through the trouble of recreating the symbols for the comparators and flip-flops that you’d see in a diagram of a 555 using wooden shapes to elevate their respective components. It might not fit the classical definition, but surely this must count as some form of circuit sculpture.</p>
<p>[Rudraksha] credits several other projects for not just inspiring him to create his own mega 555, but for helping him <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/06/17/modeling-the-classic-555-timer-on-a-breadboard/">wrap his head around the internal workings of everyone’s favorite IC</a>. Using components he salvaged from old hardware, he says the project ended up being very educational for him. These days, when most makers are more likely to reach for a microcontroller than a logic chip, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/10/26/simple-electronic-hacks-inspire-doing-more-with-less/">spending some quality time with transistors and passives can be quite illuminating</a>.</p>
