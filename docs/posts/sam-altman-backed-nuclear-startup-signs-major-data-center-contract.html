This comes on top of the revelation that, last month, Oklo signed to supply up to 500MW of power to another data center, Equinix. </span></p><p><span>&#34;Wyoming Hyperscale is building a data center campus on 58 acres of land,&#34; the report says. </span></p><p><span>Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo, commented: “As the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence increases, Oklo remains dedicated to providing clean, reliable, and affordable energy solutions to meet the needs of our data center partners.”</span></p><p><span>“Our partnership with Wyoming Hyperscale underscores our commitment to advancing sustainable energy practices and supporting high-efficiency operations within the data center industry.”</span></p><p><span>Trenton Thornock, founder of Wyoming Hyperscale, added: &#34;Our goal is to create data centers with minimal environmental impact. This collaboration with Oklo perfectly aligns with our vision for sustainable, efficient operations.
