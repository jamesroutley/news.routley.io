Release Songs
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
Every 6 months the OpenBSD project has the pleasure to release
our software with artwork and a matching song.
Theo and some other developers mutate a theme (from a classical
setting, a movie, or some genre) into the fishy world of Puffy, to
describe some advance, event or controversy the project went through
over the previous six months. To match the art released with the
historical CD sets, we joined up with some musicians we know to make
at least one song.

</p>

<p>
Three audio CDs have been made which contain approximately 5 years of songs each:

<p>
In 20 years of mitigating security issues, we&#39;ve encountered plenty of
resistance. Some upstream projects don&#39;t seem to care that their
software follows unsafe practices or sacrifice security in favor of
obsolete methods.  It takes sustained pressure to tear down the walls.

<p>
In Open Source philosophy, distinctions between progress or
backwards-compatibility, along with other dichotomous API judgments,
are vendor choice, not user; so, the duality of profit and control is
an indivisible whole. In the ethics of OpenBSD on the other hand, most
notably in the philosophy of Theo de Raadt (c. 21st century AD), a
moral dimension is attached to the idea of stagnation and advancement.

morality like none other, one name rings true. Puffiana Jones, famed
hackologist and adventurer!

the steely grip of greed. Many a villain has he pummeled, many a vile
vendor has he thwarted, countless thugs, lawyers and kitties abound.

Hello, I would like to buy a CARP license please.
</dd><dt>
</dt><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
A what?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
A license for my network redundancy protocol, CARP.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Well, it&#39;s free isn&#39;t it?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Exactly, the protocol&#39;s name is CARP.  CARP the redundancy protocol.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
What?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
He is an.... redundancy protocol.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
CARP is a free redundancy protocol!
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Yes, I chose it out of three, I didn&#39;t like the others,
they were all too... encumbered.  And now I must license it!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
You must be a looney.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
I am not a looney!  Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely
because I wish to protect my redundancy protocol?  I&#39;ve heard tell
that Network Associates has a pet algorithm called RSA used in IETF
standards, and you wouldn&#39;t call them a looney; Geoworks has a claim
on WAP, after what their lawyers do to you if you try to implement it.
Cisco has two redundant patents, both encumbered, and Cadtrack has a
patent on cursor movement!  So, if you&#39;re calling the large American
companies that fork out millions of dollars for the use of XOR a
bunch of looneys, I shall have to ask you to step outside!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Alright, alright, alright.  A license.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Yes.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
For a free redundancy protocol?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Yes.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
You are a looney.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Look, it allows for bleeding redundancy doesn&#39;t it? Cisco&#39;s got a
patent for the HSRP, and I&#39;ve got to get a license for me router
VRRP.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
You don&#39;t need a license for your VRRP.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
I bleeding well do and I got one.  It can&#39;t be called VRRP without it.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
There&#39;s no such thing as a bloody VRRP license.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Yes there is!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Isn&#39;t!
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Is!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Isn&#39;t!
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
I bleeding got one, look!  What&#39;s that then?
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
This is a Cisco HSRP patent document with the word &#34;Cisco&#34; crossed
out and the word &#34;IETF&#34; written in crayon.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
The man didn&#39;t have the right form.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
What man?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Robert Barr, the man from the redundancy detector van.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
The looney detector van, you mean.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Look, it&#39;s people like you what cause unrest.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
What redundancy detector van?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
The redundancy detector van from the Monopoly of Cizzz-coeee.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Cizzz-coeee?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
It was spelt like that on the van.  I&#39;m very observant!  I never seen
so many bleeding aerials.  The man said that their equipment could
pinpoint a failover configuration at 400 yards!  And my Cisco router,
being such a flappy bat, was a piece of cake.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
How much did you pay for that?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Sixty quid, and twenty grand for the PIX.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
What PIX?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
The PIX I&#39;m replacing!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
So you&#39;re replacing your PIX with free software, and yet you want to
license it?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
There&#39;s nothing so odd about that. I&#39;m sure they patented this
protocol too.  After all, the IETF had a hand in it!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
No they didn&#39;t!
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Did!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Didn&#39;t!
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Did, did, did and did!
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
Oh, all right.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Spoken like a gentleman, sir.  Now, are you going to give me a CARP
license?
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
I promise you that there is no such thing.  You don&#39;t need one.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
In that case, give me a Firewall License.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
A license?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Yes.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
For your firewall?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
No.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
No?
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
No, half my firewall.  It had an accident.
</dd><dt>Licenser:
</dt><dd>
You&#39;re off your chump.
</dd><dt>Customer:
</dt><dd>
Look, if you intend by that utilization of an obscure colloquialism
to imply that my sanity is not entirely up to scratch, or indeed to deny the
semi-existence of my little half firewall, I shall have to ask you to
listen to this!  Take it away CARP the orchestra leader!
