    <h1>HAProxy is not affected by the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE-2023-44487)</h1>

            <p>The vulnerability <a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a> found in the HTTP/2 protocol could allow a denial of service attack against web servers, reverse proxies, or other software processing HTTP/2 traffic.</p><p>We are following the developments of this situation, but have concluded that our products are not affected. Specifically, our products are safeguarded by code developed in HAProxy 1.9, released in 2018. This applies to HAProxy, HAProxy Enterprise, HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller, and HAProxy ALOHA. After rigorous testing, we have been able to confirm that our implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol can handle the Rapid Reset Attack without increasing the resource usage or compromising the parallelism of the protocol. We will continue to test and monitor, but the supported versions of our products are not vulnerable to the known attack vectors.</p><p>We will update this blog post with further news as it develops. Our customers can rest assured that we always develop our products with resource optimization in mind, which in this case explains why we are unaffected by the CPU issues.</p>
