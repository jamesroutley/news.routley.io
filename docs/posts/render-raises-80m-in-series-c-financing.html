    <h1>Render raises $80M in Series C financing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span>Today marks two significant milestones in Render&#39;s journey: we’ve surpassed <strong>2 million developers</strong> on the platform and added <strong>$80M in Series C financing</strong>, bringing our total funding to <strong>$157M</strong>. The round was led by Georgian, with participation from 01A, avra, and our existing investors, Addition, Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and the South Park Commons Fund.</span></p><h2>The cloud infrastructure tax</h2>
<p><span>The best teams win by focusing on their product’s core innovation. Yet, most struggle to maintain focus today because they face an impossible choice with cloud infrastructure. They can either use legacy, simplistic cloud platforms that fail to scale and constrain their technical choices. Or, they can dedicate substantial resources to managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure on public clouds, burning through precious time and capital and delaying time to market.</span>
<span>I started Render in 2019 with a radical premise: <strong>existing cloud infrastructure was fundamentally broken, and engineering teams deserved better</strong>.</span>
<span>As the fifth engineer at Stripe in 2011, I saw this firsthand. Our small team of world-class engineers was forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time building and managing cloud infrastructure on AWS because legacy platforms like Heroku were insufficient. We paid the price in reduced focus and velocity on our core products. After leaving Stripe, I observed multiple startups (including mine) make the same impossible choice. I decided to build Render to make the choice obvious.</span></p><h2>What makes Render different</h2>
<p><span>Fast forward a few years, and over 2 million developers have now chosen Render because we make powerful, modern, and flexible infrastructure accessible to everyone.</span>
<span>Developers have embraced Render because of our relentless focus on balancing flexibility and ease of use. We believe in empowering teams with the freedom to build applications their way, without limiting their architecture choices. Whether you&#39;re building a simple web app or a complex multi-service system, Render’s language and framework-agnostic platform adapts to your application needs.</span>
<span>The proof is in our word-of-mouth growth and the <strong>100,000+ developers who sign up for Render every month</strong>. Teams ranging from best-in-class startups to large enterprises trust Render to power their most innovative new products.</span>
<span>Render&#39;s platform has already proven its ability to help teams innovate faster and achieve rapid growth. Unicorn startups like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bridge.xyz"><span><span></span><span><span>Bridge</span></span></span><span></span></a> seized their window of opportunity by building on Render.</span></p><div><p>“</p><blockquote><p><span>From day one, Render’s Docker-based environment and automated blue-green deployments allowed us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day. Their platform delivers the perfect combination of simplicity and power – handling the complex infrastructure pieces while allowing our engineering team to focus on delivering business value for our customers. I’d recommend every startup build on Render.</span></p></blockquote></div>
