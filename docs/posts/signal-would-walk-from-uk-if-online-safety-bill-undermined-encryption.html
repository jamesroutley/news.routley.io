Signal president Meredith Whittaker told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government said its proposal was not &#34;a ban on end-to-end encryption&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The bill, introduced by Boris Johnson, is currently going through Parliament.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Critics say companies could be required by Ofcom to scan messages on encrypted apps for child sexual abuse material or terrorism content under the new law.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This has worried firms whose business is enabling private, secure communication.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Element, a UK company whose customers include the Ministry of Defence, told the BBC the plan would cost it clients.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Previously, WhatsApp has told the BBC it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-62291328">would refuse</a> to lower security for any government.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Magical-thinking"><span role="text">&#39;Magical thinking&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government, and prominent child protection charities have long argued that encryption hinders efforts to combat online child abuse - which they say is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64415015">a growing problem</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is important that technology companies make every effort to ensure that their platforms do not become a breeding ground for paedophiles,&#34; the Home Office said in a statement.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It added &#34;The Online Safety Bill does not represent a ban on end-to-end encryption but makes clear that technological changes should not be implemented in a way that diminishes public safety - especially the safety of children online.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is not a choice between privacy or child safety - we can and we must have both.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Child protection charity the NSPCC said in reaction to Signal&#39;s announcement: &#34;Tech companies should be required to disrupt the abuse that is occurring at record levels on their platforms, including in private messaging and end-to-end encrypted environments.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the digital rights campaigners the Open Rights Group said it highlighted how the bill threatened to &#34;undermine our right to communicate securely and privately&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Signal</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Signal messages are protected by end-to-end encryption</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Ms Whittaker told the BBC it was &#34;magical thinking&#34; to believe we can have privacy &#34;but only for the good guys&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She added: &#34;Encryption is either protecting everyone or it is broken for everyone.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said the Online Safety Bill &#34;embodied&#34; a variant of this magical thinking.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Signal has had over 100 million app downloads on the Google store alone. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It uses end-to-end encryption, a system where messages are scrambled so that even the company operating the service cannot read them. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Operated by a Californian based not-for-profit organisation, the app&#39;s users include journalists, activists and politicians.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>WhatsApp also uses end-to-end encryption, as does Apple&#39;s iMessage system and optionally Facebook and Telegram.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Apple had proposed a system where messages sent from phones and other devices would be scanned for child abuse images before being encrypted but abandoned the plans following a backlash.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Called client-side scanning, some have said this is the approach that tech firms may end up having to use - but critics argue it effectively undermines the point of encryption.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It would in effect turn everyone&#39;s phone into a &#34;mass surveillance device that phones home to tech corporations and governments and private entities&#34;, Ms Whittaker said.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Privacy-promises"><span role="text">&#39;Privacy promises&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Whittaker said &#34;back doors&#34; to enable the scanning of private messages would be exploited by &#34;malignant state actors&#34; and &#34;create a way for criminals to access these systems&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Asked if the Online Safety Bill could jeopardise their ability to offer a service in the UK, she told the BBC: &#34;It could, and we would absolutely 100% walk rather than ever undermine the trust that people place in us to provide a truly private means of communication.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We have never weakened our privacy promises, and we never would.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Element</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Matthew Hodgson, chief executive of Element</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Matthew Hodgson chief executive of Element, a British secure communications company, said the threat of mandated scanning alone would cost him clients.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He argued that customers would assume any secure communication product that came out of the UK would &#34;necessarily have to have backdoors in order to allow for illegal content to be scanned&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It could also result in &#34;a very surreal situation&#34; where a government bill might undermine security guarantees given to customers at the MoD and other sensitive areas of government, he added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He also said the firm might have to cease offering some services.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Child-safety"><span role="text">Child safety</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Whittaker said: &#34;There&#39;s no-one who doesn&#39;t want to protect children,&#34; adding: &#34;Some of the stories that are invoked are harrowing.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When asked how she would respond to arguments that encryption protects abusers, Ms Whittaker said she believed that most abuse took place in the family and in the community - where she argued the focus of efforts to stop it should be.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She pointed to a paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2210/2210.08958.pdf">by Professor Ross Anderson</a>, which argued for better funding of services working in child protection and warned that &#34;the idea that complex social problems are amenable to cheap technical solutions is the siren song of the software salesman&#34;.</p></div></article></div></div>
