<li> Consistent branch naming conventions.</li>
<li> Clear documentation of repository structure.</li>
<li> Secrets are not part of the commit history or made public. (see <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-integration/dev-sec-ops/secret-management/credential_scanning/">Credential scanning</a>)</li>
<li> Public repositories follow the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/#creating-a-new-repository">OSS guidelines</a>, see <code>Required files in default branch for public repositories</code>.</li>
