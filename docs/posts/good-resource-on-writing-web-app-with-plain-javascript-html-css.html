    <h1>Ask HN: Good resource on writing web app with plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.</p><p>I just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.</p><p>When I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.</p><p>I want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.</p></div></td></div></div>
