            <p><em>VisiCalc </em>on the Apple II. <em>Lotus 1-2-3 </em>on the IBM PC. <em>Aldus PageMaker </em>on the Macintosh. <em>Deluxe Paint </em>on the Amiga. The computer industry loves a “killer app,” that unique piece of software that compels consumers to purchase new computer hardware just for the privilege of running it. I can personally attest to <em>Deluxe Paint </em>as it compelled even my technophobic mother to buy into its potential.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Deluxe-Paint-I--1986--Electronic-Arts--a-_004-1.png" alt="The interface for Deluxe Paint III, featuring the famous pixel art rendition of the golden, bejeweled King Tutenkhamen death mask." loading="lazy" width="651" height="413" srcset="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/Deluxe-Paint-I--1986--Electronic-Arts--a-_004-1.png 600w, https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Deluxe-Paint-I--1986--Electronic-Arts--a-_004-1.png 651w"/><figcaption><span>THE picture, by Avril Harrison.

I, a teen with less than zero interest in quilting or fabric or being seen with a parent, wandered into the computer store a few doors down to lust over the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/21138-mad-max-fury-road-black-and-white-and-chrome-george-miller?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">black and chrome</a> Ataris. Maybe this would be the day I finally saw an Atari 1450XLD in the wild! I was obsessed with the futuristic stylings of that line; they looked <strong><em>powerful</em></strong>. I would get some <strong><em>serious work done</em></strong>. That specific device never released, but what I found instead changed my life.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/6d7beab0-b45c-41d3-976a-377e3eb7429f_600x459-1.webp" alt="A prototype Atari 1450XLD.

Ah, who am I kidding? I still want one!</span></figcaption></figure><p>The salesman really didn&#39;t have to work too hard that day. So much of the demo of the Commodore Amiga (not yet called the 1000) left us in awe, but it was the art and color-cycle animations in <em>Deluxe Paint</em> that sealed the deal. The decision was made to upgrade the family computer from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Adam?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ADAM</a> to the Amiga.</p><p>Though it was my first experience with a mouse, I was pushing pixels around like I was born to it. As I learned the way of the pixel, I remember feeling clever when I devised a way to smooth hard pixel edges (“anti-aliasing,” I later learned) and to checkerboard two colors to simulate a new color (“dithering,” I later learned). </p><p>Those who used <em>Deluxe Paint </em>continue to chase its high. Would-be successors to its pixel-art throne come and go, but none have clicked in quite the same way. Let&#39;s see if a re-connection is possible with my old love after. . .</p><p><em>(I feel physical pain writing these words)</em></p><hr/><h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/dpaint_release_timeline_10-1-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="979" height="2421" srcset="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/dpaint_release_timeline_10-1-1.jpg 600w, https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/09/dpaint_release_timeline_10-1-1.jpg 979w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><hr/><h2 id="my-testing-rig">My Testing Rig</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.winuae.net/download/?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><em>WinUAE</em> </a>v6.0.0 (2025.07.02) 64-bit on Windows 11<ul><li>Emulating an NTSC Amiga 1000<ul><li>512KB Chip RAM, 512KB Fast RAM</li><li>68000 CPU, 24-bit addressing, no FPU, no MMU, cycle-exact emulation</li></ul></li><li>Kickstart 1.3 / Workbench 1.3.5 HDF (from <a href="https://www.amigaforever.com/?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>Amiga Forever</em></a>)</li><li>Windows directory mounted as my “hard drive” which makes it trivial to access the images I create from Windows</li></ul></li><li><em>Deluxe Paint III</em> v3.25</li></ul><p><em>Deluxe Paint III</em> was my last personal experience with the program and was the last version creator Dan Silva developed, so that’s the version I’ve chosen to examine.

A slim vertical column, it&#39;s neatly packed with the tools you’ll spend nearly all of your time in: brushes plain and dotted, shapes filled and unfilled, airbrush, text, magnification, and my personal favorite &#34;symmetry.&#34; Most are summonable by keyboard, even mid-stroke. When present, the UI never feels like an obstruction, but it gives way by <strong>F10</strong> for a full-screen canvas, or politely steps aside by <strong>F9</strong>, hiding but not disabling the menu bar.</p><p>The default color palette stokes some dormant ember of love that I realize now will smoulder until my death bed. It&#39;s been 40 years, I should have moved on. I thought I had! But feeling again the precise, silky movement of the brush confirms that all future loves will be (fairly or not) compared against <em>Deluxe Paint</em>.</p><p>As I play around exploring the tools, I do wish I/O polling of the mouse were better. Swiftly-drawn curves are flattened out into a series of discrete lines which only approximate my motion. If I wanted to lay down large washes, I would want fast, perfect, full-screen brush motions. I don&#39;t typically work that way, so my personal drawing needs are well-met.</p><p>I see demonstrable lag in certain brush effects, however. A fat brush in symmetry mode requires slow, precise movements to let the system &#34;catch up.&#34; The “smear” effect is similarly slow, especially considering it just push-scatters pixels along the brush stroke (the 32-color palette can&#39;t actually &#34;mix&#34; colors). Combining those into “symmetry smear” just combines the slowness.</p><p>Clearly we’re at the boundary of what a 68000 CPU @7.16MHz system can pull off with finesse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Original_Chip_Set?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">even with Denise&#39;s assistance</a>. That said, even if the system struggles it doesn&#39;t fail. <em>*knock on wood* </em>Perhaps a virtual CPU upgrade is in order.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Guru_meditation4.png" alt="The Amiga&#39;s &#34;Guru Meditation&#34; crash alert.

Mixing colors, RGB vs HSV, &#34;spreads&#34; (gradients), &#34;ranges&#34; (a set of contiguous palette colors, for flood fill and color-cycling), and other palette manipulations. I&#39;m struck how <em>Deluxe Paint</em>&#39;s UX feels somehow more &#34;color-centric&#34; than current software. For example, here&#39;s how gradients are built.</p><ul><li><em>Deluxe Paint </em>: select a start color, click &#34;Spread&#34;, click an end color</li><li><em>Affinity Photo</em>: select a pre-built gradient, adjust colors in a gradient designer</li></ul><p>Generating a spread just redefines the colors in our palette. There is no relationship between the colors, other than visually. This is great for mixing up new colors, but spreads are made more useful by &#34;ranges.&#34;</p><p>A color “range” is a user-defined contiguous subset of palette colors which has an associated dithering, speed, and direction. Perhaps you’ve seen the color-cycle animations of <a href="http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mark Ferrari</a>? (Perhaps you’re an <em>Aseprite </em>user who has been <a href="https://community.aseprite.org/t/color-cycling-effect/4137/27?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">patiently waiting since 2019 </a>for color-cycling to be added?) The clever application of colors within a range can produce pleasing color-cycle animation effects.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/media/2025/08/beach_color_cycle_example_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><p>Any brush that does flood-fill can flood-fill with a range. One option forced me to check if it exists in <em>Affinity Photo </em>(it does not). Linear gradient has horizontal fill and horizontal line fill. Horizontal line fill scales the gradient per horizontal line, so each line begins and ends with the start and end colors of the spread. Now we can draw “realistic spheres!” (I guess &#34;realism&#34; had a looser definition back then.)</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-26-215932-1.png" alt="Two circles filled with a white to dark blue gradient, left to right.

Until I started doing this I hadn’t really internalized how much the Adobe-ification (Microsoft-ification?) of palettes and panels and toolbars and menu options which open entirely other screens of UI panels and toolbars and menus has frozen the evolution of creativity software. The UI chrome of modern products suddenly feels boxy and oppressive, and I find my emotional approach to that software reflects the same rigidity.</p><p><a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/electronic-arts-deluxepaint-early-source-code/?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Dan Silva once told the Computer History Museum</a></p><blockquote>“The first version of Deluxe Paint that I got going on the Amiga had no menus. I basically got the skeleton of the program going, and it was all keystrokes. You could do anything. The first paintings on that program were done by Avril Harrison (she of the Tut image). As I recall she did them without any menus, using the PICK command to pick colors out of the screen, and it worked fine.”</blockquote><p>I’d like to just sit with that thought a moment. The first version of <em>Deluxe Paint </em>had no menus; it was all keystrokes and it worked fine. A keyboard-friendly mindset continues into <em>Deluxe Paint III. </em>Its robust keyboard controls allow the artist to switch up drawing tools on the fly without having to mouse back over to a toolbar.</p><p>Mind you, I’m not lamenting how things “should have” turned out. I’m not angrily shaking my fist at the clouds, onions tied to my belt, “We’re doing it all wrong!&#34;</p><p>However, I think there is a kernel of knowledge in there about software’s relationship to the artist that is under-explored. The common cry “artists are visual people” discredits artists as being somehow incapable of learning software which doesn&#39;t shove every tool, option, and setting into their faces at all times. Basically, I’m not convinced a cockpit of controls is the best UI for making art.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/31963799064_a845caf9c8_o-561010810.jpg" alt="Hundreds of gauges, switches, buttons, and knobs fill one small part of an airplane cockpit.

The manual is from the 80s, so are pastel triangles with neon squiggles, the &#34;giant shoulder pads&#34; of graphic design, coming our way? Well, we’re here for the software, not to pass judgement on the times. Full steam ahead!</p><p><em>Deluxe Paint </em>has the concept of a “brush.” I say that like you&#39;ve never seen a brush before, but it is a very core object upon which a lot of <em>Deluxe Paint</em>&#39;s advanced functionality rests. Simply put, a brush is an arbitrary selection of pixels. You can freeform paint with it, use it to draw shapes, or just click around stamping down copies.</p><p>Brushes may be modified by applying irreversible transformations. This is the point of the review where I say a silent prayer of thanks to Monsieurs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Casteljau?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Casteljau </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bezier</a> and whomever developed unlimited undo. Low resolution logos with aggressive transformations applied can quickly degenerate into a heap of pixels that resemble the original only if we squint and agree to the fiction.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-27-114054.png" alt="A logo for a fictional company called &#34;ARCH&#34; it features a great arch logo next to red letters spelling &#34;ARCH&#34;.

A rough starting point for sculpting something beautiful, though it could be done.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Multi-color brushes can be used as single-color in &#34;Color&#34; mode, great for laying down pixel-perfect drop shadows. Colors in a brush can be swapped or replaced to quickly experiment with new color combinations. You can &#34;Outline&#34; the brush in the current background color, but the effect is weak, and there are easy, manual ways to produce better results.</p><h3 id="not-quite-masking-not-quite-layers">Not quite masking, not quite layers</h3><p>Part three of the tutorial digs into a very cool feature: stenciling. You know it as masking, but with indexed colors it works a little differently. We can lock specific colors of our palette to prevent them from being affected by any further paint or fill effects. It’s quite satisfying to see thin strokes being pixel-perfect filled with a dithered gradient leaving the background untouched.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-27-193823-1.png" alt="Deluxe Paint 3 interface showing a white-on-black scribble done in radial symmetry, giving it a shade of &#34;tribal tattoo&#34; energy.

On top of that I drew a rectangle with a dithered rainbow gradient fill, shown mid-fill. Sometimes the slowness of operations is meditative, not irritating.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Stenciling is shown as a real-time composite effect, which feels like magic for a system from 1985. If I have a big, multi-color brush loaded it will peek through unstenciled colors, and hide behind stencils without lag. It’s awesome.</p><p>Then, a big secret is revealed. While we have been working on this canvas, there has been a second blank canvas waiting for us the entire time. Press <code>j</code> to “jump” between the two. Use one as a scratchpad, use the second for your artwork proper. Or just draw two pictures? Stamp a copy of your brush down in one, transform it in the other. The program continues to reveal its depth.</p><p>In addition to locking individual colors, we can also lock the entire image, defining it as our background. Once set, &#34;Clear&#34; on the canvas reverts back to that locked image, like a permanent underpainting. With the background locked, we can paint on top then lock <em>those </em>pixels as the &#34;foreground.&#34;</p><p>Having now locked both the background and the foreground, what happens when we try to paint? What other ground is there? Some kind of. . . middle?. . . ground? No, that word isn’t even in the manual. I guess I could try it and. . .<em>GASP</em>!</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-27-144626.png" alt="A beachscape image, with water coming up to a rocky shore at dusk.

Even if there had only been three (fore, middle, back), <em>Deluxe Paint </em>could have beaten <em>Fractal Design Painter </em>to the punch. Marvel must surely have a multiverse where that happened.</p><h3 id="lost-in-translation">Lost in translation</h3><p>The tutorial ends with the 3D perspective tools. I remember back in the day being amazed at anything resembling 3D perspective on the computer screen. Even the mundane runway numbers on the tarmac in <em>Flight Simulator </em>seemed like impossible magic.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/flight_simulator_ii_01-1-1-1-1.png" alt="Cropped screenshot out the cockpit window in Flight Simulator 2 for the Amiga.

I refuse to feel shame for that.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Trying to follow along with the perspective tutorial is proving difficult. The steps required to use it smoothly are complicated, though it is still a neat trick. <code>SHIFT + Keypad #</code> is used to apply a 3D rotation to the brush. For example, <code>SHIFT + Keypad 8</code> spins the brush backward on the X-axis, which gives us a quick and dirty (emphasis dirty) <em>Star Wars </em>text crawl effect.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/07/star_wars_text_crawl.png" alt="Text in &#34;Star Wars opening crawl&#34; effect in two comparison screenshots.

Then, one day, a foolhardy Gen-Xer published a blog that is decidedly NOT about games!&#34; The lefthand image shows the text rotation with no aliasing, rendering some words illegible.

Time, of course! 5.7sec vs. 4min 28sec</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brush movement is handled by mouse for X and Y, and <code>:</code> <code>“</code> for Z. Rotation is handled by keypad. <code>SHIFT</code> allows coarse steps with the keyboard control. <code>ALT + mouse</code> moves forward/backward through Z-space. There are tools for setting the horizon line, changing angle calculations, determining 3D relativity (screen space vs object space, which can be separate for movement and rotation), setting a grid for fixed-space snapping, setting the anchor point of the brush around which transformations occur, and more. It’s overwhelming and doesn’t feel coalesced around a solid vision of “how to control objects in 3D space.”</p><p>My love feels a first twinge of betrayal.</p><p>Working with this tool is not <em>pleasurable</em>. Often, a 3D movement results in a coarse, jerky response that is visually hard to read and when it&#39;s done I can&#39;t immediately understand the current state of the brush. Even the example image provided on disk to show off the feature is lame. It’s a lot of training and learning for a small payout. A novelty.  </p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/08/Hall-of-Stars_result-1.png" alt="A relatively garish image of pixel art scaled and rotated into position to form a room interior.

Forget what I said before about betrayal! I&#39;m sorry, I should never have doubted you <em>Deluxe Paint</em>. You&#39;re awesome!</p><p>At its most basic usage animation is just a flip-book. Set a number of frames (memory permitting!), draw on each frame (keyboard control for stepping forward and back), then play those frames back in sequence. It&#39;s a simple, easy to navigate animation method.</p><p>“Animpainting” auto-steps the frames while you draw. You can do something akin to &#34;puppeteering&#34; a brush. Take a “ball” brush, move to frame 1, hold down <code>Left-Amiga</code> (left ALT on a non-Amiga keyboard) and start drawing. As you draw, the brush paints itself across frames. Played back, your brush movement has defined the animation movement. </p><p>The relatively complex “Move” tool lets you precisely define a rudimentary motion path across a desired number of frames. Using the oddly-named “Dist” and “Angle” settings, you numerically define the position and orientation in 3D space where the brush should appear in the final frame.</p><p>This is a slow process, so thankfully we can “Preview” the motion as a wireframe before committing to a render. When satisfied, “Draw” will go frame by frame, moving, rendering, and frame-stepping your brush automatically. This single-handedly sold me on the Perspective tool I soured on earlier.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/media/2025/07/door_to_mystery_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><h3 id="a-brush-with-greatness">A brush, with greatness</h3><p>Where &#34;animpainting&#34; captures your brush across frames, &#34;anim brush&#34; captures animation frames as a brush. As you move, the brush steps through its own frames, animating while you paint. These ideas can be combined into &#34;animpainting with an anim brush&#34; such that each frame of your brush is applied in turn to each frame of the canvas. In this way you can animate (say) a bird flying along any arbitrary path by simply painting a brush stroke. The brush stroke is your animation path.</p><p>&#34;anim brushes&#34; can be used in conjunction with other tools the same as any other brush can. Turn on airbrush and we can have &#34;airbrushed animpainting with anim brushes.&#34; Then, turn on symmetrical drawing to get &#34;symmetrical airbrushed animpainting with anim brushes.&#34; Then turn on color-cycling to get &#34;color-cycled symmetrical airbrushed animpainting with anim brushes.&#34;</p><p>Consider something as simple as drawing in symmetry mode, then applying fills. In <em>Deluxe Paint </em>we can combine our tools into a &#34;symmetry gradient flood-fill&#34; and flood-fill multiple areas symmetrically, simultaneously. In <em>Affinity Photo </em>&#34;symmetry,&#34; &#34;gradient,&#34; and &#34;flood fill&#34; are three utterly discrete tools that do not interact with one another. Have I beaten my point to death yet?</p><p>I wonder if an overly developer-centric approach to modern software design has locked us into this &#34;one tool at a time&#34; mindset. Keeping tools independent and discrete must surely make it easier for Adobe to add features year-over-year. (argue in the comments if that is &#34;good&#34; or even &#34;necessary&#34;). Need a new tool? Just cram another button into one of the panels, slap an adjustment slider on it, and Bob&#39;s your uncle.</p><p>But returning to <em>Deluxe Paint </em>after all these decades, I understood something I hadn&#39;t realized before. Its tools don&#39;t just coexist, they <em>collaborate </em>with one another. It feels akin to an artist cobbling together a unique tool from stuff lying about the studio.</p><p>As the artist using them, I feel similar collaboration between <em>Deluxe Paint </em>and myself. My sense of creative exploration is encouraged. I’m encouraged to play, not just follow procedure.</p><p>My mid-range laptop today is some 50,000x (?) more powerful than that Amiga, yet the laptop’s power seems almost exclusively funneled toward the mechanical goals of speed, scale, and rigid precision. I humbly suggest we&#39;re overdue in turning that power back to humanistic goals like play, intuition, and surprise.</p><p><em>Deluxe Paint</em> still holds up, admirably so in fact. Using it again after all these decades, it remains one of the purest forms of digital expression I think I&#39;ve ever used. It was a genuine pleasure to reconnect with this beautiful software.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2025/08/arch_before_and_after.png" alt="The same distorted ARCH logo from before sits above a vastly improved version.
