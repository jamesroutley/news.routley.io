    <h1>Car Bloat: “Huge Cars Are Terrible for Society”</h1>

<p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davidzipper/110843841107933007">did a big thread on Mastodon</a> (and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidzipper.bsky.social/post/3k4a4elm25e2p">Bluesky</a>) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it&#39;s bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper&#39;s points:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person&#39;s torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.</p></blockquote>

<p>For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he&#39;s written in recent months: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90854942/the-blatant-greenwashing-of-suvs">The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/electric-vehicles-tires-wearing-out-particulates/674750/">EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">Carry That Weight</a>, and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy</a>. Zipper&#39;s solution to these problems is government action: for example, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/electric-cars-hummer-ev-tax-fees-weight-joe-biden.html">taxing vehicles by weight</a>, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver&#39;s licenses for larger vehicles.</p>
