<p>Under current German law, the <strong>nation’s three remaining reactors</strong> – totaling 4.1 GW in capacity – are <strong><a href="https://climatechangedispatch.com/germany-votes-shutter-last-three-nuclear-plants-coal-instead/">due to close by the end of the year</a>. </strong>[bold, links added]</p>

<p>But there is growing pressure on the government in Berlin, including by the Free Democrats – part of the coalition government – <strong>to extend the reactors’ lifetimes to help the nation save needed gas.</strong></p>
<p>“In a crisis, you have to decide appropriate to the situation and <strong>based on clear facts</strong>,” ministry spokeswoman Beate Baron told reporters regarding the lifetime debate over the three reactors – Isar 2 (1.4 GW), Emsland (1.4 GW), and Neckarwestheim 2 (1.3 GW).</p>
<p>In its assessment, the German government will focus on southern parts of the country, especially in Bavaria where there are <strong>very few coal-fired units</strong> to replace gas ones and where the state’s government has <strong>hindered wind power expansion</strong> over the past years, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>Germany’s <a href="https://climatechangedispatch.com/germany-moves-to-shut-down-8-5gw-of-baseload-nuclear-energy/">nuclear phase-out</a> was prompted by <a href="https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-german-syndrome-far-left-govt-calls-nuclear-power-dangerous/">Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power disaster</a> in 2011.</p>

<p>But Russia’s war on Ukraine since February has <a href="https://climatechangedispatch.com/european-natural-gas-prices-surge-after-russia-withholds-extra-supply/">spiked gas prices</a> and seen <strong>reduced flows from Europe’s main supplier of natural gas.</strong></p>
<p>Also, there are concerns that the key <strong>Russian-owned Nord Stream 1</strong> <strong>pipeline</strong> linked to Germany will not restart or will operate at significantly reduced capacity after <strong>planned maintenance</strong> ends on Thursday, raising doubt about whether <strong>Europe can refill its gas storage</strong> to levels needed ahead of winter.</p>
<p>The government is currently running a second “stress test” for the winter, <strong>expecting fewer gas volumes available</strong> and <strong>more nuclear outages</strong> in <a href="https://climatechangedispatch.com/europes-energy-crisis-forcing-france-to-nationalize-largest-power-company/">neighboring France</a> than in the first round in May with gas prices above the previously modeled EUR 200/MWh level, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>In France, <strong>nuclear availability</strong> is currently at 24.8 GW, <strong>less than half the installed capacity</strong> of 61.4 GW due to<strong> safety checks at several reactors.</strong></p>
<p>In May, operator <strong>EDF cut its nuclear output target</strong> for this year to the <strong>lowest level in 34 years.</strong></p>
<p>In the first stress test in spring, the <strong>German government</strong> pointed out that <strong>nuclear units</strong> would <strong>hardly help to save gas</strong> as gas demand in Germany was mainly <strong>driven by heat production and industrial use.</strong></p>
