Staffers in India will be notified next week, while timing in other regions is dependent on local regulations, Rausch said.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/amazon-cost-cuts-under-andy-jassy-reflect-new-reality-after-25-years.html">has been in cost-cutting mode</a> since last year as the company reckons with an economic downturn and slowing growth in its core retail business. The company initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs, and axed many of its more unprofitable initiatives. Amazon previously cut employees <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/amazon-lays-off-some-devices-employees-read-the-memo.html">in its devices and services division</a>, which includes Alexa.</p><p>Since its launch in 2014, Amazon has made big investments in Alexa and assigned top talent to grow the technology, largely at the direction of Jeff Bezos, who first pitched Alexa and strongly believed voice would play a key role in how people interact with computers in the future. At one point, Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/27/amazon-has-5000-people-on-echo-and-alexa-more-than-fitbit-and-gopro.html">had 5,000 people</a> working on Alexa and Echo.</p><p>Alexa and digital assistants like it were once groundbreaking technology, but they face increasing competition from generative artificial intelligence and chatbots like OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT. In September, Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/amazon-event-2023-heres-everything-the-company-just-announced.html">teased updates</a> to Alexa that are tied to generative AI, such as composing messages on behalf of users. The unit overseeing Alexa also has a new leader, after longtime devices head Dave Limp <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-out-replaced-by-outgoing-amazon-exec-dave-limp.html">left to join</a> Bezos&#39; rocket company Blue Origin. Limp <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/27/amazon-hires-former-microsoft-product-chief-to-oversee-devices-unit.html">was succeeded by</a> veteran Microsoft executive Panos Panay.</p><p>Rausch said Amazon remains &#34;encouraged by the progress we&#39;re making with Alexa,&#34; noting that users have interacted with the virtual assistant &#34;tens of millions of times every hour,&#34; and there are more than 500 million Alexa devices in consumers&#39; homes.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/14/amazon-partners-with-snap-to-feature-shopping-ads-on-the-app.html">Amazon partners with Snap to feature shopping ads</a></p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107333715"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107333715" data-vilynx-id="7000322537" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107333716-16999882791699988276-32025931418-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1699988278&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Amazon partners with Snap to feature shopping ads on the app"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
