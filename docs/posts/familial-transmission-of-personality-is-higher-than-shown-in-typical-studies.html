    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <div data-test-preview-wrapper="">
        <p>
    
        Personality trait similarity among ordinary relatives is surprisingly low, with parent-offspring and sibling-sibling correlations usually r ≤ .15. We explain why these correlations are doubly distorted in single-method studies and argue that this issue can only be addressed with multi-method designs. In a sample of parent-offspring and sibling-sibling pairs, as well as second degree relatives, who rated their own personality traits and life satisfaction and were each rated by an independent informant [N(participants) = 2,518 + informants], we found that parent-offspring and sibling correlations were at least a third higher than typically shown (r ≈ .20). These data put personality traits and life satisfaction’s narrow-sense (additive) heritability at around 40%, up from about 25% typical in self-report studies. Life satisfaction was as heritable as personality traits, with over 80% of genetic variance shared with neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. About half of life satisfactions phenotypic correlations with neuroticism and extraversion and all its correlation with conscientiousness were accounted for by shared genetic factors. Using data from a larger relatives’ sample with only self-reports [N(participants) = 40,606; N(pairs) = 24,019], we also provide evidence that growing up together does not make people more similar and genetic effects partly wear off with time/generations.
