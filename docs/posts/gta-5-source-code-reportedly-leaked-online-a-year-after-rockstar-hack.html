<p>​The source code for Grand Theft Auto 5 was reportedly leaked on Christmas Eve, a little over a year after the Lapsus$ threat actors hacked Rockstar games and stole corporate data.</p>
<p>Links to download the source code were shared on numerous channels, including Discord, a dark web website, and a Telegram channel that the hackers previously used to leak stolen Rockstar data.</p>
<p>In a post to a Grand Theft Auto leak channel on Telegram, the channel owner known as &#39;Phil&#39; posted links to the stolen source code, sharing a screenshot of one of the folders.</p>

<p>The channel owner also paid homage to Lapsus$ hacker Arion Kurtaj, who previously <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gta-6-source-code-and-videos-leaked-after-rockstar-games-hack/" target="_blank">leaked pre-release videos of Grand Theft Auto 6</a> under the name &#39;teapotuberhacker.&#39; </p>
<p>Kurtaj was recently <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lapsus-hacker-behind-gta-6-leak-gets-indefinite-hospital-sentence/" target="_blank">sentenced to an indefinite hospital</a> stay by a UK judge for hacking into Rockstar and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uber-hacked-internal-systems-breached-and-vulnerability-reports-stolen/" target="_blank">Uber</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games was hacked in 2022 by members of the notorious Lapsus$ hacking group, who gained access to the company&#39;s internal Slack server and Confluence wiki.</p>
<p>At the time, the threat actors claimed to have stolen the GTA 5 and GTA 6 source code and assets, including a GTA 6 testing build, with some of the stolen content leaked on forums and Telegram. The threat actor also shared GTA 5 source code samples as proof that they had stolen the data.</p>

<p>Security research group vx-underground says they spoke to the leaker on Discord, who said the source code was leaked sooner than expected.</p>
<p>&#34;They claim to have received the source code August, 2023,&#34; reads a <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1739263588408164859" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post by vx-underground</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;Their motivation was to combat scamming in the GTA V modding scene, many people were allegedly scammed by people claiming to have the GTA V source code.&#34;</p>
<p>While BleepingComputer reviewed the leak, which appears to be legitimate GTA 5 source code, we could not independently verify its authenticity.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer contacted Rockstar about the leak but did not receive a response, likely due to the holidays.</p>
<h2>The Lapsus$ hackers</h2>
<p>The Lapsus$ hackers stood out for their <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lapsus-hackers-took-sim-swapping-attacks-to-the-next-level/" target="_blank">skills at performing social engineering and SIM swapping attacks</a> to breach corporate networks.</p>
<p>Some known cyberattacks attributed to the hacking group include Uber, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-confirms-they-were-hacked-by-lapsus-extortion-group/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, Rockstar Games, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/okta-confirms-25-percent-customers-impacted-by-hack-in-january/" target="_blank">Okta</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-to-nvidia-remove-mining-cap-or-we-leak-hardware-data/" target="_blank">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/e-commerce-giant-mercado-libre-confirms-source-code-data-breach/" target="_blank">Mercado Libre</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-confirms-lapsus-hackers-breached-internal-systems/" target="_blank">T-Mobile</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ubisoft-confirms-cyber-security-incident-resets-staff-passwords/" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vodafone-portugal-4g-and-5g-services-down-after-cyberattack/" target="_blank">Vodafone</a>, and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-190gb-of-alleged-samsung-data-source-code/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>.</p>
<p>As part of these attacks, the threat actors would attempt to extort the companies not to leak stolen data, which in many cases was source code and customer data.</p>
<p>The success of these attacks led the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Safety Review Board to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dhs-cyber-safety-board-to-review-lapsus-gang-s-hacking-tactics/" target="_blank">analyze their tactics</a> and share recommendations for preventing similar attacks in the future.</p>
<p>While the Lapsus$ group has not been very active after members were arrested, BleepingComputer was told some of the members are now believed to be active in the loose-knit <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-shares-tactics-of-notorious-scattered-spider-hacker-collective/" target="_blank">hacking collective known as Scattered Spider</a>.</p>
<p>Scattered Spider shares similar tactics to Lapsus$, utilizing social engineering, phishing, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/" target="_blank">MFA fatigue</a>, and SIM swapping attacks to gain initial network access to large organizations.</p>
