    <h1>The Ur-question of Blogging</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://blog.jfo.click/

"/></p>
<p>Until my couple of recent posts, it had been a long while since I had posted
anything.  There were good reasons for this...  and bad reasons.</p>
<p>The good reasons are pretty standard issue. In mid 2017, I started a new job,
had a baby, and moved to a new country within a few weeks. Between all those
things going on all at once it was tough to make the time and spend the energy
on writing very many substantive things, and I had sort of painted myself into a
bit of a corner with the maximalist approach to post writing that I had been
cultivating. I could have, should have found a path towards a more sustainable
way of writing, but that too, would have required focus and energy that was in
dramatically shorter supply all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Among the bad reasons... I started to doubt my voice. It was easy to keep a
beginners mind when I was <em>actually</em> a beginner. When I moved into my second
programming job it didn&#39;t feel genuine to think of myself that way anymore, and
yet... I didn&#39;t feel like I had achieved anything approaching the level of
skill I felt was necessary to speak with authority, either. A little bit of an
uncanny valley, that.</p>
<p>But some things have changed. I&#39;ve grown a <em>lot</em> professionally and feel more
secure in my skills and interests. My kid is nearing 5... still a huge handful
but life is also (relatively) more predictable. I have been wanting to get back
to writing...but there&#39;s one more obstacle left.  I need to answer The Question
first, if only for my own benefit.</p>
<h2 id="why-write-a-blog-">Why write a blog?</h2>
<p>Every time I sit down to start up with writing again, I&#39;m faced with this, the
ur-question of blogging. I&#39;ve <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/the-post-i-am-not-writing-this-time">punted</a>
previously, but that was as much or more out of cowardice and confusion than
enlightenment.  &#34;Why write a blog&#34; is a fair question and it deserves to be
answered in earnest. What is the <em>benefit</em> of this? Blogging can be a lot of
hard work, especially if you want to do it well.  What do I get out of this?
What do other people get out of this? Is it even worth the time and effort? The
reasons presented below are some things I&#39;m thinking about. They mostly aren&#39;t
general although some of them might apply kind of generally, but I&#39;m only
speaking for myself.</p>
<h2 id="1-blogging-helps-me-learn">1. Blogging helps me learn</h2>
<p>The most salient benefit I&#39;ve experienced from blogging about things I&#39;m
learning is that it dramatically helps me with that learning. It gives me a
framework to hang my self-assessment on. Do I understand <code>$thing</code> well enough to
explain it to an imaginary reader who roughly mirrors who I was just before I
learned about <code>$thing</code>? This can be very different than just feeling like you
understand something... and it can be a lot more in depth. Further, it gives me
a goalpost that <em>isn&#39;t</em> &#34;I fully completely 100 percent understand <code>$thing</code>.&#34; In
a vacuum, that&#39;s always going to be my goalpost, because I am a deluded
completionist who would rather not try to learn anything at all unless I&#39;m
going to make it through the equivalent of an undergraduate courseload on it. I
have actually tried to do this several times, imagining that I will take all
the courses on MIT open courseware to achieve some kind of enlightenment.
It never works, for various reasons, and I always feel bad when I fail to
achieve this overly ambitious thing. If I ever <em>did</em> manage to do that, sure,
I&#39;d probably get a lot out of it, but there&#39;s also just <em>no way</em> it&#39;s the best
use of my time at this point in my life and career.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jfo.click/the-mandelwat-set">The Mandelwat Set</a> is maybe my great success in this vein.
I have a lackluster math background, but I just got an itch to understand
fractals a few years ago and spent a little over a month studying the basics
and implementing a mandelbrot set viewer from scratch. The post covered all the
basic maths, and included a lot of interesting javascript learnings too. I&#39;m
really proud of it, and it gave me something to point to, for myself, that says
&#34;hey this reflects that work and understanding I put into that little flight of
fancy a few years ago.&#34; If I hadn&#39;t written the blog post, I would probably not
have implemented the actual code, or if I had, I wouldn&#39;t have done so to
completion. I would have been left with a vague memory of how the mandelbrot
set works and ever present guilt that I don&#39;t know more, and that&#39;s all.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really pretty productive to write a medium length post about some subject
you&#39;re learning about even if you only really intend it to benefit your own
memory.</p>
<h2 id="2-blogging-helps-other-people-learn">2. Blogging helps other people learn</h2>
<p>Blogging about something you just learned helps other people learn the things
you just learned. This is so simple as to be almost axiomatic, but it&#39;s really
powerful. Important to this point is that <em>you are best positioned to explain
something to someone directly after you&#39;ve learned it</em>. You just went through
the process! You know what you struggled with and what might be hard. After
you&#39;ve fully internalized something, it can become difficult to maintain
empathy for fresh eyes. I can see this in action looking through my drafts
folder. There are a few posts that are all about something I was into
tangentially for a few weeks years ago, and though I may still find the subject
interesting, I&#39;m not sure I find it interesting <em>enough</em> to get back into it
and finish the post. This is a good learning- when a draft is about something
specific like that, just get it out the door. Some ideas can simmer for years
and be better for it, but for devlog-like posts, they&#39;re not going to be
engaging to write forever, and it&#39;s not worth working on them if I&#39;m not
engaged in the process.</p>
<h2 id="3-i-have-a-lot-more-to-offer-now-than-i-did-before-">3. I have a lot more to offer now than I did before.</h2>
<p>I have 8 years of industry experience at this point. It&#39;s simply not accurate
to call myself a beginner, even though I feel like one every day. That&#39;s one of
the reasons I love this job, right? It&#39;s always providing new challenges and
things to learn about? I&#39;m still lucky enough to be working with absolute units
who I continue to learn from, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have a LOT more to
offer people who aren&#39;t as far along in their journeys as I am.  Does this mean
I should pivot my writing voice to an authoritative one? No, but I shouldn&#39;t
take my own experience for granted, either. I genuinely love teaching people
stuff that I know about, and I should do that. This blog can help do that.</p>
<p>In my opinion, as a reader, some of the most interesting things about blogs
are subtle, and implicit. It&#39;s about learning the solving processes people use
to attack problems and structure solutions. It&#39;s about articulating the
tradeoffs in code design that come into play when working on something. Style
guides and rules are never the whole picture- everything deserves to be thought
through and the trade offs enumerated. How modular does this project need to
be? Is it going to be distributed to other people? This becomes second nature
pretty quickly when working in a job or doing personal or open source projects
of any depth, but it&#39;s also quite mysterious from the outside in. I remember it
seeming mysterious.</p>
<h2 id="4-it-s-really-fun-and-satisfying-">4. It&#39;s really fun and satisfying.</h2>
<p>I can do whatever I want on here. Deciding what that&#39;s going to be is is a real
challenge sometimes, but once I&#39;ve made a decision to write a certain thing a
certain way, I can just do it! It&#39;s fun to exercise my creativity in this
completely self directed but contained way, and I&#39;ve read a lot of interesting
posts the last couple years that use novel presentation techniques that I find
inspiring and want to <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/">emulate</a>. This
has so far primarily been a static words blog, but the web is so much more rich
as an interactive platform, and I want to explore that.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also very satisfying to feel like I&#39;m able to reify my understanding into
something tangible, and to look back on how far I&#39;ve come and how much I&#39;ve
grown over the years. I expect this to only be more true as the years progress,
and the blog becomes a collection of snapshots of my previous minds.</p>
<p>I hope this answers The Question, and I&#39;m looking forward to publishing more
and more often.</p>
