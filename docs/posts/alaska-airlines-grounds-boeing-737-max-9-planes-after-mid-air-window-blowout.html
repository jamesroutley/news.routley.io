They returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.</p><p>Max deliveries have been interrupted at times to fix manufacturing flaws. In December, the company told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.</p></div></div></div>
