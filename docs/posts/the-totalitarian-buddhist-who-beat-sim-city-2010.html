    <h1>The Totalitarian Buddhist Who Beat SIM City (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p> I’m English, but when I was twelve I lived in North Carolina and went to an inner-city school a bit like that one in <i>The Wire</i>. I only have two memories of that time. One, of police arresting one of my classmates in the middle of Social Studies, (I never saw him again), and two, of technology lessons that consisted of us sitting two to a computer, playing the original <i>Sim City</i>; presumably to stop us fighting each other for one hour a day.</p>



<p> That was the first time I played <i>Sim City</i>. Later, I got my first computer with <i>Sim City 2000</i>. I dicked around with it for about a week before realizing I’d rather gun down Nazis in <i>Spear of Destiny</i>, than thanklessly lay down four square miles of sewage piping for silent citizens.</p>





<p> Not Vincent Ocasla though. Vince spent four years wallowing in equations and graph paper building a totalitarian <i>Sim City</i> hellscape called Magnasanti, racking up a population of six million and claiming to beat an otherwise unbeatable game. Watch this and get scared:</p>

<p> I saw this mind-blowing video a month ago, but only just managed to track Vincent down on Facebook. He’s a 22-year-old architecture student living in the Philippines, and I felt a little bit better after discovering he’s just a normal dude, not Krang from <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>.</p>



<p> <b>Vice: I think most people’s natural inclination after watching your video would be awe, followed by fear.</b></p>


<p> <b>Not to presume you didn’t have fun building and developing Magnasanti, but your approach to Sim City doesn’t seem like you really treat it as a game anymore.</b></p>




<p> <b>Godfrey Reggio’s <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PirH8PADDgQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koyaanisqatsi</a></i> seems to have been a big inspiration.</b></p>


<p> <b>I’ve a quote from one of your Facebook status updates here: “The economic slave never realizes he is kept in a cage going round and round basically nowhere with millions of others.” Do you feel that sums up the lives of the citizens of Magnasanti? (And you might want to set your Facebook to private by the way.)</b></p>



<p><i><b>Related: “Slavoj Zizek”</b></i></p>



<p> <b>Heavy.</b></p>





<p> <b>Why did it take a year-and-a-half just to complete the theory behind Magnasanti?</b></p>

<p> <b>You say Magnasanti’s design is based on the Bhavacakra, the wheel of life and death in Buddhism. Are you a practicing Buddhist?</b></p>


<p> <b>Do you play any other games apart from <i>Sim City</i>? I hate to imagine what you would do to a family in <i>The Sims</i>.</b></p>


<p> <b>According to Magnasanti’s graphs, none of its citizens seem to live past the age of 50.</b></p>


<p> <b>Anything else you’d like to add?</b></p>

<p> <b>OK, thanks.</b></p>
