    <h1>Rocky Linux 10 Will Support RISC-V</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>🏗️ Rocky Linux 10 Will Support RISC-V!</h2>
<p>We&#39;re excited to announce that <strong>Rocky Linux 10 will officially support RISC-V!</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible work of the Fedora RISC-V Community and Rocky&#39;s <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org">AltArch SIG</a>, this release will include a <strong>riscv64gc</strong> build, targeting the same platforms supported by Fedora—such as the <strong>StarFive VisionFive 2 (VF2)</strong>, <strong>QEMU</strong>, and the <strong>SiFive HiFive Premier P550</strong>.</p>

<h3>🔧 Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>✅ Works out-of-the-box on the VisionFive 2 and in QEMU, using the standard EL10 kernel.</li>
<li>🧩 Supports the P550 and similar platforms via vendor kernels, though some features may be limited.</li>
<li>🧬 Built on an upstream-first approach—actively collaborating with the Fedora community to advance RISC-V support across the ecosystem.</li>
<li>🆕 New hardware targets and extensions (like RVA23) can be enabled by the AltArch SIG—jump in and get involved!</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to <strong>RISC-V International</strong>, <strong>RISE</strong>, <strong>Rivos, Inc.</strong>, and the <strong>Fedora community</strong> for their ongoing technical and hardware support.</p>

<h2>❓ Frequently Asked: Rocky Linux RISC-V</h2>
<h3>Is this a Primary architecture?</h3>
<p>The RISC-V builds for Rocky Linux 10 will be considered an Alternative Architecture--though unlike ppc64le and s390x, build failures for riscv64 will <strong>not</strong> be considered fatal and will not block the release of the other architectures. In short, package updates for Rocky Linux will not be bottlenecked on waiting for RISC-V versions to build, or on fixing failures unique to the archicture.</p>
<h3>🔍 What hardware is supported?</h3>






























<table><thead><tr><th>Hardware</th><th>Status</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>StarFive VisionFive 2</strong></td><td>✅ Supported</td><td>Recommended board; standard kernel support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>QEMU</strong></td><td>✅ Supported</td><td>Ideal for testing and evaluation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SiFive HiFive P550</strong></td><td>⚠️ Limited support</td><td>Vendor kernel;  some feature limitations</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Milk-V / Banana Pi</strong></td><td>🚧 Not yet supported</td><td>Under consideration as mainline support matures</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3>🌟 What makes this different?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This has been a <strong>community-driven initiative</strong> since early 2024, collaborating with upstream Fedora RISC-V efforts.</li>
<li>The compiler stack was <strong>bootstrapped from Fedora RISC-V</strong>, with necessary backports to EL10 to enable the port--with many already contributed upstreamed.</li>
<li>Expect <strong>rapid iteration and growth</strong>, with your help and feedback!</li>
