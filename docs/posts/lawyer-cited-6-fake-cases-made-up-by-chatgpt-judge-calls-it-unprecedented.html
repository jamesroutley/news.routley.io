<p>A lawyer is in trouble after admitting he used ChatGPT to help write court filings that cited six nonexistent cases invented by the artificial intelligence tool.</p>
<p>Lawyer Steven Schwartz of the firm Levidow, Levidow, &amp; Oberman &#34;greatly regrets having utilized generative artificial intelligence to supplement the legal research performed herein and will never do so in the future without absolute verification of its authenticity,&#34; Schwartz wrote in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.32.1_1.pdf">affidavit</a> on May 24 regarding the bogus citations previously submitted in US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>Schwartz wrote that &#34;the use of generative artificial intelligence has evolved within law ﬁrms&#34; and that he &#34;consulted the artificial intelligence website ChatGPT in order to supplement the legal research performed.&#34;</p>
<p>The &#34;citations and opinions in question were provided by ChatGPT which also provided its legal source and assured the reliability of its content,&#34; he wrote. Schwartz admitted that he &#34;relied on the legal opinions provided to him by a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable,&#34; and stated that it is his fault for not confirming the sources provided by ChatGPT.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Schwartz didn&#39;t previously consider the possibility that an artificial intelligence tool like ChatGPT could provide false information, even though AI chatbot mistakes have been extensively reported by non-artificial intelligence such as the human journalists employed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">reputable news organizations</a>. The lawyer&#39;s affidavit said he had &#34;never utilized ChatGPT as a source for conducting legal research prior to this occurrence and therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false.&#34;</p>
<h2>Judge weighs “unprecedented circumstance”</h2>
<p>Federal Judge Kevin Castel is considering punishments for Schwartz and his associates. In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.33.0_1.pdf">order on Friday</a>, Castel scheduled a June 8 hearing at which Schwartz, fellow attorney Peter LoDuca, and the law firm must show cause for why they should not be sanctioned.</p>
<p>&#34;The Court is presented with an unprecedented circumstance,&#34; Castel wrote in a previous <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.31.0_1.pdf">order on May 4</a>. &#34;A submission filed by plaintiff&#39;s counsel in opposition to a motion to dismiss is replete with citations to non-existent cases... Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations.&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc#entry-29">filings</a> included not only names of made-up cases but also a series of exhibits with &#34;excerpts&#34; from the bogus decisions. For example, the fake <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.29.1.pdf"><em>Varghese v. China Southern Airlines</em></a> opinion cited several precedents that don&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>&#34;The bogus &#39;Varghese&#39; decision contains internal citations and quotes, which, in turn, are nonexistent,&#34; Castel wrote. Five other &#34;decisions submitted by plaintiff&#39;s counsel contain similar deficiencies and appear to be fake as well,&#34; Castel wrote.</p>
<p>The other five bogus cases were called <em>Shaboon v. Egyptair,</em> <em>Petersen v. Iran Air,</em> <em>Martinez v. Delta Airlines</em>, <em>Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</em>, and <em>Miller v. United Airlines</em>.</p>
