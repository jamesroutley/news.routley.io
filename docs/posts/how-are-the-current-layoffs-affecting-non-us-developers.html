    <h1>Ask HN: How are the current layoffs affecting non-US developers?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was looking at the data used for layoff tracker [1] and it seems that the current wave of layoffs are mostly focused on US companies (~70%) and employees (~60%). And it got me wondering, how is the current career climate for developers who aren&#39;t in the US? I still get my daily recruiter spam in my inbox for companies hiring in west-Europe, it hasn&#39;t stopped.</p><p>[1] https://airtable.com/shrclnXK0pfoGjtih/tblQ0U46nsYopm2CR?backgroundColor=gray&amp;viewControls=on</p></div></div></div>
