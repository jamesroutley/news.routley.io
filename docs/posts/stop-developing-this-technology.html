          <p>Honestly, i understand you perfectly. I am a software engineer like you
people.
The problem is creating technology that can be turned into a weapons system
in peacetime. This technology is being used by scammers, almost
exclusively, then, what more use can there be than pretending to be someone
you are not? a joke? What if it is not? What if it serves for someone to
impersonate someone important in your family and communicate to the rest
that you have died? Or if it serves to authenticate a scammer&#39;s access to a
mobile? or a foreign agent from a country hostile to the interests of your
country?

You say that the responsibility is yours because you should be able to
recognize that it is a deepfake, and before that I tell you that currently
if you have a trained eye and you are alert, it is quickly recognized, as
in the example you have given of the Putin video. It is seen to the
millisecond that it is not him, but that is because the technology is still
at a green point. The uncanny valley will disappear in no time.

I speak to you as a victim of a scam of this type of technology. Please,
you have family, put yourselves in the shoes of your relatives who know
nothing at all about technology. Think of ways to recognize the bad uses of
this technology that is not going to bring anything good. It is already
destroying the lives of multiple people, every day. I beg you, put your
knowledge at the service of good, not evil.

Best,

Alonso
