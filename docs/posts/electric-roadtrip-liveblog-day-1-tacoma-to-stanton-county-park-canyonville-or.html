<h3>Electric Roadtrip liveblog - Day 1 - Tacoma to Stanton County Park (Canyonville, OR)</h3>

<p>
Day 1 of my <a href="https://ops101.org/archives/000354.html">electric roadtrip</a>, I drove from Tacoma, WA to Stanton Park, Canyonville, OR (~350 miles). I like to camp when possible on EV road trips; tent time is good, and I can usually charge overnight at any RV spots.
</p>
<p>
<b>Packing:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>I carry a power pack (EcoFlow Delta Mini) and a powered cooler; the main EV battery keeps the Delta topped off during the day, the EcoFlow keeps the cooler cool through the night</li>
<li>I also bring electric camp kitchen devices - an electric Moka pot, an electric kettle. In the mornings, I can run them off of the EcoFlow and not have to get out fuel or my little alcohol stove</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Planning and routing:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Electric cars generally charge _much_ faster when their batteries are low than when they’re closer to full; for the Chevy Bolt, it charges at ~50 kW in the 0% - 50% range; and tapers off from there to ‘pretty slow’ in the 80% range</li>
<li>You don’t need to or want to “fill up” at each charger; you instead want to charge only enough to get to the next charger in your plan, plus some buffer</li>
<li>Hills and temperature affect range - budget for them!</li>
</ul>
