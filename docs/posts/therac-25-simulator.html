<h2>Hands-on 3b: Therac-25</h2>

<p>Now that you have had a bit more experience with systems and a
better understanding of concurrency issues, we revisit the Therac-25.
As you may already know, <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu">Nancy
Leveson</a>, the author of the Therac-25 paper, is now a professor at
MIT studying software safety.  While not the focus of her current
research, she does maintain the Therac Evaluation and Analysis
Laboratory.  The TEAL has an original unmodified Therac-25, which
allows the situations described in the paper to be reproduced in a
controlled setting.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You will need a partner to do the
second half of this hands on.</p>

<h3>Part A: Practice with the Interface</h3>

<p>As you should remember from the paper, the Therac-25 has an
operator interface where key input parameters are entered.  The
interface looks something like this:</p>

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

<p>Simulator commands:
</p><ul>
<li>Beam Type is either &#39;X&#39; or &#39;E&#39;
</li><li>The ENTER key for fast input is not working today
</li><li>Command is either &#39;B&#39; for beam on, or &#39;Q&#39; for quit simulator
</li></ul>

<p>Before continuing further, re-familiarize yourself with the
interface by re-reading the sidebar &#34;The operator interface.&#34;  You may
also find the description on page 27 (hardcopy) useful.</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> What is the sequence of events necessary to
trigger the Malfunction 54 error?</p>

<p><b>Question 2:</b> How difficult do you believe this triggering
condition to be?</p>

<p>In order for you to get a firm grasp on the specifics of this
process, we have supplied a Therac-25 Operator Console Simulator,
called <tt>therac</tt>.  It may be accessed on Athena (via dialup) or
you can download <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2007/wwwdocs/assignments/therac.c">therac.c</a> and compile it with
<tt>gcc -o therac therac.c -lcurses</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Question 3:</b> Attempt to trigger the Malfunction 54 error in
the simulator.  Is it easier or harder than you anticipated?</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Part B: Experiments with an actual Therac-25</h3>

<p>To complete the second part of the lab, you must go to Leveson&#39;s
TEAL room with a partner.  There you will find instructions for the
remainder of the hands-on, along with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2007/wwwdocs/assignments/handson-liability.html">liability release forms</a>.  The
partner need not be in 6.033, or even an MIT student.  <i>Please
direct any questions or problems to the 6.033 course staff instead of
Prof. Leveson.</i></p>

<p><b>Question 4:</b> How many rads did you receive in doing this
project?</p>
