    <h1>Focus Doesn&#39;t Mean Doing One Thing at a Time</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2022/10/focus_not_doing_one_thing_at_a_time.jpg" alt="Focus Doesn&apos;t Mean Doing One Thing at a Time"><p>Last week&#x2019;s essay was titled &#x2018;<a href="https://commoncog.com/focus-saying-no-to-good-ideas/">Focus Is Saying No To Good Ideas</a>&#x2019;. One of the more interesting things I&#x2019;ve noticed in the responses to that essay is that our ideas of &#x2018;focus&#x2019; are usually informed by focus at an <em>individual</em> level. You probably know what this means: when a teacher or coach tells you to focus, they usually mean &#x201C;do one thing at a time&#x201D;, or &#x201C;clear your mind of distractions&#x201D;. And that&#x2019;s certainly true when you&#x2019;re studying for an exam or when you&#x2019;re refining your tennis serve. But it&#x2019;s not what focus looks like at the organisational level, and it&#x2019;s not what Steve Jobs meant when he came up with that quip in the first place.</p><p>So what does it look like, really? We&#x2019;ll take a look at two very different stories today, as an illustration of what focus looks like in an organisational context. Once again, I&#x2019;m not laying out a comprehensive theory of organisational behaviour here &#x2014; I&#x2019;m merely giving you stories to demonstrate the &#x2018;shape&#x2019; of the concept instantiation. This is what organisational focus looks like in business and in war. Let&#x2019;s get started.</p><h2 id="the-brooks-turnaround">The Brooks Turnaround</h2><p>In March 2001, Jim Weber took over as CEO of the beleaguered running shoe company, Brooks Running.</p><p>Brooks was then owned by private equity firm J.H. Whitney &amp; Company. An initial turnaround under CEO Helen Rockey showed promise, but two CEOs on and the company was drifting: its financials were bad and the cash flow situation potentially catastrophic. Weber was an independent board member at Brooks at the time; he had front row seats to its decline. During a particularly bad board meeting, the board chairman, Ann Iverson, turned to Weber and said &#x201C;Jim, you should be in here running this business.&#x201D;</p><p>This was a provocative prompt. Weber took a few months to think it through. He eventually agreed.</p><p>At the point Weber took over, Brooks was in <em>very</em> bad shape. The company was structured as a typical private equity deal, which meant Whitney had raised debt to purchase Brooks and &#x2014; naturally &#x2014; put all of that debt on Brooks&#x2019;s books. By the fall of 2000 the company was in crisis. Weber never really says in his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59551681">autobiography</a> how badly Brooks missed its interest payments, but things had gotten so bad that the banks involved were simply refusing to fund operations. There came a point where even the payroll checks were at risk of bouncing.</p><p>Whitney eventually agreed to recapitalise the company &#x2014; to the tune of $7 million dollars. Weber made this a condition for his involvement: in March 2001, he spent a day with several partners in their Connecticut offices to access the problems and negotiate his appointment. On April 4, 2001, shortly after Whitney&#x2019;s renewed commitment, Weber was named Brooks&#x2019;s new CEO. He was its fourth in two years.</p><p>Weber came into the job with full understanding of the difficulties ahead of him. Brooks had 40 million dollars worth of debt on its books. The recapitalisation helped &#x2014; it was one of the conditions that its banks had for continuing to fund operations, after all &#x2014; but Brooks was still very much in trouble.</p><p>Weber had been thinking a fair bit about what he would do once he became CEO. On his first day at work he wrote &#x2018;The secret to success is constancy of purpose&#x2019; &#xA0;&#x2014; a Benjamin Disraeli quote &#x2014; on his office whiteboard. He <a href="https://commoncog.com/take-a-simple-idea-and-take-it-seriously/">took this idea very seriously</a>.</p>
