    <h1>Recurse Center Weekly Recap #3</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I was in Breckenridge on a snowboard trip all week. I didn&#39;t code much. Even though I had this trip planned long before I decided to do RC, I felt some self induced anxiety, maybe even guilt, missing a week of work. I don&#39;t want to waste any of the time I have to progress, learn, and connect with batch-mates. But I had a great time, I love snowboarding, and giving that trip up just for a week of work would have been the wrong call.</p>
<p>So, anyways, I don&#39;t have much progress to report. Knowing I wouldn&#39;t have much time, my goal for the week had been 1. To finish up my first basic React/Django app and 2. To get through some of the React materials I wanted to read. Namely, all of the React sections from the Full Stack Open course.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t quite get there. I worked on the blog app on the flight out. I added a few features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing the current user&#39;s info in cookies so that, upon a page re-load, the app still knows who the user is.</li>
<li>Only displaying the option to edit/delete a post if the current user is the author of the post</li>
<li>Pages for each individual post, which a user can click into from the main feed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a pretty productive flight. This app is really supposed to be a simple toy just to teach myself the basics of React. All in all, it&#39;s served that purpose very well. But I want to move on as fast as possible to work on something I&#39;m more excited about.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m shooting to finish the blog app tomorrow (Week 4, Monday). The last feature I want to add is the ability to navigate to blog/user/example-user-name and see a list of all posts made by that user. I experimented with a few ways to implement this. I&#39;m not quite sure which is the cleanest way to do so. On that note, I&#39;m hoping I can find someone to help review some of my code Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a next project in mind yet, so I&#39;ll try to use Tuesday to finish reading as much of the Full Stack Open material as I can. I&#39;ll do this while I mull over some project ideas. Ideally, I&#39;d like to start a new project with React on the front-end and Django on the back-end by Wednesday. The goal is just to get more experience with React and DRF. So I&#39;m looking for something I can feasibly get done in a week or so.</p>
<p>After that, I want to allow myself to start whatever project, with whatever stack, sounds most exciting to me. Right now I&#39;m thinking that might involve something with training and deploying a model. I&#39;m also interested in building another monolithic Django app that does something cool.</p>
<p>I came into this first project thinking I would learn a lot about DRF. Instead, it ended up mainly serving as a React crash course - and an effective one. I&#39;m happy I learned about components, passing props, hooks, state, router, etc., by trying to make something, as opposed to reading all about them, first. Now I&#39;ll be able to revisit that intro material, know what I care about, and get through it quickly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that by the end of this coming week, I&#39;ll be on my way to finishing up another simple, but more interesting app and that I&#39;ll feel I&#39;ve started to get a good grasp on the basics of React.</p>
<p>As of now, to be honest with myself, I don&#39;t see much point in using React for the things I want to build. If I had never heard of React and you had me build an app with it and then again with just Django/templates, I would without a doubt drop React and use monolithic Django. It is shocking how much easier it is to build so many things in Django - specifically things like permissions and filters. Not to mentioned, not needing to pass props around from component to component.</p>
<p>However, I think I am biased here; mainly because I am currently doing all of these things for the very first time in React and teaching myself. Once I&#39;ve done things, for example setting up a globally accessible user state, a few times, it won&#39;t be painful anymore. I&#39;m also biased because right now I&#39;m not building anything with a terribly complex UI (where React shines). Instead, I&#39;m more interested in what I can make happen on the backend (although what I previously considered back-end work is being challenged by React). So on one hand, I might take the approach of focusing on getting good at React and seeing how my thoughts evolve. On the other hand, I might take a functional approach. Which would mean just building what I want to build with the tools I have. And then, only learning something new when I need it. And that&#39;s what a few other&#39;s have advised me to do. For now, I&#39;m committing to one more project with this stack. I&#39;m curious to see how my thoughts evolve.</p>
