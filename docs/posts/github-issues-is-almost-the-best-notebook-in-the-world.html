<p>GitHub issues is <em>almost</em> the best notebook in the world.</p>
<p>Free and unlimited, for both public and private notes.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Markdown support, including syntax highlighting for almost any language. Plus you can drag and drop images or videos directly onto a note.</p>
<p>It has fantastic inter-linking abilities. You can paste in URLs to other issues (in any other repository on GitHub) in a markdown list <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1059#issuecomment-2907515045">like this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1078
- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1080
</code></pre>
<p>Your issue will pull in the title of the other issue, plus that other issue will get back a link to yours - taking issue visibility rules into account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an issue showing user &#34;simonw&#34; posted yesterday containing text &#34;Current logs could do with a bit of a redesign around tools already, see:&#34; followed by two bullet points with green checkmark icons: &#34;Tools in LLM logs output should only show definition first time #1078&#34; and &#34;New design for logs involving tool calls (and maybe tool classes) #1080&#34;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/issue-notes.jpg"/></p>
<p>It has excellent search, both within a repo, across all of your repos or even across the whole of GitHub if you&#39;ve completely forgotten where you put something.</p>
<p>It has a comprehensive API, both for exporting notes and creating and editing new ones. Add GitHub Actions, triggered by issue events, and you can automate it to do almost anything.</p>
<p>The one missing feature? Synchronized offline support. I still mostly default to Apple Notes on my phone purely because it works with or without the internet and syncs up with my laptop later on.</p>
<p>A few extra notes inspired by the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44094980">discussion of this post</a> on Hacker News:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not worried about privacy here. A lot of companies pay GitHub a lot of money to keep the source code and related assets safe. I do not think GitHub are going to sacrifice that trust to &#34;train a model&#34; or whatever.</li>
<li>There is always the risk of bug that might expose my notes, across any note platform. That&#39;s why I keep things like passwords out of my notes!</li>
<li>Not paying and not self-hosting is a very important feature. I don&#39;t want to risk losing my notes to a configuration or billing error!</li>
<li>The thing where notes can include checklists using <code>- [ ] item</code> syntax is really useful. You can even do <code>- [ ] #ref</code> to reference another issue and the checkbox will be automatically checked when that other issue is closed.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve experimented with a bunch of ways of backing up my notes locally, such as <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a>. I&#39;m not running any of them on cron on a separate machine at the moment, but I really should!</li>
<li>I&#39;ll go back to pen and paper as soon as my paper notes can be instantly automatically backed up to at least two different continents.</li>
<li>GitHub issues also <em>scales</em>! <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue">microsoft/vscode</a> has 195,376 issues. <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue">flutter/flutter</a> has 106,572. I&#39;m not going to run out of space.</li>
<li>Having my notes in a format that&#39;s easy to pipe into an LLM is really fun. Here&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-chronicle/issues/7#issuecomment-2833108867">a recent example</a> where I summarized a 50+ comment, 1.5 year long issue thread into a new comment using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a>.</li>
