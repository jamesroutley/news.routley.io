<p>GitHub issues is <em>almost</em> the best notebook in the world.</p>
<p>Free and unlimited, for both public and private notes.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Markdown support, including syntax highlighting for almost any language. Plus you can drag and drop images or videos directly onto a note.</p>
<p>It has fantastic inter-linking abilities. You can paste in URLs to other issues (in any other repository on GitHub) in a markdown list <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1059#issuecomment-2907515045">like this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1078
- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1080
</code></pre>
<p>Your issue will pull in the title of the other issue, plus that other issue will get back a link to yours - taking issue visibility rules into account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an issue showing user &#34;simonw&#34; posted yesterday containing text &#34;Current logs could do with a bit of a redesign around tools already, see:&#34; followed by two bullet points with green checkmark icons: &#34;Tools in LLM logs output should only show definition first time #1078&#34; and &#34;New design for logs involving tool calls (and maybe tool classes) #1080&#34;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/issue-notes.jpg"/></p>
<p>It has excellent search, both within a repo, across all of your repos or even across the whole of GitHub if you&#39;ve completely forgotten where you put something.</p>
<p>It has a comprehensive API, both for exporting notes and creating and editing new ones. Add GitHub Actions, triggered by issue events, and you can automate it to do almost anything.</p>
<p>The one missing feature? Synchronized offline support. I still mostly default to Apple Notes on my phone purely because it works with or without the internet and syncs up with my laptop later on.</p>
