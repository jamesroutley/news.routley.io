    <h1>System/360 Announcement (1964)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
System/360 is a single system spanning the performance range of virtually all current IBM computers - - from the widely used 1401 to nearly twice that of the most powerful computer previously built by the company. It was developed to perform information handling jobs encompassing all types of applications.
                     </p>
<p>
System/360 includes in its central processors 19 combinations of graduated speed and memory capacity. Incorporated with these are more than 40 types of peripheral equipment which store information and enter it into and retrieve it from the computer. Built-in communications capability makes System/360 available to remote terminals, regardless of distance.
                     </p>
<p>
The equipment is supported by programs which enable System/360 to schedule its own activities for non-stop computing that makes most efficient use of system capabilities.
                     </p>
<p>
Internal processing power of the largest System/360 configuration is approximately 50 times greater than that of the smallest. The system&#39;s machine cycle time - - basic pulse beat of a computer - - ranges from one millionth-of-a-second to only 200 billionths-of-a-second.
                     </p>
<p>
System/360 core storage memory capacity ranges from 8,000 characters of information to more than 8,000,000. Information storage devices linked to the system can store additional billions of characters of data and make them available for processing at varying speeds, depending on need.
                     </p>
<p>
It is the balancing of these factors - - all available within a single system using one set of programming instructions - - that will make it possible for a user to select a configuration suited to his own requirements for both commercial and scientific computing. With the same type of input/output devices, a user can expand his System/360 to any point in its performance range, without reprogramming.
