    <h1>Why I Love Still PHP and Javascript After 20&#43; years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>Over the last twenty years, I have used over a dozen languages professionally, from C to Common Lisp, from Java to Python, from C++ to Typescript.</p>
<p>Yet, I love janky programming languages. In particular, I really enjoy PHP and Javascript.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s why.</p>
<h2 id="they-are-used-by-people-who-get-shit-done">They are used by people who get shit done.</h2>
<p>This makes it easy to find people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand business needs,</li>
<li>can iterate quickly</li>
<li>have shipped and maintained many projects in the past.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="there-is-a-lot-of-fud-that-has-been-cargo-culted-throughout-the-years">There is a lot of FUD that has been cargo-culted throughout the years.</h2>
<p>PHP8 is not your grandmother&#39;s PHP3, ECMAScript 12 is not your grandfather&#39;s Javascript.</p>
<p>Their ecosystems haven&#39;t stood still either.  Tools like CPAN, PECL, npm have put significant evolutionary pressure on other languages.  With its daily new paradigms and frameworks, Javascript has been a hotbed of innovation for years.</p>
<h2 id="their-quality-is-offset-by-other-factors">Their quality is offset by other factors.</h2>
<p>These languages are not popular for their elegance, but for other reasons.</p>
<p>These can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>speed</li>
<li>ease of deployment</li>
<li>malleability</li>
<li>tooling</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>frameworks</li>
<li>platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP is a favorite of mine because of its cgi-bin model:</p>
<ul>
<li>legacy codebases can be refactored in pieces</li>
<li>resource leaks are non-existent</li>
<li>caching and scaling are simpler</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="they-are-fun">They are fun.</h2>
<p>Because basic areas of the language are problematic areas means that programming comes with a sense of experimentation. There is pleasure in finding ways to write elegant code in a language that doesn&#39;t prescribe any.</p>
<h2 id="janky-programming-languages-are-great-equalizers">Janky programming languages are great equalizers.</h2>
<p>Because they are quite permissive, they allow people of all levels and backgrounds to get started with programming. You can be a complete PHP beginner and get a real website going within days.</p>
<p>Having started by copy-pasting BASIC snippets and later on making my own websites with PHP2 and PHP3, I feel pride in being able to pay back by helping newcomers where they are.</p>
<p>Poo-poo-ing a 12-year-old or a recent BootCamp graduate because they are writing actual code is missing the point.</p>
<p>In fact, because users are builders and learners because they have diverse backgrounds, janky languages tend to have very active and welcome communities.</p>
<h2 id="i-never-had-issues-writing-good-code">I never had issues writing good code.</h2>
<p>PHP, Javascript, Lua, Perl all provide effective tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions</li>
<li>variables</li>
<li>classes</li>
<li>first-class functions</li>
<li>sometimes traits and prototypal inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good software is:</p>
<ul>
<li>product alignment</li>
<li>software design</li>
<li>naming and design patterns</li>
<li>enforcing invariants through static analysis or unit testing</li>
<li>providing fast and effective feedback loops to developers</li>
<li>good team communication</li>
</ul>
<p>None of which depend on the language.</p>
<p>Javascript and PHP in particular come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>solid libraries</li>
<li>pragmatic static analysis tools</li>
<li>great IDE support</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, they have better tooling than many a &#34;serious&#34; programming language.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-legacy-codebases">I love legacy codebases.</h2>
<p>A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.</p>
<p>For me, nothing comes close to the pleasure of improving a product with many users.</p>
