    <h1>Happy Birthday, GamingOnLinux â€“ 16 years today</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Time really flies huh? GamingOnLinux has now been around officially for 16 years.</p>

<p>Over the last year or two we&#39;ve seen a good few other sites shut down, some had big layoffs, others got sold and turned into gambling sites, and various got sold off to the owners of IGN but we&#39;re still here to keep reporting on everything related somehow to Linux and the wider gaming industry. A big thank you as always to everyone reading, commenting and sharing our articles. An extra big thank you to all our supporters for keeping us going!</p>

<p>Right now, things are pretty great. But, all that could change. With the continuing rise of AI being shoved into our eyeballs at every opportunity, the web is going to look quite <em>different</em> a year from now. With Google, Bing and others determined to get you to use AI that barely credits the writers that actually power all their responses (like me, hi).</p>

<p>What this does is remind everyone that the big search engines are <em>not</em> your friends. They want your data and for you to never click away from them. The longer they keep you, the more data they can grab and the more adverts they can show you.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, Microsoft also back in May decided to just remove us from Bing News and massively deranked us, following 1 single hour downtime due to a data centre problem and show no signs of putting us back in - which was a bit of a blow (so we barely appear in anything like DuckDuckGo now). I&#39;ve tried explaining this to Microsoft, and they just don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Following GamingOnLinux <em>directly</em> is now more <strong>important</strong> than it <em>ever</em> has been before. How you can help: be sure to share your favourite articles to social media, Reddit and wherever else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not <em>all</em> doom and gloom though, fear not, GamingOnLinux has no plans to go anywhere. Web traffic is still currently somehow the <em>highest</em> it has <em>ever</em> been! And we have no plans to use any AI generation for anything. It&#39;s all hand-crafted spelling errors and terrible grammar here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our Steam Tracker page</a> also recently expanded to begin to include the top Linux distributions used on Steam over time. It&#39;s a manual process and will take a while to fill up, but I thought it would be interesting to see for the trends.</p>

<p><em>Oh, and for those who liked it, our PC Info system is coming back. Stay tuned, it needs some work though to modernise it and fix a lot of issues it had in the background.</em></p>
