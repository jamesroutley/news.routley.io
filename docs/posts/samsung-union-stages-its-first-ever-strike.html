    <h1>Samsung union stages its first ever strike</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Around 28,000 Samsung workers upset over wages may have walked out in protest today, but probably used their holiday allowance to do so. Rampant industrial militancy, this is not.</p>
<p>The workers are members of the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) and are employing a &#34;coordinated use of vacation&#34; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/06/129_376133.html">according to</a> deputy union chief Lee Hyun-guk.</p>
<p>Using leave to protest working conditions is a very polite way to go about an industrial dispute. This one is made even more polite by the fact that Thursday was South Korea&#39;s Memorial Day holiday, so taking Friday off to enjoy a long weekend is not unusual.</p>

    

<p>One <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/11028197">local media report</a> even alleged Samsung management encouraged employees to use annual leave on this day.</p>

        


        

<p>The quantum of potential strikers may also be less than 28,000 – NSEU has been accused of inflating its membership numbers.</p>
<p>The head of the Samsung Electronics Device Experience branch <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=218477">reportedly</a> used internal messaging boards to accuse the union of coopting stolen internal account information of non-union employees to falsely register them.</p>

        

<p>NSEU has committed to not disclosing the number of people on strike, saying it&#39;s up to employees to volunteer info about their choices.</p>
<p>Whatever the real numbers, union members have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://samsunglabor.co.kr/37/?q=YToyOntzOjEyOiJrZXl3b3JkX3R5cGUiO3M6MzoiYWxsIjtzOjQ6InBhZ2UiO2k6MTt9&amp;bmode=view&amp;idx=26269839&amp;t=board">plastered</a> notices on Samsung facility doors, and the workers&#39; protest is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://samsunglabor.co.kr/37/?q=YToxOntzOjEyOiJrZXl3b3JkX3R5cGUiO3M6MzoiYWxsIjt9&amp;bmode=view&amp;idx=26280814&amp;t=board">taking place as planned</a>. The move marks the NSEU&#39;s first ever strike.</p>

<p>A copy of the notice placed on the door was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://samsunglabor.co.kr/37/?q=YToxOntzOjEyOiJrZXl3b3JkX3R5cGUiO3M6MzoiYWxsIjt9&amp;bmode=view&amp;idx=25953555&amp;t=board">posted</a> on NSEU&#39;s website on Thursday.</p>
<p>It alleged that promises to improve Samsung employees&#39; vacation benefits were broken and laughed at by management. It also points out that core executives have recently received bonuses while employees have not.</p>
<p>&#34;They are telling employees to tighten their belts and shifting the [blame for] worsening business performance that comes from management failures,&#34; accused the NSEU, as determined by machine translation. Examples given of those perceived failures include poor performance of Samsung&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/27/asia_tech_news_in_brief/">high bandwidth memory</a> products, and the 2022 game optimizing service (GOS) incident that saw Samsung <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220316000678">apologize</a> to shareholders and customers after some Galaxy smartphones performed poorly.</p>

        

<p>The GOS incident prompted a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) investigation, as Samsung advertised its most recent smartphones as offering improved performance.</p>
<p>The union and chaebol have attempted to negotiate. However, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/11028197">local media reports</a> alleged that talks devolved into shouting matches.</p>
<p>The union is reportedly vying for a 6.5 percent wage increase this year, but management set it to 5.1 percent during a labor-management council staged without union participation.</p>
<p>As for the sensitive issue of bonuses, the union would prefer Samsung calculate them using operating profit instead of a formula that includes operating profit and cost of capital – a method that resulted in no bonus for workers last year.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/samsung-union-goes-on-first-ever-strike-over-pay-dispute">media present onsite</a> at the protests, few visible signs of a strike outside Samsung facilities are evident.</p>
<p>Lee Hyun-kuk, deputy secretary general of the union, told Bloomberg that the strike was a &#34;soft start&#34; and &#34;symbolic move,&#34; and that if the management refuses to communicate, an &#34;all-out general strike&#34; could materialize.</p>
<p>Market analyst firm TrendForce <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240531-12164.html">warned</a> last week that the strike was brewing, but that it &#34;will not impact DRAM and NAND Flash production, nor will it cause any shipment shortages.&#34;</p>
<p>TrendForce noted that the timing of the strike – on a date when many had already applied for leave – allowed &#34;for pre-emptive adjustments in production scheduling and manpower allocation,&#34; and that &#34;fabs rely heavily on automated production and require minimal human labor&#34; anyway. ®</p>
