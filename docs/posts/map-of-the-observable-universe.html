                              Each tiny dot is a galaxy. About 200,000 are shown with their actual position and color. Each galaxy contains billions of stars and planets. We are located at the bottom. Our galaxy, the Milky Way is just a dot. Looking up, we see that space is filled with galaxies forming a global filamentary structure. Far away from us (higher up in the map), the filaments become harder to see.

                              Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is not located at any special position in space. The expansion of the Universe and the redshift effect makes all other galaxies appear redder as we look farther. This map would look similarly if we were looking at the Universe from another galaxy.
