But notably the four eating patterns with the strongest links to longevity all emphasized </span><strong>whole grains</strong><span>, </span><strong>fruits</strong><span>, </span><strong>vegetables</strong><span>, </span><strong>nuts</strong><span>, and </span><strong>legumes</strong><span>. </span><br/></p><p><strong>🍳 Choline Crisis </strong><span>— 90% of Americans aren’t getting the recommended daily intake of Choline: a nutrient found in foods like eggs, broccoli, beans, and meat. That’s bad news according to a new </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13775" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">study</a><span> published in </span><em>Aging Cell</em><span> that discovered profound changes in the brains of choline-deficient mice associated with neurodegeneration. Not to mention damage to the liver and heart, significant weight gain, and impaired glucose metabolism.</span></p><p><span>It’s quite the eggs-istential threat.</span><br/></p><p><strong>🌭 A Lot To Process</strong><span> — A new </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-022-00174-y/figures/1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">study</a><span> published in </span><em>Nature</em><span> revealed damning evidence against processed meat. Mice were found to have </span><strong>75% more tumors</strong><span> after they shifted just 15% of their diet to Frankfurter sausage. That was in comparison to a control group who stuck with 100% chow. After just 8 weeks of adding </span><strong>processed meat, oxidative stress shot up along with body weight</strong><span>. The suspected culprits behind processed meat’s harmful effects are nitrites (not to be confused with </span><em>nitrates</em><span>). </span><br/></p><p><strong>🍟 Not So Fast </strong><span>— Over half of us consume fast food. And one third of us consumers are getting at least </span><em>20% of our total daily calories</em><span> from the stuff! Unfortunately, a new </span><a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(22)01137-5/fulltext" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">study</a><span> found that our livers pay a price for convenience. Fatty liver disease was substantially higher for those whose daily fast food intake exceeded 20%. Sorry Doordash, it’s not you, it’s my liver. </span><br/></p><p><strong>⏱ This Walks Wonders</strong><span> — What’s the least amount of activity needed to counteract a workday full of sitting? Turns out that </span><strong>5 minutes of walking every 30 minutes</strong><span> can prove optimal. This revelation comes from a new Columbia University </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/9900/Breaking_Up_Prolonged_Sitting_to_Improve.200.aspx" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">study</a><span> that compared five different break-to-walk ratios. A 30-5 rhythm may sound like a lot but this cadence reduced blood sugar spikes by 58% compared with sitting all day! It also caused the biggest reduction in fatigue and the largest increase in mood.</span></p><p><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p><p><strong>🧬 Ultraviolet </strong><span>— UV-emitting nail polish dryers damage DNA according a new </span><em>Nature Communications</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35876-8" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">study</a><span>.

One particular breathing rhythm stood out as the most powerful, however: cyclic sighing.</span></p><p><strong>⭐️ THE SIGNIFICANCE</strong><span> </span></p><p>Tibetan monks had a bit of a problem in the 8th century. </p><p><span>Temperatures would drop as low as </span><em>-17 degrees</em><span> at night. </span></p><p>Electric blankets were still some 1300 years away and so this was not ideal. </p><p>But then they discovered something cool. </p><p>A certain breathing pattern could raise their body temperature and help them sleep at night.</p><p>They named it “Tummo,” after the fierce goddess* of fire and passion. </p><p>(*rumored to be an excellent +1 to any party!) </p><p>Recent science has validated the benefits of Tummo along with many other types of breath work:</p><ul><li><p><span>Nasal breathing (as opposed to mouth breathing) can </span><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/49/12448" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">synchronize</a><span> electrical activity in the amygdala and hippocampus, alleviate stress and enhance cognition.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Yogic breathing can increase peacefulness, reaction time, and problem solving, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735501/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">all the while</a><span> lowering anxiety, mind wandering, and intrusive thoughts. </span></p></li></ul><p>But questions remain.</p><p>Some of which are so intriguing that Andrew Huberman had to press pause on being an internet sensation to conduct a study. </p><p>He rounded up no less than nine of his Stanford colleagues to compare three breathing practices with mindfulness meditation. </p><p>Their goal—to identify the best technique for reducing stress and improving mood.</p><p><span>Their findings—published in </span><em><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(22)00474-8" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Cell Medical Reports</a></em><span>—reveal the answer. </span></p><p>The team began by mailing WHOOP trackers to 108 lucky participants. </p><p>(Those who completed the study were allowed to keep

Then they were told to close their eyes and to start breathing while focusing their mental attention on their forehead region between their two eyes. They were told that if their focus drifted from that location to re-recenter their attention by focusing back first on their breath and then on the forehead region between their eyes. They were told that as thoughts arise, to recognize that as normal, refocus their attention back to their forehead region and to continue the practice until time has elapsed.</span></p><p><strong>Cyclic Sighing</strong><span>: Participants were informed they should sit down in a chair or, if they prefer, to lie down, and to set a timer for 5 min. Then they were told to inhale slowly, and that once their lungs were expanded, to inhale again once more to maximally fill their lungs -- even if the second inhale was shorter in duration and smaller in volume than the first, and then to slowly and fully exhale all their breath. They were told to repeat this pattern of breathing for 5 min. They were also informed that ideally, both inhales would be performed via their nose and the exhale would be performed via their mouth, but that if they preferred, they were welcome to do the breathing entirely through their nose. They were also informed that it is normal for the second inhale to be briefer than the first.</span></p><p><strong>Box Breathing</strong><span>: Participants were informed they should sit down in a chair or, if they prefer, to lie down, and to get a timer with a seconds counter that they could watch.</span></p><p>Then they were told to take the “CO2 tolerance test” as follows.</p><ul><li><p><strong>1) </strong><span>Take 4 breaths. An inhale followed an exhale = 1 breath. Ideally these are all done via the nose.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>2) </strong><span>Then take a maximally deep breath and once your lungs are full, exhale as slowly as possible through your nose or mouth.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>3) </strong><span>Time how long it takes (in sec) to empty your lungs; this will be your C02 discard duration.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>4) </strong><span>Do not hold your breath with lungs empty. Once your lungs are empty simply record your ‘discard duration.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>5) </strong><span>Use your discard duration to determine how long your inhales, exhales, and breath holds should be for the box breathing protocol using this table:</span></p></li></ul><p>· 0–20 s C02 discard time = your inhales, exhales, and breath holds should be 3 - 4s.</p><p>· 25–45 s C02 discard time = your inhales, exhales, and breath holds should be 5 - 6s.</p><p>50 - 75 + sec C02 discard time = your inhales, exhales, and breath holds should be 8–10 s.</p><p>Participants were informed they should sit down in a chair or, if they prefer, to lie down, and to set a timer for 5 min. They were told to then inhale (for the duration determined by the C02 discard rate lookup table), then to hold their breath for the equivalent duration, then to exhale for the same duration and then to hold their breath for again, the same duration (e.g. inhale 4 s, hold 4 s, exhale 4 s, hold 4 s) and to repeat this pattern for the entire 5 min. They were told that if at any point they had to strain to reach these times, they should simply reduce the duration of inhales, exhales, and breath holds. We asked participants to perform all breathing through their nose, if possible, but that if they felt the need to switch to breathing through their mouth, to do so.</p><p>Then they were told to return to breathing normally.</p><p><strong>Cyclic Hyperventilation</strong><span>: Participants were informed they should sit down in a chair or, if they prefer, to lie down, and to set a timer for 5 min. Then they were told to inhale deeply (ideally through their nose but if that is not possible, to inhale through their mouth) and then exhale by passively letting the air &#34;fall out from the mouth&#34;. We informed them that for sake of this protocol, that pattern of a deep inhale through the nose and passively letting the air &#34;fall out from the mouth” = 1 breath.</span></p><p>Then they were instructed to perform 30 breaths (in and out) in this manner, and after those 30 breaths, to exhale all their air via their mouth and to calmly wait with lungs empty for 15 s.</p><p>We called this cycle of 30 breaths in and out, followed by a lung-emptying exhale and 15 s breath retention (hold) with lungs empty, “Round 1”.</p><p>Then they were instructed to perform this for a “Round 2” as well:</p><p>30 breaths in-and-out = 1 breath (deep inhale through nose, then “passively exhale” - let air fall out from the mouth&#34;.</p><p>Then after 30 breaths, to exhale all their air and hold to calmly wait with lungs empty for 15 s before repeating.</p><p>Then they were instructed to perform this for a “Round 3”:</p><p>30 breaths in and out = 1 breath (deep inhale through nose, let air &#34;fall out from the mouth&#34;).</p><p>Then after 30 breaths, to exhale all their air and hold to calmly wait with lungs empty for 15 s.</p><p>Then they were told to return to breathing normally.</p><p><span>Stay super, </span></p><p>‍</p><p>P.s.
