The project to enable the writing of kernel code in Rust has been underway
for several years, and each kernel release includes more Rust code.  Even
so, some developers have expressed frustration at the time it takes to get
new functionality merged, and an air of uncertainty still hangs over
the project.  At the 2024 Maintainers Summit, Miguel Ojeda led a discussion
on the status of Rust in the kernel and whether the time had come to stop
considering it an experimental project.  There were not answers to all of the
questions, but it seems clear that Rust in the kernel will continue
steaming ahead.
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991197/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2024/ms/MiguelOjeda-sm.png" alt="[Miguel Ojeda]" title="Miguel Ojeda"/></a>

Ojeda started with the topic of the flexibility needed from the kernel&#39;s
subsystem maintainers.  Two years ago, before the initial Rust support was
pulled into the kernel, he had requested that flexibility because there
would be the need to change some core APIs at times to fit Rust code in.
The need for that flexibility is being felt now, he said.
</p><p>
There are some clear differences in the expectations around Rust in the
kernel, he continued.  He has read through thousands of comments and emails
on recent events, and has seen a wide range of opinions on the state of the
Rust-for-Linux project and where it is headed.  It would be a good thing to
converge on a common understanding of what the goals are.  People and
companies want to invest in Rust for the kernel, but they are unsure about
its future.
</p><p>
Jason Gunthorpe said that he, like many other kernel developers, has not
participated in this work so far.  The project was intended to demonstrate
that Rust is suitable for kernel usage; he is waiting for the decision on
the outcome.  Dave Airlie said that the experiment is not complete, but Greg
Kroah-Hartman said that it is clear at this point that Rust in the kernel
is viable.  Part of the reason for the apparent slow pace of the work, he
said, is that the Rust developers are concentrating on device drivers;
since drivers must interface with many other kernel subsystems, there is a
lot of support code that must be merged.  That takes time.
</p><p>
Gunthorpe said that he would like to see a clear message that Rust is a
success before jumping into it; he also is unable to work with Rust until a
suitable compiler is available in RHEL.  Airlie said that perhaps, for
Gunthorpe, the time had not yet come.
</p><h4>Tooling and help</h4>
<p>
Arnd Bergmann said that there was no doubt that drivers written in Rust
would be better than those in C, but he wondered how long it would
take to merge support in all the necessary subsystems, and when the tooling
would be widely available.  When, he
asked, will he be able to build kernel code with a Rust compiler shipped by
his distribution?  Ojeda answered that multiple compiler versions are now
supported by the kernel code, and that suitable compilers are available
from many community-oriented distributions.  Airlie said that it is too
soon to ask the Rust community for a completely stable compiler to build
kernel code with; there just is not yet enough Rust code in the kernel to
make that happen.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds admonished the group that he did not want to talk about
every subsystem supporting Rust at this time; getting support into some of
them is sufficient for now.  When Airlie asked what would happen when some
subsystem blocks progress, Torvalds answered &#34;that&#39;s my job&#34;.  Christian
Brauner said that the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/953116/">binder driver</a> is
motivating much of the subsystem work now, including the somewhat
contentious <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/978738/">filesystem abstractions</a>.  That
code is being reviewed now.  Airlie added that the first real driver to be
merged will be a sort of inflection point, after which the pace will pick
up; the next challenge after that will be the creation of Rust
infrastructure that is callable from C.
</p><p>
Will Deacon asked Ojeda about the support that the Rust community was
offering to kernel developers; Ojeda answered that he has been building a
team of experts to help where needed.  Some of these people are core Rust
developers who know the language thoroughly; they can help to review
patches even if they lack deep kernel experience.
</p><p>
Torvalds pointed out that there are kernel features that are currently
incompatible with Rust; that is impeding Rust support overall.  He
mentioned modversions in particular; that problem <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/986892/">is being worked on</a>.  The list of blocking
features is getting shorter, he said, but it still includes kernel features
that people need.
</p><h4>Managing expectations</h4>
<p>
Dan Williams pointed out that he once spent two years just getting a new
<tt>mmap()</tt> flag merged.  It is necessary to manage expectations on the
Rust side, he said; merging all of that code will be a slow process.  Ojeda
acknowledged this point, but said that the companies funding
the Rust work are not seeing it going upstream; that is making them
reluctant to continue that funding going forward.
</p><p>
Brauner said that nobody has ever declared that the filesystem abstractions
would not be merged; the discussion is all about the details of how that
will happen.
</p><p>
Ted Ts&#39;o said that the Rust developers have been trying to avoid scaring
kernel maintainers, and have been saying that &#34;all you need is to learn a
little Rust&#34;.  But a little Rust is not enough to understand filesystem
abstractions, which have to deal with that subsystem&#39;s complex locking
rules.  There is a need for documentation and tutorials on how to write
filesystem code in idiomatic Rust.  He said that he has a lot to learn; he
is willing to do that, but needs help on <i>what</i> to learn.  (See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/990619/">this article</a> for a discussion of how the
Rust-for-Linux developers are working to meet this need).
</p><p>
Torvalds said that it is not necessary to understand Rust to let it into a
subsystem; after all, he said, <i>nobody</i> understands the
memory-management subsystem, but everybody is able to work with it.  I
pointed out that the Rust developers are not just creating subsystem
bindings; they are trying to create inherently safe interfaces, and that
often requires changes on the C side.  That increases the impact on
subsystems, but also makes the C code better.  Airlie added that the Rust
developers have to bring maintainers along with them, or the maintainers
will not understand what is happening.
</p><p>
Deacon raised the question of refactoring on the C side.  Changing C
interfaces will often have implications for the Rust code and may break it;
somebody will the have to fix the problems.  Torvalds said that, for now,
breaking the Rust code is permissible, but that will change at some point
in the future.  Kroah-Hartman said that the Rust developers can take
responsibility for the maintenance of the abstractions they add.
</p><h4>Steam right ahead</h4>
<p>
Torvalds said that nothing depends on Rust in the kernel now, and nothing
will for some time yet.  What is important is to make forward progress, so
developers should &#34;steam right ahead&#34; and not worry about these problems
for now.  It is enough to get things working, even though the details are
not right.  Once users are depending on Rust code, it will be necessary to
worry more, he said, but kernel developers should not fail by being too
careful now.
</p><p>
Thomas Gleixner said that the Rust developers are careful about documenting
their code, and he is not frightened by the prospect of refactoring it.  If
he does not understand something, he will simply send an email to the
developer, just as he does with C code.  Torvalds added that Rust has a lot
to offer, and the kernel should try to take advantage of it.  Kroah-Hartman
said that it could eliminate entire classes of bugs in the kernel.
</p><p>
Deacon asked how many developers are working on the Rust side now; Ojeda
answered that there are currently six or seven people, most of whom are
&#34;real Rust experts&#34;.  The strongest kernel expertise in the group had been
Wedson Almeida Filho, who had recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987635/">left the
project</a>.  That was a real loss, but Ojeda is working to recruit others.
</p><p>
Gleixner said that, 20 years ago, there had been a lot of fear and concern
surrounding the realtime kernel work; he is seeing the same thing now with
regard to Rust.  We cannot let that fear drive things, he said.  Torvalds
said that Rust has been partially integrated for two years.  That is
nothing, he said; the project to build the kernel with Clang took a decade,
and that was the same old language.
</p><p>
Julia Lawall asked what happens when things change on the C side; how much
will leak through into the Rust code?  Bergmann said that reviewing Rust
abstractions for a C subsystem without knowing Rust is not difficult; he can
reach a point where he understands the code, but would not feel able to
change it.
</p><p>
Torvalds said that the community can play around with Rust for a few years.
Gunthorpe, though, said that it would be good to get something into
production; that would give the project some needed momentum.  The binder
driver might be a good choice.  Ojeda said that would help to justify more
support from companies.  As the session closed, though, the primary outcome
may well have been expressed by Torvalds, who suggested telling people that
getting kernel Rust up to production levels will happen, but it will take
years.<br clear="all"/></p><table>
