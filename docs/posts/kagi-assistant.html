<p><em>Yes, the rumours are true!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> has been thoughtfully integrating AI into our search experience, creating a smarter, faster, and more intuitive search. This includes <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html">Quick Answer</a> which delivers knowledge instantly for many searches (can be activated by appending ? to the end of your searches), <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/summarize-page.html">Summarize Page</a> for the quick highlights of a web page, and even the ability to <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/ask-questions.html">ask questions about a web page</a> in your search results. And all of these features are on-demand and ready when you need them.</p>

</li>
<li>Mid-thread editing and branching for making the most of your conversations without starting over<br/>

</ul>

<h2>Powered by Kagi Search</h2>

<p>Kagi Assistant has the ability to use Kagi Search to source the highest quality information meaning that its responses are grounded in the most up-to-date factual information while disregarding most “spam” and “made for advertising” sites with our unique ranking algorithm and user search personalizations on top.</p>

<h2>Choice of Best Models</h2>

<p>Kagi Assistant provides the best in class capabilities for coding, information retrieval, problem solving, brainstorming, creative writing, and other LLM applications by leveraging the finest LLM models available. You can select from any model and switch whenever you like. The Assistant can always make use of the latest models as they become available. In addition, you can decide whether to give the model web access (via Kagi Search) or you want to use the model in ‘raw’ mode.</p>

<h2>Powerful Custom Assistants</h2>

<p>LLMs are incredibly flexible tools you can use for many tasks.  With Kagi’s Custom Assistants you can build a tool that meets your exact needs.  For example you may be a car enthusiast and are looking for advice about your VW Bus.</p>

<p>You could create a Custom Assistant to help with the myriad of questions a owner of a classic vehicle might have.  Start by naming your Custom Assistant and select the tools and options.</p><center><em>Custom Assistant Options</em></center>

<h2>Mid-Thread Editing and Branching</h2>

<p>Any LLM user has seen that sometimes they can get data wrong, hallucinate or just become confused.  Or we might want to refine our prompt as we see how a model responds. For instance if you’re interested in understanding how to handle imbalanced data sets you might ask Assistant:</p>
