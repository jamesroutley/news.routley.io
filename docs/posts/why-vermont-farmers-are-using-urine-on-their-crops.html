So if it&#39;s in the water, it&#39;s helping the algae grow. But if it&#39;s on the land, it&#39;s going to help plants grow,” Shupack explains. Because of this, diverting nutrient-rich urine away from waterways and onto the land can prevent harmful algal blooms while helping farmers grow food.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>Everybody pees. It&#39;s an untapped resource – Betsy Williams</span></p></div></div><p>Importantly, the REI team and the farmers they work with take steps to minimise how much of the urine runs off the land and into waterways. Application is carefully timed, so that it happens when the plant is most able to take up the nutrients – typically during the plant&#39;s more active growth stage, when it&#39;s bigger than a seedling but not yet fruiting. The soil moisture is also measured, to make sure the liquid urine will be absorbed. Despite these efforts, &#34;that doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t going to be runoff&#34;, Shupack says.<!-- --></p><p>Even so, she adds, peecycling reduces the overall amount of nutrients entering waterways because it ensures that runoff from the land is the only way excess nutrients enter rivers and lakes. In the <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/17/2525">current system<!-- --></a>, synthetic fertilisers run off into waterways, as well as urine entering rivers directly via wastewater.<!-- --></p><p>The UNRP in Vermont is pioneering peecycling in the US, but projects in other countries are also underway.

Shupack says that in Vermont, farmers&#39; demand for urine outstrips supply – but scaling up collection is tricky. Regulation can create a barrier, she says. &#34;A lot of times you go to a regulator and they say: &#39;We don&#39;t have a form for urine – the only place I know where to put urine is with biosolids, or within wastewater treatment.&#39; So it&#39;s not really categorised in a way that would make sense to do what we&#39;re doing,&#34; she says.<!-- --></p><p>To overcome this, Shupack says that REI have got to grips with the detailed language of regulations so they could spot possible paths and partnered with organisations with existing permits – such as septic haulers – to tackle the different parts of the process, and the permits needed, in a piecemeal way.<!-- --></p><p>Eamon Twohig, programme manager at Vermont&#39;s Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC), tells the BBC that when REI initially approached them &#34;it was clear there was no &#39;regulatory box&#39; for urine treatment/recycling… REI has certainly blazed a trail here in Vermont, and I think we&#39;ve managed to find a workable, regulatory pathway.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>REI has a good relationship with regulators in Vermont, Shupack says, and has all the permits needed to operate – including one for innovative on-site wastewater management, and a waste-hauling permit for transporting urine. Now the organisation is working with partners in Massachusetts and Michigan to move regulation on. &#34;We&#39;re really trying to push that forward. But it&#39;s not always easy to get new environmental regulations updated,&#34; Shupack says. One of the biggest challenges, she adds, is that there is no legal distinction between human waste that has been separated at source, and combined wastewater flows that often come with greater safety concerns. <!-- --></p><p>There are other limitations too. Urine is heavy and cumbersome to transport, and the lorries collecting and moving it <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652622046972">create emissions<!-- --></a>. Currently the urine in Vermont is transported locally, no more than around 10 miles (16km). But expanding peecycling programmes could involve moving urine across bigger distances, so REI&#39;s spinoff company has developed a freeze concentration system that concentrates urine by six times, and is currently being used at the University of Michigan.<!-- --></p><p>Plumbing, too, is a particular challenge. Love says that urine separation systems don&#39;t rely on flushing in the same way standard toilets do – which is great for reducing water use, but is difficult to achieve with current plumbing codes.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;There are solutions,&#34; Love says, &#34;like looped systems in a building. But what it means is the entire plumbing process in a building is different.&#34; This is something Love and her colleagues and partners are working on, so that new buildings in the US can have urine separation systems installed from the start. &#34;If we want any hope of sustainable water systems by the end of this century, we have to start getting the early adopters to look at these innovative solutions now,&#34; she says.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ktywf3.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Rich Earth Institute The Rich Earth Institute collects a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine each year (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)"/><span>Rich Earth Institute</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The Rich Earth Institute collects a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine each year (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>These new systems will have the important goal of making urine donation effortless. Williams began her peecycling efforts using large laundry detergent bottles that travelled in the boot of her car to a central collection tank once a month. Once she was in the habit of collecting urine, Williams didn&#39;t like to let it go to waste. &#34;I didn&#39;t even like to go anywhere where I might have to pee and not have a jug with me. It kind of became part of my routine, sort of like wearing a seat belt,&#34; she says.<!-- --></p><p>Even so, she has enjoyed the recent installation of a toilet in her home that separates urine (at the front) from other waste (at the back). The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. &#34;It&#39;s a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,&#34; Williams says.<!-- --></p><p>Avoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the &#34;ick factor&#34; when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. &#34;It&#39;s icky and it&#39;s smelly and it&#39;s something we don&#39;t talk about,&#34; she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI&#39;s research suggests that the ick factor <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/982/956">doesn&#39;t dominate<!-- --></a> people&#39;s reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn&#39;t be. &#34;It&#39;s this assumption that everyone else is going to think it&#39;s really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it&#39;s going to be,&#34; says Shupack.<!-- --></p><p>Many people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. &#34;It&#39;s the biggest question we get,&#34; Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be &#34;<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://richearthinstitute.org/research-results/pharmaceutical-study/">extremely small<!-- --></a>&#34;. &#34;You&#39;d have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live&#34; to get a cup of coffee&#39;s worth of caffeine, Shupack says.<!-- --></p><p>Health worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. &#34;Particularly in [the US], people don&#39;t really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It&#39;s a new frontier for people.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Climate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn&#39;t let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. &#34;We can just do our part,&#34; she says. &#34;We aren&#39;t perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.&#34; <!-- --></p><p>--<!-- --></p><p><i id="this-story-was-updated-on-04/03/2025-to-remove-an-incorrect-statement-about-toilet-water-plumbing-and-disease-risk.">This story was updated on 04/03/2025 to remove an incorrect statement about toilet water plumbing and disease risk. <!-- --></i></p><p><i id="for-essential-climate-news-and-hopeful-developments-to-your-inbox,-sign-up-to-the">For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/FutureEarth_Newsletter_Signup?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=futurearticle&amp;at_campaign=futureearth&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;&amp;"><i id="future-earth-newsletter,">Future Earth newsletter,<!-- --></i></a><i id="while"> while <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><i id="the-essential-list">The Essential List<!-- --></i></a><i id="delivers-a-handpicked-selection-of-features-and-insights-twice-a-week."> delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.<!-- --></i></p><p><i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on">For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/"><i id="facebook">Facebook<!-- --></i></a><i id=",">, <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future"><i id="x">X<!-- --></i></a><i id="and"> and <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><i id="instagram">Instagram<!-- --></i></a><i id=".">. <!-- --></i></p></article></div>
