    <h1>The case against a C alternative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
            <p>Like several others I am writing an alternative to the C language (if you read this blog before then this shouldn&#39;t be news!). My language (C3) is fairly recent, there are others: Zig, Odin, Jai and older languages like eC. Looking at C++ alternatives there are languages like D, Rust, Nim, Crystal, Beef, Carbon and others.</p>
<p>But is it possible to replace C? Let&#39;s consider some arguments against.</p>
<h3>1. C language toolchain</h3>
<p>The C language is not just the language itself but all the developer tools developed for the language. Do you want to do static analysis on your source code? - There are a lot of people working on that for C. Tools for detecting memory leaks, data races and other bugs? There&#39;s a lot of those, even if your language has better tooling out of the box.</p>
<p>If you want to target some obscure platform, then likely it&#39;s assuming you&#39;re using C.</p>
<p>The status of C as the lingua franca of today&#39;s computing makes it worthwhile to write tools for it, so there are many tools being written.</p>
<p>If someone has a toolchain set up working, why risk it switching language? A &#34;better C&#34; must bring a lot of added productivity to motivate the spending time setting up a new toolchain. If it&#39;s even possible.</p>
<h3>2. The uncertainties of a new language</h3>
<p>Before a language has matured, it&#39;s likely to have bugs and might change significantly to address problems with language semantic. And is the language even as advertised? Maybe it offers something like &#34;great compile times&#34; or &#34;faster than C&#34; – only these goals turn out to be hard to reach a the language adds the full set of features.</p>
<p>And what about maintainers? Sure, an open source language can be forked, but I doubt many companies are interested in using a language that they further down the line might be forced to maintain.</p>
<p>Betting on a new language is a big risk.</p>
<h3>3. The language might just not be good enough</h3>
<p>Is the language even addressing the real pain points of C? It turns out that people don&#39;t always agree on what the pain points with C is. Memory allocation, array and string handling are often tricky, but with the right libraries and a sound memory strategy, it can be minimized. Is the language possibly addressing problems that advanced users don&#39;t really worry about – if so then its actual value might be much lower than expected.</p>
<p>And worse, what if the language omits crucial features that are present in C? Features that C advanced programmers rely on? This risk is increased if the language designer hasn&#39;t used C a great deal but comes from C++, Java etc.</p>
<h3>4. No experienced developers</h3>
<p>A new language will naturally have a much smaller pool of experienced developers. For any middle to large company that&#39;s a <em>huge</em> problem. The more developers there are available for a company, the better they like it.</p>
<p>Also, while the company has experience recruiting for C developers, it doesn&#39;t know how to recruit for this new language.</p>
<h3>5. The C ABI is the standard for interoperability</h3>
<p>If the language can&#39;t easily call – or be called - by C code, then anyone using the language will have to have to do extra work to do pretty much anything that is interfacing with outside code. This is potentially a huge disadvantage.</p>

<p>So those are some of the downsides to not picking C, to be offset by the advantages of picking the alternative. However, often language designers over-estimate what how big advantages their added &#34;features&#34; bring. Here are some common &#34;false advantages&#34;</p>
<h3>1. Better syntax</h3>
<p>Having a &#34;better syntax&#34; than C is mostly subjective. Different syntax is also a huge disadvantage: now you can&#39;t copy code from C, you might have to rewrite every single line even. No company will adopt a language because it has slightly better syntax than C.</p>
<h3>2. Safer than C</h3>
<p>Any C alternative will be expected to be on par with C in performance. The problem is that C have practically no checks, so any safety checks put into the competing language will have a runtime cost, which often is unacceptable. This leads to a strategy of only having checks in &#34;safe&#34; mode. Where the &#34;fast&#34; mode is just as &#34;unsafe&#34; as C.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions: &#34;foreach&#34; avoids manually adding boundary checks and so will automatically be safer. Similarly slices helps in writing checks compared to &#34;pointer + len&#34; (or worse: null terminated arrays).</p>
<h3>3. Programmer productivity</h3>
<p>First of all, pretty much all languages ever will make vacuous claims of &#34;higher programmer productivity&#34;. The problem is that for a business this usually doesn&#39;t matter. Why? Because the actual programming is not the main time sink. In a business, what takes time is to actually figure out what the task <em>really</em> is. So something like a 10% or 20% &#34;productivity boost&#34; won&#39;t even register. A 100% increase in productivity might show, but even that isn&#39;t guaranteed.</p>

<p>So if these don&#39;t matter, what does? For a business it&#39;s whether despite the downsides the language can help the bottom line: &#34;Is this valuable enough to outweigh the downsides?&#34;</p>
<p>But if &#34;better x&#34; doesn&#39;t help - what does? Well... &#34;killer features&#34;: having unique selling points that C can&#39;t match.</p>
<p>Look at Java, when it was released it offered the following features that most of the competing languages couldn&#39;t give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>OO done cleanly (OO was hot at the time)</li>
<li>Threading out of the box (uncommon at the time)</li>
<li>&#34;Write once run anywhere&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Run your code in the browser&#34;</li>
<li>Garbage collection built in</li>
<li>Network programming</li>
<li>Good standard library</li>
<li>Free to use</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s not just one but eight(!) killer features. How many of those unique selling points do the C alternatives have? Less than Java did at least!</p>

<p>So my argument is that a common way languages gets adoption by being the <em>only</em> language in order to use something: Dart for using Flutter, JS for scripting the browser, Java for applets, ObjC for Mac and iOS apps.</p>
<p>Even if those monopolies disappear over time, it gives the language become known and used.</p>
<p>Similarly there are examples where frameworks have been popular enough to boost languages, Ruby and Python are good examples.</p>
<p>So looking at our example languages, Jai&#39;s strategy of bundling a game engine seems good: anyone using it will have to learn Jai, so if the engine is good enough people will learn the language too.</p>
<p>But aside from Jai, is anyone C alternative really looking to pursue having killer features? And if it doesn&#39;t have one, how does it prove the switch from C is worth it? It can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The &#34;build it and they will come&#34; idea is tempting to believe in, but there is frankly little reason to drop C unless the alternative has important unique features an/or products that C can&#39;t hope to match.</p>
<p>While popularity and enthusiasm is helpful, it cannot replace proven value. In the end, all that matters is whether using a language can produce more tangible value to developers than C for at least a large subset of what C is used for. While developers may be excited by new languages, that enthusiasm doesn&#39;t translate to business value.</p>
<p>So no matter how exciting that C alternative may look, it probably will fail.</p>
