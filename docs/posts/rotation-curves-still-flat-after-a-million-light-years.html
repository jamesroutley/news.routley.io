<p>That rotation curves become flat at large radii is one of the most famous results in extragalactic astronomy. This had been established by Vera Rubin and her collaborators by the late 1970s. There were a few earlier <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2017/03/19/declining-rotation-curves-at-high-redshift/">anecdotal cases</a> to this effect, but these seemed like mild curiosities until Rubin showed that the same thing was true over and over again for a hundred spiral galaxies. Flat rotation curves took on the air of a <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2016/07/18/natural-law/">de facto natural law</a> and precipitated the modern dark matter paradigm.</p>



<h2>Optical and radio data</h2>



<p>Rotation curves <em>shouldn’t</em> be flat. If what we saw was what we got, the rotation curve would reach a peak within the light distribution and decline further out. Perhaps an illustration is in order:</p>

The red line shows the expected rotation curve for the detected normal matter, which includes both the stars (yellow, from <a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/">2MASS</a>) and atomic gas (blue, from <a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/THINGS/Overview.html">THINGS</a>). This provides a good description of the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004IAUS..220..233S/abstract">inner rotation curve</a> but falls short further out. The excess observed rotation leads to the need for dark matter or MOND. Also noted is the extent of the rotation curve measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy">optically</a> to the effective edge of the stars (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.367..469D/abstract">Daigle et al. 2006</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/388/2/500/976912#305298177">Epinat et al. 2008</a>) and that measured with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/radio-interferometer">radio interferometric</a> observations of the gas (<a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2008/41/aa10120-08/aa10120-08.html">Boomsma et al. 2008</a>).</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>An obvious question is how far out rotation curves remain flat. In the rotation curves traced with optical observations by Rubin et al., the discrepancy was clear but modest – typically a factor of two in mass. It was possible to imagine that the mass-to-light ratios of stars increased with radius in a systematic way, bending the red line above to match the data out to the edge of the stars. This seemed unlikely, but neither did it seem like a huge ask.</p>



<p>Once one gets to the edge of the stellar distribution, most of the mass has been encompassed, and the rotation curve really should start to decline. Increasing the mass-to-light ratio of the stars ceases to be an option once we run out of stars*. Fortunately, the atomic gas typically extends to larger radii, so provides a tracer further out. Albert Bosma pursued this until there were again enough examples to establish that yes, flat rotation curves were the rule. They extended much further out, well beyond where the mass of the observed stars and gas could explain the data.</p>



<p>How much further out? It depends on the galaxy. A convenient metric is the scale length of the disk, which is a measure of the extent of the light distribution. Some galaxies are bigger than others. The peak of the contribution of the stars to the rotation curve occurs around 2.2 scale lengths. The rotation curve of NGC 6946 extends to about 7 scale lengths, far enough to make the discrepancy clear. For a long time, the record holder was <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991MNRAS.249..523B/abstract">NGC 2403</a>, with a rotation curve that remains flat for 20 scale lengths.</p>



<p>Twenty scale lengths is a long way out. It is observations like this that demanded dark matter halos that are much larger than the galaxies they contain. They also posed a puzzle, since we were still nowhere near finding the edge of the mass distribution. Rotation curves seemed to persist in being flat indefinitely.</p>



<h2>Results from gravitational lensing</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing">Weak gravitational lensing</a> provides a statistical technique to probe the gravitational potential of galaxies. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11677">Brouwer et al.</a> did pioneering work with data from the <a href="https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">KiDS survey</a>, and found that the <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2021/06/28/the-rar-extended-by-weak-lensing/">radial acceleration relation extended to much lower accelerations</a> than probed by the types of kinematic data discussed above. That implies that rotation curves remain flat way far out. How far?</p>



<p>Postdoc Tobias Mistele worked out an elegant technique to improve the analysis of lensing data. His <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15248">analysis corroborates</a> the findings of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11677">Brouwer et al</a>. It also provides the opportunity to push further out.</p>



<p>Weak gravitational lensing is a subtle effect – so subtle that one must coadd thousands of galaxies to get a signal. Beyond that, the limiting effect on the result is how isolated the galaxies are. Lensing is sensitive to all mass; if you go far enough out you start to run into other galaxies whose mass contributes to the signal. So one key is to identify isolated galaxies, and restrict the sample to them. KiDS is large enough to do this. Indeed, Mistele was able to show that while neighbors<sup>+</sup> were a definite concern for elliptical galaxies, they were much less of a problem for spirals. Consequently, we can trace the implied rotation curve way far out.</p>



<p>How far out? In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09685">new paper</a>, Mistele shows that rotation curves continue <em>way</em> far out. Way way way far out. I mean, damn.</p>

UGC 6614 was selected for this illustration because it has a comparable rotation speed to the KiDS average and because it is one of the largest galaxies known: the red points are already a very extended rotation curve.

<p>Optical rotation curves typically extend to the edge of the stellar disk. That’s about 8 kpc in the example of NGC 6946 given above. Radio observations of the atomic gas of that galaxy extend to 17 kpc. That fits within the first two tick marks on the graph with the lensing rotation curve. </p>



<p>UGC 6614 is a massive galaxy with a very extended low surface brightness disk. Its rotation curve is traced by <a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1993AJ....106..548V">radio data</a> to over 60 kpc. It is one of the most extended individual rotation curves known. The statistical lensing data push this out by a factor of ten, and more, with no end in sight. The flat rotation curves found by Rubin and Bosma and everyone else appear to persist indefinitely.</p>



<p>So what does it mean? First, flat rotation curves really are a law of nature, in the same sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">Kepler’s laws of planetary motion</a>. Galaxies don’t obey those planetary rules, they have their own <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2016/09/26/the-third-law-of-galactic-rotation/">set of rules</a>. This is what nature does. </p>



<p>In terms of dark matter halos, the extent of isolated galaxy rotation curves is surprisingly large. Just as we come to the edge of the stellar disk, then the gas disk, we should eventually hit the edge of the dark matter halo. In principle we can imagine this to be arbitrarily large, but in practice there are other galaxies in the universe so this cannot go one forever. </p>



<p>In the context of LCDM, we now have a pretty good idea of how extended halos should be from <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2021/02/16/galaxy-stellar-and-halo-masses-tension-between-abundance-matching-and-kinematics/">abundance matching</a>. A galaxy of the mass of UGC 6614 should live in a halo with a virial radius of about 300 kpc or less. There is some uncertainty in this, of course, but we really should have hit the edge with the lensing data. There should be some sign of it, but we see none.</p>



<p>One complication is the so-called 2-halo term. In addition to the primary dark matter halo that hosts a galaxy, when you get very far out, you run into other halos. Isolated galaxies are selected to avoid this to the extent possible, but eventually there will be some extra mass that causes extra lensing signal that would cause an overestimate of the rotation speed. I’ll forgo a detailed discussion of this for now (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09685">Mistele et al.</a> if you’re eager), but the bottom line is that it would require some unnatural fine-tuning for the 1+2 halo terms to add up to such flat rotation curves. There ought to be a perceptible feature in the transition from the primary halo to the surrounding environment. We don’t see that.</p>



<p>In the context of MOND, a flat rotation curve that persists indefinitely is completely natural. That’s what an isolated galaxy should do. Even in MOND there should be an environmental effect: the mass of everything else in the universe should impose an <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2020/12/18/statistical-detection-of-the-external-field-effect-from-large-scale-structure/">external field effect</a> that eventually limits the extent of the rotation curve. How this transition happens depends on the density of other galaxies; by selecting isolated galaxies this effect is put off as much as possible. Hopefully it will be detected as the data improve from projects like <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid">Euclid</a>.</p>



<p>The primary prediction of MOND is an indefinitely extended rotation curve; the external field effect is a subtle detail. Yet again, that is what we see: MOND gets it right without really trying, and in a way that makes little sense in terms of dark matter. Sometimes I wish MOND had never been invented so we could claim to have discovered something profoundly new, or at least discuss the empirical result without concern that the <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2022/02/08/a-script-for-every-observational-test/">data would get confused with the theory</a>. MOND predictions keep being corroborated, yet the community persists in ignoring its implications, <em>even in terms of dark matter</em>. It’s gotta be <a href="https://tritonstation.com/2023/01/05/question-of-the-year-and-a-challenge/">telling us something</a>. </p>



<p>We have a <a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/a-million-light-years-and-still-going/">press release</a> about this result, so perhaps you will see it kicking around your news feed. </p>



<hr/>



<p>*We could, of course, invoke dark stars, but that’s just an invisible horse of a different color. </p>



<p><sup>+</sup>There is a well known correlation between <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJ...236..351D/abstract">morphology and density</a> such that elliptical galaxies tend to live in the densest environments. This means that they are more likely to have neighbors that interfere with the lensing measurement, so finding that identifying isolated ellipticals with a clean lensing signal is more challenging that finding isolated spirals comes as no surprise. Isolated ellipticals do exist so it is possible, but one has to be very restrictive with the sample. </p>
