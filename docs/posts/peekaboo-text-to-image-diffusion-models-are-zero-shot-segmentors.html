      <span>Abstract:</span>  Recent diffusion-based generative models combined with vision-language models
are capable of creating realistic images from natural language prompts. While
these models are trained on large internet-scale datasets, such pre-trained
models are not directly introduced to any semantic localization or grounding.
Most current approaches for localization or grounding rely on human-annotated
localization information in the form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks.
The exceptions are a few unsupervised methods that utilize architectures or
loss functions geared towards localization, but they need to be trained
separately. In this work, we explore how off-the-shelf diffusion models,
trained with no exposure to such localization information, are capable of
grounding various semantic phrases with no segmentation-specific re-training.
An inference time optimization process is introduced, that is capable of
generating segmentation masks conditioned on natural language. We evaluate our
proposal Peekaboo for unsupervised semantic segmentation on the Pascal VOC
dataset. In addition, we evaluate for referring segmentation on the RefCOCO
dataset. In summary, we present a first zero-shot, open-vocabulary,
unsupervised (no localization information), semantic grounding technique
leveraging diffusion-based generative models with no re-training. Our code will
be released publicly.
