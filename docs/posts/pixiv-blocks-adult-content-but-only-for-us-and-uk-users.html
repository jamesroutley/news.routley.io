<p>A Japan-based online art platform is banning kink content for users based in the US and UK, as laws in these countries continue to tighten around sites that allow erotic content. </p><p>Pixiv is an image gallery site where artists primarily share illustrations, manga, and novels. The site <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=10835&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>announced</u></a> on April 22 that starting April 25, users whose account region is set to the US or UK will be subject to Pixiv’s new terms of use, “<a href="https://pixiv1.app.box.com/s/6uq41xs25m092e6co1vor3r98kr4embv?ref=404media.co"><u>Restrictions for Healthy Expression in Specific Countries and Regions</u></a>.”</p><p>The restrictions include several kinds of content that are illegal in the US, including sexualized depictions of minors and bestiality, as well as non-consensual depictions and deepfakes. But it also includes “content that appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards where you are located or where such content may be accessed or distributed, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, or otherwise violates any applicable obscenity laws, rules or regulations.” This is an invocation of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-obscenity?ref=404media.co"><u>the Miller test</u></a>, which determines non-constitutionally protected obscenity.</p><p>In the US, legislation is spreading rapidly that would levy heavy fines against sites that contain more than one third (and in <a href="https://www.404media.co/kansas-age-verification-porn/" rel="noreferrer">some states, one quarter</a>) sexual content <a href="https://www.404media.co/age-verification-laws-will-drag-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-of-online-porn/"><u>if they don’t verify all users’ ages</u></a>. </p><p>Niche Gamer, a gaming industry blog, <a href="https://nichegamer.com/pixiv-will-block-nsfw-content-for-users-in-us-and-uk/?ref=404media.co"><u>first reported</u></a> the Pixiv change. <a href="https://nichegamer.com/pixiv-new-content-restriction/?ref=404media.co"><u>In 2022</u></a>, it reported that Pixiv changed its terms for its Pixiv Fanbox platform—which allowed users to sell their content—forbidding users from selling content that contains bestiality, sexual exploitation of a minor, incest, rape, and non-consensual mutilation. </p><p>Artist platforms with rules against specific kinds of illegal acts often expand moderation of those rules beyond those kinds of content, and end up catching legal kink content creators in their nets. An artist who brought the latest terms of use change to my attention who goes by <a href="https://www.kradeelav.com/?ref=404media.co"><u>kradeelav</u></a> told me that she’s watched artist peers get kicked off Gumroad, Twitter, Deviantart, Tumblr, Discord, and dozens of other sites in the last five years. This seems like a “strong bellwether for how jittery international companies feel about legal visual art in the US,” she told me.</p><p>“I&#39;d never say this a few years ago, but it&#39;s my personal fear that the next step is most major internet hosting services implementing these policies on an infrastructure level,” kradeelav said. “My colleagues are certainly planning for it by specifically looking for kink-friendly hosts, to actually making homebrew servers themselves in worst-case scenarios.”</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.404media.co/gumroad-adult-content-creators-policy-nsfw-ban/"><u>online marketplace Gumroad announced</u></a> that it would no longer allow most types of adult content on its platform, and selling NSFW works, like “fetish-driven content,” “breast expansion” avatar mods, and adult comics are now among the banned material. Gumroad blamed banking partners as its reason for cracking down on erotic content, and the threat of payment processors leaving platforms has chilled sexual speech across the internet—most notably, when <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v33d/sex-workers-what-visa-and-mastercard-dropping-pornhub-means-to-performers?ref=404media.co"><u>Mastercard and Visa pulled services from Pornhub</u></a> in 2020.</p>
