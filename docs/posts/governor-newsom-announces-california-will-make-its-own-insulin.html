<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KION-TV)-- Governor Gavin Newsom announced Thursday a plan to allocate $100 million in state funding to have the state make its own insulin. </p>



<p>&#34;Nothing epitomizes market failure more than the cost of insulin,&#34; said Newsom. &#34;Many Americans experience out-of-pocket costs anywhere from $300 to $500 per month for this life-saving drug.&#34; </p>



<p>Half of the funding will go towards developing low-cost insulin products, and the other $50 million will be spent on a Califronia-based insulin manufacturing facility. </p>




<p>This is in hopes of creating new, high-paying jobs and a more robust supply chain in California. </p>
