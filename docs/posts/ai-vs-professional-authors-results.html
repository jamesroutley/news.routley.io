If I&#39;m interested in what it takes to smash a window I don&#39;t throw 8 anvils at 8 windows and 8 ping-pong balls at 8 windows and say, &#34;Welp, there you have it, anvils are 100% better than ping-pong balls.&#34; </i></p><p><i>In the first blog post 2 years ago the performance of the authors and AI overlapped but the authors did better on the whole. So my guess was correct, this is where the AI performance starts to falter.</i></p><p><i>In the second blog post we revist to see what has changed with 2 years development. I found the results interesting.</i></p><p><i>If I could have got a meaningful number of people to read 8 twenty-thousand-word novellas (I couldn&#39;t) and I could convince busy authors to write novellas for an experiment (I couldn&#39;t) then we would clearly get a 100% result in favour of the humans ... and ... have learned very little about the state of play.</i></p><p>The contributing authors have sold around 15 millions books between them. And they are...</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25307" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b><span>Robin Hobb</span></b></a></p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b><span>Janny Wurts</span></b></a></p><p><b><span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/710888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christian Cameron</a> / <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6535608" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Miles Cameron</a></span></b></p><p><b><span>&amp; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4721536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">me</a>!</span></b></p><p>In terms of ratings - when we did this 2 years ago, the scores were low. Six of the eight entries scored 3* or less. The people I can attract to vote in this like to read books. Short stories are unpopular in comparison, and the shorter they get the harder it is to tell a good tale. The ungenerous will suggest it is simply because none of the entries were great - I feel it&#39;s because book readers rate short stories lower than books.</p><p>Two years later, five of the eight entries scored 3* or above. You can consider the results below to see if that was because the humans did better, or the AI did better, or both.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieGxTIV7gs-eqTtLo10koay301iYnFTXZkXttuxdkI7UvQqTkiBXvQw4Op7ZeCxQPLUFbHuKyPLz0_dVW5aZTm0F8vAexkKT_-aIWNLDzfwZDWeciTpn3EoN1lzapdslX5LJjS43DSOQJBIbgUmUX0L_NZrVo4jKlj16VI2_QlUczKDkDCHZneU31I339W/s1456/demon2.jpg"><img data-original-height="980" data-original-width="1456" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieGxTIV7gs-eqTtLo10koay301iYnFTXZkXttuxdkI7UvQqTkiBXvQw4Op7ZeCxQPLUFbHuKyPLz0_dVW5aZTm0F8vAexkKT_-aIWNLDzfwZDWeciTpn3EoN1lzapdslX5LJjS43DSOQJBIbgUmUX0L_NZrVo4jKlj16VI2_QlUczKDkDCHZneU31I339W/s320/demon2.jpg" width="320"/></a></p><p>I have a Ph.D student on my patreon who constantly berates me for my terrible diagrams. Here&#39;s another one, just for you, Rae!</p><p>We had 964 votes on the issue of whether story 1 was by a human or AI. This fell fairly smoothly to 474 votes on the rating of story 8. </p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-3Gvw3Qj7Q5f88UQ9N9R6Z_ksx7mnDYk4qJPLgz5t-YcpdiXNHExq4LQYpCooqgUFUQOm7HWSwdGn71VWAfePYoH2qIQsMoJ1lau57kH9lyRm5kqCrY7F0vSQJyGi5WgyqMIHUBMGPPIPFsd4NpWU6_wa_UW8MMmKZl_RXLivvF7JDgd9JG_sXPGENpyI/s1392/AI%20results.jpg"><img data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1392" height="442" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-3Gvw3Qj7Q5f88UQ9N9R6Z_ksx7mnDYk4qJPLgz5t-YcpdiXNHExq4LQYpCooqgUFUQOm7HWSwdGn71VWAfePYoH2qIQsMoJ1lau57kH9lyRm5kqCrY7F0vSQJyGi5WgyqMIHUBMGPPIPFsd4NpWU6_wa_UW8MMmKZl_RXLivvF7JDgd9JG_sXPGENpyI/w640-h442/AI%20results.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>So, when it came to choosing, on average the public got 3 wrong, 3 right, and couldn&#39;t decide on 2. I.e. they&#39;re no more effective than a coin toss!</p></div><p>Two of these were too close to be statistically significant, but in some cases the votes were quite certain. A sizeable majority of people thought my story was human authored and a sizeable majority thought Janny&#39;s story was AI authored. So it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t have strong opinions/instincts ... it&#39;s just that they&#39;re no more likely to be correct than tossing a coin.</p><p>I asked (a new session) of ChatGPT to guess which ones were AI and it didn&#39;t do a good job either, despite generating them.</p><p>And the scores on the doors?</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgibCkMZOMJwXbUDn8aKMe0mPOvmlidZ4Ho6sD4XAS1jtWCkPFiFCjbCZ_7gQzM0lj060lK1_G37r_1gCsP2faLstCAaVQA5YxAWSdpJW4yDMp_9wKnxx6JxTER_RLu2PuFvXYk7LODeVsRoFmjB-n-Yl62-8DJfO7lI-kvyuTkoqUCkZt7eC_7jGsOmOYo/s974/AI%20result2.jpg"><img data-original-height="585" data-original-width="974" height="384" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgibCkMZOMJwXbUDn8aKMe0mPOvmlidZ4Ho6sD4XAS1jtWCkPFiFCjbCZ_7gQzM0lj060lK1_G37r_1gCsP2faLstCAaVQA5YxAWSdpJW4yDMp_9wKnxx6JxTER_RLu2PuFvXYk7LODeVsRoFmjB-n-Yl62-8DJfO7lI-kvyuTkoqUCkZt7eC_7jGsOmOYo/w640-h384/AI%20result2.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>And here the bad news is that the AI scored better than us. Not only was the highest rated story an AI one, but they scored higher on average too.</p><p>I asked the authors to do the test themselves. Only one has got back to me at time of posting.</p><p>That author made five guesses, four of which were wrong, and listed as their top two stories ... two AI generated ones...</p><p><b><span>Conclusion</span></b></p><p>First off, let me repeat my disclaimer about this not being a scientifically rigourous test.</p><p>Given that:</p><p>On the short scale it seems likely that people, on average, can&#39;t tell AI from human when it comes to fantasy writing.</p><p>If you got 6 right out of 8 ... well there&#39;s a ~15% chance of getting that result (or better) by chance, so rather than 15% of us patting ourselves on the back, we really we have to look to the bulk statistics for answers. And they don&#39;t look good.</p><p>In terms of enjoyment ... in this test the AI won.</p><p>Can AI generate a better book than Robin Hobb can write, absolutely not. Might it one day generate a book that would do better than one of hers in terms of sales and public acclaim? A few years ago I would have said &#39;absolutely not&#39;, at least in my lifetime. Now, it seems like a possibility, though hopefully an unlikely one (again - in my lifetime).</p><p>Should AI generate fiction, imagery, voices etc competing with artists in a number of fields and fooling the public. No, of course not. I hate that idea and most people do too.</p><p>Will it happen? It&#39;s already happening. Wherever anyone can circumvent skill and heart and just profiteer off a new technology, they&#39;re going to do it. People threaten people with knives in the street for a few dollars - are people going to try to sell you AI books ... of course.</p><p>I want AI to cure diseases. That&#39;s mostly it. But it looks like it was one of the belated escapees of Pandora&#39;s Box, and we&#39;re not going to be able to put it back.</p><p>Will I ever use AI to write anything (other than the bits of flash fiction in these tests). No.</p><p>Will I ever read AI fiction for pleasure. No. To quote someone wise: If nobody could be bothered to write this, why should I bother to read it?</p><p>It&#39;s a pretty grim outlook though, especially for new and future authors.</p><div><p>I had always felt that to write a great book that looked at human issues and offered insights, emotion, and enjoyment, would require an actual human, and that we wouldn&#39;t reach the point where a computer could do it any time soon.</p><p>I now wonder, if (and it&#39;s still a significant if) we get there ... will that mean that the AI is intelligent, alive in some sense, worthy of respect and rights? Will we have created an intelligent lifeform in lieu of going off into space and finding one? And is that a wise and/or moral thing to do?</p></div><p>It&#39;s a huge shock to me that fiction which, in this test, scores higher than great authors who write wonderful stories full of soul and heart and wit and intelligence, can be generated by the multiplication of a relatively small number of not particularly large matrices. On the face of it it undercuts so many things we value about being human.</p><p>There are many ways to argue against being too disheartened by this sort of thing. I advise you to seek them out. The future feels like a scary place right now, but I hope that, as far as the creative arts are concerned, AI runs up against a wall very soon and efforts are directed into doing tasks that benefit humanity rather than undermine it.</p></div></div>
