Some things, it seems, just cannot be hurried.  Back in 2007, your editor
first <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/233627/">started considering</a> alternatives to
the proprietary accounting system that had been used by LWN since the
beginning.  That search <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/496158/">became more urgent</a>
in 2012, and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/729088/">returned in 2017</a> with a
focused effort to find something better.  But another five years 
passed before some sort of conclusion was reached.  It has finally happened,
though; LWN is no longer using proprietary software for its accounting
needs.
</p><p>
The system used until now — QuickBooks — was a legacy from the beginnings
of the company in 1997.  It has long exhibited a full litany of the sorts
of misbehaviors endemic to proprietary systems.  Regular (paid) updates
were forced, despite the fact that new versions brought little in the way
of new capabilities.  Crashes were frequent; QuickBooks users know to make
backups every few minutes to avoid losing work.  The software had arbitrary
limits meant to force &#34;upgrades&#34; to the &#34;enterprise&#34; version.  More
recently, Intuit has discontinued support for the desktop version
entirely in an effort to force all users to its online, paid-by-the-month
service.
</p><p>
Enough was finally enough; your editor took some time to go back and review
the various systems that had been considered in the past.  It turned out
that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/729087/">the scripts</a> developed to pry data out
of QuickBooks still worked — at least, after a somewhat belated update to
Python 3.  In the end, the option that won out was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/731126/">GnuCash</a>.
</p><h4>How the decision was made</h4>
<p>
There is a wealth of free accounting systems available for Linux systems.
Many of them are highly complex and solve a much bigger problem; they
include features like inventory tracking, customer-relation management, and
more.  Such systems are unwieldy to work with and difficult to get started
with.  In truth, many of them appear to have been developed as platforms
for consulting businesses, though surely nobody would deliberately make
their software complex and tricky just to motivate clients to purchase
their services.  LWN prefers to not spend its hard-earned pennies that way,
and has no need for all of that complexity, so those systems were dropped
from consideration early on.
</p><p>
At the other end, there are a number of accounting systems that are based
on plain-text files and an associated set of programs.  These systems are
much easier to work with and are adaptable to most needs.  Such a system
could have been made to work for LWN, but they tend to lack some useful
features.  Check writing and report generation, for example, tend not to be
well supported.  The user interface for many operations is a text editor;
this is often seen as an advantage, but it becomes less so as the number of
transactions grows.  There are advantages to a graphical interface designed
for the job at hand.
</p><p>
GnuCash is not a perfect program by any means, but it does provide the
accounting features that LWN needs, along with a reasonable graphical
interface and a minimum of extra complexity.
</p><p>
The 2017 restart included a number of requirements that any new accounting
system had to meet:
</p><ul>
<li> Importing and exporting of data had to be doable — and relatively
     straightforward.  Getting our QuickBooks data into GnuCash took a bit
     of scripting using the capable (if poorly documented) Python bindings.
     Another set of scripts has since been written to import data from the
     site and from our bank account.  GnuCash has a reasonably capable
     import mechanism for the data formats exported by banks, complete with a
     Bayesian system to assign transactions to accounts, but a bit of
     scripting makes the process quicker yet.
</li><li> Basic accounting operations needed to be simple, and indeed they are.
</li><li> The generation of forms for our legal reporting requirements was on
     the list.  GnuCash has some features to handle this, though not for US
     forms.  In the end, this is a task that we now simply hand off to our
     accountant, who handles it with our annual taxes.  A related
     requirement is check printing, which is important for a business to be
     able to do; more on that below.
</li><li> Ease of integration with the rest of LWN&#39;s operation was mentioned
     above; the Python bindings make most things fairly easy to do.
</li><li> The last requirement had to do with the future longevity of the system
     — how healthy is its community?  The GnuCash project, having started
     in 1997, is slightly older than LWN; it is still here a
     quarter-century later and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/930917/">still making
     releases</a>.  GnuCash probably will not go away anytime soon.  That said,
     its development community is smaller than one might like, and progress
     is not rapid.
</li></ul>
<p>
All told, the requirements listed all those years ago have been met well
enough for the change to be made.
</p><h4>Some further impressions</h4>
<p>
There are a number of aspects of GnuCash that seem not quite finished.  For
example, it has had the ability to use an SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL,
or SQLite) for many years, but the native XML format is still
<a href="https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v4/C/gnucash-guide/basics-files1.html">described</a>
as &#34;<q>the most stable and established</q>&#34; and recommended for most users.
Storing data in PostgreSQL does work, and startup time is marginally faster
when using it.  Sadly, multi-user access is not supported, even when using
PostgreSQL.  Another example is the reconciliation process, which doesn&#39;t
remember what the previous reconciled value was and, instead, makes up
something strange.
</p><p>
GnuCash has a report-generation mechanism that has clearly had a lot of
effort put into it; the system is designed to be extensible by end users.
The unfortunate part is that the extension language is <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a>, and it is, for the most part,
undocumented.  Scheme looks like Lisp but isn&#39;t really Lisp; the number of
people who know it well is sure to be small.  The prospect of creating a
new report for GnuCash (or improving an existing one) can be a bit
daunting; see <a href="https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/blob/stable/gnucash/report/reports/standard/balance-sheet.scm">the
implementation of a balance sheet</a> for an example.  Your editor, in the
end, found it easier to just create new reports outside of GnuCash in
Python.
</p><p>
The ability to print checks has always been on the list.  Even in the US,
we write far fewer checks than we once did, but the need still does come
up.  GnuCash has that ability, and it can be made to work with just about
any check format.  The <a href="https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v4/C/gnucash-guide/check_format_info.html">language
used to add a new check format</a> is rudimentary, but it gets the job done in
the end.  One annoying feature of GnuCash&#39;s check printing is that address
information must be entered every time a check is printed, even if the
recipient&#39;s address is stored as, for example, a vendor in GnuCash.
</p><p>
The biggest thing we lose in this move is the ability to export data in a
format that our accountant can read directly into <i>his</i> proprietary
tax-preparation system.  He is willing to work with us, though, and
believes that the reports generated from GnuCash will be enough to get the
job done without a lot of additional effort (and expense).  Perhaps he,
too, is tired of hearing your editor&#39;s complaints about QuickBooks for all
these years is prepared to do almost anything to be done with that.
</p><p>
In the end, GnuCash is good enough to do what LWN needs it to do.  It is a
nice feeling to have gotten rid of the one proprietary program used in
LWN&#39;s operations, and to have better control over our accounting data.  The
new system is working well enough that your editor is kicking himself for
having waited so long to commit to the change.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
