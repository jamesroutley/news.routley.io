<div><p>This short post is for anyone interested in applying to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/about">RC</a> because they’d like to do more pairing, but isn’t sure how they’d actually <em>start</em> once they’re in <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>“Can I pair with you?” can seem like a daunting and direct thing to ask. Thankfully, RC provides a range of alternatives to the direct approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribing to the pairing bot for random matches with other people looking to pair</li>
<li>Posting to and reading posts from the Zulip pairing stream</li>
<li>Giving and attending end of week presentations</li>
<li>Attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding">Creative Coding</a> sessions on Thursdays</li>
<li>Generally being around and talking to people about what they’re up to, and what you’re up to</li>
<li>Working at the pairing stations in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc">virtual RC</a></li>
<li>Post and read check-ins on Zulip</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re a potential recurser reading this, hopefully you see something that could work for you. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t be discouraged. Take it to the people at RC - they&#39;re all kind, helpful, and passionate about making RC work for everyone.</p>

<li id="fn-1"><p>If you’re not yet sold on the wonders of pairing, even after reading what RC have to say about it in their <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-pairing">docs</a> , then I really recommend reading this <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html">article</a> by Birgitta Böckeler and Nina Siessegger.<a href="#fnref-1">↩</a></p></li>
