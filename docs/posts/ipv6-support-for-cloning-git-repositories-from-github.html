    <h1>IPv6 support for cloning Git repositories from GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p dir="auto">I vaguely remember that years ago (pre-MS, pre-pandemic) somewhere Github engineers held a talk (or maybe it was a blog posting?) which more less said that IPv6 is in the makes, but less trivial than one might think. I just can&#39;t find that talk or slides or so anymore. I also vaguely remember that they mentioned <code>ipv6.github.com</code> â€” which exists, but is just a (probably wildcard-) dummy page which just points to <a href="https://ipv6.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://ipv6.github.io/</a> (likely also a DNS wildcard) which then just states that there is no content yet. Probably because it (nowadays?) belongs to the Github user <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/IPv6/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/IPv6">@IPv6</a>. And the Wayback Machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/ipv6.github.com" rel="nofollow">only has a record from 2022</a> of that site. Maybe someone else remembers where that talk or blog posting was published.</p><p dir="auto">There even once was <code>github-ipv6.com</code> which worked as a reverse proxy according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/i110hy/comment/fztw4m9/?context=3_" rel="nofollow">this Reddit comment</a>, but since it no more exists, I guess they got a DCMA takedown or cease-and-desist noticed for using the Github trademark.</p><p dir="auto">But yeah, another Github user here with (on purpose) trying to run hosts IPv6 only and the first (and so far only) hard stumbling block was not being able to clone Git repos from Github. <g-emoji alias="pinched_fingers" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f90c.png">ðŸ¤Œ</g-emoji></p><p dir="auto">I wonder if I should use Gitlab.com for these repos, because they do have an AAAA record for their main site:</p><div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="â†’ host -t AAAA gitlab.com
gitlab.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:90:0:f22e:fbec:5bed:a9b9"><pre><code>â†’ host -t AAAA gitlab.com
gitlab.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:90:0:f22e:fbec:5bed:a9b9
</code></pre></div></div>
