    <h1>What does connecting with someone mean?</h1>

                <p>
                    I read a lot about the idea of connecting with people. They
                    say it&#39;s the reason to get good at conversation — so you can
                    connect. A problem I had with this advice is I couldn&#39;t find
                    a good explanation of what connecting means.

                    <b>It means mutual empathy — they <em>get</em> you and you
                        <em>get</em> them. It&#39;s discovering similar values,
                        experiences and perspectives. It&#39;s a feeling of trust
                        and comfort where you both feel safe to say what is
                        truly on your mind.</b>
                    That feeling is why I started this website. Six months I
                    asked myself what should I do for the rest of my life. A
                    good place to start was to figure out what makes me happy.
                    So, I wrote down the best experiences of my life so far. I
                    came up with 20. 19 of them were experiences where I
                    connected with people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans need connection. If loneliness is a disease then
                    connection is the cure. It fills a hole that can&#39;t be filled
                    any other way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Connecting requires lowering your guard to expose how
                        you think and feel. This leads to revealing your values,
                        experiences and perspectives.</b>
                    People hate small talk because it avoids this. The purpose
                    of social conversation is to connect but talking about the
                    weather or the latest sportz ball result reveals sh!t.

                <h2>Making friends is easy as a kid, hard as an adult</h2>
                <p>
                    As a child, I didn&#39;t have my guard up — because there was
                    nothing to guard. A six year old hardly has values,
                    experiences and perspectives. They freely offer how they
                    think and feel and thus instantly connect with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I grew up, I had experiences where exposing how I thought
                    and felt resulted in pain. Like when I asked someone out on
                    a date for the first time and was rejected. That required
                    exposing deep feelings, making me vulnerable. This mad the
                    pain of rejection <strong>visceral.</strong> I don&#39;t like
                    pain and try to avoid it. Therefore, I took steps to prevent
                    that from happening again — by erecting a concrete wall to
                    prevent anyone seeing who I was interested in. This protects
                    me. Makes me less vulnerable. As I continued to grow, I had
                    more of these experiences, so I erected more walls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time we&#39;re adults, we have so many walls that trying
                    to find out what someone thinks or feels is like talking to
                    a wall. These walls are a double edged sword. They protect
                    but also isolate. Preventing some painful experiences while
                    being the source of another — disconnection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we want to be happy, we need to have our needs met. This
                    requires lowering our walls. The next time someone asks
                    <em>&#34;How are you?&#34;</em>, try answering honestly.
