<p>The company started in 1969 as a subsidiary of Golden United Life Insurance. It was initially a computer time-sharing service. It offered data processing power to businesses that didn&#39;t have their own mainframe computers.</p><p>Rich Baker started working in the marketing department for CompuServe in 1976 and was director of corporate communications when he left in 1996. (Baker is currently a co-host on WOSU&#39;s <a href="https://www.wosu.org/show/bluegrass-ramble" data-cms-ai="0">Bluegrass Ramble</a>.)</p><p>&#34;They were giant computers. They&#39;d be like having 10 refrigerators stacked next to each other,&#34; Baker said. &#34;It had flashing lights. They had spinning tape reels.&#34; </p><p>Baker said the company’s data processing business was doing very well in the late 1970&#39;s.</p><p>&#34;It was serving some of the largest corporations in the country. But, you know, we still had those large mainframe computers that sat relatively idle in the evenings,&#34; Baker said.</p><p>So CompuServe tested the idea of giving that access to tech enthusiasts who were using these new devices called microcomputers. That developed into a business plan.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>On September 24, 1979, CompuServe launched its online service for consumers. </p><p>In the beginning, RadioShack stores were key in reaching early computer users.  Their TRS-80 desktop microcomputer was a popular choice when home computers first became available.</p><p>RadioShack marketed MicroNet, later rebranded CompuServe Information Service, alongside new computers and modems. In 1980, H&amp;R Block acquired the company.</p><p>Former tech journalist Dylan Tweney covered the industry for decades and was an early Compuserve user. He still remembers his first email address, 72241.443@compuserve.com. He also remembers the first email he sent.</p><p>&#34;I sent an email to my dad,&#34; Tweney said. His father, who was a professor at a university, had email access relatively early. &#34;I was so proud,&#34; he said.</p><p>In those days, users would sit at their computers and dial a phone number with their modems, sometimes placing an actual phone receiver onto the device.</p><p>&#34;The modem would make this hellacious noise. It would kind of screech and squawk,&#34; Tweney said.</p><p>Once the connection was made, users would see the CompuServe menu.</p><p>&#34;You&#39;d be online and on your computer screen was a bunch of text,&#34; Tweney said. &#34;So you&#39;d get a menu of options that would appear as green text on your black monitor and you would type commands or press numbers to indicate which menu item you wanted.&#34;</p><p>Those options included email, weather maps, stock quotes, online shopping and even booking airline tickets.</p><p>The speed was slow—about 30 or 40 million times slower than what we’re used to today. But for the first time, users could read the newspaper online. In fact, <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> was the first online newspaper. The Associated Press and other major newspapers soon followed.</p><p>Tweney said that while those features were impressive, CompuServe learned quickly that what computer users really wanted was<i> </i>human connection.</p><p>&#34;But it turned out that what was most popular is not reading reliable news sources, but just shooting the breeze with your friends or arguing with strangers over politics,&#34; Tweney said. </p><p>On CompuServe, this took place on something called the CB Simulator. It was basically an online chat. The name, “CB”, referred to the CB radios that gained popularity in the 70s.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Will Cowman started using CompuServe as a teenager and later went to work for the company. He said he would often use up his weekly allowance for an hour of time online, which cost $5 an hour. </p><p>Cowman said he enjoyed playing CompuServe&#39;s interactive text-based adventure games, but it was the CB Simulator that really grabbed him.</p><p><b>&#34;</b>I was very intrigued by my ability to communicate with people all around the world who didn&#39;t make any judgments about the fact that I was 14,&#34; Cowman said.</p><p>CompuServe also had popular forums that were divided into various areas of interest, everything from needlepoint to NASA. Cowman said that there were thousands of these forums.</p><p>&#34;These communities I connected to were really supportive and really interesting,&#34; Cowman said. &#34;People were very eager to help out and share and expand their online community.&#34;</p><p>CompuServe remained competitive with the other big online services, such as Prodigy and AOL, through the mid-1990s. However, none of these services were able to fully adapt to the huge shift that came with the internet and the World Wide Web, which was a wilder place where anyone could create their own website.</p><p>AOL acquired the CompuServe service in 1997 from H&amp;R Block. After that, remnants of the brand would survive for many years, but its heyday had passed.</p><p>According to Dylan Tweney, CompuServe should be remembered as a pioneer of digital community.</p><p>&#34;For a lot of people, CompuServe was a connection to the world and their first introduction to the idea that their computer could be more than a computer. It was a communications device, an information device,” Tweney said.</p><p><i>Thanks to Chris Marshall for submitting this question to </i><a href="https://www.wosu.org/curious-cbus" data-cms-ai="0"><i>Curious Cbus</i></a><i>.
