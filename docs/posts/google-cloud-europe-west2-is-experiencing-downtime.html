<li>Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if possible.</li>
<li>Impact Mitigation time:  11:05 US/Pacific</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DataFlow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the impacted area may be stuck. New Dataflow jobs may not start.</li>
<li>Workaround: Customers are advised to run their jobs in another region.</li>

<p>Description: We are experiencing an issue with multiple  cloud products beginning on Tuesday, 2022-07-19 06:33 US/Pacific.</p>
<p>Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-07-19 13:00 US/Pacific with current details.</p>
<p>We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.</p>
<p><strong>Product Impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Storage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Customers with data in the impacted region will see elevated errors when attempting to read objects</li>
<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Google BigQuery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Datasets will be unavailable for the impacted locations.</li>
<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may experience high error rates for Google App Engine and Cloud Functions in europe-west2 for requests coming through Cloud Pubsub, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and  Cloud Scheduler. Pubsub, Eventarc, and Cloud Tasks traffic will be automatically retried once the outage is resolved. Cloud Scheduler requests will need to be resubmitted.</li>
<li>Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if possible.</li>
<li>Impact Mitigation time:  11:05 US/Pacific</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DataFlow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the impacted area may be stuck. New Dataflow jobs may not start.</li>
<li>Workaround: Customers are advised to run their jobs in another region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cloud Composer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: All operations will experience downgraded performance in europe-west2.</li>
<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>

<li>Impact/Diagnosis: europe-west2-a is unavailable for all customers</li>
<li>Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cloud SQL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Non-HA instances backed by europe-west2-a are hard-down in europe-west2-a. Some HA instances are down in europe-west2-b/c (those with standby in europe-west2-a backed by europe-west2-a). Following operations are failing: Backups, creates, DMS migrations, updates, deletes, recreates (internal), restarts, exports.</li>
<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MemoryStore for Redis:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Persistent Disk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Existing PD devices in europe-west2-a may be unavailable. Replicated PD devices in europe-west2 may see some replica unavailability.</li>
<li>Workaround: Create PD devices in a different region/zone.</li>
<li>Impact mitigated: Starting at 11:18 US/Pacific, customers should be able to create new PD devices in europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>GKE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Certain portions of clusters with presence in europe-west2-a may be unavailable</li>

<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Customers hosted in europe-west2 will experience significantly increased failed requests.</li>
<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Workaround: None at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will be unable to perform any operations on Managed Active Directory (AD) domains which are single region (europe-west2). Customers will also experience a degraded experience if one domain controller is unavailable due to zonal impact.</li>
