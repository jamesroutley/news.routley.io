So Mr Bacon decided he would try and decode them. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span> Henri Breuli/Durham University/PA Wire</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dots like these from 23,000 years ago helped Ice Age hunter-gatherers survive</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He spent numerous hours on the internet and in the British Library consulting pictures of cave paintings and &#34;amassed as much data as possible and began looking for repeating patterns&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In particular, he examined a &#39;Y&#39; sign on some paintings, which he felt might be a symbol for &#34;giving birth&#34; because it showed one line growing out from another.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Neanderthal Museum, Mettmann/Durham University/PA </span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>These hand stencils and wild horses were created about 30,000 years ago</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With his research advancing, he brought in friends and senior academics. They encouraged him to continue with his investigations despite Mr Bacon being &#34;effectively a person off the street&#34;.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He collaborated with a team including two professors from Durham University and one from University College London and, by working out the birth cycles of similar present-day animals, they deduced that the number of marks on the cave paintings was a record, by lunar month, of the animals&#39; mating seasons. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Berenguer, M/Durham University/PA Wire</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dots and other markings were used to record animals&#39; reproductive cycles</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The team&#39;s findings were published in the Cambridge Archeological Journal.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Paul Pettitt, of Durham University, said he was &#34;glad he took it seriously&#34; when Mr Bacon contacted him. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The results show that Ice Age hunter-gatherers were the first to use a systemic calendar and marks to record information about major ecological events within that calendar.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Neanderthal Museum, Mettmann/Durham University/PA </span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>These drawings and markings were made 15,000 years ago</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He added: &#34;In turn, we&#39;re able to show that these people, who left a legacy of spectacular art in the caves of Lascaux [in France] and Altamira [in Spain], also left a record of early timekeeping that would eventually become commonplace among our species.&#34;  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Bacon said our ancestors were &#34;a lot more like us than we had previously thought. These people, separated from us by many millennia, are suddenly a lot closer&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Follow BBC London on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLondon">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclondon/?hl=en">Instagram</a>.
