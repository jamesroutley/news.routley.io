    <h1>The Burnout Machine</h1>

        <p><i>Originally written by Biozombie, published in 2600 Hacker Quarterly, Autumn 2024</i></p>
        <p>
            Let’s get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the &#34;dream
            job.&#34;
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and &#34;Agile&#34; processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of &#34;passion.&#34; And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it’s
            about
            &#34;responding to change over following a plan,&#34; but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the
            price.

        </p>
        <p>
            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -
            it’s
            expected. If you’re not
            pulling all-nighters, you’re &#34;not committed.&#34; If you’re not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you’re &#34;not a
            team player.&#34; This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what’s
            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you’re not &#34;on the cutting edge,&#34; you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it’s all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we’ll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s
            built. We don’t get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as
            we’re afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It’s
            about taking
            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re
            treated.
            It’s about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They’re
            showing us it can
            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            &#34;Enough.&#34; We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start the Conversation:</strong> Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you’re not alone.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Support Existing Efforts:</strong> If you’re in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Skills:</strong> We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be.</li>
            <li><strong>Push for Ethics:</strong> Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given
            us, the skills we’ve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize. Let’s take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it’s up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let’s make it a story we can be proud of.
