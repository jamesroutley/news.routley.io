    <h1>Amazon’s Ring to partner with Flock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon’s surveillance camera maker Ring announced a partnership on Thursday with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/y-combinators-police-surveillance-darling-flock-safety-raises-275m-at-7-5b-valuation/">Flock</a>, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.</p>

<p>Now agencies that use Flock can request that Ring doorbell users <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-expands-community-requests-to-additional-community-safety-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">share footage</a> to help with “evidence collection and investigative work.”</p>







<p>Flock cameras work by scanning the license plates and other identifying information about cars they see. Flock’s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/news/biased-technology-automated-discrimination-facial-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exacerbate</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/police-facial-recognition-technology-cant-tell-black-people-apart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">racial biases</a>.</p>

<p>On the same day that Ring announced this partnership, <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404 Media reported</a> that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.</p>

<p>Ring has long had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/amazon-ring-ftc-settlement-lax-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor track record</a> with keeping customers’ videos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/ring-neighbors-exposed-locations-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure</a>. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.</p>
