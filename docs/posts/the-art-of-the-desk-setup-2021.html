    <h1>The art of the desk setup (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update:</strong> a year after writing this post, I’ve published a new version of my
desk setup. Read this one first and then
<a href="https://arun.is/blog/evolution-desk-setup/">the new one</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I have invested heavily in my desk setup over my professional life, but I have
always felt some guilt. It felt like overkill. I used it only on the off days
when I stayed home for personal errands.</p>

<p>Before COVID, setting up a home office or desk setup was an interest of remote
workers and tech enthusiasts. Now, with most knowledge workers going remote
because of the pandemic, the desk setup has become essential.</p>
<p>For me, my desk is both a place for work and play. I spend most of my waking
hours working on <a href="https://www.get-carrot.com">Carrot</a>, writing this blog,
processing photos, and more. It’s part of a larger studio space that invites me
in every morning and inspires me to do my best work.</p>
<h2 id="creative-space-as-a-component-of-the-creative-process">Creative space as a component of the creative process</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arun.is/blog/palma-de-mallorca/">my visit to Mallorca a few years back</a>, I had the
fortune of visiting the studio of artist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Llu%C3%ADs_Sert">Josep Lluís Sert</a>, an
accomplished architect in his own right, envisioned it for his friend. I could
just feel the creativity flowing in the air.</p>

<p>That inspiration isn’t merely a result of an aesthetic veneer applied to the
buildings. It comes from deep inside — from the values and principles used in
its design, the materials, the textures, and the orientation with the
surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>Our desks are our artist’s studios. Visit
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/macsetups/?hl=en">@macsetups</a> on Instagram or
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macsetups/">/r/macsetups</a> on Reddit, and you’ll be met
with an endless stream of beautiful photographs of people’s desks.</p>
<div><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/515057532?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></p></div>
<p>While I appreciate the effort put into the presentation of the photographs, I
can’t help feeling like something is missing. I don’t just want to know a list
of the exact products used. What are the principles underlying the choices?
What’s the story behind that particular desk? How about that color scheme?</p>
<p>We have the opportunity not just to create something worthy of sharing on social
media. Why not do more? The ideal desk setup has the potential to immediately
transport us to a frame of mind that leads to the best work. It’s just like how
being dressed to the nines can give us a jolt of confidence when meeting
strangers.</p>
<p>As Marie Kondō writes
in <a href="https://amzn.to/3uiHkgU"><em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em></a>, “The
space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the
person we were in the past.”<sup id="1"><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup> Said
another way, the environment we work in should reflect the creative work we
aspire to create.</p>
<h2 id="two-principles-to-find-great-design">Two principles to find great design</h2>
<p>So how exactly do we create a space like that? To build the right creative
environment for myself, I look to a set of principles. The first two of these,
applies broadly to finding well-designed object, regardless of the use.</p>
<h3 id="principle-1-objects-must-form-an-emotional-bond-with-the-user">Principle 1: Objects must form an emotional bond with the user</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I love material objects. I’ve written at length about
Dieter Rams, Apple products, cameras, and industrial design. The things I’ve
carefully chosen to live my life with remind me of my job as a designer —
bringing order to the chaos. However, this love of physical items isn’t innate.</p>
<p>After saving up money from my first high school job, I decided to buy an MP3
player. It’s then that I discovered the world of gadget blogs and review sites.
I pored over them. The sites I was reading all pointed me to the Creative Nomad
Jukebox Zen. Reviews touted its class-leading 30GB storage as its primary
selling point.</p>
<p>I, however, wasn’t convinced. Besides the fact that some independent reviews
mentioned that the headphone jack was prone to breaking, I thought it looked
ugly.</p>
<p>There I was, about to spend 20% of my net worth on the first independent
purchase of my life. I wasn’t going to squander it on some plasticky
monstrosity. On a chance visit to the mall, I walked into the Apple store and
played with an iPod. That moment changed my life.</p>

    </span></p> <p><span>One is now forgotten, the other a
classic</span></p>
<p>I came away not only intending to buy an iPod, but with a new dimension of my
taste. I already had a side of me that read the reviews, did the research, and
tried to find the “best” of something, but this new side didn’t compare numbers
or stats. Instead, it cared about how something felt in hand, the sound it made
when I pressed a button, the typeface used on the interface, the box it came in.</p>
<p>I realized that objects must not only fulfill their functional purpose, but they
must also form an emotional bond with the user.</p>
<h3 id="principle-2-prefer-the-preowned-classic-to-the-brand-new-unproven-product">Principle 2: Prefer the preowned classic to the brand new, unproven product.</h3>
<p>The democratization of information means that nearly everyone wants to have the
best of everything. “A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that eighty per
cent of consumers look at online reviews before making major purchases, and a
host of studies have logged the strong influence those reviews have on the
decisions people make.”<sup id="2"><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>We want the best, from the restaurant for dinner tonight, to our next car, to
something as mundane as a vacuum cleaner. It’s not new. For decades,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Reports">Consumer Reports</a> has tested
and recommended the best of nearly anything someone could buy.</p>

<blockquote id="3"><p>“Perhaps the most miraculous part of Consumer Reports is that its work is
technically a public service: Its parent organization, which publishes the
magazine (and is also called Consumer Reports), is a nonprofit. The operation
launched in 1936, when consumer-protection laws were practically nonexistent,
and for much of its history the magazine has shaped both consumer sentiment
and government policy.”</p><sup><a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Today, Consumer Reports is slowly fading away as newer replacements shine in an
internet-first world.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirecutter_(website)">Wirecutter</a> is one of
those spiritual successors. I used to be a huge fan. I was a tech reporter in a
previous life and looked up to Wirecutter’s founder,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lam">Brian Lam</a> when he was editor-in-chief
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo">Gizmodo</a>. I loved that Wirecutter
takes the best of what made Consumer Reports great and mixed it with what makes
Gizmodo great.</p>

<p>Now, however, I’m not so sure I like it. As Owen Williams writes:</p>
<blockquote id="4"><p>“Review sites like Wirecutter are incentivized to pick products, even if they
aren’t perfect, because they don’t make money unless you buy something.
Instead of running advertising on their pages, Wirecutter relies on affiliate
links, offered by sites like Amazon. When you click “buy” on something the
site recommends and follow through with the purchase, Wirecutter gets a cut of
the sale price, which is higher the more expensive the product is.”</p><sup><a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>That’s a fundamental difference with Consumer Reports and its
customer-protection mentality. I’ve never seen Wirecutter simply recommend that
someone look on Craigslist or eBay for something even when that’s probably the
best option.</p>
<p>Phones, computers, or cars are constantly changing and there are clear
advantages with newer ones. Furniture, clothing, or household appliances, on the
other hand, have changed very little in half a century. It’s silly to constrain
ourselves to the world of what’s available new on a shelf, ready to ship to your
home in two days.</p>
<p>You tell me. If you are looking for an orange juicer, are you going to buy
<a href="https://amzn.to/2TfShmR">Wirecutter’s recommendation</a>? Or, would you rather own
<a href="https://arun.is/blog/braun-mpz2/">a piece from the 70s designed by legendary designers at Braun</a>
for the same price?</p>

<p>Sure, you would have to buy it used, but it’s also proven. It has survived half
a century and likely will survive yet another. And, obviously, it’s not ugly.</p>
<p>As Dieter Rams says in the fifth of his
<a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">ten principles for good design</a>,
“Good design is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They
are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore
be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.”</p>
<p>By constraining themselves to what’s still made today, sites like Wirecutter
completely miss the attractive, affordable options out there on the used market,
some of which are part of museum collections. The result is more ugliness. If
I’m going to see something every day, it better fit in with its surroundings.</p>
<p>Therefore when possible, I prefer the preowned classic to the brand new,
unproven product.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-hunt-for-good-design">How I hunt for good design</h2>
<p>If we are to ignore the review sites, where do we go? I’m not going to pretend
that I’m an expert, but I’ve learned a few things over the years.</p>
<p>The first is that museum collections are your friend. I regularly search
the <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/">MoMA</a>, <a href="https://collection.maas.museum/search?q=radio&amp;p=4">MAAS</a>,
and <a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt</a> collections when I
need an appliance or furniture. Often, I find something from one of these museum
collections for cheap on the used market. They are so obscure that there isn’t
much demand.</p>

<p>Some of these classic objects of design may seem expensive to buy. However,
their prices when used are usually quite stable. Buy one with cash. If you ever
decide that you no longer want it, you can sell it back for the same price.
That’s a big contrast to buying something new from Amazon, where there will be
some depreciation.</p>
<p>When buying office furniture and accessories, look where the big buyers go. Most
office furniture is sold by furniture companies like
<a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com">Herman Miller</a>,
<a href="https://www.steelcase.com">Steelcase</a>, and <a href="https://www.haworth.com">Haworth</a>
directly to businesses, hospitals, etc. The selection you’ll find is vastly
different from consumer-oriented retailers. You’ll find beautiful options that
you’ll never see on Amazon. As an added benefit, these business customers often
upgrade or go out-of-business, so items like chairs, lamps, and monitor arms hit
the used market for great prices in large quantities.</p>
<p>When buying used, patience is vital. I have found that it can take more than a
year of waiting to find the ideal piece. I’ve spent four years continuously
building my current desk setup.</p>
<h2 id="my-desk-setup">My desk setup</h2>
<p>That brings me to my creative space. I’m fortunate enough to have a light and
airy loft that I can call my studio. Perhaps in a future post, I’ll do a proper
tour of the whole space. For now, let’s focus on my desk setup.</p>
<p>In addition to the two principles that I listed previously, I’ve added three
more that are specific to my desk setup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Objects must not just fulfill their functional purpose; they must form an
emotional bond.</li>
<li>When possible, prefer the preowned classic to the brand new, unproven
product.</li>
<li>Minimize clutter and distractions. Part of this is picking a light, minimal
color palette.</li>
<li>Support as many different types of work as possible without needing rarely
used specialized equipment.</li>
<li>Change and iterate as my needs change.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="desk">Desk</h3>
<p>The perfect desk is large, soft to touch, and made of natural materials. I
previously had an IKEA Galant, but I found that the veneer surface was not
durable enough, especially at the edges. The perfect desk is height-adjustable.
I can move it up and down depending on if I am typing, writing, or standing.</p>
<p>After reviewing various options, including salvaging a desktop from a vintage
desk, I settled on the
<a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/gerton-tabletop-beech-50106773/">IKEA Gerton</a> for
the top. It’s formed from blocks of wood that are adhered together much like a
butcher block. It came unfinished, so I sanded it smooth and applied several
coats of matte polyurethane.</p>

<p>If I were to do it all again, I might choose a solid piece of wood instead since
the different pieces of wood warp differently through the seasons, causing
slight cracks and bumps. I’d also avoid polyurethane since it doesn’t hold up to
alcohol.</p>
<p>The base is the
<a href="https://www.fully.com/standing-desks.html">Jarvis standing desk</a> from Fully.
I’ve tried quite a few standing desks under $600, and the Jarvis is both quiet
and sturdy. I purchased just the frame without a top and attached it to the IKEA
Gerton myself.</p>

<p>Another option that I haven’t tried but would consider is the
<a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/height-adjustable-desks/solo-sit-stand-desk/">Steelcase Solo</a>.
All electrical components are integrated into a central spine under the desk,
removing the need for cables between the components. What a smart trick!</p>
<h3 id="cable-management">Cable management</h3>
<p>To minimize visual clutter while maintaining flexibility, I’ve built in a cable
management system.</p>
<p>There is a single cord leading to
<a href="https://amzn.to/2RL2zej">a three-foot-long power strip</a> with twelve outlets
spread across its length. It’s attached to the underside of the desk with
<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ti2mj9">3M Dual Lock</a> fasteners, which is essentially
industrial-strength Velcro. This configuration has two primary advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Items can be plugged in close to where they sit on the desk, avoiding the
need to snake cables across the length of the desk.</li>
<li>The outlets are spaced far enough away from each other that large power
bricks don’t block adjacent ports.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to the power strip, there are two
<a href="https://amzn.to/34eOMPG">Fully WireTamers</a> hanging from the desk’s back edge.
They hide all the power bricks, wires, and even a few storage drives.</p>
<h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>
<p>I love ergonomic chairs but don’t love their prices when new. Fortunately, there
is a large market for office furniture here in the Bay Area. For most of the
last decade, I used a <a href="https://amzn.to/3uig6Y7">Steelcase Think</a> that I bought
used.</p>
<p>All the while, my dream has been to own a
<a href="https://amzn.to/3fGxujY">Herman Miller Embody</a> someday. It has been a holy
grail for me. The view of the white skeleton-like spine and ribs contrasting to
the mesh back has etched itself into my memory over years of fawning over it.</p>
<p>Last year, I was lucky enough to find one used for an unbeatable price. The
tomato and white combination adds some much-needed color to the rest of the
setup.</p>

<p>As eye-catching as the Embody is, I stop noticing it within minutes of sitting
down. The chair is unbelievably comfortable.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://arun.is/images/2021-02-18-desk-setup/DSCF2663.jpg"/><img src="https://arun.is/images/2021-02-18-desk-setup/DSCF2667.jpg"/></p></div>
<p>Sometimes, after years of desiring something, when I finally acquire it, it is
unable to meet my inflated expectations. Fortunately, with the Herman Miller
Embody, that’s not the case. Seeing it at my desk every morning gives me a
little jolt of inspiration, and sitting on it does make everything else I do at
the desk better.</p>
<h3 id="monitor">Monitor</h3>
<p>A monitor is like a portal to another world. It serves so many purposes for me
during the day. Unsurprisingly, shopping for monitors is difficult.</p>
<p>Years ago, I used a 27” iMac. It had that brilliant 2560x1440 display panel that
Apple charged $999 for when purchased separately.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_angle">Viewing angles</a>, resolution,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density">pixel density</a>, brightness, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> were top-notch at the time.
If you had the money, you couldn’t go wrong with picking up one of those
displays and calling it a day.</p>
<p>Now however, with high
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate">refresh rates</a>, a wider variety of
aspect ratios, wide gamut, etc., buying a monitor is much more complicated.</p>
<p>I liked the pixel density of my iMac. As Steve
Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8j5vsqCCo">first described</a> when
announcing the Retina Display on the iPhone 4, the pixels of a display become
imperceptible at a certain distance. For the 27” iMac, this distance is 32
inches, just two inches more than the depth of my desk. So, most of the time,
the pixels were never perceptible to me. Therefore, when my iMac finally kicked
the bucket, I decided that I’d stick to a similar pixel density with its
replacement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I don’t care too much about color accuracy. Most of my time is
spent in writing and productivity software. When I need color accuracy, such as
when processing photos or designing graphics, I don’t mind using my laptop’s
built-in display. The refresh rate doesn’t matter since I’m not going to be
gaming on it. Importantly, I’d like as much screen space as possible since I
regularly open a single Figma canvas or multiple documents side-by-side.</p>
<p>I looked around and found several 40” 4K UHD monitors. The pixel density of 3840
× 2160 at that size is just a tad higher than the 27” 2560 x 1440 display in the
iMac. Perfect. I was about to order one when I doubted the viewing angles at the
edges. I did some basic trigonometry and realized that the edges of that
particular monitor would be outside the monitor’s viewing angles and would
appear discolored.</p>
<p>So, I kept looking and at last found the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3yDf6RJ">AOC C4008VU8</a>. It’s curved, so the edges remain within
viewing angles.</p>

<p>It has been an indispensable tool for the last three years that I’ve owned it.
Of course, it has a few rough edges like uneven bezel widths, mediocre build
quality, and ghosting when viewing fast-moving content. I can live with most of
that, though. The gigantic canvas it provides is a game-changer.</p>

<h3 id="wallpaper">Wallpaper</h3>
<p>For most of the last decade, I’ve been using the original wallpaper from Mac OS
X 10.4 Tiger — most
recently <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/">an upscaled version from 512pixels</a>.
It was the best and last in a line of abstract default wallpapers. For 10.5
Lion, Apple switched to a space-themed wallpaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://hector.me/aqueux">Aqueux</a> is a collection of dynamic wallpapers by
Hector Simpson based on that original wallpaper.</p>
<p>Hector did a bang-up job redrawing and thoroughly updating what I thought
couldn’t be improved. My favorite variations are the Sur and Solar dynamic
wallpapers that change with the time of day. Simply brilliant and worth much
more than the $3 that Hector is charging.</p>

<h3 id="screensaver">Screensaver</h3>
<p>My screensaver of choice is
called <a href="https://github.com/lekevicius/october30">october 30</a>. It cycles between
371 different variations of the Apple logo drawn by as many artists. The
illustrations were initially used as part of unique invitations to Apple’s
October 30, 2018 press event. Fortunately,
<a href="https://lekevicius.com/">Jonas Lekevicius</a> didn’t let them go to waste.</p>

<h3 id="monitor-arm">Monitor arm</h3>
<p>I love monitor arms since they free up desk space and enable tremendous
flexibility in positioning. I’ve used arms from Erogotron, Humanscale, and
Amazon. I didn’t love any of them. None have been sturdy, easily adjustable, and
aesthetically pleasing at the same time. And then I found the

<p>It, and another well-designed monitor arm, the
<a href="https://www.knoll.com/product/sapper-xyz">Sapper XYZ</a>, are challenging to find
if you confine your search to e-commerce sites. I picked up my Flo Plus from a
furniture supplier for less than 25% of the list price, including shipping. The
elegant cylindrical shape fades into the background. It doesn’t command
attention. Tension is easy to adjust because of the scale seen through a window.</p>

<h3 id="lamp">Lamp</h3>
<p>Previously I had a <a href="https://amzn.to/3vj0q8d">lamp from Xiaomi</a>. I bought it in
Shenzhen on <a href="https://arun.is/blog/exploring-hong-kong/">my trip to China a few years back</a>. It
was both pretty and functional, with the ability to control the color
temperature and the brightness. However, I found the build quality wanting.</p>
<p>When it comes to desk lamps, I have two favorites, both from
<a href="https://www.artemide.com/en/home">Artemide</a>.</p>
<p>The first is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3fhwBiB">Tizio</a>. It’s now considered a classic
of industrial design. Penned by the master Richard Sapper, the Tizio is a wonder
both aesthetically and mechanically. At first glance, it is stark, black,
angled, as if born from some science fiction world. It can be easily
disassembled since it has no wires leading from the base to the bulb. This is
possible because the frame carries the current — an innovation that seemingly no
other lamp has used.</p>
<p>In my setup, the Tizio would command too much attention. So I turned to other
favorite lamp, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3vmczJm">Tolomeo</a>.</p>

<p>Mine is the Mini size. Its polished base functions as the perfect landing pad
for keys, a wallet, or a phone. The arm of the lamp is architectural, portraying
both elegance and strength. The reflector is simple. The circular cut-out at the
top allows some light to go up, while most of it points towards the desk.
Mechanically, the Tolomeo isn’t as ingenious as the Tizio. However, it is
gorgeous.</p>

<p>I have written before that the more aesthetically-pleasing and well-built an
object, the more likely we will use it. That couldn’t be truer with the Artemide
Tolomeo. I use this lamp at my desk more than I have ever used any other lamp in
my life.</p>
<p>I bought my lamp used in excellent condition. It’s one of those objects that I
could quickly sell again for the exact price I paid if I ever wanted to part
with it.</p>
<h3 id="dock">Dock</h3>
<p>The dock is the heart of this setup. A single Thunderbolt 3 connection to my Mac
provides power and links to the monitor, two storage drives, the webcam, and any
temporary storage like USB drives or SD cards. I tried a few different docks and
had reliability problems with the others. This
<a href="https://amzn.to/3wwElmU">one from CalDigit</a> is rock solid and not too ugly.</p>

<p>When I call into video conferences, I connect a pair of wired headphones (my
wife’s
<a href="https://gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series/item/2-sr60e">Grado SR60e</a>)
using the 3.5mm jack at the front. I previously used wireless headphones from
Sony and Bose but found the need to charge the devices and occasional
disconnects too much of a nuisance. Wired headphones are far more reliable.</p>
<h3 id="desk-mat">Desk mat</h3>
<p>For the last ten years, I’ve arranged my peripherals very specifically — a
full-size keyboard with a trackpad to the left and a mouse to the right. In
design tools like Figma and Sketch, I can pan around the canvas with my left
hand and click on things with my right hand.</p>
<p>They sit on a desk mat that I cut from 3mm felt.</p>

<p>There are many commercial mats available, but they either aren’t the right size
or feature prominent logos. The desk mat serves three purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>It provides a planted, cushioned surface for my keyboard.</li>
<li>It reduces the visual clutter that the peripherals would otherwise create on
the bare desk surface.</li>
<li>It’s a coaster for when I bring a cold drink to the desk.</li>

<p>No one makes a better trackpad than Apple, so here there is no choice to be

<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>On the keyboard front, I’ve tried quite a few. I previously used the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3fgLWQL">Matias Tactile Pro and Mini Tactile Pro</a>. I loved the
switches’ feeling, but the keyboards and wires are unsightly, looking like
puffed-up versions of the USB keyboard that Apple first shipped with the Bondi
Blue iMac. Unfortunately, both broke and now live in a closet waiting to be
fixed or given away.</p>
<p>I’ve reverted to using <a href="https://amzn.to/3oK7b0e">Apple’s Magic Keyboard</a>. The
keys are tactile enough for day-to-day use. Crucially, the keyboard is reliable.</p>

<p>I’m also currently getting up to speed with a

but haven’t finished customizing it to my liking. Look out for a full review in

<h3 id="mouse">Mouse</h3>
<p>Mice are one class of peripheral that Apple seems to fail at completely. They do
such a great job of making human-centered products in most cases, but their mice
are painful to use. The Magic Mouse is beautiful, and the materials are durable.
However, the flat design gives me hand cramps within a few weeks of use. So,
I’ve been a loyal user of Logitech’s MX Master series.</p>
<p>I previously had an MX Master 2 in light gray, but that mouse eventually
discolored from exposure to the sun and oils from my hand. Hopefully, this
<a href="https://amzn.to/3wwykX6">MX Master 3</a> holds up better over time.</p>

<h3 id="webcam">Webcam</h3>
<p>Webcams seem to have been utterly ignored till very recently. Most are both ugly
and have terrible image quality. The
<a href="https://amzn.to/34ibGWg">Logitech Streamcam</a> is undoubtedly good looking. The
microphone is pretty good and I use it daily for video calls. However, I can’t
say that its image quality is stellar. The software is also both hard to use and
buggy. Let’s hope that some updates fix those issues. It’s good enough for now,
but I’ll likely upgrade to a mirrorless camera setup down the road.</p>

<h3 id="clock">Clock</h3>
<p>I, like most of you, spend a lot of time on video calls on my computer. I
quickly lose track of time, so that’s why I have a dedicated clock that I can
glance at. I picked this one up used since Muji seem to have discontinued it.
You may be able to <a href="https://amzn.to/2QOxupF">find it new at Amazon</a>. I bought it
because it was the best looking of various digital clocks I had seen. Only much
later did I realize that it was designed by one of my idols, Naoto Fukasawa.</p>

<h3 id="plant">Plant</h3>
<p>I didn’t want my whole desk to be covered in dead artificial objects, so I keep
a plant. This one is a succulent my wife planted in a pot and saucer that she
made at the local ceramics studio. It’s both art and a bit of greenery to
brighten my days.</p>

<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>
<p>The choice of computer, in this case, isn’t that important. Most of my work only
requires a moderately powerful computer. I currently switch between a 2018 15”
MacBook Pro, that I use during weekdays for my work at
<a href="https://www.get-carrot.com">Carrot</a>, and a 2013 13” MacBook Air for this blog
and other personal things.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/2QMdp38">2020 M1 MacBook Air</a> en route to replace the
2013 Air. I plan to connect the Pro to the dock during the day and the M1 Air on
nights and weekends.</p>
<h2 id="in-brief">In brief</h2>
<p>My desk setup is the marriage of modern technology and minimal industrial
design. It provides me both inspiration and utility. By combining my aesthetic
taste with my interest in technology, I’ve created a space for creative
expression.</p>

<p>This setup is also a creative work in itself. As my needs change, I remove or
replace items. On rare occasions, I finally get my hands on a long-coveted piece
of classic design. All the while, I continue to discover and refine the
principles I hold myself to.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Marie Kondo’s quote from earlier, my desk encourages me to grow
into my future self. It’s helping me embody the calm and considered quality that
I hope to convey in my work.</p>
