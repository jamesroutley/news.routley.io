<p>As part of my work with <a href="https://www.se3committee.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SE3</a>, I’m giving a presentation on retention in structural engineering in a few months (trust me, the irony is not lost on me). One of the most difficult things about working with the SE3 survey data is that it provides an incomplete picture of the structural engineering industry. </p>
<p>While there were over 5000 respondents to the survey in 2020, this represents only a fraction of professionals practicing structural engineering in the country. California alone has nearly 4400 licensed structural engineers and only had ~1100 responses to the survey; the next closest state was Texas with 300 respondents. I’ve wanted to look at licensure data for a while as a better metric of whether the profession is growing/shrinking/or staying stagnant, if only to see how much my own biases/experience color my perception of the field. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, 70-80% of the people I’ve vaguely kept in touch with after graduate school have left structural engineering. Some of the ones that <em>are</em> licensed and “practicing” are not traditional consulting engineers (i.e. someone designing a building or bridge and submitting stamped drawings to the city/state). The structural engineering and civil engineering subreddits are littered with dissatisfied engineers contemplating leaving the industry, some of whom have even taken the extra measure of getting a structural engineering license (a step beyond the typical professional engineering license). I know several people who have their SE license, but aren’t really using it since they can pay the maintenance fee and keep it in their back pocket in case they come back to the field.</p>

<p>But just what does licensure look like for structural engineers? I’ve touched on the cost and resources required for the <a href="https://mclare.blog/posts/a-year-of-professional-development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">professional</a> <a href="https://mclare.blog/posts/a-year-of-professional-development-pandemic-edition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">engineering</a> (PE exam), but the <a href="https://ncees.org/engineering/pe-structural/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">structural engineering (SE) exam</a> is an entirely different beast of 16 hours (split over 2 days) testing your knowledge of of vertical (gravity) and lateral (seismic and wind) design. Depending on the state, this exam may not be recognized any further than the PE exam, and there are very few states that absolutely require it to do any type of structural engineering work. Some states require it  piecemeal; you may be required to be an SE for special structures. </p>
<p>However, the experience requirements to even sit the exam also vary widely. In my state of California, my professional experience essentially reset when I passed my PE exam in California, which means I would need to practice for an additional three years to be eligible to take the exam, whereas in Nevada or Illinois, I’m already eligible to take the SE exam based on my current level of experience. It’s a patchwork of requirements that’s confusing to navigate and depending on where you settle down may be entirely unnecessary to advance your career.</p>

<p>Gathering data about PE/SE licensure was largely a mixed bag thanks to a lack of uniformity in state websites/databases. Some states happily provide an up-to-date csv data dump directly from their databases, while others only allow single license lookup. Others still would email you a csv “roster”, for the low low price of anywhere from $10 to $1000s (seriously, Louisiana and Hawaii, go home, you’re drunk if you think I’m paying thousands of dollars for PE info). The variance in approaches probably has to do with the type of data within these rosters. Some of them get entirely too specific for my purposes (providing emails, phone numbers, and addresses), where I’m really only interested in the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial year of licensure</li>
<li>Current license status (active / delinquent)</li>
<li>Expiration date of license</li>
<li>(If PE data) civil/structural subspecialty</li>
</ul>
<p>About half the states/territories had csvs or html pages that I could download and parse. Unfortunately a number of those (like Florida), do not include any information beyond “Professional Engineer” in terms of sub-specialty. Ultimately I chose to look at Illinois, California, Texas, and Massachusetts for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illinois</strong> was the first state to have a distinct SE license, establishing an SE licensure law back in 1915. Illinois is also one of the few states that has a practice restriction for structural engineering. You <em>cannot</em> practice any type of structural engineering related activities in Illinois without an SE license, so subsequently it’s a pretty popular place for people to knock out taking the SE exam earlier in their careers, since it is the first license required, rather than needing to hold a PE before being able to test for the SE.</li>
<li><strong>California</strong> is a state that has piecemeal SE adoption but heavily emphasizes the SE as a required credential for career advancement (if you look at the board of directors for just about any of the local National Counsel of Structural Engineers Associations in California, everyone has an SE). You <em>can</em> practice structural engineering in California without an SE, but you can’t design “significant structures”, including hospitals, schools, and bridges over 200 ft long. You also cannot use the credential “SE” after your name (putting structural engineer on your business card <em>could</em> land you in hot water… potentially). The pathway to getting an SE in California is possibly the longest one, since as I mentioned above, your experience resets once you pass the California PE (which has more exams than most states), unless you can prove a significant level of experience.</li>
<li><strong>Texas</strong> and <strong>Massachusetts</strong> do not recognize the SE as a credential, but you can get comity from being an SE in a state like California to be awarded a PE in Texas or Massachusetts. I chose these states because they were two of the few with easily downloadable rosters that included practice subspecialty info (breaking out PE licenses into electrical, mechanical, civil, structural, etc.**. They also have fairly large structural engineering markets based on population and major city size.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The above chart is interactive. Hover over a bar to get precise numbers for active licenses and inactive licenses based on the license year and choose which state to display from the dropdown menu.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first thing I looked at were the license stats: at what rate are people getting licensed as SEs/PEs, and are the numbers increasing every year (a quick look at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/edTool/data/engineering-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">graduation</a> <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/cip/civil-engineering#about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">statistics</a> revealed that civil engineering rates have increased linearly for the past 20 years). I used a stacked bar chart to also show how many licenses are inactive for those licensed in a given year.</p>
<p>In California, the number of SEs licensed in a given year is on a downward trend since reaching a peak in 2012. What’s more, when the exam was cancelled in Spring of 2020 (it’s only offered twice a year currently), the number of licenses awarded in the following year did not indicate a bounce back for test takers that delayed by a year plus those that were planning on testing in 2021 to begin with. California however, does not have a lot of delinquent licenses for “younger” engineers. This is likely due to the fact that once you get an SE license in CA, you do not have to do any continuing education requirements; you just need to pay the biannual license fee.</p>
<p>In Illinois, licensure rates have followed an increasing trend, but the plot does exhibit the same behavior as California where there was no bounce back (&gt; 2x expected new licensees compared to 2020) for test takers delayed by the pandemic. Additionally, there are a <em>lot</em> more delinquent licenses (either “inactive” or “not renewed”) among those who’ve held an SE license for 15 years or less. Illinois does require continuing education credits (a single PDH hour can cost hundreds of dollars), so people would be more likely to drop their license rather than hold onto it if contemplating leaving the profession.</p>
<p>For PE licenses, Texas has a strong upward trend with very few lapsed licenses, even though they require 15 hours of <a href="https://pels.texas.gov/cep.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">continuing education</a> per renewal cycle. Massachusetts has a surprising number of lapsed licenses, and a similar proportion to Illinois in terms of recent (within the past 15 years) licensees.</p>

<p><strong><em>The above chart is interactive. Hover over the line to get the average age of a license in a given year, or hover over a bar to get the precise number of active licensed professionals in a given year.</em></strong></p>
<p>Plotting the cumulative number of active licenses as well as the age of a license showed some interesting trends. As I suspected in California, the “age” of a license has been increasing with nearly the same slope since the 90s (aside from a brief leveling off around 2010) and is now 20 years old. In Illinois, the license age has been holding steady around 15 years since 2000. In Massachusetts and Texas, the age has also been approaching a steady value, though licenses in Massachusetts (18 years) are about 4 years older than those in Texas.</p>
<p>For active licensed professionals, all states other than Texas show signs of leveling off, though this is particularly pronounced in Massachusetts, where the number of active licensed PEs has hovered around 2400 for the past 20 years. </p>
<p>For a healthy growing profession, I would expect to see level or downward trends for the age of a license, and a linearly increasing number of active licenses (this is assuming that graduation rates for the field are continuing to grow linearly as previously mentioned), but this does not appear to be the case for anywhere other than Texas.</p>

<p><strong><em>The above charts are interactive. You can choose the state and year of interest to see the distribution of years of experience or years of experience before exiting the profession as a histogram.</em></strong></p>
<p>For the sake of completion, I also broke out the distribution of years in practice (the average value plotted as a line in the previous plot).</p>
<p>For California, this showed the bimodal distribution of years of experience for SEs as of 2021. In Massachusetts, these plots potentially indicate that the greatest number of exits from the profession occur in the first 15 years.</p>

<p>While I’m not going to do an in-depth statistical analysis, because 1) I don’t have the data, 2) I don’t have the time, and 3) No one is paying me to do this, this exercise confirmed some of my suspicions, but left a few others up in the air. Based on what I’ve seen, I can’t say that there are a growing number of people in my generation attaining the highest level of SE licensure and leaving the profession, but I can say that it does seem like fewer people are getting an SE license and those that do are not necessarily holding onto it. The profession appears to be growing older as well, and I don’t think additional gate-keeping with more certifications and required education or exams (as suggested by the <a href="https://www.asce.org/-/media/asce-images-and-files/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/structural-engineering/documents/selc-a-vision-for-the-future-of-structural-engineering-licensure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vision for the Future of Structural Engineering Licensure Report</a>) is going to bolster the numbers anytime soon.</p></div></div>
