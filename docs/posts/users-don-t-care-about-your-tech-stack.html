    <h1>Users don&#39;t care about your tech stack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I still often find myself in discussions where the main focus is the choice of technologies. Questions like <em>“Is this language better than that one?”</em> or <em>“Is this framework more performant than the other?”</em> keep coming up. But the truth is: <strong>users don’t care about any of that</strong>. They won’t notice those extra 10 milliseconds you saved, nor will their experience magically improve just because you’re using the latest JavaScript framework.</p>
<p>What truly makes a difference for users is your attention to the <strong>product</strong> and their <strong>needs</strong>.</p>
<p>Every programming language shines in specific contexts. Every framework is born to solve certain problems. But none of these technical decisions, in isolation, will define the success of your product from a user’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-should-you-focus-on"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#so-what-should-you-focus-on"><span></span></a>So, what should you focus on?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use what you know well.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use what you enjoy working with.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use what challenges and motivates you to improve every day.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t get swept up by the hype. Sure, set aside time to explore new technologies that catch your interest, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking that building a great product requires the same stack featured in the latest YouTube tutorial from your favorite tech influencer.</p>
<p>Learn to distinguish between tech choices that are <strong>interesting to you</strong> and those that are genuinely <strong>valuable for your product and your users</strong>. Finding the right balance is key to creating something truly impactful.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There are no “best” languages or frameworks. There are only technologies designed to solve specific problems, and your job is to pick the ones that fit your use case—not because they’re trendy, but because they’re the right tool for the job.</p></div></div>
