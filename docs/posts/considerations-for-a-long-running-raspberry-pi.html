Several classes of things can go wrong, and you need to consider how your Pi will recover from each of them — and <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2023/12/Consider-the-risks-before-making-any-dramatic-changes-to-your-Raspberry-Pi-setup.html">weigh the risks of each solution against its benefits</a>.</p><p>This new set of posts in <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/series/pi-reliability.html">my Raspberry Pi Reliability series</a> covers each class of issues I’ve run into, and what I’ve done to solve them.
