    <h1>People can read their manager&#39;s mind (2015)</h1>

<p>The fish rots from the head down.</p>
<p><em>– A beaten saying</em></p>
</div>
<p>People generally don&#39;t do what they&#39;re told, but what they expect to be rewarded for. Managers often say they&#39;ll reward
something – perhaps they even believe it. But then they proceed to reward different things.</p>
<p>I think people are fairly good at predicting this discrepancy. The more productive they are, the better they tend to be at
predicting it. Consequently, management&#39;s stated goals will tend to go unfulfilled whenever <em>deep down</em>, management
doesn&#39;t value the sort of work that goes into achieving these goals.</p>
<p>So not only is paying lip service to these goals worthless, but so is lying to oneself and <em>genuinely convincing</em>
oneself. When time comes to reward people, it is the gut feeling of whose work is truly remarkable that matters. And what you
usually convince yourself of is that the <em>goal</em> is important – but <em>not</em> that achieving it is remarkable. In fact,
often someone pursuing what you think are <em>unimportant</em> goals in a way that you admire will impress you more than someone
doing &#34;important grunt work&#34; (in your eyes.)</p>
<p>You then live happily with this compartmentalization – an important goal to be achieved by unremarkable people. However,
nobody is fooled except you. The people whose compensation depends on your opinion have ample time to remember and analyze your
past words and decisions – more time than you, in fact, and a stronger incentive. And so their mental model of you is often much
better than your own. So they ignore your requests and become valued, instead of following them and sinking into obscurity.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A manager truly appreciates original mathematical ideas. The manager requests to rid the code of crash-causing bugs, because
customers resent crashes. The most confident people ignore him and spend time coming up with original math. The less confident
people spend time chasing bugs, are upset by the lack of recognition, and eventually leave for greener pastures. At any given
moment, the code base is ridden by crash-causing bugs.</li>
<li>A manager enjoys &#34;software architecture&#34;, design patterns, and language lawyer type of knowledge. The manager requests to
cooperate better with neighboring teams who are upset by missing functionality in the beautifully architected software. People
will tend to keep designing more patterns into the program.</li>
<li>A highly influential figure enjoys hacking on their machine. The influential figure points out the importance of solid,
highly-available infrastructure to support development. The department responsible for said infrastructure will guarantee that
<em>he</em> gets as much bandwidth, RAM, screen pixels and other goodies as they can supply, knowing that the infrastructure he
<em>really</em> cares about is that which enables the happy hacking on his machine. The rest of the org might well remain stuck
with a turd of an infrastructure.</li>
<li>A manager loathes spending money. The manager requires to build highly-available infrastructure to support development.
People responsible for infrastructure will build a piece of shit out of yesteryear&#39;s scraps purchased at nearby failing
companies for peanuts, knowing that they&#39;ll be rewarded.</li>
<li>A manager is all about timely delivery, and he did very little code maintenance in his life. The manager nominally realizes
that a lot of code is used in multiple shipping products; that it takes some time to make a change compatible with all the
client code; and that <em>branching the entire code base</em> is a quick way to do the work for this delivery, but you&#39;ll pay
for the shortcut many times over in each of your future deliveries. People will fork the code base for every shipping product.
(I&#39;ve seen it and heard about it more times than the luckier readers would believe.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And so it goes. If something is rotten in an org, the root cause is a manager who doesn&#39;t value <em>the work</em> needed to
fix it. They <em>might</em> value it being fixed, but of course no sane employee gives a shit about <em>that</em>. A sane
employee cares whether <em>they</em> are valued. Three corollaries follow:</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 1.</strong> Who can, and sometimes does, un-rot the fish from the bottom? An <em>insane</em> employee.
Someone who finds the forks, crashes, etc. a personal offense, and will repeatedly risk annoying management by fighting to stop
these things. Especially someone who spends their own political capital, hard earned doing things management truly values, on
doing work they don&#39;t truly value – such a person can keep fighting for a long time. Some people manage to make a career out of
it by persisting until management truly changes their mind and rewards them. Whatever the odds of that, the average person
cannot comprehend the motivation of someone attempting such a feat.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 2</strong>. When does the fish un-rot from the top? When a manager is taught by experience that (1)
neglecting this thing is harmful and (2) it&#39;s actually hard to get it right (that is, the manager himself, or someone he
considers smart, tried and failed.) But that takes managers admitting mistakes and learning from them. Such managers exist; to
be called one of them would exceed my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 3.</strong> Managers who can&#39;t make themselves value <em>all</em> important work should at least realize
this: their goals do not automatically become their employees&#39; goals. On the contrary, much or most of a manager&#39;s job is to
align these goals – and if it were that easy, perhaps they wouldn&#39;t pay managers that much, now would they? I find it a blessing
to be able to tell a manager, &#34;you don&#39;t really value this work so it won&#39;t get done.&#34; In fact, it&#39;s a blessing even if they
ignore me. That they can hear this sort of thing without exploding means they can be reasoned with. To be considered such a
manger is the apex of my ambitions.</p>
<p>Finally, don&#39;t expect people to enlighten you and tell you what your blind spots are. Becoming a manager means losing the
privilege of being told what&#39;s what. It&#39;s a trap to think of oneself as just the same reasonable guy and why wouldn&#39;t they want
to talk to me. The right question is, why <em>would</em> they? Is the risk worth it for them? Only if they take your org&#39;s
problem very personally, which most people quite sensibly don&#39;t. Someone telling me what&#39;s what is a thing to thank for, but not
to count on.</p>
<p>The safe assumption is, they read your mind like an open book, and perhaps they read it out loud to each other – but not to
<em>you</em>. The only way to deal with the problems I cause is an honest journey into the depths of my own rotten mind.</p>
<p>P.S. As it often happens, I wanted to write this for years (the working title was &#34;people know their true KPIs&#34;), but I
didn&#39;t. I was prompted to finally write it by reading Dan Luu&#39;s excellent &#34;<a href="http://danluu.com/wat/">How Completely
Messed Up Practices Become Normal</a>&#34;, where he says, among other things, &#34;It’s sort of funny that this ends up being a problem
about incentives. As an industry, we spend a lot of time thinking about how to incentivize consumers into doing what we want.
But then we set up incentive systems that are generally agreed upon as incentivizing us to do the wrong things...&#34; I guess this
is my take on the incentives issue – real incentives vs stated incentives; I believe people often break rules put in place to
achieve a stated goal in order to do the kind of work that is truly valued (<em>even regardless of whether that work&#39;s goal is
valued.</em>) It&#39;s funny how I effectively comment on Dan&#39;s blog two times in a row, his blog having become easily my favorite
&#34;tech blog&#34;, while my own is kinda fading away as I spend my free time learning to animate.</p>
