    <h1>AI Can&#39;t Even Fix a Simple Bug — But Sure, Let&#39;s Fire Engineers</h1>

      <p><em>Reddit discovered the funniest thing in tech this week, and it shows exactly how broken the AI narrative is.</em></p>

<p>The newly released GitHub Copilot agent was given permission to make pull requests on Microsoft’s .NET runtime, and the results couldn’t be funnier.</p>

<p>The AI confidently submitted broken code, while human developers patiently explained why it didn’t work. Over and over again, for days.</p>

    I feel bad for the engineers in this <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115733" target="_blank">PR</a>, but I also can&#39;t stop laughing.

<p>What’s worse is that CEOs are using this same technology to <strong>justify laying off entire engineering teams.</strong></p>

<h2 id="comedy-show">Comedy show</h2>

<p>I spent way too much time scrolling through these PRs. The pattern was always the same:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI: “I fixed the issue!”</li>
  <li>Human: “Your code isn’t working and you broke other tests.”</li>
  <li>AI: “You’re absolutely right! Fixed it now.”</li>
  <li><em>Still not fixed.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This went on for days. Multiple rounds of the AI insisting it solved problems, while making them worse.</p>

<p>And somewhere, executives are watching this thinking, <em>“Yeah, this is ready to replace our engineering team.”</em></p>



<p>I don’t want to sound like an AI hater, I use AI for coding daily. It’s genuinely made me more productive.</p>

<p>But here’s what’s actually happening with these layoffs: Companies over-hired during the pandemic boom. Now they need to cut costs. AI gave them the perfect cover story.</p>

<p>Instead of admitting <em>“We planned poorly,”</em> they get to sound visionary: <em>“We’re leveraging AI to optimize workforce efficiency!”</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I know a startup founder who just raised Series A. He messaged me about wanting to hire three more engineers.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you using AI to do more with fewer people?” I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed. “AI makes my team unstoppable. Why would I want fewer unstoppable people?”</p>

<h2 id="what-devs-need-to-do-right-now">What devs need to do right now</h2>

<p>If you’re worried about AI layoffs, here’s your playbook:</p>


      

      

<ul>
<li><strong>Become the AI expert on your team.</strong> Don&#39;t fight the tools, master them. Be <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning">the person who knows when AI helps and when it hurts.</a></li>

<li><strong>Document everything AI can&#39;t do.</strong> Keep a running list of complex problems you solve that AI suggestions couldn&#39;t handle. Things like system design decisions, business logic that required domain knowledge, or bugs that needed deep debugging.</li>

<li><strong>Make it public.</strong> Share your real AI experiences on social media. Post screenshots of AI failing at complex tasks alongside examples where it actually helped. Show the world that human + AI is the future, not AI alone. </li>

<li><strong>Create the narrative.</strong> Every time you solve something AI couldn&#39;t, tweet about it. When AI helps you ship faster, share that too. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

<p>If your CEO is talking about AI layoffs, update your resume. Not because AI will replace you, but because you’re working for someone who thinks a technology that <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers">can’t understand a simple bug</a> is ready to run their engineering org.</p>

<p>AI has become a part of software development, but it isn’t perfect. Humans are needed more than ever.</p>

<p>And if you want proof, just check those <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/" target="_blank">Microsoft PRs</a>. The AI is still confidently wrong. The humans are still patiently fixing everything.</p>

<p>So trust me, your job is safe.</p>
