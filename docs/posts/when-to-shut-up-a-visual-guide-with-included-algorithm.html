    <h1>When to Shut Up: A Visual Guide (With Included Algorithm)</h1>

<p>From time to time, many of us find ourselves delivering speeches of various sorts: 
   best-man toasts, employee training sessions, or extended monologues delivered to a confused Arby&#39;s employee.</p>

<p>It can be tricky, however, to determine the optimal duration of such speech.</p>

<p>Below, I&#39;ve compiled a visual guide to help you figure out when you should put a sock in it.</p>

<p>Following these rules won&#39;t necessarily guarantee a successful speech — that largely depends on 
   the quality of the content — but it will guarantee that excessive duration is not the chief complaint.</p>

<p>In addition to the visual guide, I&#39;ve also included an accompanying algorithm that implements the logic from the guide.</p>

<p><a href="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shut_up.jpg" target="_new"><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shut_up.jpg"/></a></p><p>In case you&#39;re curious about the format of the flow chart shown in the image above, it&#39;s a Drakon chart.</p>

<p>Drakon was developed as part of the now-defunct Soviet space program to produce flow charts with tidy control structures.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to experiment with your own Drakon charts, check out <a href="https://drakonhub.com">DrakonHub.com</a></p>

<h3>The algorithm</h3>


<p>Below is a simple Python algorithm that (roughly) implements the logic shown in the flow chart above.</p>

<pre>def when_should_i_shut_up(
    threshold = &#34;optimal&#34;,  # one of: &#34;safe&#34;, &#34;optimal&#34;, &#34;maximum&#34;
    speech_solicited = False,
    speaker_prepared = False,
    speech_outlined = False,
    speaker_experienced = False,
    audience_knows_time = False,
    speech_written = False,
    audience_paid = False,
    speaker_is_jesus = False,
):
    if not speech_solicited:
        speech_minutes = (0, 0, 1)
    elif not speaker_prepared:
        speech_minutes = (1, 2, 3)
    elif not speech_outlined:
        speech_minutes = (2, 2, 3)
    elif not speaker_experienced:
        speech_minutes = (3, 4, 5)
    elif not audience_knows_time:
        speech_minutes = (5, 8, 10)
    else:
        speech_minutes = (15, 30, 60)

    if speech_minutes:
        if threshold == &#34;safe&#34;:
            result = speech_minutes[0]
        elif threshold == &#34;optimal&#34;:
            result = speech_minutes[1]
        else:
            result = speech_minutes[2]

    if speaker_experienced or audience_knows_time:
        if speech_written:
            result = int(result * 1.2)

    if audience_paid:
        result = result + (30 if threshold != &#34;maximum&#34; else 60)

    if speaker_is_jesus:
        result = float(&#39;inf&#39;)

    return result
