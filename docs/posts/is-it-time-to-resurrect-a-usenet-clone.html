    <h1>Ask HN: Is it time to resurrect a Usenet clone?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The current events of Reddit and Stack Exchange amplifying a thought that communities and users&#39; contributions should be decentralized. The current structure of online communication poses a major risk.</p><p>1. There has to be a movement at both protocol and community-level to bring a Usenet like forum for general consumption. Different decetralized subgroups hosting and replicating the communities for others.</p><p>2. The model needs to be rethought to ensure that the thoughts and knowledge of communities and users belong to them.</p><p>3. These forums should encourage less anonymity and more persistent communication.</p><p>4. Trustworthy individuals should run these forums, chosen by the community. Individual groups, academia, organizations running the communities but easily redistributed across to people who want it. This was usenet.</p><p>Failure to address these issues allows mega companies to exploit data and control access against users&#39; wishes.</p><p>Taking action is crucial to prevent unfavorable outcomes and hold ourselves accountable.</p></div></div></div>
