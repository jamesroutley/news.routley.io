    <h1>Residential Networking over Telephone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Recently, I covered some of the history of <a href="https://computer.rip/2025-01-05-pairs-not-taken.html">Ethernet&#39;s tenuous relationship
with installed telephone
cabling</a>. That article
focused on the earlier and more business-oriented products, but many of you
probably know that there have been a number of efforts to install IP networking
over installed telephone wiring in a residential and SOHO environment. There is
a broader category of &#34;computer networking over things you already have in your
house,&#34; and some products remain pretty popular today, although seemingly less
so in the US than in Europe.</p>
<p>The grandparent of these products is probably PhoneNet, a fairly popular
product introduced by Farallon in the mid-&#39;80s. At the time, local area
networking for microcomputers was far from settled. Just about every vendor had
their own proprietary solution, although many of them had shared heritage and
resulting similarities. Apple Computer was struggling with the situation just
like everyone; in 1983 they introduced an XNS-based network stack for the Lisa
called AppleNet and then almost immediately gave up on it [1]. Steve Jobs made
the call to adopt IBM&#39;s token ring instead, which would have seemed like a
pretty safe bet at the time because of IBM&#39;s general prominence in the
computing industry. Besides, Apple was enjoying a period of warming relations
with IBM, part of the 1980s-1990s pattern of Apple and Microsoft alternately
courting IBM as their gateway into business computing.</p>
<p>The vision of token ring as the Apple network standard died the way a lot of
token ring visions did, to the late delivery and high cost of IBM&#39;s design.
While Apple was waiting around for token ring to materialize, they sort of
stumbled into their own LAN suite, AppleTalk [2]. AppleTalk was basically an
expansion of the unusually sophisticated peripheral interconnect used by the
Macintosh to longer cable runs. Apple put a lot of software work into it,
creating a pretty impressive zero-configuration experience that did a lot to
popularize the idea of LANs outside of organizations large enough to have
dedicated network administrators. The hardware was a little more, well, weird.
In true Apple fashion, AppleTalk launched with a requirement for weird
proprietary cables. To be fair, one of the reasons for the system&#39;s enduring
popularity was its low cost compared to Ethernet or token ring. They weren&#39;t
price gouging on the cables the way they might seem to today. Still, they were
a decided inconvenience, especially when trying to connect machines across more
than one room.</p>
<p>One of the great things about AppleTalk, in this context, is that it was very
slow. As a result, even though the physical layer was basically RS-422, the
electrical requirements for the cabling were pretty relaxed. Apple had already
taken advantage of this for cost reduction, using a shared signal ground on the
long cables rather than the dedicated differential pairs typical for RS-422.
A hobbyist realized that you could push this further, and designed a passive
dongle that used telephone wiring as a replacement for Apple&#39;s more expensive
dongle and cables. He filed a patent and sold it to Farallon, who introduced
the product as PhoneNet.</p>
<p>PhoneNet was a big hit. It was cheaper than Apple&#39;s solution for the same
performance, and even better, because AppleTalk was already a bus topology it
could be used directly over the existing parallel-wired telephone cabling in a
typical house or small office. For a lot of people with heritage in the Apple
tradition of computing, it&#39;ll be the first LAN they ever used. Larger offices
even used it because of the popularity of Macs in certain industries and the
simplicity of patching their existing telephone cables for AppleTalk use; in my
teenage years I worked in an office suite in downtown Portland that hadn&#39;t seen
a remodel for a while and still had telephone jacks labeled &#34;PhoneNet&#34; at the
desks.</p>
<p>PhoneNet had one important limitation compared to the network-over-telephone
products that would follow: it could not coexist with telephony. Well, it
could, in a sense, and was advertised as such. But PhoneNet signaled within
the voice band, so it required dedicated telephone pairs. In a lot of
installations, it could use the second telephone line that was often wired but
not actually used. Still, it was a bust for a lot of residential installs where
only one phone line was fully wired and already in use for phone calls.</p>
<p>As we saw in the case of Ethernet, local area networking standards evolved very
quickly in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s. IP over Ethernet became by far the dominant
standard, so the attention of the industry shifted towards new physical media
for Ethernet frames. While 10BASE-T Ethernet operated over category 3 telephone
wiring, that was of little benefit in the residential market. Commercial
buildings typically had &#34;home run&#34; telephone wiring, in which each office&#39;s
telephone pair ran directly to a wiring closet. In residential wiring of the
era, this method was almost unheard of, and most houses had their telephone
jacks wired in parallel along a small number of linear segments (often just
one).</p>
<p>This created a cabling situation much like coaxial Ethernet, in which each
telephone jack was a &#34;drop&#34; along a linear bus. The problem is that coaxial
Ethernet relied on several different installation measures to make this linear
bus design practical, and home telephone wiring had none of these advantages.
Inconsistently spaced drops, side legs, and a lack of termination meant that
reflections were a formidable problem. PhoneNet addressed reflections mainly
by operating at a very low speed (allowing reflections to &#34;clear out&#34; between
symbols), but such low bitrate did not befit the 1990s.</p>
<p>A promising solution to the reflection problem came from a system called Tut
Systems. Tut&#39;s history is unfortunately obscure, but they seem to have been
involved in what we would now call &#34;last-mile access technologies&#34; since the
1980s. Tut would later be acquired by Motorola, but not before developing a
number of telephone-wiring based IP networks under names like HomeWire and
LongWire. A particular focus of Tut was multi-family housing, which will become
important later.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not even sure when Tut introduced their residential networking product, but
it seems like they filed a relevant patent in 1995, so let&#39;s say around then.
Tut&#39;s solution relied on pulse position modulation (PPM), a technique in which
data is encoded by the length of the spacing between pulses. The principal
advantage of PPM is that it allows a fairly large number of bits to be
transmitted per pulse (by using, say, 16 potential pulse positions to encode 4
bits). This allowed reflections to dissipate between pulses, even at relatively
high bitrates.</p>
<p>Following a bit of inter-corporate negotiation, the Tut solution became an
industry standard under the HomePNA consortium: HomePNA 1.0. HomePNA 1.0 could
transmit 1Mbps over residential telephone wiring with up to 25 devices. A few
years later, HomePNA 1.0 was supplanted by HomePNA 2.0, which replaced PPM with
QAM (a more common technique for high data rates over low bandwidth channels
today) and in doing so improved to 10Mbps for potentially thousands of devices.</p>
<p>I sort of questioned writing an article about all of these weird home
networking media, because the end-user experience for most of them is pretty
much the same. That makes it kind of boring to look at them one by one, as
you&#39;ll see later. Fortunately, HomePNA has a property that makes it
interesting: despite a lot of the marketing talking more about single-family
homes, Tut seems to have envisioned HomePNA mainly as a last-mile solution for
multi-family housing. That makes HomePNA a bit different than later offerings,
landing in a bit of a gray area between the LAN and the access network.</p>
<p>The idea is this: home run wiring is unusual in residential buildings, but in
apartment and condo buildings, it is typical for the telephone lines of each
unit to terminate in a wiring closet. This yields a sort of hybrid star
topology where you have one line to each unit, and multiple jacks in each unit.
HomePNA took advantage of this wiring model by offering a product category that
is at once bland and rather unusual for this type of media: a hub.</p>
<p>HomePNA hubs are readily available, even today in used form, with 16 or 24
HomePNA interfaces. The idea of a hub can be a little confusing for a
shared-bus media like HomePNA, but each interface on these hubs is a completely
independent HomePNA network. In an apartment building, you could connect one
interface to the telephone line of each apartment, and thus offer high-speed
(for the time) internet to each of your tenants using existing infrastructure.
A 100Mbps Ethernet port on the hub then connected to whatever upstream access
you had available.</p>
<p>The use of the term &#34;hub&#34; is a little confusing, and I do believe that at least
in the case of HomePNA 2.0, they were actually switching devices. This leads to
some weird labeling like &#34;hub/switch,&#34; perhaps a result of the underlying
oddity of a multi-port device on a shared-media network that nonetheless
performs no routing.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another important trait of HomePNA 2.0 that we should discuss, at least
an important one to the historical development of home networking. HomePNA 1.0
was designed not to cause problematic interference with telephone calls but
still effectively signaled within the voice band. HomePNA 2.0&#39;s QAM modulation
addressed this problem completely: it signaled between 4MHz and 10MHz, which
put it comfortably above not only the voice band but the roughly up-to-1MHz
band used by early ADSL. HomePNA could coexist with pretty much anything else
that would have been used on a telephone line at the time.</p>
<p>Over time, control of HomePNA shifted away from Tut Systems and towards a
competitor called Epigram, who had developed the QAM modulation for HomePNA
2.0. Later part of Broadcom, Epigram also developed a 100Mbps HomePNA 3.0 in
2005. The wind was mostly gone from HomePNA&#39;s sails by that point, though, more
due to the rise of WiFi than anything else. There was a HomePNA 3.1, which
added support for operation over cable TV wiring, but shortly after, in 2009,
the HomePNA consortium endorsed the HomeGrid Forum as a successor. A few years
later, HomePNA merged into HomeGrid Forum and faded away entirely.</p>
<p>The HomeGrid Forum is the organization behind G.hn, which is to some extent a
successor of HomePNA, although it incorporates other precedents as well. G.hn
is actually fairly widely used for the near-zero name recognition it enjoys,
and I can&#39;t help but suspect that that&#39;s a result of the rather unergonomic
names that ITU standards tend to take on. &#34;G.hn&#34; kind-of-sort-of stands for
Gigabit Home Networking, which is at least more memorable than the formal
designation G.9960, but still isn&#39;t at all distinctive.</p>
<p>G.hn is a pretty interesting standard. It&#39;s quite sophisticated, using a
complex and modern modulation scheme (OFDM) along with forward error
correction. It is capable of up to 2Gbps in its recent versions, and is kind
of hard to succinctly discuss because it supports four distinct physical media:
telephone, coaxial (TV) cable, powerline, and fiber.</p>
<p>G.hn&#39;s flexibility is probably another reason for its low brand recognition,
because it looks very different in different applications. Distinct profiles of
G.hn involve different band plans and signaling details for each physical
media, and it&#39;s designed to coexist with other protocols like ADSL when needed.</p>
<p>Unlike HomePNA, multi-family housing is not a major consideration in the design
of G.hn and combining multiple networks with a &#34;hub/switch&#34; is unusual. There&#39;s
a reason: G.hn wasn&#39;t designed by access network companies like Tut; it was
mostly designed in the television set-top box (STB) industry.</p>
<p>When G.hn hit the market in 2009, cable and satellite TV was rapidly
modernizing. The TiVo had established DVRs as nearly the norm, and then pushed
consumers further towards the convenience of multi-room DVR systems. Providing
multi-room satellite TV is actually surprisingly complex, because STV STBs (say
that five times fast) actually reconfigure the LNA in the antenna as part of
tuning. STB manufacturers, dominated by EchoStar (at one time part of Hughes
and closely linked to the Dish Network), had solved this problem by making
multiple STBs in a home communicate with each other. Typically, there is a
&#34;main&#34; STB that actually interacts with the antenna and decodes TV channels.
Other STBs in the same house use the coaxial cabling to communicate with the
main STB, requesting video signals for specific channels.</p>
<p>Multi-room DVR was basically an extension of this same concept. One STB is the
actual DVR, and other STBs remote-control it, scheduling recordings and then
having the main STB play them back, transmitting the video feed over the
in-home coaxial cabling. You can see that this is becoming a lot like HomePNA,
repurposing CATV-style or STV-style coaxial cabling as a general-purpose network
in which peer devices can communicate with each other.</p>
<p>As STB services have become more sophisticated, &#34;over the top&#34; media services
and &#34;triple play&#34; combo packages have become an important and lucrative part of
the home communications market. Structurally, these services can feel a little
clumsy, with an STB at the television and a cable modem with telephone adapters
somewhere else. STBs increasingly rely on internet-based services, so you then
connect the STB to your WiFi so it can communicate via the same cabling but a
different modem. It&#39;s awkward.</p>
<p>G.hn was developed to unify these communications devices, and that&#39;s mostly how
it&#39;s used. Providers like AT&amp;T U-verse build G.hn into their cable television
devices so that they can all share a DOCSIS internet connection. There are two
basic ways of employing G.hn: first, you can use it to unify devices. The
DOCSIS modem for internet service is integrated into the STB, and then G.hn
media adapters can provide Ethernet connections wherever there is an existing
cable drop. Second, G.hn can also be applied to multi-family housing, by
installing a central modem system in the wiring closet and connecting each unit
via G.hn. Providers that have adopted G.hn often use both configurations
depending on the customer, so you see a lot of STBs these days with G.hn
interfaces and extremely flexible configurations that allow them to either act
as the upstream internet connection for the G.hn network, or to use a G.hn
network that provides internet access from somewhere else. The same STB can
thus be installed in either a single-family home or a multi-family unit.</p>
<p>We should take a brief aside here to mention MoCA, the Multimedia over Coax
Alliance. MoCA is a somewhat older protocol with a lot of similarities to G.hn.
It&#39;s used in similar ways, and to some extent the difference between the two
just comes down to corporate alliances: AT&amp;T is into G.hn, but Cox, both US
satellite TV providers, and Verizon have adopted MoCA, making it overall the
more common of the two. I just think it&#39;s less interesting. Verizon FiOS
prominently uses MoCA to provide IP-based television service to STBs, via an
optical network terminal that provides MoCA to the existing CATV wiring.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve looked at home networking over telephone wiring, and home networking over
coaxial cable. What about the electrical wiring? G.hn has a powerline profile,
although it doesn&#39;t seem to be that widely used. Home powerline networking is
much more often associated with HomePlug.</p>
<p>Well, as it happens, HomePlug is sort of dead, the industry organization behind
it having wrapped up operations in 2016. That might not be such a big practical
problem, though, as HomePlug is closely aligned with related IEEE standards for
data over powerline and it&#39;s widely used in embedded applications.</p>
<p>As a consumer product, HomePlug will be found in the form of HomePlug AV2. AV2
offers Gigabit-plus data rates over good quality home electrical wiring, and
compared to G.hn and MoCA it enjoys the benefit that standalone, consumer
adapters are very easy to buy.</p>
<p>HomePlug selects the most complex modulation the wiring can support (typically
QAM with a large constellation size) and uses multiple OFDM carriers in the HF
band, which it transmits onto the neutral conductor of an outlet. The neutral
wiring in the average house is also joined at one location in the service
panel, so it provides a convenient shared bus. On the downside, the
installation quality of home electrical wiring is variable and the neutral
conductor can be noisy, so some people experience very poor performance from
HomePlug. Others find it to be great. It really depends on the situation.</p>
<p>That brings us to the modern age: G.hn, MoCA, and HomePlug are all more or less
competing standards for data networking using existing household wiring. As a
consumer, you&#39;re most likely to use G.hn or MoCA if you have an ISP that
provides equipment using one of the two. Standalone consumer installations, for
people who just want to get Ethernet from one place to another without running
cable, usually use HomePlug.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t really <em>have</em> to be that way, G.hn powerline adapters have come down
in price to where they compete pretty directly with HomePlug. Coaxial-cable and
telephone-cable based solutions actually don&#39;t seem to be that popular with
consumers any more, so powerline is the dominant choice. I can take a guess at
the reason: electrical wiring can be of questionable quality, but in a lot of
houses I see the coaxial and telephone wiring is much worse. Some people have
outright removed the telephone wiring from houses, and the coaxial plant has
often been through enough rounds of cable and satellite TV installers that it&#39;s
a bit of a project to sort out which parts are connected. A large number of
cheap passive distribution taps, common in cable TV where the signal level from
the provider is very high, can be problematic for coaxial G.hn or MoCA. It&#39;s
usually not hard to fix those problems, but unless an installer from the ISP
sorts it out it usually doesn&#39;t happen. For the consumer, powerline is what&#39;s
most likely to work.</p>
<p>And, well, I&#39;m not sure that any consumers care any more. WiFi has gotten so
fast that it often beats the data rates achievable by these solutions, and it&#39;s
often more reliable to boot. HomePlug in particular has a frustrating habit of
working perfectly except for when something happens, conditions degrade, the
adapters switch modulations, and the connection drops entirely for a few
seconds. That&#39;s particularly maddening behavior for gamers, who are probably
the most likely to care about the potential advantages of these wired solutions
over WiFi.</p>
<p>I expect G.hn, MoCA, and HomePlug to stick around. All three have been written
into various embedded standards and adopted by ISPs as part of their access
network in multi-family or at least as an installation convenience in
single-family contexts. But I don&#39;t think anyone really cares about them any
more, and they&#39;ll start to feel as antiquated as HomePNA.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s a quick postscript to show how these protocols might adapt to the
modern era: remember how I said G.hn can operate over fiber? Cheap fiber, too,
the kind of plastic cables used by S/PDIF. The HomePlug Forum is investigating
the potential of G.hn over in-home passive optical networks, on the theory that
these passive optical networks can be cheaper (due to small conductor size and
EMI tolerance) and more flexible (due to the passive bus topology) than copper
Ethernet. I wouldn&#39;t bet money on it, given the constant improvement of WiFi,
but it&#39;s possible that G.hn will come back around for &#34;fiber in the home&#34;
internet service.</p>
<p>[1] XNS was a LAN suite designed by Xerox in the 1970s. Unusually for the time,
it was an openly published standard, so a considerable number of the
proprietary LANs of the 1980s were at least partially based on XNS.</p>
<p>[2] The software sophistication of AppleTalk is all the more impressive when
you consider that it was basically a rush job. Apple was set to launch
LaserWriter, and as I mentioned recently on Mastodon, it was outrageously
expensive. LaserWriter was built around the same print engine as the first
LaserJet and still cost twice as much, due in good part to its flexible but
very demanding PostScript engine. Apple realized it would never sell unless
multiple Macintoshes could share it---it cost nearly as much as three Mac
128ks!---so they absolutely needed to have a LAN solution ready. LaserWriter
would not wait for IBM to get their token ring shit together. This is a very
common story of 1980s computer networks; it&#39;s hard to appreciate now how much
printer sharing was one of the main motivations for networking computers at
all. There&#39;s this old historical theory that hasn&#39;t held up very well but is
appealing in its simplicity, that civilization arises primarily in response to
the scarcity of water and thus the need to construct irrigation works. You
could say that microcomputer networking arises primarily in response to the
scarcity of printers.</p>
