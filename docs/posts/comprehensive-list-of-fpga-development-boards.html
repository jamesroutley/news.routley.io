    <h1>Comprehensive list of FPGA development boards</h1>

        <p>I often get asked what I think is the best FPGA/MPSoC dev board for some particular application,
or I have to choose one for a client project. There are so many out there these days, it’s hard
for anyone to keep up, so I thought it would be useful to bring all of them together into a repository
and generate tables from that data, categorizing the boards into their different types and features.
Since moving the blog to the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> platform, this is something that has become
possible and fairly easy to do, so I finally got it done.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find the lists, categorizing the boards according to a few attributes that I
considered useful. If you have an idea for a category that I haven’t listed, please let me know.
Also, if you know of a board that is not on these lists, please <a href="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/contact-me">contact me</a> with the details.</p>
<p>
  I’ve only considered something to be a “dev board” if it can operate on it’s own, independent of any
carrier board or other add-on that it may be possible to use with. For example, I considered the
<a href="https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/microzed/">MicroZed</a>
to be a “dev board” because although it <em>can</em> be used with a carrier board, it is still fully functional
without one. The <a href="https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/picozed/">PicoZed</a>
I considered <em>not</em> to be a “dev board” because it <strong>requires</strong> a carrier board to function. If I were to add
all of the SoMs out there, with all of their possible configurations and carrier boards, this list would
quickly get out-of-hand.

<p>As I add boards to the repository, or remove them when they become obsolete, the lists will be
automatically updated; so in theory at least, the lists will always be relevant.
Just keep in mind however that the prices listed for these boards should only
be taken as a guide, because the real prices depend on distributors and resellers and they
change too often for me to realistically keep up with.</p>
<p>I hope you find this useful!</p>
