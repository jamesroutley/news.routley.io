    <h1>Meta announces nuclear energy projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>
		<p><span>At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>our nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Our commitments to </span><a href="https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx"><span>Oklo</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/"><span>TerraPower</span></a><span> support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with </span><a href="https://vistracorp.com/"><span>Vistra</span></a><span>, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span>These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW</span><span> of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.</span></p>
<p><span>This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear </span><span>these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy </span><span>infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta</span></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology</h2>
<p><span>As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.</span></p>
<p><span>These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices. </span></p>
<h2>TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology<b><br/>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/"><span>Natrium® units</span></a><span> capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”</span></p>
<h2>Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio</h2>
<p><b></b><span>Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. </span><a href="https://oklo.com/energy/default.aspx"><span>Oklo Aurora powerhouses</span></a><span> are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.</span></p>

<p><span>“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality </span><span>through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio</span><span>.”</span></p>
<h2>Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy<b><br/>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/meta-constellation-partner-clean-energy-project/"><span>first nuclear energy agreement</span></a><span> helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.</span><span><br/>
</span></p>
<p><span>Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.</span></p>

<p><span>Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.  </span></p>
<p><span>“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”</span></p>
<h2>Supporting Our Energy Future</h2>
<p><span>Today’s announcements are the result of a thorough </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> where we learned how we could improve our support of nuclear projects’ development lifecycles and identify specific partner companies to help scale and accelerate the buildout of new nuclear energy production. For more than a decade, we’ve worked with innovative partners to back clean energy projects that support the grid — adding nearly 28 GW of new energy to grids across 27 states. We’re proud to include Oklo, TerraPower, and Vistra on that list and support their work to boost America’s energy leadership.</span></p>
