        <p>This week I kept talking and meeting with people, a combination of
        scheduled talks and impromptu meetings in the hub and especially the
        kitchen (especially especially the coffee machine). I found the coffee
        bot to be a good way of having an opt-in coffee chat with people that
        you haven&#39;t met yet, or to get to know others better that I&#39;ve already
        introduced myself to.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m continuing to be impressed and happy about the pure breadth and
        diversity of people in terms of background and talents. It&#39;s really
        great to get to know what people are working on and realizing further
        fields which you may not even know exist and / or know about but have
        to real clear picture of. I hope I&#39;ll be able to meet everyone in my
        batch by the end of the retreat.</p>

      <div id="text-org82ebb2a">
        <p>During this week I started learning about web development, HTML and
        CSS, in order to build this website and have somewhere to publish my
        notes. I&#39;ve started this several times in the past but never gotten to
        the finishing line, so I see this as a success in itself, a small win
        for me to get started.</p>
        <p>I will not go into the technicalities of this website and how I&#39;ve
        decided to structure my notes and pages. For a note on this, see my
        note on <a href="https://isakfalk.com/notes/building-this-website.html">how I build this
        website</a>!</p>

      project</a></h2>
      <div id="text-org3bcd72b">
        <p>During this week I had an idea which came to me, where I will build
        a &#34;this RC does not exist&#34;<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> by taking photos of the hub and
        then fine-tune an image generative model on this dataset. I already
        know a lot of machine learning, but generative modelling has never been
        one of my fields of focus.</p>
        <p>I am excited about doing this project as it would allow me to do a
        full ML-pipeline from data collection all the way to a user facing
        website serving images. Let us see how this goes. I have already
        started collecting some images, so it&#39;s a start!</p>

      attend</a></h2>
      <div id="text-orgcae105b">
        <p>There are so much you could potentially do at RC. It&#39;s easy to form
        study groups or hold events around almost any topic of choice. It&#39;s a
        real smorgasbord of opportunity, to dive deep in topics you already
        know or pick up something new and go from beginner to intermediate in 3
        months. Of course, the effect of focusing on too many things is that
        you will not get too far into any one topic in addition to taking
        energy and time from actually working on projects.</p>
        <p>During this week I realized that I cannot attend everything and that
        I should be a bit more mindful where I spend my time and energy in
        order to finish a project before the end of the batch. Some events I
        want to attend from time to time even though it may not be related to
        my area of expertise (like the creative coding session where we code
        something in 90 minutes using a small prompt to work the creative
        muscles), but others I will have to leave for now as otherwise I will
        spread myself too thin.</p>
