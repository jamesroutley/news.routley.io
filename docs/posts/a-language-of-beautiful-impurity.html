One of the earliest proponents was Thomas Wilson, </span><a href="https://www.folger.edu/blogs/shakespeare-and-beyond/inkhorn-controversy-latin-greek-english-words/" rel="">who criticised those who</a><span> ‘seeke so far for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers language’.</span></p><p><span>One of the most notable campaigners was Victorian poet </span><a href="https://twitter.com/WeirdMedieval/status/1787986110779412985?t=-Q4yl4AlBp96742SFy40UA&amp;s=19" rel="">William Barnes, who wished to replace</a><span> foreign loan words </span><a href="https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/4/4/2/8/44289/44289-h/44289-h.htm" rel="">with Germanic Anglo-Saxon</a><span> terms he’d made up: genealogy becomes</span><em> kin-lore</em><span>, grammar </span><em>speech-craft</em><span> and, perhaps less attractive, forceps become </span><em>nipperlings</em><span>. He also suggested </span><em>wortlore</em><span> for botany, </span><em>welkinfire</em><span> for meteor, and </span><em>sunprint</em><span> for photograph.</span></p><p><span>What made Barnes interesting was that he was a noted scholar of foreign languages. </span><a href="https://paulkingsnorth.substack.com/" rel="">Paul Kingsnorth</a><span>, who takes a keen interest in Old English, </span><a href="https://www.paulkingsnorth.net/barnes" rel="">described </a><span>him as ‘a rural boy from Dorset who became a literary figure befriended by Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Thomas Hardy. He was a polymath, speaking seven languages and teaching himself mathematics, music and wood engraving. All of this was done from the Dorset village he lived in; his walks in to Dorchester to set his watch by the town clock were the closest he came to metropolitan life.’</span></p><p><span>Barnes’s poem, ‘The Fall’, is typical of this Saxon style of verse.</span></p><p><span>The linguistic purism movement peaked in the age of industrialisation, in a country losing its local traditions, songs and dialects, some of which still carried traces of the Anglo-Saxon past. As anyone forced to read Thomas Hardy at school will know, the Wessex dialect of south-west England still retained some of these characteritics well into the modern age, with </span><em>I be, thee bis, he be </em><span>obviously closer to </span><em>Ich bin, du bis, er ist</em><span> than to the standard ‘I am, you are, he is’.</span></p><p><span>Anglo-Saxon terms often lasted longer in Scotland and England’s north-east, where the influence of a French overclass was weakest, but older words could hang on in more remote parts. A versions of ‘outlander’, cognate with German </span><em>ausländer</em><span> and Dutch </span><em>buitenlander</em><span>, was noted by an </span><a href="https://x.com/crimkadid/status/1462916517268492289" rel="">anthropologist in the Appalachians in</a><span> 1910; people still used the word ‘foreigner’ to describe people from beyond the region, distinguishing them from non-English speakers, who were ‘outlandish’.</span></p><p><span>The Anglo-Saxon language movement didn’t really take off, perhaps </span><a href="https://www.edwest.co.uk/p/how-german-are-the-english" rel="">because pan-Germanism</a><span> was tainted, but most of all because linguistic purity campaigns are always hopeless battles against globalisation, choice and fashion (consider France’s doomed fight against Franglais).</span></p><p><span>Yet there is still great interest in the language that might have been. Kingsnorth&#39;s highly-acclaimed novel </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wake_(novel)" rel="">The Wake</a></em><span> is written in a hybrid of Old and modern English. There is also an online newsletter called </span><em>The Anglish Times, </em><span>which has an enjoyable </span><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes" rel="">Twitter feed</a><span> offering alternative terms. A </span><a href="https://instituteofengland.substack.com/p/why-you-need-anglish" rel="">primer on Anglish for the </a><em><a href="https://instituteofengland.substack.com/p/why-you-need-anglish" rel="">Anglish Times</a></em><a href="https://instituteofengland.substack.com/p/why-you-need-anglish" rel=""> declares:.</a></p><p>‘One way Anglish is beneficial over Modern English is in giving people an easier and more visceral understanding of academic or otherwise abstract concepts. For example the academic study of birds is called ornithology. Unless you already knew the Greek words Ornis, meaning bird and Logia, meaning to speak about, then you would likely have no idea what this word means upon first encountering it. Whereas if you said Birdlore, native English speakers will already know the component words making up the compound, and can guess pretty easily what it means.’</p><p><span>In Anglish, theology </span><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes/status/1837408586885967971" rel="">would be </a><em><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes/status/1837408586885967971" rel="">godlore</a></em><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes/status/1837408586885967971" rel="">.</a><span> rhetoric </span><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes/status/1834948084859617507" rel="">is </a><em><a href="https://x.com/theanglishtimes/status/1834948084859617507" rel="">speechcraft.</a></em><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/edwest/status/1782326553336021256" rel="">doctors would be </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/edwest/status/1782326553336021256" rel="">healers</a></em><span>, journalists </span><em>newsmen</em><span>, and status-signalling would be </span><em>rankmarking</em><span>.

French words are usually more formal or aristocratic sounding: </span><em>ascend</em><span>, rather than rise, </span><em>status</em><span> rather than standing, </span><em>mansion</em><span> rather than house, </span><em>cordial</em><span> rather than hearty. J.R.R. Tolkien, an Anglo-Saxon scholar who lamented the loss of 1066, even had Denethor using more </span><a href="https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1805175073537425539" rel="">French-derived terms after he</a><span> went mad.</span></p><p><span>Most people with an interest in the subject will also know of Orwell’s </span><a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" rel="">famous advice that:</a><span> ‘Bad writers, and especially scientific, political and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, sub-aqueous and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers.’</span></p><p>Anglo-Saxon language can also have more emotional, atavistic appeal. When in 1940 Britain faced an invasion even more devastating than that of 1066, Winston Churchill made a speech that notably used ancient vocabulary: ‘We shall fight on the beaches; we shall fight on the landing grounds; we shall fight in the fields and the streets; we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.’ All but the final word are of Old English origin, and perhaps this was deliberate.</p><p>Yet as much as I would have been on Team Harold in 1066, and fun as this all is, I’m grateful for the variety which French has given us. It enriches our language that the Old English see, ask, come, let, eat and break can be doubled by perceive, inquire, arrive, permit, ingest and damage. It is good and beneficial that we have house and residence, kin and relative, talk and conversation, high and elevated, fair and equitable, good and favourable.</p><p><span>Such is the richness of the language that often English nouns retained the native terms while the adjective became French, so that we have water/aquatic, mouth/oral, son/filial and sun/solar. As David Crystal </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stories-English-David-Crystal-ebook/dp/B002RI9GWQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="">wrote in </a><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stories-English-David-Crystal-ebook/dp/B002RI9GWQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="">The Stories of English</a><span>, </span></em><span>another curious result of this bilingualism is that legal English possesses various lexicon doublets, made up of an English and </span><em>French</em><span> word, such as breaking and </span><em>entering</em><span>, fit and </span><em>proper</em><span>, wrack and </span><em>ruin</em><span>, acknowledge and </span><em>confess</em><span>, give and </span><em>grant</em><span>, lands and </span><em>tenements</em><span>, new and </span><em>novel</em><span>, </span><em>pardon</em><span> and forgive.</span></p><p><span>Many hybrid terms mix the Anglo-Saxon suffix </span><em>ful</em><span> and French adjectives, like beautiful, graceful, merciful and faithful. Alternatively, French </span><em>able</em><span> is added to Anglo-Saxon roots to make knowable or doable.</span></p><p>Thanks to the Normans we have two words for many conditions, such as friendship and amity, brotherhood and fraternity, motherhood and maternity, cheer and cherish, cave and cavern, stand and stay, thoughtful and pensive, smell and odour, help and aid, weep and cry, weird and strange, harbour and port, worthy and valuable, and knowledge and science. As charming as the Anglish ‘sealy’ is, I think maritime is an improvement.</p><p><span>As the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis </span><a href="https://www.jordanmposs.com/blog/2023/6/7/the-two-registers-of-english" rel="">Borges explained</a><span>, on why he preferred this language more than any other: ‘English is both a Germanic and a Latin language. Those two registers — for any idea you take, you have two words. Those words will not mean exactly the same. For example if I say “regal” that is not exactly the same thing as saying “kingly.” Or if I say “fraternal” that is not the same as saying “brotherly.” Or “dark” and “obscure.” Those words are different.
