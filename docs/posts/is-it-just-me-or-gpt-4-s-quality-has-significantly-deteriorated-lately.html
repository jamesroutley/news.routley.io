    <h1>Ask HN: Is it just me or GPT-4&#39;s quality has significantly deteriorated lately?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It is much faster than before but the quality of its responses is more like a GPT-3.5++. It generates more buggy code, the answers have less depth and analysis to them, and overall it feels much worse than before.</p><p>For a while, the GPT-4 on phind.com gave even better results than GPT-4-powered ChatGPT. I could notice the difference in speed of both GPT-4s. Phind&#39;s was slower and more accurate. I say &#34;was&#34; because apparently phind is now trying to use GPT-3.5 and their own Phind model more frequently, so much for GPT-4 powered search engine....</p><p>I wonder if I use Poe&#39;s GPT-4, maybe I&#39;ll get the good old GPT-4 back?</p></div></div></div>
