<p>Early this year Intel also announced the IFS Accelerator ecosystem alliance designed to help accelerate chip prototyping and tape-outs through deep collaboration with various semiconductor partners across EDA, IPs, and design services. IFS Accelerator is a comprehensive suite of tools comprising silicon-verified Intel-process-specific optimized IP portfolio (from std cell library, memory, GP I/O, analog, and I/F IPs). Strategically, A large and vibrant ecosystem will be incredibly important for the success of Intelâ€™s foundry strategy and IFS Accelerator is one of a piece of that. The company initially started Accelerator in September of 2021 to assist the automotive industry with transitioning to more advanced nodes, however, it has since broadened its effort into other segments.</p></div>
