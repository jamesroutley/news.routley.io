    <h1>The Man Who Spent Forty-Two Years at the Beverly Hills Hotel Pool (1993)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>In August, 1933, when he was twenty-seven, Irving married Nan Ofgang at his older sister’s house, in Brooklyn. “I had to borrow ten dollars to pay the rabbi,” he said. “We had nothing but guts and faith, and my wife had a job at the cosmetics department at the Thrifty Drug Company. I had heard from a friend, however, about a novelty company that had gone broke and abandoned a million units of a fortune-telling device in a warehouse in New York. This was called the Fortunscope. I borrowed money to lay claim to the inventory, and Nan and I decided to go on the road. There were a million Fortunscopes in that warehouse, and I was determined to sell them all. Now, the Fortunscope was a device in which you spun an arrow and found your fortune. All the fortunes were complimentary. I had a sample case, and would offer the Fortunscope to retailers. Once they placed an order, I would send it back to the New York warehouse, and Fortunscopes would be shipped to the retailer. It was a painstaking business: a gross to a department store, a dozen Fortunscopes to small five-and-dimes. I bought them for two cents and sold them for fifteen cents. In our first two years, we couldn’t afford sleeping cars, so we slept sitting up, in the day coach.</p><p>“Oh, those were wonderful days, though! We travelled from Philadelphia to Seattle, through the Middle West, Minnesota, and the various Dakotas. We were determined to visit every city with a population of more than twenty-five thousand. It was one day in some small city in one of the Carolinas—I can no longer remember which—that I was walking down a street and saw three magnificent Palm Beach suits in the window of a men’s store. One was cream, one was white, and one was navy. I went in and bought them all, eighteen dollars apiece. I’ve tried never to be badly dressed since.</p><p>“Our odyssey ended here, in California, where I took the stake we had made through the Fortunscope and went into the dress business. We liked California, but we both became homesick and decided to try moving back East. We actually found a house in Connecticut, and were ready to close on it. But then thoughts of California filled our heads. So we tossed a coin to see where we should go, and it turned up heads—California. We came back out in 1949 and bought a little house here in Beverly Hills for six thousand dollars. By then my beautiful daughter, Gale, was born. I have a son, Rand, as well, who’s a dean at Sonoma State University. I’ve always been an early riser, and so one morning—not wanting to wake my wife and children—I slipped out of the house and went looking for breakfast. The hotel was at the bottom of the street, on Sunset Boulevard, so I slipped into the Polo Lounge and ordered breakfast, and my life at the hotel began that day.”</p><p>The Beverly Hills Hotel that Irving walked into that morning was, though Irving did not know it then, in the midst of a transformation. The hotel had been built in 1912, at a time when Beverly Hills was still essentially rural; in fact, the hotel was the first large building that the city had seen. It was decorated in the heavy, leadfooted style then called Mission Revival. The halls were uncarpeted, the rooms had exposed beams, and the hotel’s various amenities had a severe, purposeful look: the swimming pool was a place where people went to go swimming, and the Polo Lounge, which had been christened by Will Rogers, looked more or less like the kind of rough-hewn place in which you might actually wish to lounge after playing polo.</p><p>By 1941, the hotel had been in and out of bankruptcy, and it was bought by a consortium of show-business people headed by the banker Hernando Courtright, who decided to have the place remodelled in the style today loosely referred to as Deco but actually called by experts Coffee Shop Moderne. Courtwright had a new wing built along Crescent Road, on the east side of the hotel, and the interior of the hotel was redesigned: its hard Spanish angles were rounded off, and it became a paradise of curving stairs, recessed lighting, and pink and green stucco. The Fountain Coffee Shop, with its famous black S-shaped counter, was installed downstairs. A thirty-foot-high sign—“The Beverly Hills” inscribed in low relief in a looping, almost feminine cursive hand—was visible from Sunset.</p><p>It was during this period that the Beverly Hills Hotel pool achieved its familiar form. The pool was set in a tropical garden. On the eastern and western edges were three rows of lounge chairs; each group of three chairs was punctuated by a small table topped with translucent glass, and a telephone rested upon each table. At the north end, a small white fountain played all day. To the south, behind a hedge of lime trees in white urns, lay the Patio Club: ten white metal tables under umbrellas, with a small bar in the back, and eight shaded booths set into one side wall. On the west side of the pool were the cabanas—little tents with striped awnings, like jousting tournament pavilions. Each had a chair, a chaise of its own, and a small door leading to a changing room just behind. (A second group of cabanas was mounted, more discreetly, above the chaises on that side, nestled into a little overhanging promontory, like a Tibetan monastery; these upper cabanas were, by legend, favored by Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe and other movie stars who were either too chubby to be looked at or too nude to be respectable.) The only sounds at the pool—aside from soft piped-in classical music and the sound of people being paged—were the metallic whirring and put-put of the blender at the bar, preparing frozen drinks (it was a tradition for the pool boys to make the rounds of the chaises every day at two-thirty with sherbet freezes in the heraldic house colors, pink and green), the breeze in the palms, and the constant murmur of boastful, wheedling, confident monologue.</p><p>It is sometimes said that the heyday of the pool dates from the heyday of the great studios, but in fact its heyday was just after theirs: its high period occurred in the mid-fifties—the era of Sam Spiegel (who stayed in the hotel for a long time) and Joseph Levine (who did, too) and Stanley Kramer and the other independent producers who began to assemble films from the ground up. It was the era of “international” casts, freelance directors, and creative financing. There was a new kind of negotiating to be done, which required a neutral place to negotiate, and the place that a lot of people chose was the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>“Now, how I got my cabana had a great deal to do with what happened at the hotel,” Irving was saying. He and I had returned from lunch and were sitting together by the side of the pool. There would be no gin game that day; the regulars had all gone off to other hotels. The weather had turned unseasonably chilly; at certain moments, you could actually see your breath. But a solitary man in brown trunks, whom Irving referred to as the Hamburger Hamlet King, was lying bare-chested on a chaise on the other side of the pool. (“If you get yourself focussed in the sun,” he had said when we walked in, “it’s actually quite warming.”) “Looking back, in later years, it’s quite remarkable that I got my cabana at all,” Irving went on. “What happened was that Hernando Courtwright, who was responsible for the renovation, sold the hotel in 1953 to a couple of gentlemen from Detroit—Manny Borenstein and Ben Silberstein. Silberstein was a lawyer; Borenstein was a very astute businessman.” Irving’s tone implied that Silberstein was not. “They began to make a great deal of money. But Silberstein wanted to keep the profits for himself, and Borenstein wanted to plow the money back into the hotel. They quarrelled endlessly, for years, but neither could budge the other. Now, each had forty-five per cent, and two or three other people had the rest. Silberstein’s sister, for instance, owned two per cent. That turned out to be important, as you’ll see. They agreed to sell—Borenstein to Silberstein. Silberstein got a good deal, and Borenstein, as part of the package, got a ten-year lease, for no money, on a suite and a cabana. But his cabana was next to Silberstein’s, and by that time there was so much bad blood between them that he didn’t want to be anywhere near Silberstein, so he gave the cabana to me. We were friends. I had begun the gin game several years before, and Manny enjoyed it.</p><p>“So, because of the ill feeling and misunderstanding between Borenstein and Silberstein, I had my cabana, when only two or three years later grown men would have killed for that cabana. There were thirteen cabanas, and in summer months they were almost impossible to get, even at a hundred dollars a day. A cabana meant power, it meant glamour, it meant that you had a place in the world. Everyone came to the hotel then. Every important personality in the picture business. I knew them all. Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Buddy Rogers, Don Ameche.” Irving is essentially a democrat; Buddy Rogers and Clark Gable exist for him on more or less the same plane. “Orson Welles, Marlene Dietrich. How well I remember that memorable day when Dietrich broke the dress code in the Polo Lounge! Women were not allowed to wear slacks. It was an absolute prohibition. Now, Dietrich entered the loggia room in slacks.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“They let her in. She was Marlene Dietrich, after all.”</p><p>The Hamburger Hamlet King jogged over—there were goose bumps all over his almost purple tanned skin—and he and Irving began to talk. Then the Hamburger Hamlet King returned to his chaise and peremptorily summoned the one remaining pool boy. “Can you believe that? Only one,” Irving said. “Now, in those days the people who worked here at the hotel had influence. They had power. To get a good chaise from Sven, a good table from Bernice—well, grown men would plead with me to put in a good word for them. Even the parking was competitive. Who parked your car. It was in the nature of the picture business, you see, to be like that. It is a nest of insecurities. Now, I have sat here”—he waved toward the cabanas behind us—“for forty-two years and watched the picture business, and the thing that I have learned about the picture business is this: Keep out of the picture business. They can strip you naked and leave nothing behind. I knew everyone who mattered in the picture business, and the ones who made real money were the ones who expanded beyond the picture business.</p><p>“The only time I ever really got involved in the picture business was when several gentlemen were making a picture with Hal Holbrook called ‘The Kidnapping of the President.’ They came to me to see if I could introduce them to anyone who could help with the financing. Well, at that point I wanted to do something surprising for my grandchildren, so I encouraged these gentlemen, and they offered me a bit part in the picture, as an Air Force general. When the picture came out, my grandchildren were delighted.</p><p>“Now, I was explaining how the hotel came to be sold to the Sultan, which has led us to all this. You see, the two daughters of Silberstein inherited the hotel, and one of them, Seema, at the time of Silberstein’s death was married to Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who was also very astute, decided to sell the hotel. The sisters didn’t get along—the Beverly Hills Hotel curse, you could call this. So he bought the two per cent the aunt still had—you recall the aunt I mentioned?—and got it for himself. The balance had tipped, and now he could sell the hotel. There were two real bids: one from the Sultan of Brunei and one from my good friend Marvin Davis, whom I once tried to help buy CBS. Marvin—do you know Marvin? Well, in addition to being a wonderfully astute businessman he’s—” Irving groped for a word. “He’s a wonderfully Falstaffian figure,” he said at last, delicately. “We had breakfast together once, and he asked me to teach him how to dress. I said, ‘Draw up a contract!’ But he never did. Anyway, Marvin Davis explained to me that both he and the Sultan of Brunei offered a hundred and thirty-five million, but that Muriel wanted to sell it to an American rather than to a foreigner. So Marvin bought the hotel. But it was only after he bought the hotel that they pursued the due diligence—checking the plumbing, the wiring, the corroding. He realized that it would take millions to fix it. ‘Irving,’ he told me, ‘I made a bad deal.’ Then he gets a call from the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan is still dying to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel. ‘Not for sale,’ Marvin says. He’s an astute Sultan, as sultans go, but no match for Marvin Davis. Marvin has nerves of steel. Of course, it’s much easier to have nerves of steel when you have money of gold. That’s a maxim of mine. So the Sultan ended up paying a lot more than a hundred and thirty-five million.</p><p>“It was too much to pay, of course—what the Sultan paid. People have a hard time understanding the hotel business. There’s an interesting sidelight to this story. Let’s go back to the late fifties, when Howard Hughes had three bungalows and twenty-one rooms permanently taken at the hotel, although he only visited for a few weeks each year. I used to observe Mr. Hughes going from one bungalow to another: one bungalow for Jean Peters, his wife; one for Hughes; and one for his mistress, who was rotated every month. Now, this is the interesting part. Ben Silberstein came to me upset, because he was going to have to throw Hughes out. Throw out Howard Hughes! I asked why. Because the rooms were not producing any income. No food, no services. Hughes thought that everybody must be holding him in awe because he had all those rooms, and in fact they were going to have to kick him out. So Hughes checked out, and went to Las Vegas. He was not terribly missed by any of us. My point is that the hotel business is not as simple as it looks. The Sultan owns the hotel, but he discovers that it needs work to bring it up to date. So he’ll spend millions. The problem is that if you close the hotel and spend the millions, by then all the regulars will have moved on—to the Hilton, the Peninsula, the Bel-Air. Did I mention to you that I was thinking of moving to the Hilton? I should go over and spend more time there before I decide. But I hate to leave the hotel.”</p><p>In its last weeks, there were only a dozen paying guests left in the Beverly Hills Hotel; Sven Peterson at one point was even seen waiting on tables at the Patio Club. The doors to the unoccupied rooms were often left open for hours by the maids, and, peering inside, you saw a kind of anthology of forlorn, forgotten de-luxe styles: rooms lined with mirrors and Buffet-like paintings; rooms with wall-to-wall shag carpeting; rooms with “Persian” rugs and small terraces; rooms that looked like sets for James Bond movies; rooms that looked like sets for Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies.</p><p>Over the past twelve months, the decision to close down the Beverly Hills Hotel and remodel it has been much argued over in Beverly Hills, but, Beverly Hills being Beverly Hills, the argument has taken a peculiarly Beverly Hills form, with much of the argument conducted in the weekly “giveaway” papers. The Beverly Hills community, which is heavily Jewish, has always mistrusted the Sultan, who is, of course, Muslim, and whose little, wealthy country has voted against Israel in the United Nations, and this larger mistrust took the local form of suspicion that he and his minions intended to destroy the hotel “landmarks”—the Polo Lounge and the pool, in particular. There were even dark rumors—not entirely implausible, given the shaky state of small Islamic principalities—that the Sultan wanted the hotel remodelled in order to have it ready to use as a palace in exile.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
