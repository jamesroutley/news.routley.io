					<p>Iceland is known to the rest of the world as the land of Vikings and volcanos, an island caught between continents at the extremities of the map. Remote and comparatively inhospitable, it was settled only as long ago as the 9th century, and has seen little additional in-migration since. Even today, more than 90 percent of Iceland’s 390,000 residents can trace their ancestry back to the earliest permanent inhabitants, a Nordic-Celtic mix. The tradition of the Norse sagas lives on in the form of careful record-keeping about ancestry⁠⁠—and a national passion for genealogy. In other words, it is not the place to stumble upon old family mysteries.</p>
<p>But growing up in the capital city of Reykjavík in the 1950s, neurologist Dr. Kári Stefánsson heard stories that left him curious. Stefánsson’s father had come from Djúpivogur, an eastern coastal town where everyone still spoke of a Black man who had moved there early in the 19th century. “Hans Jónatan”, they called him⁠⁠—a well-liked shopkeeper who had arrived on a ship, married a spirited woman from a local farm, and became a revered member of the community.</p>
<p>The local census did record a man by the name of Hans Jónatan, born in the Caribbean, who was working at the general store in Djúpivogur in the 19th century⁠⁠—but that was all. No images of the man had survived, and his time in Iceland was well before any other humans with African ancestry are known to have visited the island. If tiny, remote Djúpivogur did have a Black man arrive in the 19th century, the circumstances must have been unusual indeed.</p>
<p>It was an intriguing puzzle⁠⁠—and solid grounds for a scientific investigation. Given the amount of homogeneity in the baseline Icelandic population, the genetic signature of one relative newcomer with distinct ancestry might still stand out across a large sample of his descendants. Geneticists thus joined locals and history scholars, and they pieced together a story that bridged three continents.
</p>
<p>
In 1964, University of Copenhagen law professor Knud Waaben wrote an extensive review of two men born into slavery in the 18th century who ended up fighting for their rights in Danish court. History had lost track of both men, according to Waaben, and only speculation was possible as to any later stages in the life of either.</p>
<figure data-embiggen="true"><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-height-ratio="0.56176470588235" data-lazy-load-src="https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/damninteresting-a-trail-gone-cold-2.jpg" alt="Sugar plantation in the Danish West Indies (National Museum of Denmark)" title="Sugar plantation in the Danish West Indies (National Museum of Denmark)"/></p><figcaption>Sugar plantation in the Danish West Indies (National Museum of Denmark)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the two men had been born on 12 April 1784 in the town of Christiansted on the Caribbean island of St. Croix. This small piece of land⁠⁠—named by the French, intermittently occupied by the British, and technically owned by the Danish⁠⁠—exemplified the European-colonial squabbling that was playing out all over the Caribbean, not to mention the Americas and also the world in general.</p>
<p>The economies of St. Croix and the other Danish West Indies were driven almost exclusively by the Europeans’ relatively new but insatiable need for sugar. Production of the stuff was based on an incomprehensible amount of slave labour. Generations of field-slaves and house-slaves endured brutal conditions across hundreds of sugarcane plantations as European sugar magnates became enormously wealthy. By the late 18th century, St. Croix held around 3,000 white people⁠⁠—almost all men⁠⁠—plus about ten times as many Black slaves. Escape attempts were easily thwarted, since St. Croix afforded very few places to hide. Captured runaways were subjected to vicious beatings, public shaming, or both, even if they were children.</p>
<p>In Danish, he was called Hans Jonathan, as he was born into slavery and thus not entitled to a surname. His mother was a house slave named Regina, who at the time was in her mid-20s; her pregnancy was likely involuntary. Regina’s owner was a wealthy young widow named Henrietta Cathrina Schäffer, who brought with her Regina and several other slaves when she married Ludvig Heinrich Ernst von Schimmelmann, a local judge from a prominent German-Danish family who was rapidly climbing through the political ranks of the Danish West Indies. In 1784, the same year Hans Jonathan was born, Schimmelmann was appointed Governor-General of the territory.</p>
<p>Hans was noticeably lighter-skinned than his mother, which suggested he was the offspring of Regina and a free white man. Exactly which free white man is unknown; historical records are vague, indicating only that the father in question was “said to be the secretary”. In his extensive 2014 biography of Hans Jonathan, Icelandic anthropologist Gísli Pálsson weighs the evidence and considers several possibilities. He points out that if “the secretary” is taken literally, the most logical match is a man named Hans Gram, who was the Schimmelmanns’ scribe at the time (though Gram would later find minor fame in the United States as a composer). That said, “the secretary” is not a reliable clue, as it may have been either someone’s guess or a deliberate cover story. Other candidates for Hans’ paternity cannot be ruled out⁠⁠—including Schimmelmann himself.</p>
<figure data-embiggen="true"><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-height-ratio="0.95" data-lazy-load-src="https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/damninteresting-a-trail-gone-cold-1.jpg" alt="A map of the Danish West Indies, 1762 (Library of Congress)" title="A map of the Danish West Indies, 1762 (Library of Congress)"/></p><figcaption>A map of the Danish West Indies, 1762 (Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Little Hans spent his early childhood at the Schimmelmanns’ sugar plantation, Constitution Hill, picking up three languages used locally (Danish, English, and the St. Croix creole of the time). In 1788, Schimmelmann left his post in the Danish West Indies, and he and Henrietta made arrangements to return to Copenhagen and settle in an affluent neighbourhood. They selected several adult slaves to take back to the homeland⁠⁠—including Hans’s mother, now called Emilia Regina after a mandatory baptism in 1787, and her brother. The slave children were another matter. They were considered too young to bother with, so four-year-old Hans, along with his younger half-sister and their two cousins, were left behind in Christiansted. Surprisingly, four years later, the Schimmelmanns appear to have changed their minds; they arranged for the two eight-year-olds⁠⁠—Hans and one of his cousins⁠⁠—to travel to Copenhagen and join the household in 1792.</p>
<p>Europe was another world relative to St. Croix, and not just because it was colder. The languages were mostly familiar, but the capital of Denmark was large, bustling, and cosmopolitan⁠⁠—home to almost 100,000 people from a variety of backgrounds. Far removed from the sugar plantation, here all of the slaves were house-slaves; they were responsible for looking after the Schimmelmanns’ children, and cleaning and maintaining the family’s lavish five-storey mansion to the standards of European aristocrats.</p>
<p>Ludvig Schimmelmann died at the end of 1793; most of his surviving children moved out in their young adulthood before the end of the century. Now the head of household, Henrietta Schimmelmann made it very evident that she believed in the traditional definition of slavery, whereby her slaves would do her bidding and that was that. The Copenhagen census of 1801 lists that she had nine “servants” at the time, including Hans, his mother, and his cousin. Hans was given a small amount of schooling⁠⁠—enough to learn to read and write and do arithmetic, which suited Hans’s curiosity and intellect. Alongside this, he received exposure to European music and fell in love with playing the violin. At some point, he was able to acquire an instrument of his own, which he cherished. Once he was a teenager, he was to some extent allowed to roam the city on his own. Still, he and the few other Black house-slaves of Copenhagen did not have true freedom, nor would it have readily occurred to their owners to consider giving it to them.</p>
<p>More broadly, across Europe slavery was becoming a contentious political issue. Abolitionist thought was on the rise, with an increasing number of people scoffing at defenders’ insistence that slaves were happy (or, if unhappy, it was their own fault). Denmark agreed in 1792 that it would soon put a stop to new slave trading; however, this would not end any pre-existing slavery. In order to mitigate the inconvenience to angry wealthy white people, the changes would take effect only in stages over several years. In 1795, it became illegal for Danish slaveholders to transport Caribbean slaves back to Denmark (as the Schimmelmanns had done). In 1803, slave trading beyond the Danish West Indies was outlawed.</p>

<p>But none of this freed Hans Jonathan. As the 18th century turned into the 19th, he found himself in a rotten state indeed, and started pushing back against his lot in life. He repeatedly broke his evening curfew, spending time in the city and mingling with locals, visitors, and students studying in Copenhagen. This infuriated Henrietta. She would stay up waiting for him, then lecture him when he finally returned. Henrietta was a well-off, powerful woman with allies throughout the upper ranks of Danish society. She had no trouble putting her foot down to rein in a disobedient teenage slave.</p>
<p>Things reached their breaking-point at the beginning of 1801 when greater hostilities flared and Denmark found itself on the brink of war with the United Kingdom. Normally these two countries got along with each other, but that was mainly because Denmark tended to be wary and deferential. The British as a colonial and trading power were brash, dominant, heavy-handed, and hypercompetitive. They were especially interested in keeping war supplies out of the hands of their most dependable adversaries⁠⁠—the French. So when Denmark sought to enter into an alliance with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia to facilitate trade with France, it flung British hackles into the stratosphere. Enraged, Great Britain intercepted a group of Danish trading ships, setting the scene for direct naval conflict. Up against the most powerful navy on the planet, Denmark put out a call for patriotic men to enlist.</p>
<p>Henrietta Schimmelmann’s 20-year-old son enthusiastically took up the call and went to serve in the Royal Danish Navy. Right behind him was a similarly eager 16-year-old Hans Jonathan⁠⁠—until Henrietta caught him and said absolutely <i>not</i>. Hans argued that he did not have to follow her rules. Appalled, Henrietta reached for a cane and whacked the young man with it several times to show him who was boss. That did it. Later that evening, Hans said a quick goodbye to his mother, then walked off the Schimmelmann property and joined the Navy anyway.</p>
<p>Henrietta went to the police. Her son had spoken to them just two days prior, reporting the disappearance of money from his possession⁠—200 Danish <i>rigsdalers</i> (several thousand dollars in modern USD). There is no evidence that this had anything to do with Hans Jonathan, but Henrietta decided to blame her slave for it anyway⁠⁠—on top of complaining about his running away. This move was a gamble that could soon have turned very dark, as theft in Denmark had frequently been treated as a capital offense. Henrietta emphasised that the punishment she sought was merely to have Hans Jonathan sent back to St. Croix and sold. <i>That</i> would put him in his place⁠⁠—literally and otherwise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the newly minted naval recruit was about to help his current country face the British. It was the beginning of April, and Britain was eager to catch Danish ships in port at Copenhagen as early as possible. Any later in the spring, and the ice would melt enough to risk letting the Russians out to assist Denmark. In Copenhagen, the Danes would have the home-field advantage, but that was all that could be said for them, as their fleet was much smaller than the British Royal Navy and not remotely as well-trained.</p>
<figure data-embiggen="true"><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-height-ratio="0.70588235294118" data-lazy-load-src="https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/damninteresting-a-trail-gone-cold-3.jpg" alt="The Battle of Copenhagen, the Charlotte Amalie among the vessels on the right" title="The Battle of Copenhagen, the Charlotte Amalie among the vessels on the right"/></p><figcaption>The Battle of Copenhagen, the <i>Charlotte Amalie</i> among the vessels on the right</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Danish people tended to be quiet about their devotion to their country, but when the Battle of Copenhagen began on 2 April 1801, Denmark found itself whipped into a fiery patriotic frenzy. Hans Jonathan was assigned to the <i>Charlotte Amalie</i>, a ship named after a queen consort from a century earlier. The ship took the not-quite-17-year-old and his shipmates straight to the heart of the action. Barely 300 metres from two huge British ships, the <i>Charlotte Amalie</i> exchanged fire with the British over the course of a harrowing four hours, as the doctors below the deck of the ship desperately tried to keep up with the number of men being wounded or worse. The Danish navy did get a boost from Copenhagen’s narrow harbour, which was difficult for the large British vessels to navigate; Britain briefly wavered and considered retreating, but then regained the upper hand. With British victory inevitable, British Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson sent a letter to Danish Crown Prince Frederick proposing a ceasefire⁠⁠—the acceptance of which, he added, would keep him from having to set fire to the captured Danish ships with the crews still inside. Frederick accepted, ending the Battle of Copenhagen and kick-starting negotiations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The <i>Charlotte Amalie</i> was battered and had lost about one-sixth of its men. But Hans Jonathan was uninjured, plus his captain noticed his resolve and praised him specifically in front of others. On top of that, the Navy paid the young man 15 Danish rigsdalers for his service in battle (between $200 and $300 in modern USD).</p>
<p>Hans Jonathan probably thought that in joining the Navy against Henrietta Schimmelmann’s wishes, he had made his point. After all, he had risked his life⁠⁠—and perhaps secured a future for himself as a Danish naval officer instead of a slave. It had been only days since the Battle of Copenhagen, but, assuming that Henrietta had given up, Hans went home to see his mother.</p>
<p>Henrietta had done no such thing. The police had paid little attention to her complaint⁠⁠—the imminent British threat to the city had been somewhat more pressing. Without reinforcement, Henrietta created a makeshift jail by locking Hans inside the Schimmelmanns’ property. But after a couple of days she decided that she’d had enough, and released him back to the Royal Danish Navy.</p>
<p>The Navy briefly assigned Hans to a ship called the <i>Denmark</i>, where he forthrightly shared his unusual story with Captain Steen Andersen Bille. Subsequently, reassigned to the <i>Elephant</i>, Hans met a man much like himself: a slave named Peter Samuel who had also just served in the Battle of Copenhagen. Unlike Hans, Peter was in the Navy at the insistence of his owner. Still, the men had a shared goal in securing their freedom. Fortunately, they had an influential ally in Hans’s previous captain. Bille was a thoughtful man who had spent time in the Danish West Indies and was sympathetic to the two men’s cause. Better yet, he was so well-respected in the Danish government that he could simply take the issue directly to Crown Prince Frederick⁠⁠—which he did.</p>
<figure data-embiggen="true"><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-height-ratio="1.2811387900356" data-lazy-load-src="https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/damninteresting-a-trail-gone-cold-4.jpg" alt="A portrait of Danish Crown Prince Frederick" title="A portrait of Danish Crown Prince Frederick"/></p><figcaption>A portrait of Danish Crown Prince Frederick</figcaption></figure>
<p>As biographer Pálsson points out, this was a dilemma for Frederick, who knew both Steen Bille and Henrietta Schimmelmann well, and was now caught between them in a dispute. Taking either position on the issue of the promising young naval recruit who was also a runaway slave could have amounted to a betrayal.</p>
<p>Frederick considered. Possibly in the spirit of Europe’s encroaching doubt about slavery, he ended up writing a very cautiously worded, three-page letter to Bille on 12 May 1801, gently arguing that on homeland Danish soil, the only people who could be convincingly argued to be <i>legally</i> slaves were prisoners whose sentences specified servitude. As long as Henrietta Schimmelmann was located within Denmark proper, he continued, no one in her household could qualify as anything lower than a free servant. While the letter did not name Hans Jonathan specifically as the person who “is considered free and enjoys rights”, it <i>did</i> refer to Henrietta Schimmelmann, so the intended referent was unambiguous.</p>
<p>It was more than enough for Captain Steen Bille. On 14 May, Bille officially bestowed freedom on Hans Jonathan. From a different commanding officer, but as the result of the same letter from Crown Prince Frederick, his shipmate Peter Samuel received the same. Finally free at 17, Hans Jonathan rented a room above a tavern, filled it with his possessions including the beloved violin, and began to consider how to pursue the life of his own that he had sought for so long.</p>
<p>The development left Henrietta Schimmelmann newly irate. Only a handful of people had seen Frederick’s letter to Bille, and it is not clear if Henrietta was among them; either way, the consequences would have allowed her to infer a major risk to her ability to maintain her household the way she wanted it. The letter was, from this perspective, a dangerous precedent. On its basis, any of the <i>other</i> eight slaves in her household (including Hans Jonathan’s mother, uncle, and cousin) could simply walk away with the presumed blessing of Denmark’s very ruler. Unacceptable! On 19 May⁠⁠—only a week after the release of Frederick’s letter⁠⁠—Henrietta marched straight back into the same police station as before and submitted a formal written complaint, asking the authorities to arrest and question Hans Jonathan.</p>
<p>This time, the police officers went out looking for Hans. Finding him at the tavern, they explained the issue. Hans told them he wanted to serve the Danish monarch by remaining in the navy⁠⁠—and he told the police that he would provide evidence of having been set free.</p>
<p>The complaint was left to be resolved by the courts, but when the case came up in front of the judges, Henrietta Schimmelmann was not in attendance. She had vowed to send relevant documents via her intermediary⁠⁠—her steward Peder Hansen⁠⁠—but when Hansen arrived, he claimed to have no documents to show. The court threw out the case, and Hans Jonathan was free once again. But Henrietta had not given up. She went to the navy and requested 400 rigsdalers as compensation for losing her slave (somewhere between $5,000 and $7,000 in modern USD). The Navy brushed her off.</p>
<p>A badly timed coincidence gave her a new idea. On 20 July 1801, a slave named David Tams slipped away from his rural Danish household and made a wild dash for Copenhagen. He too was from St. Croix and had been brought back to the homeland by slaveowners. However, his attempt at entering the city got him arrested. Tams’s irritated owner then opened a civil lawsuit hoping to establish a legal claim on the man⁠⁠—and Henrietta Schimmelmann, bringing a whole new meaning to the term “follow suit,” decided to do the same. Legally, this was much less complicated than her earlier accusations of theft and desertion; if she won the civil case, it would simply establish that she owned Hans Jonathan, end of story.</p>
<p>It was not obvious how this new court case would go. On the one hand, bringing slaves from the Danish West Indies to Denmark itself had been technically illegal since 1795. On the other, Hans Jonathan had arrived in Denmark before that point, and his move to Copenhagen had not automatically voided his status as a slave. If Henrietta owned him, she should still have the right to sell him. With that, on the evening of 3 December 1801, four police officers set off for the tavern to arrest Hans Jonathan⁠⁠—who once again explained the existence of the letter from Crown Prince Frederick to Captain Steen Bille ensuring his freedom. The police officers were unmoved. A slave with a personal letter from the <i>Crown Prince of Denmark</i>? Suuuure. Within an hour, Hans was in a cell.</p>
<p>At the time, Danish courtroom processes were conducted slowly and mainly through written statements. However, then, as now, access to skilled legal assistance was not equitable. Henrietta Schimmelmann, wealthy and connected, had a steadfast lawyer named N. C. Bierring, and he did so much of the work that there is no evidence she ever made an appearance in court herself. At the other end of the scale, Hans Jonathan was unable to afford the services of any lawyer, and was assigned an attorney by the court, a man thought to be named ‘Beyer’ (though sources do not agree).</p>
<p>Bierring slammed Hans Jonathan for his (supposed) shameless lying⁠⁠—to think that a slave could have had the backing of the Danish crown prince! Captain Bille still had the copy of the letter from Crown Prince Frederick, and either way could have established the truth if called as a witness. However, for some reason, Beyer did not call Bille, which suggests some incompetence as it left the accusation of lying unchallenged. Beyer also made a few errors in recounting the facts of the case, and at one point lapsed into sarcasm. Bierring leapt at the chance to criticise Beyer’s tone, undercutting the inconvenient fact that some of Beyer’s arguments had merit and strength. For instance, Beyer had been through the Danish legal code and found absolutely no support for slavery in homeland Denmark. Also, had Henrietta Schimmelmann not said in her written statement to police that Hans Jonathan had “left her service”⁠⁠—and thus never been anything less than a <i>servant</i>? </p>
<p>Every single one of the witnesses was from Henrietta Schimmelmann’s household, and meant to support the plaintiff. However, they were less than cooperative. Emilia Regina was understandably unhelpful when it came to answering questions in a case against her own son (especially with her own freedom possibly being at stake as well). Likewise, Henrietta’s steward Peder Hansen stood up for Hans Jonathan and pointed out that Henrietta had physically beaten him “a few times with a Spanish stick” and that Hans had left in order to serve his country. Beyer also asked: who was the young man’s father, anyway? A “free white man” or a slave? Presumably the idea was to explore the possibility that Henrietta Schimmelmann’s claim on Hans Jonathan was far from watertight⁠⁠—but the judges accepted Bierring’s objection of “irrelevant” and refused to let Emilia Regina respond.</p>
<p>Toward the end of May 1802, the analogous case of David Tams wrapped up⁠—Danish judges sided with the man’s owner. For Hans Jonathan only days later, the judges likewise announced on 31 May their decision that Hans Jonathan was Henrietta Schimmelmann’s property and she was legally permitted to send him back to the Danish West Indies to be sold. Four of the judges saw no room for argument. The fifth, a young man not much older than Hans himself, ended up siding with his seniors but also made room in his comments for a dissenting argument that Caribbean slaves arriving on Danish soil could only be servants rather than slaves⁠⁠—precisely the conclusion that Crown Prince Frederick had drawn in his not-at-all-fictional letter.</p>
<p>The courts had not found Hans guilty of any crime, but unless he chose to appeal the verdict, he was required to turn himself in to Henrietta Schimmelmann within 15 days. The court does not seem to have noticed that, as a strategy for containing a runaway, this plan left something to be desired.</p>
<p>In the days following the verdict, a summary of the case and its outcome were published and disseminated as usual to the people of Copenhagen⁠⁠—thus making very public the dispute between the socialite and the escaped slave. One Danish government official even wrote to the Danish West Indies to warn them that an ill-behaved man named Hans Jonathan might soon be sold on the island. For the social elite, the details of the civil lawsuit made for irresistible gossip, to the point that it may have become a problem for Henrietta Schimmelmann in spite of her nominal victory.</p>
<p>Hans Jonathan did not request an appeal. He also did not surrender himself to Henrietta Schimmelmann. He was nowhere to be found. Once the 15-day period had elapsed, Henrietta gained the legal right to have him located and arrested. However, she does not seem to have requested police assistance. Instead, within only a year, she moved her household out of the city altogether.</p>
<p>However one-sided, the case was enough of a landmark that the story of the young biracial Black man up against a crushing system remains fairly well-known in Danish legal circles. But the man himself had apparently walked out of the courtroom and into the streets of Copenhagen and vanished. Even more than 150 years later, a comprehensive 1964 article by Danish law professor Knud Waaben would point out that historians had no idea what had become of David Tams and Hans Jonathan.</p>
