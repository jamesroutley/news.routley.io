    <h1>Neo-Luddite Revolution II: Attention &amp; Intention</h1>

	this series if you want some context, or just keep reading if you&#39;re here for the practical deinstagramification
	hacks.</p> <h3>context</h3> <p>I hate how I have come to use my phone and the internet more broadly. I think most of you reading
	this are probably in the same boat. While there are no shortage of urgent political and social
	problems at the moment, figuring out how to love your current life more while fighting for a
	better one is a worthwhile pasttime. It also does a good deal towards giving people energy <i>for</i> those fights, rather than paralyzing people into inaction.</p> <p>IMO: We collectively lack compelling visions of how we could practically make our lives better on
	the attention economy front without it feeling like eating digital brussels sprouts. I am here to
	share a few strategies I&#39;ve found that feel more like drinking a nice cup of tea: you had to brew
	it, but you&#39;re probably glad you did. There&#39;s no quick fix to addictive technologies, but if
	you&#39;re actively trying to kick a habit, it&#39;s easier when presented with some strategies which have
	worked for others. On that note: <b>write me a line</b> if you have strategies you like or cool stuff
	you&#39;re working on in this regard!</p> <p>Here are some of the strategies I&#39;ve been tinkering with in the interests of decoupling my
	emotional state from various automatic processes and re-coupling it more intentionally to other
	inputs.</p> <h4>reinvent the ipod touch</h4> <p>My favorite suggestion on the list because it rocks (ha). I grabbed an old android phone lying
	around, wiped it, installed <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="blank" rel="noreferrer"><!----><!---->LineageOS<!----></a><!----> on it
	(so, no Google Play or Google Services), and then installed only five applications on it: a minimalist
	text-only launcher, a music file player, a radio application, a podcast application, and Bandcamp.
	I have it connected via Bluetooth to two speakers in my house, one in my kitchen and a portable speaker
	I can carry around. There is no reason I need to be carrying an attention trap around to do work and
	chores when I can be carrying an attention ~hack~ around instead (that is, putting on light and pleasant
	background noise). Also soft-quitting streaming has led to me discovering new music and loving the
	music I already own more than the last several years of battling the Spotify algorithm (to stop spamming
	me with Caroline Polachek) ever did. Local radio is great, whoulda thought.</p> <h4>leave your phone in a different room. ideally, stock both rooms with various interesting
	experiences</h4> <p>Because I can do everything I actually need my phone for during the workday or choreday on my
	&#34;ipod,&#34; that is to say play music, I have been leaving my phone in another room. I can still check
	it whenever, but it&#39;s not around for me to compulsively check each time I am seeking stimulus (aka
	bored) at my desk. If I have to go into another room to check my phone, I&#39;ll also usually find
	something else interesting to do in that room --- check on my houseplants, feed my cat, make a cup
	of tea, etc. Raising the barrier to checking notifications to &#39;walking downstairs&#39; has done a lot
	more for me than the block apps you can install have, because the former requires physical motion
	and is therefore real to my brain. I don&#39;t make the rules! Also, adding a pleasant task (water my
	backyard nasturtiums and pet my cat) to the unpleasant compulsion (see what fresh hell is being
	announced on AP News today) helps soften the blow. It&#39;s hard to be too upset with the world when
	you&#39;re looking at a flower and petting a cat.</p> <h4>periodicals</h4> <p>Subscribing to a few long-form print periodicals and newsletters has helped mitigate my compulsive
	news-checking. I feel more infinitely more informed reading a few long-form articles published at
	a regular cadence than I do consuming tons of slapped-together news-cycle journalism. This switch
	been harder for me of late because political situations have been more volatile, and therefore
	even more valuable in terms of avoiding spiralling about every hourly new crisis. Taking
	recommendations of new periodicals, especially in print, to subscribe to!</p> <h4>harm reduction for the sensory seeking</h4> <p>Sometimes you just want to tip-tap. There are moods where nothing but clicking colorful boxes on a
	portable screen will do. For these moments, I have been pivoting to opening up Duolingo or Mango
	Languages and completing a course lesson. Are mobile apps the best way to learn a language?
	Absolutely not. Is this still contributing to my overall usage of the phone as a strategy for
	&#39;checking out&#39; emotionally? Absolutely. Is it still better for my general wellbeing than getting
	sucked into an infinite-scroll socials app? <i>holy Shit, yes.</i></p> <h4>take an exposure break</h4> <p>From Friday sundown to Saturday sundown, my phone is turned off and placed at the back of a
	cabinet. (Yes, I am Jewish.) Having 25 hours per week free of the compulsion to check my
	notifications has been a major improvement to my life. Those notifications will still be there for
	me Saturday night, and I&#39;m always significantly less pressed about checking them the first day or
	two after my weekly break.</p> <h4>get more (smaller!) social media</h4> <p>My local WhatsApp groups serve the function that Facebook free groups used to with a lot less
	drama. I hate Discord for <i>so</i> many reasons but I still stay in a couple smaller servers to get
	casual updates on subjects of interest. My partner is on chronological-feed Tumblr with mostly people
	he&#39;s followed since he was 13 who are now regular-degular adults. I&#39;m on several local / national listservs
	and selectively subscribe to newsletters that keep me informed on stuff I might want to know about
	without having to brave the wilds of FB/Insta/Tiktok about it all. It&#39;s hard to say for another person
	what these &#39;smaller&#39; socials might be because &#39;small&#39; means &#39;insanely idiosyncratic&#39;, but if you&#39;re
	gonna stay on socials at all, I find smaller scale options to be less overwhelming and addictive. There&#39;s
	usually just less there of interest, which helps you not really want to look at whatever it is beyond
	what you need it for. Local groups are great because that helps you feel connected to folks in person
	ideally! Probably NextDoor would not work for that purpose though, gotta be judicious....</p> <h4>delete socials. just delete your socials</h4> <p>Or as many of them as you can bring yourself to. I cannot tell you how much saner a person I am
	having left Instagram/Twitter/Facebook in particular. So much of my mental energy is conserved
	from not seeing the constant deluge of goods for sale masquerading as various activisms,
	algorithmically amplified racist nationalisms, and undiluted brainrot respectively on these
	platforms. This is the only &#39;negative&#39; suggestion I have, and I put it at the end, but seriously!
	If you can&#39;t delete an account, at least delete the app and view it from a browser.</p><!----><!--]--> <!----><!----><!----><!----><!----> <!--[--><hr/> <ul><li><a href="https://rjp.io/blog/rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><!----><!----></a><!----></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/jmgisele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><!----><!----></a><!----></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-gisele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><!----><!----></a><!----></li> <li><!----></li> <li><!----></li></ul><!----> <!--]--></div></div>
