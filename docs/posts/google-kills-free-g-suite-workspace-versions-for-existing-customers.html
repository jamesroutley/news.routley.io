    <h1>Google kills free G Suite / Workspace versions for existing customers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">  <section> <div>    <div>      <article class="page" sc-render-smart-button="false" itemscope=""> <section data-stats-ve="35"><div><div><p>Prior to December 6, 2012, Google offered a free edition of G Suite—also known as the <em>legacy free</em> edition of Google Apps—that had a reduced set of business features. As of December 6, 2012, Google stopped offering the free edition to new customers. The Terms of Service for the G Suite legacy free edition can be found <a href="https://workspace.google.com/terms/standard_terms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have the G Suite legacy free edition, you need to upgrade to a paid Google Workspace subscription to keep your services. The G Suite legacy free edition will no longer be available starting May 1, 2022. Starting May 1, Google will seamlessly transition you to Workspace, which you can use at no cost until July 1, 2022.</p>

<p>We recommend you upgrade now to a Google Workspace subscription that meets your needs. Upgrading does not affect your data or service availability. Learn how to <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Upgrade from the G Suite legacy free edition</a>.</p>
