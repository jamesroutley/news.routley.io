    <h1>Introducing the blogroll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2025-03-07-blogroll-plant.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Plant" src="https://macwright.com/images/2025-03-07-blogroll-plant.jpg"/></picture></p><p>This website has a <a href="https://macwright.com/blogroll.opml">new section: blogroll.opml</a>! A blogroll is a list of blogs - a lightweight way of people <a href="https://indieweb.org/blogroll">recommending other people’s writing on the indieweb</a>.</p><h2 id="what-it-includes">What it includes</h2><p>The blogs that I included are just sampled from my many RSS subscriptions that I keep in my <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> reader. I’m subscribed to about 200 RSS feeds, the majority of which are dead or only publish once a year. I like that about blogs, that there’s no expectation of getting a post out every single day, like there is in more algorithmically-driven media. If someone who I interacted with on the internet years ago decides to restart their writing, that’s great! There’s no reason to prune all the quiet feeds.</p><p>The picks are oriented toward what I’m into: niches, blogs that have a loose topic but don’t try to be general-interest, people with distinctive writing. If you import all of the feeds into your RSS reader, you’ll probably end up unsubscribing from some of them because some of the <a href="https://www.cycfi.com/">experimental electric guitar design</a> or <a href="https://adamaskwhy.com/">bonsai news</a> is not what you’re into. Seems fine, or you’ll discover a new interest!</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p><a href="https://rubenerd.com/">Ruben Schade</a> figured out a brilliant way to show blogrolls and I copied him. Check out his post on <a href="https://rubenerd.com/styling-opml-and-rss-with-xslt/">styling OPML and RSS with XSLT to XHTML</a> for how it works.</p><p>My only additions to that scheme were making the blogroll page blend into the rest of the website by using an <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">include</a> tag with Jekyll to add the basic site skeleton, and adding a link with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/download">download</a> attribute to provide a simple way to download the OPML file. Oddly, if you try to save the OPML page using <em>Save as…</em> in Firefox, Firefox will save the transformed output via the XSLT, rather than the raw source code. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> is such an odd and rare part of the web ecosystem, I had to use it.</p></div></div>
