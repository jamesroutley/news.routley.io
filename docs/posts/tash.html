      <p>It&#39;s time for sharing music again. Interestingly I only feel like writing about music when it&#39;s something I normally wouldn&#39;t enjoy but still find intriguing. Let&#39;s see if that trend continues.</p>
<p>So, today I want to share Tash Sultana with you. She seems new to the spotlight, but an experienced musician, though I cannot say for sure. All I know is that her <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522848880/tash-sultana-tiny-desk-concert">Tiny Desk</a> performance blew me away. She is so energetic and beautifully excited by her own music that I simply cannot look away, wich is quite unusual for me. I normally let Tiny Desk concerts run in the background, becuase they&#39;re often very mellow and calming. Not this time.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know her music before watching this performance. I&#39;m glad that changed, and I hope I will see much more of her in the future.</p>
<p>Also, that last song is just <em>insane</em> guitar work.</p>
