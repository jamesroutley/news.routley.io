    <h1>Anthropic and Cursor Spend This Much on Amazon Web Services</h1>

This information provides a revealing — though incomplete — insight into the costs of running Anthropic and Cursor, but does not include other costs, like salaries and compute obtained from other providers. I cannot tell you (and do not have insight into) Anthropic’s actual private moves. Any conclusions or speculation I make in this article will be based on my interpretations of the information I’ve received, as well as other publicly-available information.</li><li>I have used estimates of Anthropic’s revenue based on reporting across the last ten months. Any estimates I make are detailed and they are brief. </li><li><strong>These costs are inclusive of every product bought on Amazon Web Services, including EC2, storage and database services (as well as literally everything else they pay for).</strong></li><li>Anthropic works with both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud for compute. I do not have any information about its Google Cloud spend.<ul><li>The reason I bring this up is that Anthropic’s revenue is already being eaten up by its AWS spend. It’s likely billions <em>more</em> in the hole from Google Cloud and other operational expenses.</li></ul></li><li>I have confirmed with sources that every single number I give around Anthropic and Cursor’s AWS spend is <strong>the final cash paid to Amazon after any discounts or credits.</strong></li><li>While I cannot disclose the identity of my source, I am 100% confident in these numbers, and have verified their veracity with other sources. </li></ul><h2 id="anthropic%E2%80%99s-compute-costs-are-likely-much-higher-than-reported-%E2%80%94-135-billion-in-2024-on-aws-alone">Anthropic’s Compute Costs Are Likely Much Higher Than Reported — $1.35 Billion in 2024 on AWS Alone</h2><p>In February of this year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The information reported</u></a> that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue:</p><blockquote>It’s not publicly known how much revenue Anthropic generated in 2024, although its monthly revenue rose to about $80 million by the end of the year, compared to around $8 million at the start. That suggests full-year revenue in the $400 million to $600 million range.</blockquote><p>While I don’t know about prepayment for services, I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.</p><p>Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for. </p><p>The Information’s piece also brings up another point:</p><blockquote>The costs to develop AI models accounted for a major portion of Anthropic’s expenses last year. The company spent $1.5 billion on servers for training AI models. OpenAI was on track to spend as much as $3 billion on training costs last year, though that figure includes additional expenses like paying for data.</blockquote><p>Before I go any further, I want to be clear that The Information’s reporting is sound, and I trust that their source (I have no idea who they are or what information was provided) was operating in good faith with good data. </p><p>However, Anthropic is telling people it spent $1.5 billion on <em>just</em> training when it has an Amazon Web Services bill of $1.35 billion, which heavily suggests that its actual compute costs are significantly higher than we thought, because, to quote SemiAnalysis, “<a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/amazons-ai-resurgence-aws-anthropics-multi-gigawatt-trainium-expansion?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=A%20large%20share%20of%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20spending%20is%20going%20to%20Google%20Cloud%20%E2%80%93%20one%20of%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20first%20major%20investors%20(%24300M%20round%20late%2D2022)%20and%20preferred%20cloud%20partner%20in%202023%20and%202024%2C%20before%20the%20expanded%20AWS%20deal."><u>a large share of Anthropic’s spending is going to Google Cloud</u></a>.” </p><p>I am guessing, because I do not know, but with $4.85 billion of other expenses to account for, it’s reasonable to believe Anthropic spent an amount similar to its AWS spend on Google Cloud. I do not have any information to confirm this, but given the discrepancies mentioned above, this is an explanation that makes sense.</p><p>I also will add that there is some sort of undisclosed cut that Amazon gets of Anthropic’s revenue, though it’s unclear how much. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to The Information</u></a>, “Anthropic previously told some investors it paid a substantially higher percentage to Amazon [than OpenAI’s 20% revenue share with Microsoft] when companies purchase Anthropic models through Amazon.”</p><p>I cannot confirm whether a similar revenue share agreement exists between Anthropic and Google.</p><p>This also makes me wonder exactly where Anthropic’s money is going.</p><h2 id="where-is-anthropic%E2%80%99s-money-going">Where Is Anthropic’s Money Going?</h2><p>Anthropic has, based on what I can find, raised $32 billion in the last two years, starting out 2023 with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-aws-anthropic-ai?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a $4 billion investment from Amazon from September 2023</u></a> (bringing the total to $37.5 billion), where Amazon was named its “primary cloud provider” nearly eight months after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/22/google-agrees-to-new-1-billion-investment-in-anthropic.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Anthropic announced Google was Anthropic’s “cloud provider.,”</u></a> which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/google-commits-to-invest-2-billion-in-openai-competitor-anthropic.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google responded to a month later by investing another $2 billion on October 27 2023</u></a>, “involving a $500 million upfront investment and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time,” bringing its total funding from 2023 to $6 billion.</p><p>In 2024, it would raise several more rounds — one in January for $750 million, another in March for $884.1 million, another in May for $452.3 million, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>another $4 billion from Amazon in November 2024</u></a>, which also saw it name AWS as Anthropic’s “primary cloud and training partner,” bringing its 2024 funding total to $6 billion.</p><p>In 2025 so far, it’s raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/22/google-agrees-to-new-1-billion-investment-in-anthropic.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a $1 billion round from Google</u></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/anthropic-raises-3-5b-to-fuel-its-ai-ambitions/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a $3.5 billion venture round</u></a> in March, opened <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/anthropic-ai-credit-facility.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a $2.5 billion credit facility</u></a> in May, and completed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13-billion-at-18-billion-valuation.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a $13 billion venture round in September, valuing the company at $183 billion</u></a>. This brings its total 2025 funding to $20 billion. </p><p>While I do not have Anthropic’s 2023 numbers, its spend on AWS in 2024 — around $1.35 billion — leaves (as I’ve mentioned) $4.85 billion in costs that are unaccounted for. The Information reports that <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>costs for Anthropic’s 521 research and development staff reached $160 million in 2024</u></a>, leaving 394 other employees unaccounted for (for 915 employees total), and also adding that Anthropic expects its headcount to increase to 1900 people by the end of 2025.</p><p>The Information also adds that Anthropic “expects to stop burning cash in 2027.”</p><p>This leaves two unanswered questions:</p><ul><li>Where is the rest of Anthropic’s money going?</li><li>How will it “stop burning cash” when its operational costs explode as its revenue increases?</li></ul><p>An optimist might argue that Anthropic is just growing its pile of cash so it’s got a warchest to burn through in the future, but I have my doubts. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-dario-amodei-gulf-state-leaked-memo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In a memo revealed by WIRED</u></a>, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei stated that “if [Anthropic wanted] to stay on the frontier, [it would] gain a very large benefit from having access to this capital,” with “this capital” referring to money from the Middle East. </p><p>Anthropic and Amodei’s sudden willingness to take large swaths of capital from the Gulf States does not suggest that it’s not at least a <em>little</em> desperate for capital, especially given Anthropic has, <a href="https://archive.ph/t2HiF?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>according to Bloomberg</u></a>, “recently held early funding talks with Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13-billion-at-18-billion-valuation.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a month after raising $13 billion</u></a>.</p><p>In my opinion — and this is just my gut instinct — I believe that it is either significantly more expensive to run Anthropic than we know, or Anthropic’s leaked (and stated) revenue numbers are worse than we believe. I do not know one way or another, and will only report what I know.</p><p>So, I’m going to do this a little differently than you’d expect, in that I’m going to lay out how much these companies spent, and draw throughlines from that spend to its reported revenue numbers and product announcements or events that may have caused its compute costs to increase.</p><p>I’ve only got Cursor’s numbers from January through September 2025, but I have Anthropic’s AWS spend for both the entirety of 2024 and through September 2025.</p><h2 id="what-does-%E2%80%9Cannualized%E2%80%9D-mean">What Does “Annualized” Mean?</h2><p>So, this term is one of the most abused terms in the world of software, <em>but in this case</em>, I am sticking to the idea that it means “month times 12.” So, if a company made $10m in January, you would say that its annualized revenue is $120m. Obviously, there’s a lot of (when you think about it, really obvious) problems with this kind of reporting — and thus, you only ever see it when it comes to pre-IPO firms — but that’s besides the point.</p><p>I give you this explanation because, when contrasting Anthropic’s AWS spend with its revenues, I’ve had to work back from whatever annualized revenues were reported for that month. </p><p>Anthropic’s 2024 revenues are a little bit of a mystery, but, as mentioned above, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The Information</u></a> says it might be between $400 million and $600 million.</p><p>Here’s its monthly AWS spend. </p><ul><li>January 2024 - $52.9 million</li><li>February 2024 - $60.9 million</li><li>March 2024 - $74.3 million</li><li>April 2024 - $101.1 million</li><li>May 2024 - $100.1 million</li><li>June 2024 - $101.8 million</li><li>July 2024 - $118.9 million</li><li>August 2024 - $128.8 million</li><li>September 2024 - $127.8 million</li><li>October 2024 - $169.6 million</li><li>November 2024 - $146.5 million</li><li>December 2024 - $176.1 million</li></ul><p>I’m gonna be <em>nice</em> here and say that Anthropic made $600 million in 2024 — the higher end of The Information’s reporting — meaning that it spent around 226% of its revenue ($1.359 billion) on Amazon Web Services.</p><p><strong>[Editor&#39;s note:</strong> this copy originally had incorrect maths on the %. Fixed now.]<strong> </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/howmuchmoney/#anthropic-has-made-around-15-billion-through-july-in-2025-so-far-and-could-hit-9-billion-annualized-by-end-of-2025"><u>Thanks to my own analysis</u></a> and reporting from outlets like The Information and Reuters, we have a pretty good idea of Anthropic’s revenues for much of the year.

As I discuss in what I just linked, this led Cursor to aggressively change its product, thereby vastly increasing its customers’ costs if they wanted to use the same service.</li><li>That same month, Cursor’s AWS costs — which I believe are the <em>minority</em> of its cloud compute costs — exploded by 104% (or by $6.48 million), and never returned to their previous levels.</li><li>It’s conceivable that this surge is due to the compute-heavy nature of the latest Claude 4 models released that month — or, perhaps, Cursor sending more of its users to other models that it runs on Bedrock. </li></ul></li><li>July 2025 - $15.5 million<ul><li>As you can see, Cursor’s costs continue to balloon in July, and I am guessing it’s because of the Service Tiers situation — which, I believe, indirectly resulted in Cursor pushing more users to models that it runs on Amazon’s infrastructure.</li></ul></li><li>August 2025 - $9.67 million<ul><li>So, I can only guess as to why there was a drop here.

After all, <a href="https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI already has its own priority processing product, which it launched shortly after Anthropic’s in June</u></a>.</p><p>The ultimate problem is that there really are no<em> winners</em> in this situation. If Anthropic kills Cursor through aggressive rent-seeking, that directly eats into its own revenues. If Anthropic lets Cursor succeed, that’s <em>revenue</em>, but it’s also clearly <em>unprofitable revenue</em>. Everybody loses, but nobody loses more than Cursor’s (and other AI companies’) customers. </p><p>I’ve come away from this piece with a feeling of dread.</p><p>Anthropic’s costs are out of control, and as things get more desperate, it appears to be lashing out at its customers, both companies like Cursor and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Claude Code customers facing weekly rate limits on their more-powerful models</u></a> who are chided for using a product they pay for. Again, I cannot say for certain, but the spike in costs is clear, and it feels like more than a coincidence to me. </p><p>There is no period of time that I can see in the just under two years of data I’ve been party to that suggests that Anthropic has any means of — or any success doing — cost-cutting, and the only thing this company seems capable of doing is increasing the amount of money it burns on a monthly basis. </p><p>Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time"><u>The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers</u></a>, but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it’s impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.</p><p>In any case, these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically — from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! — for this company to ever become sustainable. </p><p>I don’t think that people would pay those prices. If anything, I think what we’re seeing in these numbers is a company bleeding out from costs that escalate the more that its user base grows. This is just my opinion, of course. </p><p>I’m tired of watching these companies burn billions of dollars to destroy our environment and steal from everybody.
