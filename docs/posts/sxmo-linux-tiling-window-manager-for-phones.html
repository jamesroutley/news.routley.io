        <h3>Simple menu-driven interface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> tools (dwm, dmenu, st, etc) or Wayland tools (sway, bemenu, foot, etc.)</li>
            <li>Augmented touch and gesture support</li>
            <li>Menu-driven interface that can also be controlled with hardware buttons</li>
            <li>Community sourced context menu that changes according to the active application (CLI or GUI)</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “I really like this; I&#39;ve been using this for about a week now.
            I appreciate the developers&#39; willingness to design something
            with a slight learning curve that works very well, and in
            part because of this. This demonstrates a level of respect
            for their end users which I value. I am not saying that this
            mobile computing environment is hard to use, I am saying
            that it is highly efficient and effective, and that I have
            learned things by using it because the people who made this
            do not condescend through oversimplification.”

        <h3>SSH as a first class citizen</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Send texts via ssh using your favorite text editor (vis, emacs, vim, etc.)</li>
            <li>Read notifications, texts, etc.</li>
            <li>Access bluetooth, wifi menus</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “Being able to SSH into my phone and treat it just like any
            other Alpine Linux machine adds a tremendous amount of value.
            Leaving it in my pocket and using it from my computer is very
            convenient. I don&#39;t have to treat my phone like an alien in my
            otherwise uniform computing setup anymore.”

        <h3>Everything is Scriptable</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Launch user defined scripts at phone calls, texts, etc.</li>
            <li>Bind certain scripts to gestures using lisgd</li>
            <li>Bind device&#39;s physical buttons (single/double/triple click) to trigger scripts</li>
            <li>Plain text modem logs, contact list, and sms texts</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “Phone calls and text messages are routed through shell scripts,
            a feature I didn’t know I needed until I saw it in action.
            Sxmo probably is the killer app for running an actual Linux
            distribution on your phone.”

        <h3>Use the same <span hint="free open source software">FOSS</span> apps you use on the desktop</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No locked-down app ecosystem</li>
            <li>Runs on traditional Linux distributions like <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and <a href="https://postmarketos.org">postmarketOS</a> optimized for mobile devices</li>
            <li>Use terminal-based applications on a smartphone</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “Running a tiling WM on your phone sounds like a
            stupid idea... until you discover #Sxmo. The whole thing is
            simple but amazing - it takes one or two days to get used
            to it, but then you know it inside out. Thanks to the
            built-in extensibility and simple codebase, you can change
            everything to your liking. This interface and its skilled
            community have become a great asset in
            the wider #linux smartphone ecosystem!”
