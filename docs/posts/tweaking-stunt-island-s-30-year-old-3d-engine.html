      <h2 id="800-detail-tweaking-stunt-islands-30-year-old-3d-engine">800% Detail: Tweaking Stunt Island’s 30-year-old 3D Engine</h2>

<p>Note: the patch is available at the end of the article (<b><a href="#download">HERE</a></b>). This post is about its making-of.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Stunt Island is a flight simulator from the year 1992. You can read more about it in my <a href="https://annali.netlify.app/2024/11/15/stunt-island-elegy.html">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Last month I finally beat the game, winning all the missions and getting the title of “Stuntman of the year”. While I was replaying the videos of my attempts, as well as some fan-made SI films in the channel, I wondered if I could somehow mitigate the obvious limitations of the rendering engine.</p>

<p>Also, I was always fascinated by the art of reverse engineering, and I thought this could be a good opportunity to learn something in this field. Assembly is not new to me, but dealing with an archaic DOS program, working without gdb’s features and any kind of debug symbols means entering an entirely different world.</p>

<p>I spent a dozen of hours learning the tools of the trade and trying to figure out the puzzle, and I was very happy of my eventual success. After finding and patching the right location in the executable, the engine got some extra horsepower. No extra resolution unfortunately, but many more details, as one can see in the comparisons below.</p>

<p>For a video comparison, one can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/AZMDm-2IIzc?si=7q4pK-dFhUyMhEyJ"><b>this “remaster” of the movie <em>Mickey’s Revenge</em></b></a>, courtesy of Doug Armknecht’s “Stunt Island Central” channel.</p>

<p>In the following, I’ll show the process and some failed tries. Even if this is far from being a professional effort, I hope that publishing this can be of help to other learners, or maybe induce some experts to chime in and suggest improvements (in the name of Cunningham’s Law). Tutorials about debugging with DOSBox are rare to find, so I feel that even this small example can be useful.</p>

<p>Also, I hope to revive some interest in an old, but beautiful and unique game.</p>

<h3 id="start">Start</h3>

<p>Since I have never debugged DOS programs, the first step is to build up the toolset. I need</p>

<ul>
  <li>DOSBox debug to run and live-debug the game</li>
  <li>Ghidra to decompile and analyze the executable. There are other DOS-compatible decompilers around, but I liked Ghidra’s “late Nineties” UI, even if it does not render nicely on Linux. I used the older 10.4 version for compatibility with my Debian’s openjdk package.</li>
  <li>Bless, my favorite hex editor</li>
</ul>

<p>I start by opening the game executable in Ghidra. The first result is underwhelming:</p>

<p>Just one function and a lot of non-decompiled bytes, that does not look good. Maybe the decompile process failed?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the function. I cannot grasp all the details, but it seems to be copying a buffer. This rings a bell – I remember reading some articles about self-decrypting executables. Could it be that the real game code is obfuscated and only revealed after the startup?</p>

<p>By the way, what does the file header look like?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C STUNT.EXE | head -5

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seeing the “LZ91” finally clicks for me. This game was probably compressed by some variant of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Some googling leads me first to <a href="https://www.lodsb.com/reversing-lz91-from-commander-keen">this article by Sam Russell</a> and then to <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/UNLZEXE">the UNLZEXE unpacker</a>. Turns out that the original compression tool was authored by the prolific genius Fabrice Bellard.</p>

<p>OK, let’s decompress the executable and reload it in Ghidra:</p>

<p>Looks better. Can we make any sense of the functions?</p>

<p>Nope, this is over my paygrade. But we are in 2024, maybe we can seek the help of a LLM? Copilot says:</p>

<p><small><blockquote>
This looks like assembly code mixed with some higher-level C code constructs, dealing with system-level operations. Here’s a bit of a breakdown:</blockquote>
</small></p>

<p>Oh, I see, “the code calls other functions which perform some specific tasks”. Awesome. Thanks all the same, AI. See you in some years, and let’s rely on carbon-based intelligence in the meanwhile.</p>

<h3 id="a-matter-of-detail">A matter of detail</h3>

<p>The static analysis has not yielded any result yet, but I have another idea. Stunt Island has a “Detail” setting:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>My hope is to find out where the detail level (here, 75%) is stored in the memory, and to change it to 255, or to see how it is used in the rendering process.</p>

<p>Let’s fire up Dosbox debug. The best manual for the interface is <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=3944">a thread on the Vogons forum</a>.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/dosbox-debug.png">

</a>
</center>

<p>The GUI is nice, even if I miss the amenities of modern debugging, especially the function names. However, credit is due to the authors: they put in nice features like a branch predictor that shows whether a jump instruction will be taken, and in which direction (back or forward), assuming that the current status of registries and memory stays the same.</p>

<p>How to find the location of the detail level variable? I navigate again to the “Preferences” screen and spend a lot of time there, trying to devise a method to extract such information. My list of failed attempts includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Break on keyboard input: I set a breakpoint on keypress (<code>BPINT 16</code>) and press “Return” with the mouse pointing on the “plus” sign. The program breaks in a input-reading routine, but stepping through the code I lose my way before being able to understand what the program is doing. Considering I could be in the middle of a complex UI-drawing routine, I give up.</li>
  <li>Break on mouse move or click: there is a <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=83267">helpful guide</a> for that, but again I end up in a mysterious land.</li>
  <li>Break on pixel change: I manage to break the program when a pixel in the detail scroller changes (<code>bpmem a1000:3500</code>). Again, I cannot find the way out of the graphics code.</li>
  <li>In Ghidra, look for a printf format string with a number and a percent (something like <code>&#34;%u%%&#34;</code>): nothing found</li>
</ul>

<p>While looking for other ideas, I find a nice <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Reverse_Engineering">list of techniques</a> by the makers of ScummVM. One of the options is “File Access”, which reminds me that the game must store its preferences somewhere. A quick search by date reveals that a file with the promising name <code>GAME.VAR</code> is updated every time I alter the settings. Let’s see how it changes when a different detail level is chosen. At 99% detail we have</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  70 fd ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |p.............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s set 1% detail:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  8f 02 ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |..............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the detail level is in the very first two bytes. Unluckily, it seems already to be scaled, with 100% = <code>0xffff</code>. No chance to simply set it higher. But let’s not lose hope so soon: we have now more information to find out where in the memory this value is stored, and maybe we can change something else in the 3D computations.</p>

<p>I need a breakpoint when <code>GAME.SAV</code> is written. According to an <a href="https://mrszeto.net/CIT/interrupts.htm">old but practical</a> guide to the interrupt table, a file write is triggered by calling interrupt <code>21h</code> with <code>40h</code> in registry <code>AH</code>. Dosbox can set a breakpoint on precisely this event:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-bpint-21-40.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-bpint-21-40.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>I change the detail level, close the preferences window and, bingo! Breakpoint triggered.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-config-save.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-config-save.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>The bytes to write are in <code>DS:DX</code>, so <code>1628:2FEA</code>. Let’s have a look:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>Yes, the 16-bit value at that address matches the detail level I set (<code>0x3d70/0xffff ~= 0.24</code>). I bet that this is a global variable and will stay there for the whole duration of the program, what I verify by starting a mission:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>The value is still there. Very nice.</p>

<h3 id="following-the-dataflow">Following the dataflow</h3>

<p>Now I have to see where this variable is used. Let’s go back to Ghidra, and look for the low two bytes.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>I am lucky, not too many occurences.</p>

<p>First location: <code>CS:4CDA</code>. Ghidra decompiles the code to</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    *(int *)0xb86 =
         (int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x10) + *(int *)0xa5a +
         (uint)((int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100) &lt; 0);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not super clear, but the meaning becomes evident when I set a breakpoint there (<code>BP CS:4CD8</code>): the line is executed only when I open the preferences box. So the “100” in the code must be part of the rescaling to a percentage.</p>

<p>Second location: <code>CS:680E</code>. The assembly is clearer than the C equivalent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>       1000:6809 a1 ea 91        MOV        AX,[0x91ea]
       1000:680c f7 26 ea 2f     MUL        word ptr [0x2fea]
       1000:6810 d1 e0           SHL        AX,0x1
       1000:6812 d1 d2           RCL        DX,0x1
       1000:6814 89 16 f2 91     MOV        word ptr [0x91f2],DX
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> get multiplied by the detail level, and then written at <code>DS:91F2</code>. No idea what <code>DS:91EA</code> is, though. I first think that this routine is calculating some per-polygon quantity, but it turns out that it is only run once per frame. Also, when I run some frames in mission 1 the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> switches between <code>0x0999</code> and <code>0x7FFF</code>. Let’s ignore the matter: we now know that at <code>DS:91F2</code> something gets written that is proportional to the detail level. Moreover, with Detail set at 100% this variable is often set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, almost the maximum.</p>

<p>I look for <code>f2 91</code> in Ghidra: it only yields two occurrences. One is the fragment we just analyzed, the other is in the middle of some bytes that Ghidra did not decompile automatically.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>Well, there is no other place to look, so I ask Ghidra to decompile this section. Some attempts later, a plausible assembly appears:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2-found.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2-found.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>I ensure that the decompilation is right by setting a breakpoint at the start of the fragment (<code>BP CS:76E8</code>), and for added safety I verify that the program counter (<code>EIP</code>) really points to the locations shown in the listing. This code gets executed many, many times per frame – have I finally reached the goal?</p>

<h3 id="ace-gets-glasses">Ace gets glasses</h3>

<p>Let’s try to understand the code: first it decrements <code>AX</code> and executes what follows only if it’s still positive. Not sure what this means but some live debugging shows that the condition is met quite often anyway. The following calculation is easier to understand: in the x86 architecture, calling <code>MUL</code> multiplies <code>AX</code> by the operand, leaving the  result in <code>DX:AX</code>. With maximum detail, we know that <code>DS:91F2</code> will be set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, so that the multiplication becomes almost a 16-bit left shift, setting <code>DX</code> to <code>(AX_old - 1)</code>. The lower the detail, the lower <code>DX</code> will be. Then the code executes the following branch only if <code>CX &lt;= DX + BX</code>, otherwise it gets skipped.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/stunt_island/">interview by Fabien Sanglard</a>, Stunt Island’s main programmer Adrian Stephens revealed an important aspect of the rendering engine: each 3D entity in the game is represented as a tree, and the game decides whether to render the (coarser) top nodes or the (finer) lower levels according to their distance from the observer. And we see here that a subroutine gets executed if <code>CX</code> is under a certain threshold, which gets bigger the bigger is the detail level. Let’s make the bold hypothesis that <code>CX</code> is the object distance, and <code>(DX + BX)</code> determines the distance threshold under which a higher-resolution model gets loaded.</p>

<p>I can test the hypothesis by overwriting the calculation with new code. Let’s start by setting the threshold to zero. Ghidra shows which bytes to insert:</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>I can do that in the live program:</p>

<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/dd-patch-live.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>The experiment works perfectly: all details disappear, Jackson City is reduced to flatland.</p>

<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/flatland.png" alt="drawing" width="640"/>
</a>
</center>

<p>But what I want is the contrary: changing the code so that the max resolution gets used for all objects. Let’s just set the threshold to the max:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 7f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x7FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This makes the engine totally unresponsive to the keyboard commands. I guess I was too greedy. My second try is more modest:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 4f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x4FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here we are: Stunt Island in the best detail you’ll ever get in a 320x200 window! Pity that the system is still just barely responsive: even with DOSBox’s CPU set to max performance, I cannot control my plane, and this is the best screenshot I am able to take before crashing.</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>But there is a better way to go sightseeing: the rendering routine is shared across flight sim, video player and set designer, and at least in the last mode I can take all the time I need to steer the camera. It takes some minutes to push the extremely sluggish control, but after a while I can frame Jackson City and surroundings, looking more gorgeous than ever!</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>Now that I explored the limits, it’s time to turn back the dial and find some compromise to make the game playable. The current patch is brutal, it just uses a fixed threshold ignoring the original value in <code>DX</code>. We know that <code>DX</code> is approximately <code>AX_old * (detail_level/100)</code>, maxing out at <code>AX_old - 1</code> if the detail level is 100%. What about putting a multiple of <code>AX</code> there? The space is limited, only 6 bytes, but a bitshift is compact enough. After some experiments, I settle on</p>

<div><div><pre><code>89 c2 c1   MOV DX,AX 
e2 03      SHL DX,0x3
90         NOP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which would be the equivalent of a 800% detail. I patch it in using the Dosbox command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 89 c2 c1 e2 03 90  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And everything goes as hoped: the quality is great and the game (after cranking up Dosbox’s CPU to the max) runs quite fluidly. Time to celebrate!</p>

<p>By the way, the fact that the three most significant bits of <code>DX</code> are discarded does not seem to lead to any noticeable glitch; I could add some code checking for overflow and saturating the value, but this would require more bytes than I am replacing. I might create the algorithm elsewhere and then <code>JMP</code> to it, but at the price of making the code slower and the patching process more difficult. The current version is simple and good enough for me, and after all one must leave some fun to future tinkerers.</p>

<h3 id="washing-the-dishes">Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>Before calling it a day, I still have some housework to do.</p>

<p>First, I need to edit the executables to avoid having to live-patch the code every time. Stunt Island provides not only the game executable (<code>STUNT.EXE</code>), but also a video encoder and a player (<code>MAKEONE</code> and <code>PLAYONE</code>), so that users can distribute and view their films without having to navigate through the game interface. To do a complete work, I want to patch all these files.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rendering code is the same in all three executables. However, the detail variable is stored at different addresses, so the assembly is not the same. The easiest way to find the relevant location is to search for the instructions that follow the <code>MUL</code> (so the <code>ADD / CMP / JG</code> sequence): they only refer to register values, so their encoding (<code>03 D3 3B CA 7F 1B</code>) is the same in all the files to patch.</p>

<p>Then, we move four bytes back, and we replace the “multiply by the detail level” segment (<code>F7 26 XX XX 03 D3</code>) with the “multiply by 8” code (<code>89 C2 C1 E2 03 90</code>).</p>

<p>The operation works well on all three executables. The patched <code>PLAYONE</code> can only play films created by the patched <code>MAKEONE</code>, but this seems reasonable. I guess that the films created by the vanilla <code>MAKEONE</code> are missing the high-polygon versions of the far objects.</p>

<p>Second, I must create a patching program that can upgrade the game without embedding Disney’s code. It would be nice to just implement it as simple search and replace for the six bytes that need to be overwriten, but unfortunately there is the problem of the LZ compression. I cannot bundle <code>unlzexe</code>, whose copyright status is unclear, so I end up recompressing the patched executable and diffing it with the unpatched version. The compression smears my 3-byte change all over the file creating a big diff, but this seems to me the least worst method. The patcher then applies the diff to the original game file, which must be provided by the user. This should put the patch on the safe side, copyright-wise.</p>

<p>Finally, I am informed that Disney released a patch (“#3”) containing some features like an alternative beginner-friendly flight model. It would be good if the 800% mod also worked on this version. Luckily the renderer was not changed so the same patching method can be used. The only surprise happens when uncompressing the new <code>.EXE</code>: it turns that the compression method was slightly changed (from LZ091 to LZ091E), and <code>unlzexe</code> does not recognize the format. However, the algorithm is the same, just the magic number used for the format identification has changed. Commenting out the magic number check in the source code of <code>unlzexe</code> solves the problem: I can uncompress the file and create a patch using the same process of the original game.</p>

<p>So, here the best Stunt Island one can have, with the enhanced rendering engine and the quality-of-life improvements of Disney’s patch:</p>
