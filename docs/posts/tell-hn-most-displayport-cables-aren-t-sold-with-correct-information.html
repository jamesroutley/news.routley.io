    <h1>Tell HN: Most DisplayPort cables aren&#39;t sold with correct information</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>In every DisplayPort (DP) cable I&#39;ve seen on Amazon and many other retailers, the main difference between cables is shown as the version of the DP specification that they support.<p>Unfortunately, that&#39;s not what makes a DP cable different from its peers. Every DP cable supports every version of the spec! 1.1 to 1.4, they all support the same DP spec. The difference is in the bandwidth they support: RBR, HBR, HBR2, HBR3, and UHBR 10 (and above). This then translates to the resolution and refresh rate that the cable can support.</p><p>The differences are listed here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Cable_bandwidth_and_certifications" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Cable_bandwidth_an...</a></p><pre><code>    RBR (Reduced Bit Rate)            6.48 Gbit/s
    HBR (High Bit Rate)               10.80 Gbit/s
    HBR2 (High Bit Rate 2)            21.60 Gbit/s
    HBR3 (High Bit Rate 3)            32.40 Gbit/s
    UHBR 10 (Ultra High Bit Rate 10)  40.00 Gbit/s
</code></pre>
The Wikipedia page also has tables that show what those bandwidths are capable of with regards to resolution+refresh rate: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Refresh_frequency_limits_for_common_resolutions" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Refresh_frequency_...</a><p>If you want 4K @ 60Hz you need a HBR2 cable. For 4K @ 144Hz you need UHBR 10.</p><p>Some retailers are better at telling you what bandwidth their cables support, such as Startech which does list the BR: <a href="https://www.startech.com/en-us/search?search_term=HBR3" rel="nofollow">https://www.startech.com/en-us/search?search_term=HBR3</a></p><p>Monoprice doesn&#39;t show any search results for HBR3: <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/search/index?keyword=HBR3&amp;didyoumean=HBR3&amp;TotalProducts=37" rel="nofollow">https://www.monoprice.com/search/index?keyword=HBR3&amp;didyoume...</a></p><p>Cable Matters does have some results, but doesn&#39;t show the bitrate in the product title: <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/search.aspx?PageSize=20&amp;PageNum=1&amp;SearchTerm=HBR3" rel="nofollow">https://www.cablematters.com/search.aspx?PageSize=20&amp;PageNum...</a></p><p>Amazon shows results for HBR3 but so many customer reviews tell of counterfeit cables and straight up lying in descriptions.</p><p>If you know of any better retailers that sell UHBR 10 or above cables, please let me know in the comments! I hope this information is useful to someone and saves you some time and pain trying different cables.</p></div></div>
