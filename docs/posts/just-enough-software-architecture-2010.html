    <h1>Just Enough Software Architecture (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This is the book I wish I had when I started developing software. At
the time, there were books on languages and books on object-oriented
programming, but few books on design. Knowing the features of the C++
language does not mean you can design a good object-oriented system,
nor does knowing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) imply you can
design a good system architecture.</p>

<p>This book is different from other books about software
architecture. Here is what sets it apart:</p>

<p><strong>It teaches risk-driven architecting.</strong> There is no need for
meticulous designs when risks are small, nor any excuse for sloppy
designs when risks threaten your success. Many high-profile Agile
software proponents suggest that some up-front design can be helpful,
and this book describes a way to do just enough architecture. It
avoids the “one size fits all” process tar pit with advice on how to
tune your architecture and design effort based on the risks you
face. The rigor of most techniques can be adjusted, from
quick-and-dirty to meticulous.</p>

<p><strong>It democratizes architecture.</strong> You may have software architects at
your organization — indeed, you may be one of them. Every architect I
have met wishes that all developers understood architecture. They
complain that developers do not understand why constraints exist and
how seemingly small changes can affect a system’s properties. This
book seeks to make architecture relevant to all software developers,
not just architects.</p>

<p><strong>It cultivates declarative knowledge.</strong> There is a difference between
being able to hit a tennis ball and knowing why you are able to hit
it, what psychologists refer to as procedural knowledge and
declarative knowledge. If you are already an expert at designing and
building systems then you will have employed many of the techniques
found here.  This book will make you more aware of what you have been
doing and provide names for the concepts. That declarative knowledge
will improve your ability to mentor novice developers.</p>

<p><strong>It emphasizes the engineering.</strong> People who design and build
software systems have to do many things, including dealing with
schedules, resource commitments, and stakeholder needs. Many books on
software architecture already cover software development processes and
organizational structures. This book, in contrast, focuses on the
technical parts of software development and deals with what the
developers do to ensure the system works — its engineering. It shows
you how to build models and analyze architectures so that you can make
principled design tradeoffs. It describes the techniques software
designers use to reason about medium to large sized problems and
points out where you can learn specialized techniques in more detail.</p>

<p><strong>It provides practical advice.</strong> This book offers a practical
treatment of architecture. Software architecture is a kind of software
design, but design decisions influence the architecture and vice
versa. What the best developers do is drill into obstacles in detail,
understand them, then pop up to relate the nature of those obstacles
to the architecture as a whole. The approach in this book embraces
this drill-down/pop-up behavior by describing models that have various
levels of abstraction, from architecture to data structure design.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-book">About this book</h2>

<p>This book focuses on software architecture as it relates to the
construction of software, and describes the techniques used to ensure
that software satisfies its engineering demands. This book is largely
process agnostic because the engineering techniques themselves are
largely process agnostic. You will not find advice on management
activities like the political responsibilities of architects, when to
hold specific kinds of meetings, or how to gather requirements from
stakeholders.</p>

<p>This book is divided into two parts. This first part introduces
software architecture and the risk-driven approach. The second
part helps you build up a mental conceptual model of software
architecture and describes in detail the abstractions like
components and connectors. What follows is short summaries of each
part.</p>

<h3 id="part-i-risk-driven-software-architecture">Part I: Risk-driven software architecture</h3>

<p>A definition of software architecture is difficult to pin down
precisely, but several things about it are quite clear. Software
developers, like engineers in other specialties, use abstraction and
models to solve large and complex problems. Software architecture
acts as the skeleton of a system, influences quality attributes, is
orthogonal to functionality, and uses constraints to influence a
system’s properties. Architecture is most important when the
solution space is small, the failure risks are high, or you face
difficult quality attribute demands. You can choose from
architecture-indifferent design, architecture-focused design, or
even architecture hoisting.</p>

<p>Risks can be used to guide you regarding which design and
architecture techniques you should use and regarding how much design
and architecture you should do. At its core, the risk-driven model
is simple: (1) identify and prioritize risks, (2) select and apply a
set of techniques, and (3) evaluate risk reduction.</p>

<p>To reveal the risk-driven model in practice, Chapter 4 provides an
example of applying the risk-driven model to a Home Media Player
system. The developers on that system have the challenges of team
communication, integration of COTS components, and ensuring metadata
consistency.</p>

<p>The first part of the book concludes with advice on using models and
software architecture, including: use models to solve problems, add
constraints judiciously, focus on risks, and distribute architecture
skills throughout your team.</p>

<h3 id="part-ii-architecture-modeling">Part II: Architecture modeling</h3>

<p>The second part of the book helps you build a mental conceptual model
of software architecture. It starts with the canonical model
structure: the domain model, the design model, and the code model.
The domain model corresponds to things in the real world, the design
model is the design of the software you are building, and the code
model corresponds to your source code. You can build additional models
that show selected details, called views, and these views can be
grouped into viewtypes.</p>

<p>Building encapsulation boundaries is a crucial skill in software
architecture. Users of a component or module can often ignore how it
works internally, freeing their minds to solve other hard problems.
And the builders of an encapsulated component or module have the
freedom to change the implementation without perturbing its users.
Builders will only have that freedom if the encapsulation is
effective, so you will learn techniques for ensuring that it is.</p>

<p>A great number of architectural abstractions and modeling techniques
have been built up over the years. This book consolidates software
architecture techniques found in a variety of other sources,
integrating techniques emphasizing quality attributes as well as
techniques emphasizing functionality. It also discusses pragmatic ways
of building effective models and debugging them.</p>

<p>The second part of the book concludes with advice on how to use the
models effectively. Any book that covered the advantages but not the
pitfalls of a technology should not be trusted, so it also covers
problems that you are likely to encounter. By the end of the second
part, you should have built up a rich conceptual model of abstractions
and relationships that will help you see software systems the way a
coach sees a game.</p>
