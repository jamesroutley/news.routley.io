The bank <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-bank-chief-risk-officer/?ref=the-lever">reportedly</a> did not have a chief risk officer in the months leading up to the collapse, while more than <a href="https://twitter.com/business/status/1634211584657571843?s=20&amp;ref=the-lever">90 percent of its deposits</a> were not insured.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://www.levernews.com/content/images/2022/06/About-Page-Logo-1.png" loading="lazy"/></p><p><h4>Help Us Do More Stories Like This</h4></p><p>We&#39;re building a reader-supported investigative news outlet that holds accountable the people and corporations manipulating the levers of power.

Despite <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1f3f2e7c-ca31-4976-976e-cd48b0a788c9/dodd-frank-roll-back-bill--a-windfall-for-big-banks.pdf?ref=the-lever">warnings</a> from some senators, Becker’s lobbying effort was ultimately successful.</p><p>Touting “SVB’s deep understanding of the markets it serves, our strong risk management practices,” Becker argued that his bank would soon reach $50 billion in assets, which under the law would trigger “enhanced prudential standards,” including more stringent regulations, stress tests, and capital requirements for his and other similarly sized banks.</p><p>Becker insisted that $250 billion was a more appropriate threshold.</p><p>“Without such changes, SVB likely will need to divert significant resources from providing financing to job-creating companies in the innovation economy to complying with enhanced prudential standards and other requirements,” wrote Becker, who <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-sale-ceo-greg-becker-f5089a4d?ref=the-lever">reportedly</a> sold $3.6 million of his own stock two weeks ago, in the lead-up to the bank’s collapse. “Given the low risk profile of our activities and business model, such a result would stifle our ability to provide credit to our clients without any meaningful corresponding reduction in risk.”</p><p>Two months later, SVB <a href="https://www.svb.com/news/company-news/svb-financial-group-appoints-mary-john-miller-formerly-of-the-u.s.-treasury-department-to-its-board-of-directors?ref=the-lever">added</a> former Obama Treasury Department official Mary Miller to its board, noting she had previously helped oversee “financial regulatory reforms.”</p><p>Around that time, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/40f1aec7-9dbf-46da-a20e-2ce2f5af80cc/print/?ref=the-lever">federal</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/1a82c199-21a1-447c-98ca-78decd6cc97e/print/?ref=the-lever">disclosure</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e5be3075-8267-42a0-8aa2-aa1725d4e7d4/print/?ref=the-lever">records</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/276fe661-9582-4f96-995d-151d133db5e2/print/?ref=the-lever">show</a> the bank was lobbying lawmakers on “financial regulatory reform” and the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2015 — a bill that was the precursor to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text?ref=the-lever">legislation</a> ultimately signed by President Donald Trump that increased the regulatory threshold for stronger stress tests to $250 billion.</p><p>Trump signed the bill despite a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2018/3/dodd-frank-roll-back-bill-a-windfall-for-big-banks?ref=the-lever">report</a> from Democrats on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee warning that under the new law, SVB and other banks of its size “would no longer be subject to nearly any enhanced regulations.”</p><p>The bill was supported in the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00054.htm?ref=the-lever">Senate</a> by 50 Republicans and 17 Democrats, including Virginia Sen. Mark Warner (D), for whom Becker held a fundraiser at his Menlo Park, California, home in 2016, according to an <a href="http://politicalpartytime.org/party/41385/?ref=the-lever">invite</a> obtained by The Sunlight Foundation and OpenSecrets. The bank’s political action committee also donated a total of $10,000 to Warner’s campaigns in the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/silicon-valley-bank/C00333658/candidate-recipients/2016?ref=the-lever">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/silicon-valley-bank/C00333658/candidate-recipients/2018?ref=the-lever">2018</a> election cycles.</p><p>In 2019, when the Federal Reserve proposed regulations implementing the deregulatory law, financial watchdogs warned that its regulations on Category IV institutions — as <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45711?ref=the-lever">SVB was later classified</a> due to its size and other risk factors — were far too weak.</p><p>“The proposal to significantly weaken enhanced prudential standards for Category IV firms could be disastrous,” Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for stricter financial regulations, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/August/20190806/R-1658/R-1658_062119_134209_447374886406_1.pdf?ref=the-lever">wrote</a> in a comment on the Federal Reserve’s proposal. “Moreover, these are not small or insignificant firms. Recall that the smallest among this class of banks is over twice the size of the $50 billion dollar banks that automatically required enhanced prudential regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act as originally enacted.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/01/2019-23662/prudential-standards-for-large-bank-holding-companies-savings-and-loan-holding-companies-and-foreign?ref=the-lever">final rule</a> guaranteed that Category IV institutions are “not required to conduct and publicly report the results of a company-run stress test” and “reduces the required minimum frequency of liquidity stress tests and granularity of certain liquidity risk-management requirements,” according to Federal Reserve officials at the time.</p><p>In 2021, SVB passed the threshold of $100 billion under management, triggering some additional scrutiny as a Category IV bank but remaining exempt from the more frequent and detailed analyses that regulators perform to determine whether banks above $250 billion of assets have sufficient capital to withstand a crisis.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://www.levernews.com/content/images/2022/08/Citizens-Guide-Mockup-1600x900-2-1.png" loading="lazy"/></p><p><h4>Learn All Our Investigative Tricks</h4></p><p>Score a copy of our<em><strong> Citizens’ Guide to Following the Money and Holding the Powerful Accountable</strong></em>, free with a paid subscription.
