    <h1>Show HN: Chawan TUI web browser</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Version 0.2.0 of the Chawan TUI browser has been released.
</p><p>
A tarball of the source tree is available
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-src.tar.xz">here</a>.  Please refer to the README
file for compilation instructions.
</p><p>
A static binary distribution for
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-linux-amd64.tar.xz">amd64 Linux</a> also exists.
To install it, extract the archive somewhere and run <code>make install</code>
as root.  (To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code>.)
</p><p>
The same distribution is also available as a <a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-amd64.deb">.deb
package</a>.

<p>
The current list of mandatory runtime dependencies is:
</p><ul>
<li>libssh2.
</li><li>libbrotli (more precisely, libbrotlicommon and libbrotlidec).
</li><li>OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  For OpenSSL, you will want 3.0 or later.
For LibreSSL, the version in OpenBSD 7.7 has been tested.
</li></ul>
<p>
Previous development versions had other dependencies which no
longer apply, and can be dropped.  In particular, zlib, libseccomp,
termcap/ncurses and libcurl are no longer used.
</p><p>
If you run into an issue while packaging Chawan, please contact me
before trying to patch over it.  Chances are we can solve it upstream.

<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but I finally feel OK putting a
version on this.  It has all features I wanted from an MVP, and no known
fatal bugs.
</p><p>
The v0.2 branch in git will only receive bugfixes.  Further work on new
features will continue on the master branch.
</p><p>
For the next release, I hope to improve upon the layout module&#39;s
performance &amp; correctness, and to make the UI somewhat more user
friendly.  Stay tuned :)
