    <h1>Daniel Stenberg and the home of curl in Stockholm, Sweden</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="hi-tell-us-about-who-you-are-and-what-you-do">Hi! Tell us about who you are and what you do</h2><p>My name is <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/">Daniel Stenberg</a>. I am a Swedish software developer. Mostly known
for being the founder and lead developer of the <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> project. I work full-time
on Open Source from my home office.</p><h2 id="what-is-your-hardware-setup">What is your hardware setup?</h2><p>My hardware and office setup is focused on my curl work. I develop software as
my primary thing. I run two 27-inch screens attached to my desktop PC as my
primary workhorse. I have some additional computers around for when my
desktop is not enough. I run <strong>Debian Linux</strong> on my machines when I get to choose,
but I have some other alternatives for when those are needed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackerstations.com/setups/daniel_stenberg/images/desk-left-angle.jpg" alt=""/></p><p>I have been working from home exclusively for over nine years now. I do Open
Source development and the occasional live stream and webinar from this
place. I spend all my work days here and often a few additional spare time hours
later. I never game.</p><p>My home office is on the upper floor of my house in a southern suburb of
Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>The desk is a 300cm wide, 60cm deep homemade creation, designed to fit
within the doors in the wall immediately next to the table on both sides. My
original idea was to leave space to allow more than one person to work at it.</p><h3 id="office-overview">Office overview</h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackerstations.com/setups/daniel_stenberg/images/office-explained.jpg" alt=""/></p><p><strong>A</strong> - Here are boxes from recent purchases and gifts that arrived. Not really
for my work benefit, but good to keep it around for a while before recycling in
case I need to return stuff or similar.</p><p><strong>B</strong> - This is the new development machine that I was preparing to switch to and
use as my main driver “any day now.” It is a PC running a recent Intel CPU and
<strong>Debian Unstable Linux</strong>, with a fast SSD and fast memory. Meant to compile
fast. I have since switched it with the machine in E.</p><p><strong>C</strong> - An old loudspeaker from a long time ago for when I want sound. I often
just use headphones (to save my family from my sounds and let the noise
canceling save me from my family’s sounds) so this is not used terribly
much. My wireless headphones (<strong>Bose Quiet Comfort 35</strong>) are not in this photo.</p><p><strong>D</strong> - cable mess. I counted 29 used power plugs a while ago. I have a plan to do
something to hide this better, but that has not materialized yet, obviously.</p><p><strong>E</strong> - My old trusted old development machine. Runs Debian Unstable, with two 27
inch 4K screens. Nowadays, switched with the (A) machine.</p><p><strong>F</strong> - backpacks. One for short stay-over trips and one I use for day trips when I
do talks etc. They usually should not just be out on the floor like this, but
when I took this photo, I had not done my job right.</p><p><strong>G</strong> - my work laptop. It’s a 14-inch <strong>Lenovo 540s</strong> running Debian Unstable. I
never work a lot from a laptop but when I do this is my machine. It is light
enough to be easy to bring with me wherever I like. Not very powerful.</p><p><strong>H</strong> - my headset. A light Sennheiser set with a cable for meetings, talks,
webinars etc.</p><p><strong>I</strong> - A USB hub to provide a set of extra USB ports for when the ones in the PC
are not enough or not close enough.</p><p><strong>J</strong> - <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/08/20/the-right-keyboard-layout/">Mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Red switches</a>. I average at some 8
million key presses per year.</p><p><strong>K</strong> - USB charger. A micro USB, USB-C and my Fitbit cables are on the
table. Next to that is my ethernet to USB “dongle,” as one of my laptops
doesn’t have an RJ45.</p><p><strong>L</strong> - Two extra computers: this is a Lenovo 13 on top that runs Windows, which I
use for video conferencing and the like when those glitch, or work
suboptimally on Linux. Underneath is one of my Mac Minis I use for curl
development when I need to work on macOS specific issues. This is the M1
version. I also have an x86 version, but that is not in this picture.</p><p><strong>M</strong> - Extra temp screen and keyboard. Right now, this set is attached to computer
(B) but I also use it for the ones in (L) when necessary. Depending on work.</p><p><strong>N</strong> - Led light, for when I need extra bright lighting, perhaps when doing video
conferences or streaming. (A gift from GitHub)</p><p><strong>O</strong> - Kid drawings with curl theme. To keep my spirits up! The left one is from
my daughter from many years back, and the right one is a more recent one from a
friend’s daughter.</p><p><strong>P</strong> - I have three of these spotlights to provide pleasant light during the dark
hours. The two ceiling windows do provide adequate and rather nice light for
the bright hours, but I live in Sweden and we have extended periods of darkness
during winter.</p><p><strong>Q</strong> - GitHub coasters. I need to put my coffee cup on something!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackerstations.com/setups/daniel_stenberg/images/extras-explained.jpg" alt=""/></p><p><strong>A</strong> - art work. A gift from curl’s 20th birthday. It features 20 * 365 small
lines for everyday curl had existed, but with a twitch: they also form the
big letter ‘c’ in a kind of subtle way.</p><p><strong>B</strong> - a wooden robot that can be modified to stand or sit in different
positions.</p><p><strong>C</strong> - a GitHub star logo led thing. Powered by USB and controlled with the
little remote that is on the table next to it. It can be set to different
colors and numerous different light patterns. From mildly disturbing to highly
annoying.</p><p><strong>D</strong> - A wooden 3d puzzle thing in its solved shape. A gift from GitHub.</p><p><strong>E</strong> - My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polhem_Prize">Polhem Prize</a> award. A gold medal. But in this picture there are two old
chocolate fake Polhem Prize awards lying on top of, hiding the real medal.</p><p><strong>F</strong> - A “korpen” medal I received a few years ago when my team won a floorball
tournament. Gold-colored plastic.</p><p><strong>G</strong> - <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/08/11/a-github-star/">My GitHub star award</a></p><h2 id="and-what-are-the-favorite-items-in-your-workspace">And what are the favorite items in your workspace?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackerstations.com/setups/daniel_stenberg/images/github_star.jpg" alt=""/></p><p>My gold medal award from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polhem_Prize">Polhem Prize</a>. I keep it on my desk to remind me
and keep me happy. I’m a pragmatic and my things are generally in place and in
use for their practical purposes, not so much for their aesthetics. My
workspace items are there to help me be productive in what I do during my time
at the desk.</p><h2 id="what-is-your-software-setup">What is your software setup?</h2><p>I run Debian Linux on most of my computers. On Linux, I prefer using
<strong>KDE/Plasma</strong> on the desktop. On the desktop, I run <strong>Emacs</strong> for coding and
development, I use Konsole as terminal and I use make, C compilers and gdb a
lot. Old style development I guess you would call it. I use <strong>Firefox</strong> for
browsing.</p><h2 id="what-are-your-favorite-programming-or-scripting-languages">What are your favorite programming or scripting languages?</h2><p>Most of my programming is done with <strong>C</strong> (not C++ if I have a say). The main
projects I maintain are written in C. But when I need to hack something quick
together or perhaps parse a lot of text, I like doing such things in <strong>Perl</strong>. Or
when even simpler: in shell scripts.</p><h2 id="is-there-anything-you-are-missing-in-your-setup">Is there anything you are missing in your setup?</h2><p>I have thought about a HDMI/keyboard switch to allow me more easily switch
between my different spare computers into the left “backup screen” to make it
a lesser hassle to alter between those machines, but I haven’t yet decided nor
found a product that would be suitable.</p><p>I need to do something about the cable mess underneath the desk. Either hide
them in a container of some sorts or attach a “cable basket/holder” to the
underside of the table to make them less visible. And to make it easier to
vacuum under the table.</p><h2 id="what-book-comes-to-your-mind-that-you-would-like-others-to-read">What book comes to your mind that you would like others to read?</h2><p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/04/30/uncurled/">“Uncurled” by Daniel Stenberg</a> :-)</p></div></div>
