<p>Ever since George Floyd I&#39;ve been thinking about two fictional policemen at opposite moral extremes: Jim Gordon from the Batman comics, and Dim in The Clockwork Orange.</p>
<p>Jim is fearless and resolute in his fight for justice, and absolutely incorruptible.</p>
<p>Dim is a stupid, sadistic psychopath who switches from gang member to police officer so he can commit the same crimes but with the additional power the uniform gives him.</p>
<p>I used to assume the vast majority of cops were somewhere on the Jim side of the spectrum, but that world view took a hit after George Floyd. I became a lot more aware that any given cop could be, if not a full-blown Dim, somewhere on that side of the spectrum. Still, I never went so far as to paint all cops with that brush.</p>
<p>What we&#39;re seeing now, if we didn&#39;t know it already, is that ICE is ALL Dims. ALL of them.</p>
