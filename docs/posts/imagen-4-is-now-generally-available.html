                        A retro science fiction movie poster with an airbrushed art style. The poster features a detailed spaceship, flying towards the right through a vibrant nebula in a star-filled deep space. The ship&#39;s two engines emit bright blue glowing trails. The title at the top of the poster reads &#34;SUPER GALACTICA: THE LAST NEBULA&#34; in a bold, beveled, metallic chrome font with a drop shadow. Below it, the subtitle &#34;STARFALLS REVENGE&#34; is written in a simpler, clean white font. The entire image has a vintage, weathered look, with a distressed, off-white border. At the very bottom, in a small font, is the text: &#34;This poster was created by AI as was this disclaimer :)&#34;.
