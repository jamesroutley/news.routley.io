    <h1>238th Carnival of Mathematics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Wow! It&#39;s the 238th Carnival of Mathematics organized by <a href="https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Aperiodical</a>. This has been a fun month with lots of submissions and lots of beautiful math art. To start let&#39;s jump into the number 238 itself.</p><h2 id="238-is"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238_(number)?ref=fractalkitty.com">238</a> is:</h2><ul><li> 2 × 7 × 17.</li><li>the sum of the first 13 primes. </li><li>a &#34;triprime&#34; (the product of three primes).</li><li>I asked and was not disappointed by the <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@fractalkitty/114271455058841657?ref=fractalkitty.com">Mathstodon</a> community:<ul><li>Uranium-238 is the most common isotope of uranium (From Rich Holmes)</li><li>2^3 = 8 (from DR Ms KAT and Maya Zimmerman)</li><li>Year of the six emperors? CE, Rome, three unique Gordians as well! (from @Mycotropic)</li><li>For those of you that have a birth minute of 02:38 - happy birth minute - I will post this at 02:38 at some time in the world.

(Thank you Charlotte Aten!)</li><li>&#34;It&#39;s the number ways to label a connected graph with 5 nodes that stays connected if you remove a node. No, that wasn&#39;t a favorite fun fact before just now; I just did an OEIS/Wikipedia dive.&#34; (from Alexandre Muñiz)</li></ul></li><li>The complete graph of K238 has 28,203 edges (see the feature image).</li><li>untouchable (see <a href="https://www.numberphile.com/videos/untouchable-numbers?ref=fractalkitty.com">numberphile</a>) (and extremely slow codepen to play with below):</li></ul>

<p>In addition to scraping OEIS and the internet for this number, I put a 238-celled Voronoi diagram on a sphere to confirm that the most boring of numbers can be fun:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/04/238-1.GIF" alt="" loading="lazy" width="442" height="332"/></figure><h2 id="and-now-the-carnival-for-march-2025">And now the Carnival for March 2025:</h2><ul><li>The month kicked off with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ayliean.bsky.social?ref=fractalkitty.com">Ayliean</a>&#39;s #<a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/MathArtMarch?ref=fractalkitty.com">MathArtMarch</a> and it was inspiring!
