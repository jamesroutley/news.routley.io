Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard&#39;s podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bought access to location data harvested from tens of millions of phones in the United States to perform analysis of compliance with curfews, track patterns of people visiting K-12 schools, and specifically monitor the effectiveness of policy in the Navajo Nation, according to CDC documents obtained by Motherboard. The documents also show that although the CDC used COVID-19 as a reason to buy access to the data more quickly, it intended to use it for more general CDC purposes.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Location data is information on a device’s location sourced from the phone, which can then show where a person lives, works, and where they went. The sort of data the CDC bought was aggregated—meaning it was designed to follow trends that emerge from the movements of groups of people—but researchers have repeatedly raised concerns with how location data can be deanonymized and used to track specific people.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The documents reveal the expansive plan the CDC had last year to use location data from a highly controversial data broker. SafeGraph, the company the CDC paid $420,000 for access to one year of data to, includes Peter Thiel and the former head of Saudi intelligence among its investors. Google <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db4ad/google-bans-safegraph-former-saudi-intelligence"><span>banned the company from the Play Store</span></a> in June. </p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Do you work in the location data industry?

Multiple media organizations, including the <em>New York Times</em>, used location data provided by companies in the industry to show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-us-reopen.html" target="_blank"><span>where people were traveling to once lockdowns started to lift</span></a>, or highlight that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-stay-home-rich-poor.html" target="_blank"><span>poorer communities were unable to shelter in place as much as richer ones</span></a>.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic as a whole has been a flashpoint in a broader culture war, with conservatives and anti-vaccine groups protesting against government mask and vaccine mandates. They&#39;ve also expressed a specific paranoia that vaccine passports would be used as a tracking or surveillance tool, framing vaccine refusal as a civil liberties issue. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s Children&#39;s Health Defense, one of the more influential and monied anti-vaccine groups in the U.S., has promoted fears that digital vaccine certificates could be used to surveil citizens. QAnon promoter Dustin Nemos wrote on Telegram in December that vaccine passports are &#34;a Trojan horse being used to create a completely new type of controlled and surveilled society in which the freedom we enjoy today will be a distant memory.&#34; </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Against that inflamed backdrop, the use of cell phone location data for such a wide variety of tracking measures, even if effective for becoming better informed on the pandemic’s spread or for informing policy, is likely to be controversial. It&#39;s also likely to give anti-vaccine groups a real-world data point on which to pin their darkest warnings.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651520756653-cdc-uses.png?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651520756653-cdc-uses.png?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651520756653-cdc-uses.png?resize=20:*"/><img alt="cdc-uses.png"/></picture></div></div><p>A screenshot of the use cases proposed by the CDC.

On the developed product side SafeGraph has several different products. “Places” concerns points of interest (POIs) such as where particular stores or buildings are located. “Patterns” is based on mobile phone location data that can show for how long people visit a location, and “Where they came from” and “Where else they go,” <a href="https://www.safegraph.com/products/patterns" target="_blank"><span>according to SafeGraph’s website</span></a>. More recently SafeGraph has started offering aggregated transaction data, showing how much consumers typically spend at specific locations, under the “Spend” product. SafeGraph sells its products to a wide range of industries, such as real estate, insurance, and advertising. These products include aggregated data on movements and spends, rather than the location of specific devices. Motherboard previously bought a set of SafeGraph location data for $200. The data was aggregated, meaning it was not supposed to pinpoint the movements of specific devices and hence people, but at the time, Edwards said &#34;In my opinion the SafeGraph data is way beyond any safe thresholds [around anonymity].&#34; Edwards pointed to a search result in SafeGraph’s data portal that displayed data related to a specific doctor’s office, showing how finely tuned the company’s data can be.

The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6935a2.htm?s_cid=mm6935a2_x#contribAff" target="_blank"><span>published a study in September 2020</span></a> which looked at whether people around the country were following stay-at-home orders, which appeared to use SafeGraph data. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><a href="https://www.safegraph.com/blog/safegraph-provides-cdc-fed-and-1000-organizations-with-data-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank"><span>SafeGraph wrote in a blog post in April 2020</span></a> that “To play our part in the fight against the COVID-19 health crisis—and its devastating impact on the global economy—we decided to expand our program further, making our foot traffic data free for non-profit organizations and government agencies at the local, state, and federal level.” Multiple location data companies touted their data as a potential mitigation to the pandemic during its peak in the United States, and provided data to government and media organizations.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A year later, the CDC purchased access to the data because SafeGraph no longer wanted to provide it for free, according to the documents. The Data Use Agreement for the in-kind provided data was set to expire on March 31, 2021, the documents add. The data was still important to access as the U.S. opened up, the CDC argued in the documents.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“CDC has interest in continued access to this mobility data as the country opens back up.

The EFF shared those documents with Motherboard. They showed that the CDC also asked to speed up the purchase of Cubeiq’s data because of COVID-19, and intended to use it for non-COVID-19 purposes. The documents also listed the same potential use-cases for Cubeiq’s data as in the SafeGraph documents.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Google <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db4ad/google-bans-safegraph-former-saudi-intelligence"><span>banned SafeGraph from its Google Play Store in June</span></a>.
