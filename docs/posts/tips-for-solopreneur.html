    <h1>Ask HN: Tips for Solopreneur?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Yo HN! I have been working on some design tools in my spare time to solve problems I&#39;ve faced over and over, and I&#39;m thinking about monetizing them.</p><p>I&#39;ve been to some conferences recently and talked to a lot of people who have these problems as well, and they&#39;re keen to try it out. I have collected some emails, been communicating with them a bit and even got beers with one of them recently!</p><p>Here&#39;s my list of concerns:</p><p>1. It is just me - is that a red flag? Some people have asked me about my team and I told them it was just me. I got the feeling that it may have turned them off because the conversation kind of ended right there. To be fair, after that I did say that it is just me right now BUTTTTTTTT why that is okay due to my experience and work history. However, yes it is my first time doing a business.</p><p>2. How do I set appropriate milestones for me to reach? Do I think about reaching 100 customers before reaching 5 recurring customers for example?</p><p>3. I&#39;m in a small town in PNW. Does that matter if this will be an online thing anyway? Why or when do people move to big cities like Seattle/SF/NYC/Austin etc.</p><p>4. What are some ways to do marketing? Should I even think about that before I have a few customers who are using my product consistently?</p><p>5. I&#39;ve been inspired by the Startup School videos. Honestly though I&#39;m not sure about fundraising and all these things, it seems very intimidating to me. What&#39;s the difference between those things and starting a company and slowly building it up?</p></div></div></div>
