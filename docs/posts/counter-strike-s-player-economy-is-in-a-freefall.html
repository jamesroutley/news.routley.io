<div><p><em>Counter-Strike</em> has long been known for two things: tight tactical FPS gameplay and a thriving player marketplace effectively valued at literal billions of dollars. Now, thanks to a recent update from Valve, the latter is in a downward spiral, having lost 25% of its value — or $1.75 billion — overnight.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p>First, some context. <em>Counter-Strike</em> is a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. As with most other F2P games, it generates revenue from selling cosmetics. They arrive in lootbox-like Cases, which are opened by Keys purchased with real-world currency. They can also be obtained through trading with other players and purchasing from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=730" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Community Market</a>. Beyond Steam, unofficial third-party marketplaces for CS cosmetics have also popped up as channels for buying and selling items.</p>    <p>Because items are obtained at random through opening Cases, rarer items fetch the highest value on the open marketplaces. Items of lower-rarity tiers can also be traded in at volume for an item of a higher tier via trade up contracts. Previously, Knives and Gloves could not be obtained through trade up contracts, exponentially increasing their value as highly sought-after items. Prior to the most recent update, some Knives, like a <a href="https://csfloat.com/item/844203115195532537" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Doppler Ruby Butterfly Knife</a>, could fetch around $20,000 on third-party storefronts like CSFloat.</p>    <p>Following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Valve&#39;s Oct. 22 update to <em>Counter-Strike</em></a>, the second-highest-tier, Covert (Red), can now be traded up and turned into Knives and Gloves. Essentially, this means that a previously extremely rare and highly sought-after cosmetic is going to be much more obtainable for those who increasingly want it, reducing the value of Knives and Gloves on the open marketplace.</p>    <p>And this is where the market descends into a freefall. Now, that Butterfly Knife mentioned above? It&#39;s going for around $12,000, as people are essentially dumping their stock, with 15 sold over the past 16 hours at the time of this writing.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/market-for-counter-strike-items-falls-1-75-billion-overnight" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reported the market for <em>Counter-Strike</em> cosmetic items dropped 25% overnight from Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. It&#39;s lost about $1.84 billion in value, according to <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981381483764834476" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pricempire</a>, which tracks and analyses the market for CS items. &#34;This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items,&#34; Pricempire marketing manager Ethan MacDonald told Bloomberg.</p>    <p>As sellers attempt to recoup their investments, similar fire sales like the one happening at CSFloat are occurring at other sites. One such site, <a href="https://skinport.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Skin Port</a>, even put us in a waiting room to access it; traffic was overwhelming its servers.</p>    <p>Just like how NFT or cryptocurrency values can drastically shift, <em>Counter-Strike</em> item traders are seeing their stock rapidly change in value, and not for the best. While some items of lower-rarity tiers have gone up in value, and Reds might see a bump now that they can be traded up into Knives and Gloves, that can&#39;t make up for the sudden drop at the top of the cosmetics market.</p>    <p>We&#39;ll have to wait and see if the market levels out or if it continues to crash. Plenty of players and CS traders must be eagerly awaiting more news: As of this writing, <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981390097204302098" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pricempire&#39;s servers had crashed</a>.</p>    </div></section></div>
