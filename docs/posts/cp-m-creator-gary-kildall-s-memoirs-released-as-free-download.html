    <h1>CP/M creator Gary Kildall&#39;s memoirs released as free download</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="CP/M Creator Gary Kildall’s Memoirs Released as Free Download"><div><p>The year before his death in 1994, Gary Kildall—inventor of the early microcomputer operating system CP/M—wrote a draft of a memoir, “Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry.” He distributed copies to family and friends, but died before realizing his plans to release it as a book.</p><p>This week, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/computer-history">Computer History</a> Museum in Mountain View, with the permission of Kildall’s children, released the <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/in-his-own-words-gary-kildall/">first portion of that memoir</a>. You can download it <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/in-his-own-words-gary-kildall/">here</a>.</p><p>Wrote Scott and Kristin Kildall in an introductory letter: “In this excerpt, you will read how Gary and Dorothy started from modest means as a young married couple, paved a new path for start-up culture, and embraced their idea of success to become leaders in the industry. Our father embodied a definition of success that we can all learn from: one that puts inventions, ideas, and a love of life before profits as the paramount goal.”</p><p>Later chapters, they indicated, did “not reflect his true self,” but rather his struggles with alcoholism, and will remain unpublished.</p></div></div></div>
