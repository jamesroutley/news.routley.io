    <h1>Twitodon: Finding Twitter Peers on Mastodon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>When you login to Twitodon with both your Twitter and Mastodon accounts it will memorise the association between your two accounts. Twitodon will then match any Twitter users you follow that have previously loged into Twitodon thereby providing their own association information. Unfortunately, there is no way of discovering, or guessing, Twitter users on Mastodon without them logging into Twitodon previously. Because of this, it is recommended to check back again regularly to keep up to date as more users use Twitodon.</p>
            <p id="twitterLoginParagraph">Step 1. <a id="twitterLoginLink">Login With Twitter</a>. </p>
            <p id="mastodonLoginParagraph">Step 2. <span id="mastodonLoginText">Login With Mastodon</span>. </p>
            <p id="mastodonFormParagraph">Enter your Mastodon host&#39;s web address:</p>
            
            <p>Looking for Mastodon users progress, scanned <span id="scanProgressCount">0</span> of <span id="twitterFollowingCount">0</span> users you follow on Twitter. Discovered <span id="matchedMastodonUsers">0</span> Twitter users on Mastodon who have previously linked their Twitter and Mastodon accounts by logging into Twitodon.</p>
            <p>Step 3. Download matching users in CSV format to import into your Mastodon account. </p>

            <p>Important information about how your data is handled is available in the <a href="https://twitodon.com/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            <p>To revoke access to Twitter, use the button that appears when you are successfully logged into Twitodon with your Twitter account. Your login session has a time limit, though, so the buttons will not appear until you refresh your session by logging in again. When visible, clicking the Revoke button will completely dissacotiate Twitodon from your Twitter account. (Unfortunately Mastodon doesn&#39;t provide Twitodon the ability to revoke access, but you can still logout. To completely revoke access you need to navigate to your Mastodon instance, login and go to your settings/preferences page, select &#34;account&#34; followed by &#34;authorized apps&#34;, find the Twitodon app and click the revoke button on the entry.)</p>
