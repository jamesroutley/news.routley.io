<p>Arm has <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2023/05/new-arm-total-compute-solutions-enable-mobile-future-built-on-arm" title="Arm">revealed Total Compute Solution 2023</a> (TCS23), its next-generation chip designs for mobile devices including phones of all types. Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Google all use Arm&#39;s designs and technology as a foundation for their own processor chips that power essentially all of today&#39;s phones. The new Arm <b>Cortex-X4</b> is a high-performance &#34;prime&#34; core for flagship phones. Compared to last year&#39;s X3, it offers 15% better performance using 40% less power. Arm also has new &#34;big&#34; and &#34;little&#34; CPU core designs for <i>all</i> classes of phones: the <b>Cortex-A720</b> and <b>Cortex-A520</b> (respectively). They both offer a 40% performance boost and 20–22% better power efficiency compared to last year&#39;s designs. On the graphics side, the new <b>Immortalis-G720</b> GPU offers a 14% improvement in total system efficiency and introduces Deferred Vertex Shading (DVS) technology. In addition to the new cores, TCS23 includes designs for other chip components, including the interconnect that links the cores and memory, which boasts 25% better latency. Arm is also working more closely with TSMC, the world&#39;s leading chip manufacturer. Through this partnership, TCS23 is optimized for TSMC&#39;s new, cutting-edge N3E manufacturing process. Arm revealed that it has already produced a physical chip with TCS23 on TSMC N3E. This example chip exists only to proves the technology. It is not a full SoC (it doesn&#39;t have a modem, for one) and Arm has no intention of competing with its partners like Qualcomm and MediaTek. The chip is intended to help those partners bring chips based on TCS23 and N3E to market faster. </p>
