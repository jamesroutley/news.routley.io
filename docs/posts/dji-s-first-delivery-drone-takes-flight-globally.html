    <h1>DJI&#39;s First Delivery Drone Takes Flight Globally</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><strong>January 10, 2024 – </strong>DJI, the world’s leader in civil drones and creative camera technology, today introduces DJI FlyCart 30 (FC30) to the global market. This delivery drone overcomes traditional transport challenges with its large payload capacity, long operation range, high reliability, and intelligent features. Now delivery, such as mountain transportation, offshore transportation, or emergency rescue transportation, can be performed with more efficiency and flexibility. </span></p>







<p><span><strong>Increased operational safety </strong></span></p>

<p><span>FC30’s built-in redundancies and intelligent safety features help ensure safety throughout operation. Before takeoff, it evaluates flight route viability based on environmental conditions, and ensures pre-takeoff safety through audio-visual prompts and by delaying propeller launch. During flight, the dual active phased array radar and binocular vision systems enable all-weather multidirectional intelligent obstacle sensing, day or night.<span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""></a></span> The built-in ADS-B signal receiver gives timely warning of nearby crewed aircraft. In emergencies, an integrated parachute can deploy at low attitudes and land the drone stably, protecting both people and property.<span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""></a></span></span></p>



<p><span><strong>Flexible configurations for different transportation scenarios</strong></span></p>

<p><span>FC30 folds down for easy transport in a standard-sized vehicle. </span></p>

<p><span>In Cargo mode, payloads are placed in a 70-liter case<span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""></a></span> that features weight and center-of-gravity sensors to improve balance and safety. </span></p>

<p><span>In Winch mode, payloads are carried by a winch crane for delivery to areas without convenient landing sites. The winch system includes a 20m cable that can manually or automatically retract at 0.8 m/s and can carry 40 kg. AR Projection assists accurate placement of goods by indicating the projected landing point. During flight, FC30 can intelligently adjust its flight attitude, automatically reducing cargo swing. </span></p>



<p><span>DJI DeliveryHub systematizes aerial delivery with operation planning, status monitoring, centralized team resource management, and data collection and analysis. It also supports live viewing through the drone&#39;s high resolution FPV gimbal camera. </span></p>

<p><span>DJI Pilot 2 powers manual flight, and displays real-time flight status, cargo status, and more for safe and efficient operation. In extreme weather or other abnormalities, DJI Pilot 2 alerts operators of risks and supports alternate landing site management.</span></p>

<p><span>DJI DeliveryHub and FC30 support integration with external cloud platforms or payloads, enabling adaptation to a wide range of industry-specific applications.</span></p>



<p><span>Since 2006, DJI has led the world with civilian drone innovations that have empowered individuals to take flight for the first time, visionaries to turn their imagination into reality, and professionals to transform their work entirely. Today, DJI serves to build a better world by continuously promoting human advancement. With a solution-oriented mindset and genuine curiosity, DJI has expanded its ambitions into areas such as agriculture, public safety, surveying and mapping, and infrastructure inspection. In every application, DJI products deliver experiences that add value to lives around the world in more profound ways than ever before.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""></a> Measured with DJI FlyCart 30 (operating on dual batteries) flying with a full payload in a windless environment at sea level. Data is for reference only.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""></a> Measured at sea level. Please pay attention to the difference between single and dual battery states. The maximum loaded weight must not exceed the recommended value. Avoid placing sharp objects when using cargo cases. Avoid goods hitting the landing gear when using the winch system. Otherwise, flight safety may be compromised. </span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title=""></a> Measured with DJI FlyCart 30 (operating on dual batteries) flying at a constant 15 m/s in a windless environment at sea level with a full payload until displayed battery level reached 0%. Data is for reference only. Please pay attention to the Return to Home (RTH) prompts in the DJI Pilot 2 app during your flights.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title=""></a> See footnote 2 </span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title=""></a> Measured with FCC compliance in an unobstructed environment with low interference. Data is for reference only. During your flight, please pay attention to reminders in the app.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title=""></a> During takeoff and landing, DJI FlyCart 30 can resist a maximum wind speed of 12 m/s.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title=""></a> Effective sensing range and obstacle sensing capabilities may vary depending on ambient light, rain, fog, and the material, position, shape, and other properties of the obstacles. Downward sensing is mainly used to assist in measuring ground clearance. Sensing in other directions is used for obstacle sensing.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title=""></a> When DJI FlyCart 30 operates on dual batteries and flies in a 25° C windless environment at sea level with a full payload, the lowest height for opening the parachute is 60 m and the terminal descent speed is 6 m/s.</span></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title=""></a> The dimensions of the Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) case interior are 573×416×306 mm (L×W×H).</p>
