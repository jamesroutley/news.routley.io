    <h1>Safari on iOS can overlap multiple full-screen videos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h3>Jun 16, 2022</h3></header><section><p>I recently discovered (by mistake) a potentially irritating behavior of Safari on iOS: full-screen videos <strong>can</strong> overlap each other:</p>

<p>Nope, the video above it’s not broken. That’s exactly what you see when multiple full-screen videos overlap.</p>
<p>I assume this is a bug, right? As a user, I can’t think of cases where I’d want to open more than a single full-screen video.</p>
<p>The most annoying part of this behavior is that, if done on purpose, websites can easily open dozens of videos simultaneously. <strong>Thanks to slow iOS animations, good luck closing 30+ full-screen videos. It’s easier and faster just to force close Safari… and, if you’re lucky enough, you might not even have to close it since sometimes this behavior makes Safari crash.</strong></p>
<p>All it takes for a website to show multiple videos in full screen is to use JavaScript to invoke the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>HTMLMediaElement.play()</code> method</a> on multiple video elements after a user interaction.</p>
<p>I know, I know, after all this talking, you wanna try this magical behavior yourself. So <a href="https://mmazzarolo.com/safari-mobile-annoying-full-screen-videos/">here’s a tiny web page I created to play with it</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, the page shows a button that runs the following code when pressed:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>let</span> videoElementStrings <span>=</span> <span><span>`</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  videoElementStrings <span>+=</span> <span><span>`</span><span>&lt;video src=&#34;https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;video-elements-root&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>innerHTML <span>=</span> videoElementStrings<span>;</span>



<span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  document<span>.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;video&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>videoElement</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      videoElement<span>.</span><span>play</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I haven’t investigated in depth why this is happening, nor how other mobile browsers and OS behave. Still, if I had to guess, I’d say Safari is not checking if there’s another resource that already obtained the full-screen control (given that the full-screen request is an asynchronous operation).</p></section></article></div>
