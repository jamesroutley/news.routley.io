      <p>What is Teclis?</p>

      <div><p>
        Teclis is a search engine for finding interesting, unique results on
        &#39;clean&#39; websites.</p></div>
    </div>

     <div>
      <p>Usage</p>

      <div><p>
        Type a query to search. Use the examples above for a few ideas. </p></div>
    </div>
     <div>
      <p>Fun Challenge</p>

      <p>
        Find a query that has only one result in Teclis! Then read
        that page.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>Motivation</p>

      <div><p>
        Finding genuine content on the web became incredibly hard, as if the
        ad-monetized search engines
        are tuned to steer the user towards the sites that
        feed into the same ad food chain. As a result, the same &#34;top&#34; sites dominate the search results, happily patting each other
        on the back.
        The rest of the web has more or less gone incognito. </p></div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Technical Implementation</p>

      <div><p>
        The
        crawler is hybrid, using async python requests and <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a> with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>. The way
        detection works is we count the
        number of uBO blocked requests on the page, and if too many (threshold is set
        to 5), we kick it out, leaving only &#34;clean&#34; pages
        in the index.</p></div>
