            <div><p data-block-key="31ldj">Google Quantum AI was founded in 2012 and our mission today remains the same — build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems. We’re making steady progress on our roadmap, including with our latest <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">Willow chip</a>.</p><p data-block-key="2ilbs">Today, we’re excited to announce that the Atlantic Quantum team is joining Google. Atlantic Quantum is an MIT-founded startup that develops highly integrated quantum computing hardware. Its modular chip stack, which combines qubits and superconducting control electronics within the cold stage, will help Google Quantum AI more effectively scale our superconducting qubit hardware, and accelerate progress on our roadmap to a large error-corrected quantum computer and real-world applications.</p><p data-block-key="6ra7i">We’re delighted for Atlantic Quantum to join us as Google continues to invest in the future of quantum computing and deliver its benefits to society.
