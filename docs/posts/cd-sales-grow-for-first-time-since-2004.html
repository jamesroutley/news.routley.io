By comparison, 2021 vinyl sales increased to $1 billion annually, up from $643.9 million.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>It&#39;s especially good news for local record stores, like Grimey&#39;s on East Trinity Lane. Co-owner Doyle Davis tells Axios that vinyl is still king, but CD sales have &#34;held their own.&#34; </p><ul><li>Davis has noticed strong CD sales for new albums, especially when there is a delay in the vinyl release, and pointed to the new album by Adia Victoria last year as an example.</li><li>&#34;I think really this is about young people who are finding they like hard copies of music in the digital age,&#34; Davis says.</li></ul><p><strong>Be smart: </strong>The CD was the music industry&#39;s leading format in the 1990s, peaking at $13.2 billion in annual sales in 2000.</p><ul><li>You know what happened next. Napster and illegal streaming sites gave way to paid streaming, which now accounts for $8.6 billion in annual revenue.</li><li>In addition to record stores, artists have appreciated the rise in vinyl — and now CD sales — because it gives them another avenue to sell their music.</li></ul><p><strong>What they&#39;re saying: </strong>&#34;I just think the whole thing is great,&#34; Davis says. &#34;It speaks to the health and the overall comeback of physical media in general.&#34;</p></div></div>
