									<p>This is what happened: Extraterrestrials visited our Earth many millennia ago. They behaved similarly to how current ethnologists behave today. They studied a few languages, visited different tribes, gave suggestions, and disappeared sometime—however, with the promise to return in the distant future.</p><p>Our Stone Age ancestors could not grasp what happened back then. They wrongfully believed that the extraterrestrials were gods. The supposed events then wandered into our mythology and became the founders of many religions.</p><p>I have been conducting research for 70 years in order to substantiate these ideas. My work is now present in 49 volumes. Many films and TV series were first made possible through my body of thought. I am not an esoteric, I do not rely on statements from fellow humans who claim to have real or supposed contact with UFO crews today. Whatever I say must make sense in itself—it must be conclusive. That is why, in particular, my new books are rich with illustrations. And of course, they contain sources that can be verified.</p><p>Why do I do my work? We live in a world of religious and, unfortunately, often scientific humbugs. Humanity is encouraged to believe in a jealous god from the Old Testament—who was never a god. To believe in angels, who were also not really that, and “heavenly vehicles” that never existed.</p>								</div>
