                <p>The indefinite closure of 3M Co’s semiconductor coolant plant in Belgium could have major effects on the global semiconductor industry, in which Taiwan has a leading role, analysts said on Sunday.
</p><p>The 3M plant in Zwijndrecht closed on March 8 due to tightened environmental regulations, a report on Friday in BusinessKorea magazine said.
</p><p>Coolant prices have been rising since early this year due to high demand, and the Zwijndrecht plant reportedly accounted for 80 percent of global semiconductor coolant output, analysts said.

                </div><p>3M on March 18 sent an official notice to its clients including Samsung Electronics Co, SK Hynix Inc, Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), the magazine said.
</p><p>Citing industry sources, the magazine said that 3M’s customers could manage for one to three months with their current coolant inventories, which are essential for semiconductor etching.

    <p>Unless the situation is resolved, the global semiconductor manufacturing sector is likely to be significantly affected, the report said.
</p><p>BusinessKorea said the Belgian government’s regulations were related to the emission of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known for their nonstick and water-resistant properties and which have long been used in products from fabric protectors to firefighting foam.
</p><p>PFAS, a controversial class of chemicals that 3M pioneered decades ago, has been linked to significant health risks, including certain types of cancer, according to news reports.
</p><p>Separately, Spain plans to invest 11 billion euros (US$12.1 billion) to develop microchips and semiconductors as part of a series of strategic projects to overhaul its economy, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.
</p><p>“We want our country to be at the vanguard of industrial and technology progress,” Sanchez said yesterday in Madrid, without giving more details.
</p><p>Sanchez said the project would soon be approved by his Cabinet.
</p><p>Policymakers across Europe are racing to enact plans to invest in chips and cut reliance on imported technology. The EU aims to become a key semiconductor manufacturer with a goal of producing 20 percent of the world’s chip supply by 2030. The commission also freed up public funding for the production of chips considered “first of a kind” in Europe with its 45 billion euro Chips Act last month.
</p><p>Germany is looking to grant Intel 5 billion euros in public funds to help finance a 17 billion euro semiconductor plant, people familiar with the matter said last month.
