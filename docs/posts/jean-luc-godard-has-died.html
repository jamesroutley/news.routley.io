Like all exceptional creative figures, he is taking with him something that has been torn from the collective consciousness. First, there is the loss of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, the electroshocks of images and sounds that his work rekindles in the memory of his contemporaries around the world and with a sphere of influence that very few French filmmakers ever reached.</p>             <p>Then there is the last roll of the New Wave, since Godard so personified it. A symbolic moment finally relegating what was dubbed &#34;cinematographic modernity,&#34; alive while Godard still was, into a chapter in the great book of cinema.</p>               <p>This creative rupture of modernity born with Italian neo-realism from the disaster of the Second World War is what Godard embodied more passionately, violently and painfully than many others, including his former New Wave companions. So much so that he immediately became the movement&#39;s standard-bearer all over the world, an example followed and admired by all those who thought cinema was created to change the world.</p>             <p>An artist with a romantic temperament, an inventor of beauty like no other, a genius of provocation and a furious self-destructing personality, Godard delivered as many blows as he received. A filmmaker at turns adored and hated, Godard demands to be placed as high on the cross of modern cinema&#39;s tortured gods as Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman. They both preceded him into the grave on the same day, July 30, 2007.<strong> </strong>These three film icons engraved the modern odyssey of love&#39;s disarray and the torture of couples in Celluloid&#39;s inflammable marble.</p>             <h2>A dazzling surprise</h2>             <p>It would be an exaggeration to claim that it only took one film for Godard to rise to this level. Yet <em>A bout de souffle</em> (<em>Breathless</em>), his first feature film made in 1960, was an unrivaled lightning strike, including the rest of its creator&#39;s career. A dazzling surprise, a stroke of genius, an instant public and critical success, an aesthetic shock and influence for many future filmmakers, <em>A bout de souffle</em> remains part of the short list of films that have changed the history of cinema. Even so, its plot is startling in its banality: a young thug named Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) falls in love with Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American student living in Paris. The boy dreams of the impossible; the girl prefers to deal with the possible. She betrays him; he is shot by the police. While dying, he describes what happened as &#34;dégueulasse&#34; (disgusting), a word that his fiancée neither wants nor can understand.</p>                     <figure> <img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; viewBox=&#39;0 0 664 443&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/2702/2214/1328/0/45/0/10aa77e_217692749-le-monde-ne-cro-sur-jean-luc-godard-300pixels.jpg 1328w, https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/2702/2214/664/0/75/0/10aa77e_217692749-le-monde-ne-cro-sur-jean-luc-godard-300pixels.jpg 664w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 664px, 100vw" alt="Jean-Luc Godard, on the set of the film &#39;Breathless&#39; (1960), with his chief operator Raoul Coutard, Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo, rue Campagne-Première, in Paris." width="664" height="443"/>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Jean-Luc Godard, on the set of the film &#39;Breathless&#39; (1960), with his chief operator Raoul Coutard, Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo, rue Campagne-Première, in Paris. <span aria-hidden="true">RAYMOND CAUCHETIER</span> </figcaption>  </figure>              <p>What really matters in this film lies elsewhere: In the film&#39;s emotional editing, in the sense of rediscovered freedom by bodies, language and spirits, in the proud allure of a cobbled-together and inspired cinema that in a single day seemed to have become a hundred years younger. It is also in this distillation of cinephilic material that extracts an equally singular essence from the mixed influences of Nicholas Ray, Roberto Rossellini, Jean Rouch and Ingmar Bergman. More than François Truffaut&#39;s<em> Les Quatre Cents Coups</em> (<em>The</em> <em>400 Blows</em>, 1959) which preceded it, <em>A bout de souffle </em>was the New Wave&#39;s inaugural film because it invented the form that best corresponded to the movement&#39;s innovative spirit and because it celebrated the coming of age of a generation discovering itself and imposing its values on French society.</p>               <p>The recognition of this film was a moment of precarious grace in Godard&#39;s life and career, which was marked by the all-consuming permanent revolution. This began very early on within his family circle. This scion of the Franco-Swiss Protestant upper middle class lived through the horrors of the Second World War in the cocoon of the privilege afforded by his birth and his young age. The post-war period, during which he discovered his grandfather&#39;s collaborationist affinities, served as a repellent. His increasing misbehavior led him to fall out with his family, who forbade him to attend his mother&#39;s funeral in 1954.</p>             <p>In the meantime, the young outlaw had found a second family under the auspices of the ogre Henri Langlois, director of the Cinémathèque française, and the critic André Bazin and his <em>Cahiers du Cinéma </em>comrades. They were preparing their invasion on the cinematographic scene by proclaiming their love of American genre cinema, their auteur policy and their detestation of a French corporation they considered prodigiously sclerotic. The New Wave itself, a movement of rebellious sons searching for freely chosen fathers, became the pursuit of an aesthetic genealogy. Yet this second family also fizzled out in the mid-1960s.</p>             <h2>Permanent revolution</h2>             <p>The price to pay for the New Wave&#39;s undeniable artistic and ideological victory in the long run was its failure in terms of box office receipts and the group&#39;s splintering into the many individualities composing it. Compared to the reformism of Truffaut and Chabrol, and the strategic withdrawal of Rohmer and Rivette, Godard became the one who kept the sacred fire of permanent revolution alive at the risk of a permanent rupture. This was a dangerous approach, combining the explosion of a genius mind and the temptation of a scorched earth policy, the dream of collective solidarity and a sinking into solitude. This was to be Godard&#39;s destiny: furious victories and bitter disappointments, magnificent utopias and doubtful stumbles. His was the story of a man who never stopped wanting to recreate a family while ensuring that no one could ever fulfill this desire.</p>             <blockquote> <p>Godard became the one who maintained the sacred fire of permanent revolution, at the risk of permanent rupture.</p> </blockquote>            <p>His work devoted to this ambiguous quest traces a long and winding path –more than one hundred films in a career spanning some sixty years and marked by several major cinematic periods. The first one sees an insolent young creator full of talent establishing himself in a few years as a great artist despite censorship for his film on Algeria (<em>Le Petit Soldat</em>, &#34;The Little Soldier,&#34; 1963) and the bitter failure of his attempt at fierce Brechtism (<em>Les Carabiniers,</em> &#34;The Carabineers,&#34; 1963). A string of successive titles reminded us of his ironic and graceful genius, so typical of Godard, who melted in the crucible of cinema lightness and melancholy, puns and revolt, the ambition of thought and the lyrical trembling of emotions, quotations and inventions, dazibao and song, love of genres and the poetic freedom to betray them, the chronicle of his loves and the acute intuition of the social issues of his time. All this and so much more is on display in <em>Une Femme est une femme </em>(<em>A Woman is a Woman, </em>1961), <em>Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux</em> (&#34;My Life to Live,&#34; 1962), <em>Bande à Part</em> (1964, and <em>Masculin féminin</em> (&#34;Masculine feminine,&#34; 1966).</p>                     <figure> <img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; viewBox=&#39;0 0 664 443&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/5079/3392/1328/0/45/0/a9491d4_466918281-gamma-5537343.jpg 1328w, https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/5079/3392/664/0/75/0/a9491d4_466918281-gamma-5537343.jpg 664w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 664px, 100vw" alt="Jean-Luc Godard with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot during the filming of &#39;Contempt&#39; in Italy in 1963." width="664" height="443"/>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Jean-Luc Godard with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot during the filming of &#39;Contempt&#39; in Italy in 1963. <span aria-hidden="true">JEAN-LOUIS SWINERS/GAMMA-RAPHO</span> </figcaption>  </figure>              <p><em>Le Mépris </em>(<em>Contempt</em>) (1963), a haughty and torrid meditation on cinema with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, and then<em> Pierrot le fou </em>(&#34;Pierrot the madman,&#34;1965), a Rimbaudian road movie about a couple on the run with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina – the woman Godard was separating from – were the touchstones of his artistic elevation, sanctioned by Aragon in the magazine <em>Les Lettres françaises: </em>&#34;What is art?

This galvanized Jean-Luc Godard, who contributed to the collective film <em>Loin de Vietnam</em> (&#34;Far from Vietnam,&#34;1967), supported the workers&#39; strike at the Rhodiacéta in Besançon, seized cinema&#39;s means of production under the name &#34;Medvedkine groups&#34; (1967), marched in support of Henri Langlois who was threatened with dismissal (February 1968), hung from a curtain of the Palais to interrupt the Cannes Festival in solidarity with the student revolt (May 1968).</p>               <p>He was also the anonymous director of &#34;cinétracts&#34; inspired by the Situationist International during the protests of May 1968, and then of a provisional assessment of the movement in <em>Un film comme les autres </em>(&#34;A Film Like Any Other,&#34;<em> </em>June 1968), shot in Flins – the last and bloody bastion of the revolt where high school student Gilles Tautin was killed – where he recorded the words of the Renault factory workers.</p>             <p>The failure of the May 68 movement radicalized his approach, prompting the director to refuse to make cinema according to the industry&#39;s rules. He still managed to get movies made on the strength of his name alone and went so far as to sabotage the &#34;Jean-Luc Godard&#34; name by creating the Dziga-Vertov group (a pioneer of Soviet cinema), a cinematographic-revolutionary phalanstery created with Jean-Pierre Gorin, a young journalist from <em>Le Monde</em> who introduced him to Maoist circles and who, for five years, formed with him a symbiotic couple. This led to the release of several hot-button films in which dogmatism competed with grace, such as the Marxist-Leninist western <em>Le vent d&#39;est </em>(&#34;Wind from the East,&#34; 1970). Disappearing into the folds of the Dziga-Vertov group, Godard became absent (a longstanding temptation) while becoming more international. <em>Pravda</em> (1969) was shot on the Czechoslovak front, Luttes en italie (&#34;Struggles in Italy&#34;) in the Italian peninsula (1970) and <em>Jusqu&#39;à la Victoire</em> (&#34;Until Victory,&#34; unfinished) in Jordan alongside Fatah.</p>             <blockquote> <p>Disappearing into the Dziga-Vertov group, Godard is absent (a longstanding temptation) while becoming more international.</p> </blockquote>            <p>Godard had, not without courage, burned his own boats, but these films, usually refused by the television networks that also produced them, were barely seen. He had a falling out with many of his friends; Wiazemski left him, he attempted several times to kill himself and his reputation in the profession faded. In one of his last and rare interviews (<em>Les Cahiers du Cinéma</em>, October 2019), the filmmaker summed up his situation with the hindsight of his 88 years of age and a touch of Swiss placidity: &#34;I am in favor of disobedience, but I remain in cinema. At one point, I thought I could be involved in world affairs. When Anne-Marie (Miéville) yells at me, she tells me: &#39;Go out into the world and make your revolution, but then no coffee today!&#39;&#34;</p>             <h2>&#39;Politically&#39; making movies</h2>             <p>Before reaching this level of wisdom, the failure of the revolutionary form of cinema he dreamed about, combined with a serious motorcycle accident, led the filmmaker to go underground. Solicited by the young and glittering producer Jean-Pierre Rassam, who suggested the idea, he returned to the center stage with the humorously titled<em> Tout va bien </em>(&#34;All is Well,&#34; 1972), in which two stars, Yves Montand and Jane Fonda, are kidnapped by striking workers. The film signed, in a sense, the death certificate of leftism in France.</p>               <p>More specifically, it deconstructed this moment of the Godardian dialectic, marked by the mourning of the Dziga-Vertov utopia (his separation from Gorin was brutal) but without giving up on &#34;politically&#34; making movies, to repeat one of his mantras. His attention to the conditions of production and distribution, his deep technical knowledge and his great care to measure the ideological repercussions in his own way of making cinema proved it. Godard never regained the status he once had with the public, however. Besides, it is not clear that it was something he actually cared about, even if he often did complain about it.</p>             <p>The<strong> </strong>filmmaker did not give up his taste for experimentation. During this third period of his career, he frequently took part in criticizing the media (in the monthly magazine of the proletarian left <em>J&#39;accuse</em>), created a real audiovisual laboratory (Sonimage), was a pioneer in video&#39;s plastic and critical possibilities (<em>Ici et ailleurs</em>, &#34;Here and Elsewhere,&#34; 1976) and tried to confront television on its own ground by proposing two monuments of alternative information (<em>Six Fois Deux</em>, &#34;Six Times Two&#34;, in 1976  and <em>France/tour/détour/deux enfants</em>, &#34;France/tour/detour/two children&#34; in 1977-1978).</p>             <h2>Dialectics of the old and the new</h2>             <p>Yet it was not until the late 1970s that he reentered<strong> </strong>cinema&#39;s traditional system with a series of fictions more disconcerting than ever. This comeback, not by chance inaugurated by a film entitled <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie) (Every Man for Himself)</em>, was afforded to him by film producer Marin Karmitz and Alain Sarde, who became his regular producer. A new Godardian vein was discovered in this film whose characters are dazedly trying to escape from an impasse, a deadly circle. It is permeated with beauty, breathing in large breaths, tending towards an unprecedented harmony, although deceptive if we conclude from it that Godard has shelved his own restlessness. Now in his fifties, Godard&#39;s epiphany was accompanied by a deliberate slowing down, a hunger for air and light and an incessant variation on the ideas of resurrection and duality. It was as if he had rediscovered the taste for filming the world as it is, without betraying his desire to strain towards the world as it should be.</p>                     <figure> <img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; viewBox=&#39;0 0 664 443&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/1103/990/1328/0/45/0/73520c7_178432754-2021-03-17-a-14-33-04.jpg 1328w, https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/1103/990/664/0/75/0/73520c7_178432754-2021-03-17-a-14-33-04.jpg 664w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 664px, 100vw" alt="Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Louis Malle and Roman Polanski at the Cannes Film Festival, 1968." width="664" height="443"/>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Louis Malle and Roman Polanski at the Cannes Film Festival, 1968. <span aria-hidden="true">TOURTE/STILLS/GAMMA</span> </figcaption>  </figure>              <p>This kind of religion of images as a place of mystery and freedom, whose genealogy lies in the history of Western art, succeeded the dogmatic temptation of a word that was now disqualified, much like the Dziga-Vertov period wanted to do away with the famous &#34;auteur policy.&#34; Each Godardian period was thus both a self-criticism of the previous one and a rebirth. Were his dialectics of the old and the new – his role in the New Wave, his interest in history and each of his films taken separately – not always his beautiful and perhaps his only concern?</p>             <blockquote> <p>&#39;I try to risk the death of what I know how to do as the only possibility of survival&#39;</p> </blockquote>            <p>Godard provided a summary, perfect as often, of himself in an interview with the <em>Nouvel Observateur</em> in 1980: &#34;I try to risk the death of what I know how to do as the only possibility of survival.&#34; From <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie)</em>(1980) to <em>Nouvelle Vague (New Wave, </em>1990), <em>Prénom Carmen</em> (<em>First Name: Carmen, </em>1983)<strong> </strong>and <em>Je vous salue, Marie </em>(<em>Hail Mary, </em>1985), this would be his creed, one based on Christian theology, particularly his belief in the redemptive role of images in the economy of salvation. Yet this celebration was truly pantheistic, extending to the splendor of the world, the vibrant bodies of young women (Maruschka Detmers as Carmen, Myriem Roussel as Mary) and art as a whole. The films of this period abound with many joyfully irreverent references to music, painting and sculpture.</p>             <h2>Increasingly alone</h2>             <p>From Isabelle Huppert to Nathalie Baye, from Jacques Dutronc to Alain Delon, it also marked the grand return of movie stars in his films, unwillingly put at the service of Godard&#39;s scathing contempt for the materialism and cynicism of the 1980s. Godard&#39;s real star, the one who accompanied him from now on in his life, his thought and his art, was Anne-Marie Miéville, a photographer he met in 1971 and who became the privileged partner of his mature years. She was his third &#34;Anne,&#34; after the fiery Karina and the youthful Wiazemsky.</p>               <p>In his fourth and final act, as death – a faithful companion in his films – crept closer, the impression Godard gave was of a man increasingly alone. His work was now part of a genre, the cinematographic essay, to which he lent prestige along with Chris Marker. It is evident that nothing in Godardian work, not even fiction, is foreign to this genre. The art of editing and the analysis of the relationship between images were always at the forefront. The great Godardian figure was now a meditative and melancholic look back on things, from his Swiss retreat in Rolle on Lake Geneva. In other words, from the very location of his own childhood.</p>             <p>He kept looking back. On himself with <em>JLG/JLG</em> (1994), a deeply moving diary in which this offspring of a Protestant lineage went as far as he could to reveal himself. And on his art and its relationship with history with the monumental video essay <em>Histoire(s) du Cinéma</em> (Story/Stories of Cinema)(1989-1999). A colossal project which aired in eight episodes on Canal+ in 1998, this video montage chronicling the history of cinema bristled with flashes of brilliance and was steeped in mad erudition as it presented cinema, a great hypnotic power watching over the ghosts of history, as the ultimate chapter in the history of Western art.</p>             <p>The miracle he performed was that these general and interdependent <em>Histoire(s),</em> as well as all the diverse materials (films, documentaries, fictions, videography, drawings, engravings, paintings), infused, through the supreme art of reference, a creation as personal and sensitive<strong> </strong>as this one.<strong> </strong>It also conveyed the idea, developed by the critic Serge Daney, of the death of cinema itself, or at least of the idea of cinema as conceived by a certain cinephilia.</p>                     <figure> <img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39; viewBox=&#39;0 0 664 443&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/4961/3264/1328/0/45/0/c77caad_253680981-gettyimages-1264450647.jpg 1328w, https://img.lemde.fr/2021/03/17/0/0/4961/3264/664/0/75/0/c77caad_253680981-gettyimages-1264450647.jpg 664w" data-sizes="(min-width: 768px) 664px, 100vw" alt="Jean-Luc Godard, camera in hand, in the student demonstration in Paris, May 13, 1968." width="664" height="443"/>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Jean-Luc Godard, camera in hand, in the student demonstration in Paris, May 13, 1968. <span aria-hidden="true">GAMMA-KEYSTONE VIA GETTY IMAGES</span> </figcaption>  </figure>              <p>This was what haunted Godard in this project, adding to the sepulchral consciousness of his own disappearance and, no doubt, of a filial transmission that never occurred. Some letters, found in his correspondence, discreetly revealed Godard&#39;s suffering on this point, his acute and heartbreaking awareness of never having been able to be anything other than a son of cinema.</p>               <p>Even his fictional movies now presented an increasingly ghostly framework to his mortified consciousness of the world, from <em>Allemagne 90 neuf zéro</em> (<em>Germany Year 90 Nine Zero, </em>1991), an archaeological project on German reunification, to <em>Notre Musique </em>(&#34;Our Music,&#34; 2004), in which he interwove dark meditation on the ex-Yugoslavian and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. This last issue and all that touches more widely on Judaism had thus far been, among many impeccable intuitions, the blind spot of Godardian thought, to characterize it with the utmost respect.</p>             <p>His ultimate film finally was released in 2010, or at least one self-proclaimed as such and presented at the Cannes Film Festival while its author was absent: <em>Film socialisme </em>(<em>Film Socialism)</em>. It was in truth a farewell to both cinema and socialism, two utopias ridiculed by history.</p>             <p>Amid the global economic crisis, it was also the incrimination of a system where, more than ever, injustice vied with cynicism. The film represented it with a luxury cruise obliviously sailing towards catastrophe.</p>             <h2>Contradictions</h2>             <p>Godard wanted to leave on this note, but he was neither the first nor the last to postpone his departure. He kept filming. He shot at the same time <em>Adieu au Langage</em> (<em>Farewell to Language, </em>2014), a 3D movie about a dog that speaks in place of its masters, a couple that has lost all notion of a common language.</p>               <p>Back in official competition, where he had never won anything, at the age of 83, the filmmaker used the film to express a strident whine, a fluorescent cry, a chaotic recounting of the return to childhood and humanity&#39;s illegible destiny, shot between his house and the shores of Lake Geneva. The film earned him, jointly with the young Canadian Xavier Dolan, the Jury Prize at Cannes, a symbolic award he obviously did not come to pick up. An eight-minute video letter addressed to Gilles Jacob and Thierry Frémaux, president and delegate of the Festival, beautifully justified this absence. In it, Godard said, from his native land and in a voice more broken than ever before: &#34;Yes, from now on, I will go where I have stayed.&#34;</p>             <p>This did not prevent him from being back in the official competition four years later with <em>Le livre d&#39;image</em> (The Image Book, 2018) , a montage film closed in on itself where he returned to the themes of reflection and Godardian digression (war, the Middle East, art) with a maelstrom of images borrowed from cinema, document and painting.</p>             <p>More than ever, the film opens itself up only to those who consent to surrender to it. More than ever, Godard&#39;s voice and words resembled those of God on Mount Sinai. Unlocatable, inappropriable, unassimilable, addressed to the last Moses of the dark rooms capable of transmitting his word. Once again, people waited for Godard in Cannes and once again, the expectations of the cinephile crowd were disappointed. It was an idiosyncratic way of managing his presence through his absence. The film, in keeping with the director&#39;s wishes, was not even commercially exploited, but it did benefit from occasional screenings in good company, like at the Théâtre des Amandiers in Nanterre in October 1999.</p>             <blockquote> <p>Once again, people waited for Godard in Cannes and once again, the expectations of the cinephile crowd were disappointed.</p> </blockquote>            <p>This ultimate contradiction crowned a thought process that was continually fed by contradiction. Between the fervent defender of a popular and minor cinema and the artist who rallied to the elitism of high culture, between the right-wing dandy and the boiling leftist, between the herald of auteur cinema and the filmmaker who condemned bourgeois auteurism, between the man who considered himself a Jew of cinema and the one who created collages between Golda Meir and Adolf Hitler, to which of these Godards should we devote ourselves? Perhaps to the one in the photograph opening <em>JLG/JLG:</em> Godard as a child resembling Kafka, so sad, so proud and so alone, as described by the adult he had become: &#34;I was already in mourning for myself, my own and only companion.&#34;</p>           <div> <div> <svg width="29" height="27" viewBox="0 0 29 26" fill="none" style="box-sizing: inherit;"> <path d="M24 1H5a3.51 3.51 0 00-3.5 3.5v12A3.51 3.51 0 005 20h2.5v5l5.857-4.884a.5.5 0 01.321-.116H24a3.51 3.51 0 003.5-3.5v-12A3.51 3.51 0 0024 1v0z" stroke="#383F4E" stroke-width="1.4" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> <p>We are interested in your experience using the site.</p> </div> </div>        <p>During the burning last embers of his life, the filmmaker dreamed of himself as a man without ancestry or descendants: the son of his creations, identified with the total art of cinema. Failing to save the world by using it, Godard said that he would simultaneously film both its testament and his own. Is this to say that cinema has died with Jean-Luc Godard? Of course not, but a certain history of cinema may have. If it finds poetry in the <em>Histoire(s) du cinéma,</em> the first line had already been written as early as <em>A bout de souffle</em>, whose novelty has long obscured its cruel endgame, as much regarding its plot (death of the betrayed hero) as regarding cinema&#39;s (farewell to classical cinema). Like any great melancholic artist, this never prevented Godard from being the most alive of filmmakers.</p>                                             <section>  <p> <span><span>Jacques Mandelbaum</span></span>  </p>   <p>Translation of an original article published in French on <a href="https://lemonde.fr">lemonde.fr</a>; the publisher may only be liable for the French version.</p>  </section>    <section>       </section>   </article>     </section>                                    </section> </section>          <section id="js-capping" data-full="0" data-mini="0"> <section id="js-capping-wrapper">  <section id="js-capping-content"> <p>You may read <i>Le Monde</i> on one device at a time</p>   <p>This message will be displayed on the other device.</p>    <a href="https://moncompte.lemonde.fr">Learn about our multi-account offers</a>  </section> <section id="js-capping-bottom">     <ul id="js-capping-faq"> <li> <p>Because someone else (or you) is reading <i>Le Monde</i> with this account on another device.</p> <p>You may only read <i>Le Monde</i> on <strong>one device</strong> at a time (computer, phone or tablet).</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I stop seeing this message?</p> <p>By clicking on «  » and by making sure that you are the only user on <i>Le Monde</i> with this account.</p> </li> <li> <p>What will happen if you keep reading here?</p> <p>This message will be displayed on the other device.
