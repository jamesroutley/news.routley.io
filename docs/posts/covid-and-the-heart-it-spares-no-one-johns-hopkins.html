            <div><p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>This study was done before vaccination was widely available. Is there any indication that, for example, breakthrough infections would have a different result long term?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Yes. We are [studying] this, but I think the jury is still out. We&#39;re certainly very interested in addressing that publicly as soon as we can.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>You studied Veterans Administration records, and that population is mostly men, white, and older. Do you feel that [the findings] apply to the entire population?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Yes and no. I think we have to be cognizant that this study comes from one system, the VA system, but that needs to be put into a larger context. This is a study of nearly more than 11 million people. People tell me most vets are males, but 10% are females—meaning our study has more than 1 million females. Similarly, 20% [of study participants] are Black—more than 2 million people. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to this, we did subgroup analyses to see what would happen in only women, only men, only Black people or white people, people younger than a certain age or older than a certain age. Across the board we saw an increased risk of heart problems. This tells us that it doesn&#39;t matter if you are a female or male, Black or white, older or younger, diabetic, a smoker, have chronic kidney disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, or not. The risk was across the board, and it’s driven by COVID-19. It really spared no one.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>The jury&#39;s still out on all of the things that long COVID might encompass. Would this fit into that category?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Absolutely. Long COVID is the umbrella term that describes all the post-acute manifestations that happen as a result of COVID-19. It could be things that started in the acute phase that lingered and persisted into the long term, or it could be new things attributable to SARS-CoV-2 that have happened three, four, or five months out. When you have that definition in mind, it&#39;s very clear that the heart manifestations we described in our report are part and parcel of the broader picture of long COVID. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Long COVID can give you fatigue and brain fog and result in new-onset diabetes, kidney problems, and heart problems. All of that collectively forms a multilayered, multifaceted long COVID. That&#39;s not to say one patient will have all of these things.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Are we going to have a lot of people who have some form of long COVID and are chronically ill? Will it be a strain on government resources? What do you see as the future?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I think that&#39;s why talking about it is very important. We think long COVID can affect anywhere between 4% and 7% of people. That seems really small, but it’s not if you multiply that number by the huge number of people infected with COVID in the U.S., more than 80 million people and counting. We think that will translate into millions of people with long COVID in need of care, and broadly speaking, our health systems need to be prepared. People running health systems or clinics need to start preparing for the tide of patients that are going to hit our doors with heart problems and other long COVID problems. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>On a government level, I think we definitely need to be prepared for this. We cannot move on from the pandemic and disregard its long-term consequences. Arguably the long-term consequences are going to be even more profound and stick with us and scar a lot of people around us for generations. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A lot of the manifestations we&#39;re describing in this report are chronic conditions that will [affect] people for a lifetime. For example, heart failure isn&#39;t something that you wake up tomorrow and all of a sudden don&#39;t have. That&#39;s not how it works. We&#39;re no longer talking about things that might improve tomorrow—we&#39;re seeing chronic conditions that will require care for a long time. People, health systems, and governments need to be prepared for that.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
