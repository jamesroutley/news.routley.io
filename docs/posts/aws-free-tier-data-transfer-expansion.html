Some services offer free trials, others are free for the first 12 months after you sign up, and still others are always free, up to a per-service maximum. Our intent is to make it easy and cost-effective for you to gain experience with a wide variety of powerful services without having to pay any usage charges.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Free Tier Data Transfer Expansion</strong></span></p> 
       <p><strong>Data Transfer from AWS Regions to the Internet</strong> is now free for up to 100 GB of data per month (up from 1 GB per region). This includes Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, and so forth. The expansion does not apply to the AWS GovCloud or AWS China Regions.</p> 
       <p><strong>Data Transfer from Amazon CloudFront</strong> is now free for up to 1 TB of data per month (up from 50 GB), and is no longer limited to the first 12 months after signup. We are also raising the number of free HTTP and HTTPS requests from 2,000,000 to 10,000,000, and removing the 12 month limit on the 2,000,000 free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-cloudfront-functions-run-your-code-at-the-edge-with-low-latency-at-any-scale/">CloudFront Function</a> invocations per month. The expansion does not apply to data transfer from CloudFront PoPs in China.</p> 
       <p>This change is effective December 1, 2021 and takes effect with no effort on your part. As a result of this change, millions of AWS customers worldwide will no longer see a charge for these two categories of data transfer on their monthly AWS bill. Customers who go beyond one or both of these allocations will also see a reduction in their overall data transfer charges.</p> 
       <p>Your applications can run in any of 21 AWS Regions with a total of 69 Availability Zones (with more of both on the way), and can make use of the full range of CloudFront features (including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/">SSL support</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/streaming/">media streaming</a>), and over 300 CloudFront PoPs, all connected across a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/global_network/">dedicated network backbone</a>. The network was designed with performance as a key driver, and is expanded continuously in order to meet the ever-growing needs of our customers. It is global, fully redundant, and built from parallel 100 GbE metro fibers linked via trans-oceanic cables across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and South China Seas.</p>
