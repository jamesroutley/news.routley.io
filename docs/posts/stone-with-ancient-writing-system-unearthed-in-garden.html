what the stone was when he found it, but was unable to find someone to confirm his suspicions and &#34;hit a brick wall&#34;.</p><p>But he said that changed when Katherine Forsyth from the University of Glasgow &#34;took the trouble to come down with a researcher&#34; a few months ago.</p><p>She partially translated the script to reveal a name: Mael Dumcail.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Herbert Art Gallery &amp;

he said.</p><p>The piece of sandstone measures just 11cm (4 inches) in length and is believed to have been carved sometime between the 4th and 6th Century AD.</p><p>Ms Gilmore said another theory was that it could have been used by Irish tradesmen to make contact with each other.</p><p>The team said Ogham was highly unusual among world writing systems, consisting solely of parallel lines in groups of one to five.</p><p>They said it could provide an insight into the Irish language before the use of the Latin insular script</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Birmingham Museums Trust</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Part of the writing was deciphered and revealed a name: Mael Dumcail</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>She said the discovery took her by surprise, but finds like this can &#34;leave more questions than answers&#34;.</p><p>She hopes to learn more when the rest of the stone is translated.</p><p>It is due to go on display at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry on Saturday, as part of a free exhibition titled Collecting Coventry.</p></div></div></article></div></div>
