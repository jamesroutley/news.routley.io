<p><em><a href="https://github.com/cceckman/reading-list" rel="external" target="_blank">Reading List</a> but for real this time</em></p>
<p>Long-time readers of this blog[^thanks] may note a new entry in the nav bar: <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/">Reading</a>, to match <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/">Writing</a>.
Reading includes my <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/blogroll/">blogroll</a> <em>plus</em> a <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/">roundups</a> section
that I’ll be updating with recent articles I’d like to call out.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re following this site via RSS, you may want to resubscribe!</strong>
I’ve used the <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/index.xml">Writing feed</a> as the default for the whole site,
but now there’s a combined <a href="https://cceckman.com/index.xml">all-site feed</a> if you want to see the roundups too.
(Or you can follow the round-ups <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/index.xml">separately</a>; your call!)</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to track my online reading for a while.
In the limit, I want a lot of metadata about each article / link:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the article?</li>
<li>Where and when did I find it?</li>
<li>Have read it yet, or is it TBR? What did I think about it?</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to <a href="https://github.com/cceckman/reading-list" rel="external" target="_blank">write my own applet</a>.
That was a good learning experience about web technologies (app manifest! service workers!)
but was ultimately too unwieldy to use.
The above data are a lot lot to be presented with on each access,
when mostly I’m just trying to make a record to look at later.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I also tried using <a href="https://omnivore.app" rel="external" target="_blank">Omnivore</a>, a TBR-oriented web app.
I found this didn’t reliably “receive” links I sent to it:
after sharing a link, I would refresh the page, but the new entry wouldn’t
be available until minutes later.
I saved about a dozen links in Omnivore before I stopped using it.</p>
<p>The approach I’ve had success with is “just” dropping the link in my
<a href="https://obsidian.md" rel="external" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> vault, in today’s <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes" rel="external" target="_blank">daily note</a>,
using the <code>#reading</code> tag.
The file name gives me the “date of discovery”;
any other metadata is part of the prose, if I chose to include it.</p>

<p>For a while I’ve had Leah Neukirchen’s <a href="https://leahneukirchen.org/trivium/" rel="external" target="_blank">Trivium</a> feed in my <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/blogroll/">blogroll</a>.
Every now-and-again Leah posts a set of links on topics matching (her) interests;
sometimes just the titles, usually with attribution, sometimes with a few words of summary.</p>
<p>I really like this format!
It’s easy to scan over and peek at the recent articles, “will this be interesting to me too”.</p>
<p>My goal was to produce something like Trivium from my own recent reading.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
I think my Obsidian notes have been effective at <em>adding</em> to my reading list; so I wanted a tool to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract links and annotations from my daily notes</li>
<li>Serve an edditor where I can see the list, create round-ups, and edit annotations</li>
<li>Download completed roundups for publication on this site, as <a href="https://gohugo.io" rel="external" target="_blank">Hugo</a>-friendly Markdown</li>
</ul>

<p>A bit of coding later, and I have <a href="https://cceckman.com/r/reading-roundup/">these tools</a>; may they serve as an inspiration to you!</p>
<p>If you’re just interested in the roundups, follow along <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/">here</a> or in the <a href="https://cceckman.com/index.xml">combined feed with my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
