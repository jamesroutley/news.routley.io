Now Apple has become one of the first tech giants to explicitly call out and ban caste discrimination in the company. Given that the idea of caste, which is well-known to people in India, might not be familiar to managers and employees in the US, Apple has also started training on the topic so that its workers understand the new policies better.</p><p>In recent years the topic of caste and alleged caste discrimination among tech workers who have Indian heritage has led to much talk in Silicon Valley. Just a few months ago in June, Google, whose CEO Sundar Pichai has Indian roots, cancelled a talk on caste discrimination where Dalit rights activist Thenmozhi Soundararajan was supposed to give a presentation. The talk was organised by Google employee Tanuja Gupta.</p>

<p>After the news of the cancellation came out, a report noted that Google cancelled the talk because it was leading to rancour inside the company. In the following days, Tanuja was put under investigation allegedly for violating the company&#39;s code of conduct. Soon after, she left Google.</p><p>--- ENDS ---</p><div id="tab-link-wrapper-plugin"><div id="tab-video-wrapper-plugin"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="463" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oJ0W5B1DuLQ" width="769"></iframe></p></div></div></div></div></div></div> </article>
