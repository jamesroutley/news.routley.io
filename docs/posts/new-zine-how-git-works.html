    <h1>New zine: How Git Works!</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I’ve been writing about git on here nonstop for months, and the git zine
is FINALLY done! It came out on Friday!</p>

<p>You can get it for $12 here:
<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">https://wizardzines.com/zines/git</a>, or get
an <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/all-the-zines/">14-pack of all my zines here</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the cover:</p>

<h3 id="who-is-this-zine-for">who is this zine for?</h3>

<p>I wrote this zine for people who have been using git for years and are still
afraid of it. As always – I think it sucks to be afraid of the tools that you
use in your work every day! I want folks to feel confident using git.</p>

<p>My goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>To explain how some parts of git that initially seem scary (like “detached
HEAD state”) are pretty straightforward to deal with once you understand
what’s going on</li>
<li>To show some parts of git you probably <em>should</em> be careful around.  For
example, the stash is one of the places in git where it’s easiest to lose
your work in a way that’s incredibly annoying to recover form, and I avoid
using it heavily because of that.</li>
<li>To clear up a few common misconceptions about how the core parts of git (like
commits, branches, and merging) work</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-this-and-oh-shit-git">what’s the difference between this and Oh Shit, Git!</h3>

<p>You might be wondering – Julia! You already have a zine about git! What’s going
on? <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/oh-shit-git">Oh Shit, Git!</a> is a set of tricks for fixing git messes. <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git/">“How Git Works”</a>
explains how Git <strong>actually</strong> works.</p>

<p>Also, Oh Shit, Git! is the amazing <a href="https://sylormiller.com/">Katie Sylor Miller</a>’s <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">concept</a>: we made it
into a zine because I was such a huge fan of her work on it.</p>

<p>I think they go really well together.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-so-confusing-about-git-anyway">what’s so confusing about git, anyway?</h3>

<p>This zine was really hard for me to write because when I started writing it,
I’d been using git pretty confidently for 10 years. I had no real memory of
what it was <em>like</em> to struggle with git.</p>

<p>But thanks to a huge amount of help from <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> as
well as everyone who talked to me about git on Mastodon, eventually I was able
to see that there are a lot of things about git that are counterintuitive,
misleading, or just plain confusing. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/01/confusing-git-terminology/">confusing terminology</a> (for example “fast-forward”, “reference”, or “remote-tracking branch”)</li>
<li>misleading messages (for example how <code>Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;</code> doesn’t necessary mean that your branch is up to date with the <code>main</code> branch on the origin)</li>
<li>uninformative output (for example how I <em>STILL</em> can’t reliably figure out which code comes from which branch when I’m looking at a merge conflict)</li>
<li>a lack of guidance around handling diverged branches (for example how when you run <code>git pull</code> and your branch has diverged from the origin, it doesn’t give you great guidance how to handle the situation)</li>
<li>inconsistent behaviour (for example how git’s reflogs are almost always append-only, EXCEPT for the stash, where git will delete entries when you run <code>git stash drop</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The more I heard from people how about how confusing they find git, the more it
became clear that git really does not make it easy to figure out what its
internal logic is just by using it.</p>

<h3 id="handling-git-s-weirdnesses-becomes-pretty-routine">handling git’s weirdnesses becomes pretty routine</h3>

<p>The previous section made git sound really bad, like “how can anyone possibly
use this thing?“.</p>

<p>But my experience is that after I learned what git actually means by all of its
weird error messages, dealing with it became pretty routine! I’ll see an
<code>error: failed to push some refs to &#39;github.com:jvns/wizard-zines-site&#39;</code>,
realize “oh right, probably a coworker made some changes to <code>main</code> since I last
ran <code>git pull</code>”, run <code>git pull --rebase</code> to incorporate their changes, and move
on with my day. The whole thing takes about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Or if I see a <code>You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state</code> warning, I’ll just make sure
to run <code>git checkout mybranch</code> before continuing to write code. No big deal.</p>

<p>For me (and for a lot of folks I talk to about git!), dealing with git’s weird
language can become so normal that you totally forget why anybody would even
find it weird.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-bit-of-internals">a little bit of internals</h3>

<p>One of my biggest questions when writing this zine was how much to focus on
what’s in the <code>.git</code> directory. We ended up deciding to include a couple of
pages about internals (“inside .git”, pages 14-15), but otherwise focus more on
git’s <em>behaviour</em> when you use it and why sometimes git behaves in unexpected
ways.</p>

<p>This is partly because there are lots of great guides to git’s internals
out there already (<a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out">1</a>, <a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">2</a>), and partly because I think even if you <em>have</em> read one
of these guides to git’s internals, it isn’t totally obvious how to connect
that information to what you actually see in git’s user interface.</p>

<p>For example: it’s easy to find documentation about remotes in git –
for example <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches">this page</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remote-tracking branches […] remind you where the branches in your remote
repositories were the last time you connected to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if you’ve read that, you might not realize that the statement <code>Your
branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;&#34;</code> in <code>git status</code> doesn’t necessarily
mean that you’re actually up to date with the remote <code>main</code> branch.</p>

<p>So in general in the zine we focus on the behaviour you see in Git’s UI, and
then explain how that relates to what’s happening internally in Git.</p>

<h3 id="the-cheat-sheet">the cheat sheet</h3>

<p>The zine also comes with a free printable cheat sheet: (click to get a PDF version)</p>

<p><a href="https://wizardzines.com/git-cheat-sheet.pdf">
  <img width="600px" src="https://wizardzines.com/images/cheat-sheet-smaller.png"/>
</a></p>

<h3 id="it-comes-with-an-html-transcript">it comes with an HTML transcript!</h3>

<p>The zine also comes with an HTML transcript, to (hopefully) make it easier to
read on a screen reader! Our Operations Manager, Lee, transcribed all of the
pages and wrote image descriptions. I’d love feedback about the experience of
reading the zine on a screen reader if you try it.</p>

<h3 id="i-really-do-love-git">I really do love git</h3>

<p>I’ve been pretty critical about git in this post, but I only write zines about
technologies I love, and git is no exception.</p>

<p>Some reasons I love git:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s fast!</li>
<li>it’s backwards compatible! I learned how to use it 10 years ago and
everything I learned then is still true</li>
<li>there’s tons of great free Git hosting available out there (GitHub! Gitlab! a
million more!), so I can easily back up all my code</li>
<li>simple workflows are REALLY simple (if I’m working on a project on my own, I
can just run <code>git commit -am &#39;whatever&#39;</code> and <code>git push</code> over and over again and it
works perfectly)</li>
<li>Almost every internal file in git is a pretty simple text file (or has a
version which is a text file), which makes me feel like I can always
understand exactly what’s going on under the hood if I want to.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this zine helps some of you love it too.</p>

<h3 id="people-who-helped-with-this-zine">people who helped with this zine</h3>

<p>I don’t make these zines by myself!</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan</a> every
morning for 8 months to write clear explanations of git.</p>

<p>The cover is by Vladimir Kašiković,
Gersande La Flèche did copy editing,
James Coglan (of the great <a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Building
Git</a>) did technical review, our
Operations Manager Lee did the transcription as well as a million other
things, my partner Kamal read the zine and told me which parts were off (as he
always does), and I had a million great conversations with Marco Rogers about
git.</p>

<p>And finally, I want to thank all the beta readers! There were 66 this time
which is a record! They left hundreds of comments about what was confusing,
what they learned, and which of my jokes were funny. It’s always hard to hear
from beta readers that a page I thought made sense is actually extremely
confusing, and fixing those problems before the final version makes the zine so
much better.</p>

<h3 id="get-the-zine">get the zine</h3>

<p>Here are some links to get the zine again:</p>

<ul>
<li>get <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">How Git Works</a></li>
<li>get an <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/all-the-zines/">14-pack of all my zines here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, you can get either a PDF version to print at home or a print version
shipped to your house. The only caveat is print orders will ship in <strong>July</strong> – I
need to wait for orders to come in to get an idea of how many I should print
before sending it to the printer.</p>

<h3 id="thank-you">thank you</h3>

<p>As always: if you’ve bought zines in the past, thank you for all your support
over the years. And thanks to all of you (1000+ people!!!) who have already
bought the zine in the first 3 days. It’s already set a record for most zines
sold in a single day and I’ve been really blown away.</p>
