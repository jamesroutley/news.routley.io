    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>Hi peeps. Living in Germany, have a masters in chemical engineering. After working a few years in my own field, got bored and switched sectors. Then realized I really enjoy learning, getting good at a new position, and then get bored. Was young back then so I kept switching jobs, fields, industries. Have also been working as a freelancer on the side for 15+ years. Worked as a consultant, engineer, coding/language teacher (foreign languages and coding), social worker, marketing/sales agent, product/project/community manager, educator, workshop facilitator, devops technician, etc. This all used to be ok as I always somehow found a new job when I needed one. And I always found companies that didn&#39;t see this as a disadvantage. I have gained so many skills, but in the last 2 years it&#39;s been hard to find a job. My cv is pretty weird of course for typical companies and positions. I need to find people / companies who can see this as an advantage. Anyone else in a similar position? Any tips?</p></td></div></div>
