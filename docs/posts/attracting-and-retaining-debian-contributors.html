    <h1>Attracting and Retaining Debian Contributors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Many projects struggle with attracting and retaining contributors; Debian
is no different in that regard.  At <a href="https://debconf24.debconf.org/">DebConf24</a>, Carlos Henrique Lima
Melara and Lucas Kanashiro gave a presentation about efforts that the
Brazilian Debian community has made to increase participation.  Their ideas
and the lessons
learned can be applied more widely, both for other Debian communities and
for other projects.
</p>

<p>
Kanashiro introduced himself as a software engineer, Debian developer since
2016, and an Ubuntu core developer working on Ubuntu Server at Canonical.
Melara said that &#34;everybody calls me Charles&#34;, and that is his name within
Debian; he is a computer engineer interested in security and operating
systems, working on embedded systems at Toradex.  He has recently become a
Debian developer.

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
Eight or nine years ago, a local Debian community was formed in Brasília, which is
the capital of Brazil, &#34;right in the middle of the country&#34;, Kanashiro
said.  He was working on Debian without any local colleagues at the time and wanted to try to get
others involved.
So he and his
former professor began holding events and installfests, which worked
pretty well, &#34;but in the end we were not able to engage people&#34; and retain
them in a local community.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/988884/">

</a></p><p>
Later, he was able to work with some university students who were
interested and they formed a group that met monthly, sometimes in
conjunction with a
local Linux users group.  His goal, though, was not to be a users group;
instead he wanted to have a local community of Debian contributors.  But, then,
along came the pandemic, and everything stopped.
</p>

<p>
A few months after the start of the pandemic, the group started to have
online meetings.  That is &#34;when things started to get some traction&#34;,
largely because people from other cities were able to join in.  The group
also started to be able to contribute to Debian; it now has four <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper">Debian
developers</a>, five <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">Debian maintainers</a>, and those numbers increase every
semester.
</p>

<p>
Brazil now has an engaged and active community of Debian contributors.  He
showed a picture of attendees at the <a href="https://bh.mini.debconf.org/">MiniDebConf Belo Horizonte</a> that was
held in April; there were around 225 participants, Kanashiro said.  He also
showed a picture of all of the Brazilian attendees at <a href="https://debconf23.debconf.org/">last year&#39;s DebConf</a> in Kochi,
India; there were 14 people in the picture.  The Brazilian Debian community
likes to promote what it is doing, by showing up and participating in
events like those, but it is also interested in improvement
and in helping other communities to improve as well.
</p>

<p>
To that end, Melara asked the audience how many were
Debian developers (lots) and maintainers (two); then he asked how many
&#34;have a thriving local community where you are living?&#34;  There were a few
hands raised, which is &#34;nice&#34;, he said, but is indicative of the problem
that they have been trying to
solve, both in the city of Brasília and in the whole country of Brazil.
</p>

<p>
There are two things that they think are important to overcome in order to
create and build a new local community.  The first is to lower the barriers
for newcomers to contribute.  But once you have attracted a newcomer and
gotten them to contribute, how can they be retained so that they become
long-term contributors or even become Debian maintainers and developers?
The main goal of the talk, he said, is to relate what the Brazilian
community has done &#34;to make those two things a reality&#34;.
</p>

<h4>Barriers and problems</h4>

<p>
Kanashiro described some of the barriers for newcomers that the Brazilian
community has
encountered.  Documentation for newcomers is often missing, or
is spread around in various places if it exists, so it is hard to
find.  Another problem is that there are too many different tools and
workflows for Debian packaging, which is confusing to newcomers.  Searching
for packaging tools, or talking to different Debian developers about it,
will lead to too many options.
Communicating via mailing lists and IRC is the norm in Debian, but
&#34;that does not work well&#34; for the &#34;new generation&#34;; if you want to bring
those folks into the project, there needs to be some kind of
workaround. &#34;Of course, we will not change everything, because the
community works like that, but, for sure, we need to find a way to lower
this barrier.&#34;
</p>

<p>
English is not an easy language for many potential newcomers in Brazil, but
most of 
the documentation that is available is written in English, so that needs to be
addressed.  People, especially new participants, are shy about asking for
help; they do not know who the right people to ask about how to
contribute are and worry that, even if they did, those people are so busy
that a newcomer should not bother them.  The final barrier that he relayed
is the 
technical 
jargon, terms, and acronyms that pervade Debian and its packaging;
newcomers find it hard to understand what people are even saying when they
are talking about those topics.
</p>

<p>
Melara said that the list of barriers is long; he had some more to add to
the pile.  Newcomers obviously already know about Git, rebasing, packaging
tools, using the command line, and more, right?  &#34;Yeah, no, that&#39;s not
true.&#34;  Most of the new people are coming from Windows, so they are not
familiar with the command line and only have a general sense of how
computers and operating systems work.  As noted earlier, the diversity of
tools and workflows is intimidating as well.
</p>

<p>
Once you get someone interested, engaged, and perhaps even doing some packaging
work or fixing a bug, he asked, how do you encourage them to continue to
contribute 
in the long term?  &#34;It&#39;s difficult to make this transition from a
first-time contributor to a long-term one.&#34;
</p>

<p>
Once a contributor gets to the point where they know how to use the tools,
fix bugs, and do packaging tasks, local community members help them to
become Debian maintainers.  But, there is a similar problem when that
happens, he said; 
they get upload permissions for the packages they maintain, but there is no
clear path forward. The goal is for the Debian-maintainer role not to get
stale.
</p>

<p>
The last problem is with visibility for local groups.  For those doing
packaging, there are various statistics that can show the work that is
going on, which can help increase the visibility of the group.  But there
are other tasks that are not really measured that way, including
putting together events like the MiniDebConf.  Those things are important
for the community but are not as visible.
</p>

<p>
So, with those barriers and problems in mind, Melara said, they wanted to
talk about the solutions that the local group has come up with.  These things have been
worked out over the last four or five years; they would be presenting
what they are doing now, which &#34;seems to work for us&#34;.
</p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>

<p>
Kanashiro said that the documentation problems are being addressed with a
<a href="https://wiki.debianbrasil.org.br/pt-br/home">wiki for Debian
Brasil</a>.  They had encountered a number of problems with using the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/">official Debian wiki</a> due to IP-address
blocks, which restricted access and required pinging people to get
addresses unblocked. Beyond that, the Debian wiki is not particularly modern, while the
Debian Brasil wiki, which is based on <a href="https://js.wiki/">Wiki.js</a>,  has Markdown-editing capability and allows editing pages
side-by-side with their rendering, both of which make it easier to use.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/988885/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/debconf-kanashiro-sm.png" alt="[Lucas Kanashiro]" title="Lucas Kanashiro" width="246" height="260"/>
</a></p><p>
All of the wiki content is in Portuguese, since it is targeting
Brazilians. There are some basic tutorials on setting up an environment to
do packaging work, the structure of a Debian package, using packaging
tools, and so on.  There are also videos from previous events on topics of
interest.  &#34;Everything is there, everything is in Portuguese&#34;. Since it is
a wiki, it can be edited, of course; if someone has a problem when they
follow the steps on the wiki, they are asked to edit the item to improve
the document for the next person.
</p>

<p>
This helps address two of the barriers: lack of documentation for newcomers
and the prevalence of documentation in English.  They could have translated
the existing documentation, he said, but what they have is easier and works
better for the Brazilian community, at least for now.  There has been some
interest in updating the Debian wiki to something modern, which might make
it easier to merge the two at some point.
</p>

<p>
The tool-proliferation problem has been fixed by the simple expedient of
choosing &#34;a very opinionated set of tools&#34; for newcomers to use for
packaging, Melara said.  These are the same tools that he, Kanashiro, and
others use, so they can easily review the work that is being done and &#34;make
sure that everything is OK for uploading&#34;, Melara said.  The process uses
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild">sbuild</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/PackagingWithGit">git-buildpackage</a> (or
gbp), <a href="https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep14/">DEP-14 Git
layouts</a>, and the <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/public">Salsa GitLab
instance</a> for Debian.
</p>

<p>
All of the review comments are picked up by a bot to send to the <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> channel for the group.  That allows
others to see what changes people are asking for in review and to learn
from that. 
There is a &#34;very, very detailed workflow&#34;, which is well-documented and that only requires learning two
tools and Git; that is the starting point for newcomers, though they can
use other tools and workflows once they get their feet under them.  This
helps address the problems with too many tools and workflows; &#34;it&#39;s pretty
easy for newcomers&#34;.
</p>

<p>
The Brazilian community is using modern tools for communication, Kanashiro
said. 
It is difficult to make big changes in the overall Debian community, but
their local community can make its own way. IRC is the 
default chat mechanism for Debian, but younger people do not use IRC; in
Brazil, they use <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>
instead.  It is not practical to expect them to leave Telegram and move to
IRC, so Debian Brasil has created a bridge that connects IRC, Matrix, and
Telegram so that people can choose the one that works best for them &#34;and
everyone will be there discussing things&#34;. 
</p>

<p>
One of the big complaints about IRC is that messages get lost when people
are not logged in, so Debian Brasil provides a <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> service for its users.  Convos is an
web client and server-side &#34;bouncer&#34; for IRC, which handles message
persistence so that users can always get the messages sent.  These tools
have been helping with the communication barrier that was identified, but
also helps with long-term commitment to the community since people can
track and review all of the different comments being made on package
reviews, merge requests, and other activities.
</p>

<p>
Helping people to transition from proprietary tools to free ones (&#34;as in
free speech, not free beer&#34;) is another
thing that the group does, Melara said.  There is an ongoing effort to convince
people to move from Telegram to Matrix or IRC.  It takes a long time, he
said, but he thinks that progress is being made there.
</p>

<p>
Another way to help keep people involved is to keep in touch frequently.
Debian Brasil has weekly online meetings using <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>.  As might be guessed, those calls are
in Portuguese. Normally the first hour and a half or so are spent on
problems that people are having; after that, it becomes a &#34;happy hour&#34;
where people talk about other things.  It is a bonding experience that helps
make newcomers more comfortable by seeing the other members in a social setting.
</p>

<p>
It is important to be consistent and not skip any weeks, because if people
try to attend and the meeting is not held, that may make them less likely
to come the next time.  So Melara tries to be there every week; his slide
had a picture from DebCamp the previous week of a few Brazilians attending
the Jitsi meeting from Korea at 7am Friday, which was the usual 7pm
Thursday meeting time in Brazil.
</p>

<p>
Debian Brasil has a well-defined process for packaging contributions,
Kanashiro said; it is based around using issues and merge requests on
Salsa.  Newcomers often know about using GitHub, so it is easy to get them
using 
similar features on Salsa.  Instead of going to a Debian
mailing list to ask for help in English, they can get help in Portuguese
via chat.  There is a real effort to provide feedback quickly, he said,
rather than having them wait weeks or months, which can happen in other
parts of the Debian project.  They have been successful in getting new
people to contribute this way, he said.
</p>

<p>
The process can be easily tracked because tags can be assigned in GitLab,
Melara said.  That allows the progress to be tracked by email or via the
web client; reviews can be made and checked in email and the comments get
relayed to the Matrix channel so that people can keep up with what others
are doing. &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty nice.&#34;
</p>

<p>
Reviews are handled by any available Debian developer or maintainer, but
they have also developed a mentorship program to try to help new Debian maintainers to
keep contributing.  The mentor is a Debian developer who gets assigned to
the maintainer to help them, on a one-to-one basis, explore different
possibilities of things to work on.  This program is new to Debian Brasil;
it is still being worked on, including in a discussion in an informal birds-of-a-feather (BoF)
session 
earlier in DebConf, Melara said.
</p>

<p>
But the plan is for it to be more than just working with the mentor, since they
may be unavailable at times.  So there will also be group discussions to
share knowledge and look for tasks to work on beyond just the handful of
packages that a maintainer is responsible for.  That way, there will be
faster responses with input from more people, which is especially helpful
for harder questions and problems.
</p>

<h4>Application</h4>

<p>
Other local communities can use some of what they have learned, Kanashiro
said.  He suggested that Debian could create &#34;virtual environments for
local groups&#34; that come with &#34;a bunch of different tools that helped us a
lot&#34;.  Debian Brasil has people available to set up and run all of those
tools, but other local communities may not.
</p>

<p>
A local group could ask to have this environment set up for its members.
They would get a wiki area for the group with some amount of storage
reserved for them.  The IRC bouncer would be configured and started.  There
would be a way to generate statistics for the activities of the
group. Providing &#34;an easy way to do all of this for any local community&#34;
would be &#34;great to have&#34; for Debian.
</p>

<p>
The younger generation (&#34;Gen Z&#34;) is not interested in lengthy videos,
Melara said, so they have been working on three-to-four-minute videos
explaining basic packaging concepts, answering FAQs, and so on.  The
localization team created videos a ways back, which were well-received, so
they are trying to do something similar for packaging.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, they
would like to collect them all into a video course on packaging, Kanashiro
said.    It would present their opinionated view on 
packaging tools and processes; much of it is already done and is being
used.  The goal is to start with everything in Portuguese, naturally, but
eventually to also have them in English.  Getting the video content onto the <a href="https://peertube.debian.social/home">Debian PeerTube</a> is in the
works as well.
</p>

<p>
There are some open questions, Melara said.  He wondered if the
contribution and mentorship processes would make sense elsewhere; can those
be applied or adapted for other local communities?  Are the problems that
have been identified mostly Brazilian in nature or are they more
widespread?  There was not a lot of time left in the session  at that
point, so those 
questions mostly went unanswered.
</p>

<p>
A packaging-team member from the audience said that regular calls were
useful, but that it is hard to do when people are distributed across the
globe.  For local groups, that have participants in similar time zones, it
is much easier. Mentoring people using GitLab issues &#34;is a really good
idea&#34;, he said, which 
makes it easier to see &#34;what&#39;s going on and what&#39;s not&#34;.  Kanashiro
suggested that recording the calls and making them available can help those
who cannot attend them live.
</p>

<p>
Samuel Henrique, who is part of the Debian Brasil group, pointed out that
there are participants in the call from elsewhere, including him from
Ireland; they have managed to find a time that works, though &#34;it&#39;s not
perfect&#34; since he ends up staying up until 3am most Fridays.  Melara said
that some people come early, some stay late, and some do both.
</p>

<p>
There is a question of how to promote the work that local groups do,
Kanashiro said.  One way is to do more frequent blog posts and make them
available on <a href="https://planet.debian.org/">planet.debian.org</a> so
that others can see what the group has been doing.  They have also been
talking with the people working on <a href="https://contributors.debian.org/">contributors.debian.org</a> about
adding data sources for things like event organization, meeting attendance,
and various group activities.  Currently, those things are not tracked.
</p>

<p>
The final item in their presentation was about new Debian maintainers
getting more exposure to the whole project and, in particular, to people outside
of the Brazilian community.  The mentors are often encouraging these people
to broaden their horizons and to get in touch with the project-wide <a href="https://mentors.debian.net/">Debian mentors</a> organization.  The
intent is to get them working on more complex projects once they come up to
speed on packaging.  But the local mentoring is a new program for Debian
Brasil, so they are still working it all out and are interested in what
others are thinking.
</p>

<p>
With that, time expired on the session, which provided some ideas that may
well be applicable to other Debian local groups—and beyond.  It is
interesting to note that some of the choices that are being made at the
local level (e.g. opinionated packaging, moving away from IRC-only) are
going to be difficult to push at the distribution-project level, at least
for some time to come.  The relative success of local organizations at
attracting and retaining new people could—slowly—start pushing Debian as a
whole toward more modern approaches.  Time will tell.
