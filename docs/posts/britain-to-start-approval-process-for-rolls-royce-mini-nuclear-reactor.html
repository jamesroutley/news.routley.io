This is the first time a small scale reactor has been assessed by regulator.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The process typically takes around 4-5 years for large scale reactor designs.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Susanna Twidale
