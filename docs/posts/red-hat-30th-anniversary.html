        <p>Thirty years ago the world looked very different. Grunge music was everywhere, the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl, Jurassic Park was the highest-grossing film, the first Beanie Babies were sold, sun-dried tomatoes were the hottest food trend and Red Hat was incorporated. </p>

<p>When Bob Young and Marc Ewing came together to create Red Hat, they couldn’t have imagined what the company would become and the impact it would ultimately have on enterprise IT. From our humble beginnings at our first corporate headquarters in Durham to North Carolina State University’s Centennial Campus to our current global headquarters in downtown Raleigh, we’re proud to have played a part in the technology sector’s growth across North Carolina and the drive towards open source and hybrid cloud globally. We are now the world&#39;s leading provider of enterprise open source solutions but we have stayed true to our North Carolina roots. </p>

<p>To help us celebrate three decades of open source innovation, State of North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared March 26, 2023, as Red Hat Day across North Carolina. </p>

<p>Thank you to the Governor for recognizing our 30th anniversary with Red Hat Day. And thank you to the customers, partners, associates and community members who made this possible. Here’s to the next 30!</p>

<p>We’re including the full text of their proclamations below.  </p>
