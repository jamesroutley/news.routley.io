    <h1>Why I do programming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-astro-cid-o5gmpz7g="">  <p><em>This piece was inspired by this <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-realize-that-programming-was-your-passion/answer/Aaron-Boodman">post</a> by Aaron Boodman.</em></p>
<p>I remember myself as a calm, quiet kid, happiest when I had a bunch of wires in my hands. My parents used to give them to me as toys along with a screwdriver and an old cassette player I could take apart and try to put back together. I was three years old. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I loved the feeling of exploring the insides of a machine, trying to understand how it works.</p>
<p>In first grade, I was introduced to MS-DOS and Logo with a bit of PASCAL. Later, when the school got better computers, I started writing small programs in BASIC: tic-tac-toe, calculators, that sort of thing. It felt magical.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I finally got my own PC. At first, I mostly used it for games, but after I got internet access, everything changed. I discovered HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. This was pre-HTML5, so the web was limited, but I still built a lot of weird and ugly websites. My computer science teacher actually liked them. I even made a bit of money by doing other people’s HTML homework, not just for my classmates, but for my brother’s too.</p>
<p>Around that time, I was really into GTA and discovered MTA and SAMP, community-made mods that added multiplayer to the game. I became obsessed with the idea of running my own server with custom mods and rules. That led me to PAWN, a scripting language used in those mods. I wanted to build a world where we could do almost anything, like in real life. A kind of proto-metaverse.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered <a href="https://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> — a fully virtual world with its own economy. It had everything I had wanted to build in GTA. I started creating things: clothes, buildings, scripts using LSL (a scripting language that’s a superset of Lua). I even made some money, converting Second Life currency into real-world cash.</p>
<p>But after a while, I realized I didn’t want to create only for a virtual world. I wanted to make something meaningful for people in real life. I was around 16 at the time, still unsure what that could be. What I did know was: I wanted to buy a new computer and a Korg microKORG to make electronic noises. So I launched a tiny “business” reselling ICQ numbers and other digital things on a local white-hat hacker forum. I earned enough to buy what I wanted… and nearly got expelled from school for truancy.</p>
<p>Around then, HTML5 launched, and the web suddenly became powerful again. I created my first homepage with animated JavaScript clouds in the header, layered and moving like in the real sky. I didn’t save the source code, but I still have a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/artiffical/6315413321/in/dateposted-public/">screenshot</a>. Around that time I also discovered Bret Victor’s <a href="https://youtu.be/EGqwXt90ZqA">Inventing on Principle</a>, a talk that shaped how I see programming and creativity.</p>
<p>In university, I studied <em>Engineering in Innovation</em> — a mix of semi-technical and business-oriented classes. My favorite courses were <em>Engineering Graphics</em> (lots of CAD), <em>Computer Security</em> (where I once “hacked” the university’s SMTP server — not because I was clever, but because it was ridiculously easy), and <em>Philosophy</em>, which taught me the value of asking right questions, and of creating a personal philosophy as well.</p>
<p>After graduation, I was lost. I didn’t know what I wanted. Luckily, a friend invited me to join a startup — <em>MipoTheBot</em>, a Slack bot for freelancers using platforms like Upwork. I worked on design, UI/UX, and started writing code again. That’s where my professional career began. We shut it down eventually, because we didn’t understand sales or marketing well enough. But I learned an important lesson: those things matter.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, I built a lot across different industries. Most importantly, I discovered that great products come from small, curious and tight-knit teams where everyone owns the outcome together.</p>
<p>What stayed with me most from Aaron Boodman’s post was what he wrote about burnout. Like him, I’ve gone through it. Twice, in fact. My most recent episode wasn’t work-related but came from personal life changes. I took a month off to recover and visit friends across Europe, and when I came back, I had a renewed desire to build. That break reminded me that I still love programming. It has never been just a job for me.</p>
<p>The beauty of programming, for me, is that there’s always a new frontier to explore. Ops, backend, frontend, hardware, and systems programming — each one pulls me in a different direction. Within each of those areas, there are even more rabbit holes: web performance, local-first software, distributed systems, crypto, decentralization, AI, design engineering, and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes the hardest part is maintaining focus and not chasing every shiny new thing.</p>
<p>For me, programming has always been more than a skill. It’s a way to explore, to tinker, and to satisfy curiosity. From wires and screwdrivers to apps, the tools have changed. But the impulse remains. That’s why I keep coming back to it. It’s my natural way of interacting with the world.</p>
