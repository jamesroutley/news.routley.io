    <h1>Microsoft is testing ads in the Windows 11 File Explorer</h1>

<p>Microsoft has begun testing promotions for some of its other products in the File Explorer app on devices running its latest Windows 11 Insider build.</p>
<p>The new Windows 11 &#34;feature&#34; was discovered by a Windows user and Insider MVP who <a href="https://twitter.com/flobo09/status/1502645866204704773" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a screenshot of an advertisement notification displayed above the listing of folders and files to the File Explorer, the Windows default file manager.</p>
<p>As shown in the screenshot, Microsoft will use such ads to promote other Microsoft products, for instance, about how to &#34;write with confidence across documents, email, and the web with advanced writing suggestions from Microsoft Editor.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the reaction to this was adverse, to say the least, with some saying that File Explorer is &#34;one of the worst places to show ads,&#34; while others added that this is the way to go if Microsoft wants &#34;people ditching Explorer for something else.&#34;</p>
<p>BleepingComputer also tried replicating this on a system running the newest Windows 11 Insider build, but we didn&#39;t get any File Explorer ads.</p>
<p>This can likely be explained by Microsoft running an A/B testing experiment trying to gauge the success of such a feature or by the company disabling it after the visible user outcry.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Microsoft has added promotional messages to various places within the Windows user interface.</p>
<p>For example, Redmond <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-tests-office-ads-in-windows-10-wordpad/" target="_blank">tested ads pushing its free Office web apps</a> in the menu bar for the Windows 10 Wordpad application two years ago, a campaign with similar user protests.</p>
<p>The company also started displaying <a data-remove-tab-index="true" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-start-menu-promo-for-microsoft-edge-cant-be-disabled/" delay="150" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-start-menu-promo-for-microsoft-edge-cant-be-disabled/" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">ads for Microsoft Edge</a> in the Windows 10 Start Menu every time users searched for a competing browser, prompting them to download the new Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has reached out to Microsoft with questions regarding the File Explorer ads, but we haven&#39;t heard back yet.</p>
