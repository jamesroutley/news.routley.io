Since the broadcast is public, pirates are able to use their software-defined radio (SDR) transmitters to effectively flood the frequencies with noise and memes.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The recent barrage of attacks on the station come as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/blinken-ukraine-russia-attack-short-notice-invasion-fears-mount-rcna12691" target="_blank">Russia prepares to invade neighbouring Ukraine</a>, where radio enthusiasts speculate at least some of the pirate broadcasts originate.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezvyyj/cubas-mysterious-numbers-station-is-still-on-the-air">Numbers stations</a> are short-wave radio stations known for their mysterious and cryptic broadcasts, long believed to be a method used by spy agencies to communicate with covert operatives. They typically involve voices reading off sequences of numbers, or timed pulses that can be decoded into messages. While many stations have become obsolete or redundant, several broadcasts remain on the air—much to the fascination of amateur radio hobbyists.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/s8jblw/the_russian_buzzer_uvb76_4625_broke_protocol/" target="_blank">Another poster on Reddit uploaded an image</a> they said was from the UVB-76 broadcast of a V for Vendetta mask. Another broadcast <a href="https://twitter.com/redfox0x20/status/1483180058869121033?s=21" target="_blank">included the trollface</a> meme.</p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Do you know anything else about this hijacked broadcast?

The following year, enthusiasts entered the broadcast’s original location in Povarovo, Russia, and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/07/the-unexplained-signals-of-russian-station-uvb-76/" target="_blank">allegedly found a log book which showed messages transmitted on UVB-76</a>.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>For now, the excitement appears to be over.
