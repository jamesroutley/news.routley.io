<p><a href="http://decentraland.org" data-type="URL" data-id="decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> is the first fully decentralized virtual world. Its vision is to hand over control to the people who create and play in this virtual space. The DAO  (“Decentralized Autonomous Organization”) behind Decentraland decided in a recent community town hall meeting to join the Blender Development Fund for a period of two years, as Patron Member.</p>



<blockquote><p>The fight for an open metaverse will define the 2020s and Blender is one of the most important open source projects in the 3D creator ecosystem. “A rising tide lifts all boats.”</p><cite>Jin, founding Decentraland member</cite></blockquote>



<p>Blender Foundation uses the Development Fund to support and fund developers on core development tasks, topics that have a wide endorsement in the contributor community of blender.org. Check for the roadmap proposal ’22 and ’23 on <a href="http://code.blender.org">the code blog</a>.</p>



<p>Welcome Decentraland! We for sure share your mission to make sure artists and creators are being enabled and supported to access open metaverse initiatives on the web.</p>
