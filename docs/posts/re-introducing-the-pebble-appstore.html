Pretty good for the first month of production. These watches are being transferred to our fulfillment center and will be shipped out soon.</p><p>Black Pebble 2 Duo production did not start until the end of September, and then got interrupted by a China/Hong Kong holiday. Extremely sorry for the delay on black!</p><p><strong>Pebble Time 2</strong></p><p>One fun piece of Pebble Time 2 software development news - we added a feature to make existing Pebble watchfaces/apps now (optionally) scale up to fill larger and higher resolution Pebble Time 2 display! Previous generation Pebble rectangular displays measured 144x168 pixels in 1.26&#34; diagonal, but Pebble Time 2 is 200x228 pixels in 1.5&#34;, existing faces/apps would have had a black border on PT2. Many thanks to Alina for posting <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1395517128043401258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this idea on Discord</a>.</p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-1-cleanshot_2025-10-07_at_16.48.452x.png"/></p><p>This is fantastic because it will allow <em>all</em> older apps/faces to fill up the whole screen. Even better though, many Pebble developers are already upgrading their apps/faces to support the bigger screen natively, like <a href="https://lignite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lignite</a>’s beautiful face <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/55386bcd2aead62b16000028?query=mosaic&amp;section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic</a>. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-9-pxl_20251001_2309170933.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Pebble Time 2 <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal">hardware development</a> is going pretty well. We finished EVT (engineering verification test) and we’re now heading into the DVT (design verification test) stage. We’re still working on a number of tasks like tuning the stainless steel PVD hard coating, testing water resistance, integrating our firmware test suite into the factory ERP and more fun stuff. </p><p>Schedule-wise, we’re behind where I would have liked to be in October. We’re now aiming to start mass production <em>just</em> around the end of the year (12/26 to be precise). That means December pre-orders will not ship out until January at the earliest. We’ll try our best to catch up, but the other looming date is the start of the lunar new year (factory shuts down Feb 1 through 17). We’ve got our work cut out for us! We’ll get it done.</p><p>Now onto the main event…</p><h3 id="reintroducing-the-pe"><a href="#reintroducing-the-pe">(re)Introducing the Pebble Appstore<span>#</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/555283c7efff0cc8e50000b0?query=slides&amp;section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-3-cleanshot_2025-10-08_at_22.09.51.gif" alt="The wonderful Slides of Time"/></a></p><p>The wonderful Slides of Time</p><p>For those of you who forgot or weren’t around 10 years ago, one of the most awesome parts of Pebble is the huge selection of fun/quirky/beautiful/clever/useful apps and watchfaces (from here I’ll just call them both ‘apps’). These were made by an extraordinarily talented community of casual developers, who primarily built apps for themselves and shared them with the broader public. This was facilitated by a damn good SDK, APIs, devtools and documentation created by the friendly and talented software and devrel teams at Pebble.</p><p>I think the ease of development and hackability of Pebble truly made the world a better place, one little app at a time. I love hearing stories from people who first learned how to program on a free Pebble they got from a hackathon (we gave away thousands this way). <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/blog/2016/05/11/Learning-C-with-Pebble-The-Book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Books</a> were <a href="https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU_hPBhgjGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tools</a> <a href="https://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were</a> created. My then-girlfriend now-wife (a biochemistry professor) even learned Pebble.JS to create an <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/5344b0d7b89f52694f000132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amino acid flash card</a> app for her students! Yes, we are nerds.</p><p>Over 2,000 apps and 10,000 watchfaces were created and hosted on the Pebble Appstore. It’s time to get (re)acquainted with them - browse away on <a href="http://apps.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.rePebble.com</a>!</p><p>Enjoy the same apps and faces you loved from before, plus some new ones created since 2016 by the developer community that over the last few years <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/688f5e77d36b550009ece4cf?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never</a> <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68937d18f7ca35000951da1b?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceased</a> <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/6899705f76f9e4000ad53ad5?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to</a> <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68013ba9ef119e0009664826?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep</a> <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/67c751c6d2acb30009a3c812?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating</a> <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/67c75cbed2acb30009a3c821?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful </a><a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/5a6f1c5c0dfc329496002383?section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face</a> and <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/62304a7d2a976b000a6e73df?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fun</a>, <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68aa0fab4d6161000851b5ae?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">british</a>, <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68cf73f6e9a54400096dd548?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific</a>, <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68dea5734be9cb0009429595?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useful</a>, <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/689a51c3ad152a00098e1b66?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timely</a> apps and <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/60ec78db1342ae0152f9a409?section=watchapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing games</a> (this is an beautiful Pokemon game written for Pebble in 2023!). </p><p>All existing Pebble apps are compatible with the new watches, though some apps may not work anymore due to broken settings pages, obsolete APIs, etc. Hopefully as we ship out more new watches, some developers will re-emerge to rescue some of these apps. I’m sure new apps will also rise to fill any voids!</p><blockquote><p>What are your favourite Pebble apps and watchfaces? Share links to your favs in the comment section below! </p></blockquote><h3 id="in-partnership-with"><a href="#in-partnership-with">In partnership with Rebble<span>#</span></a></h3><p>For the last 9 years, the <a href="http://rebble.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebble Alliance</a> has been keeping the Pebble dream alive. Many of you have used their web services, <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aRUAYFN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, <a href="https://help.rebble.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful instructions</a> or <a href="https://dev-portal.rebble.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev portal</a>. I’m a huge fan - I’ve been a daily active user since 2017. Without Rebble, it’s unlikely that the Pebble community would be as in-tact as it is today. On top of that, several members of the Rebble (and ex-Pebble colleagues) were absolutely critical in helping Google open-source PebbleOS. Without the community or the OS, there is zero chance that these new watches would be possible! Thank you Rebble!</p><p>One other great thing that Rebble did was in 2017 - they archived and started hosting a copy of the Pebble Appstore, before the servers were shut down. New apps uploaded by developers since 2017 have also been popping up!  </p><p>We have partnered with Rebble to re-introduce the appstore. Their web services now power the Pebble appstore backend. New apps submitted via <a href="http://dev-portal.rebble.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev-portal.rebble.io</a> will show up on Pebble Appstore as well. </p><p>You won’t need a subscription with Rebble in order to access the Appstore. Core Devices is funding Rebble, a non-profit, directly to provide this service. You can still donate or subscribe to Rebble and support their community efforts!</p><h3 id="new-and-improved"><a href="#new-and-improved">New and Improved<span>#</span></a></h3><p>The Pebble Appstore now lives on <a href="http://apps.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.rePebble.com</a>.

It’s easy to get caught up in the ‘most hearted’ section…use this new feature at the bottom of each app page to discover hidden gems! It’s not perfect, but it’s helped me discover some awesome apps.</p><p>Additionally, we’re thinking about adding new features like:</p><ul><li>Click to try out the app in an emulator</li><li>Detecting and warning users about broken APIs and settings pages</li><li>More and better categories</li><li>Better discovery and recommendations</li><li>Highlighting less-hearted apps (give new apps a chance vs old ones with a lot of hearts)<blockquote><p>What new features should we add next?

Part of what made the experience so awesome before was the developer relations team! We unfortunately do not have the resources to recruit the whole team back (though I wish we could!). Luckily many of the great decisions they made continue to pay off. </p><p>The great news is that over the summer, we had an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com/post/3lxxgv4gguk2j">insanely productive intern</a> on our team.
