    <h1>Tell HN: Oops Upwork did it again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve read some horror stories like this, but never thought that this would happen to me.
Upwork, out of the blue, suspended my account, oh, and my payments are lost like tears in the rain.</p><p>This past Friday Upwork informed me that the were some &#34;account overlapings&#34; with an specific client, I provided Id&#39;s, answered questions, even provided long ass screens recordings of the conversations with this client, so they could check how much of a boring illustator I am.</p><p>Still they&#39;ve decided that I was doing something shady and suspended my account with no further explanation ):</p><p>I guess I&#39;m posting this to get it off my chest, but also to warn others as to how capricious and arbitrary these platforms can be.</p></div></div></div>
