    <p>Look at you; a scarf of silken cloud draping over the earthly being that nurtures you into existence. You form from beautiful circumstance. The wind that starts straight and stable is bent up and over this textured Earth. With height, there is a cooling of the moisture within and at the lens-shaped curve of this standing wave – you become – a temporal manifestation of glory and awe.</p>
<p>As a stream is the same and always different, so are you; gathered molecules of ancient water coalescing above and around a pinnacle of the land – a strange attractor of beauty in this dynamic system of now. As a lens, you bend thought and grab light into your being to focus on a single point. You accentuate the texture around you while slowly becoming a thin and delicate flower petal. Your light resonates even as you take a last breath and dissipate - you ephemeral lenticular being.</p>

There are dark, rocky textures with white glaciers and trees at the base."/></p>

The image is high contrast, black and white. The lenticular cloud is smooth like silk and contrasts with the rough and ragged structure of the mountain and ice."/></p>
