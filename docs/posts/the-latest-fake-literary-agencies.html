<p><em><strong>Fake agencies mentioned in this post:</strong></em></p>



<p><em>The Elite Scout Society</em></p>



<p>Not too long ago, I published a post with tips and techniques to help writers spot <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2023/12/15/how-to-spot-a-fake-literary-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fake literary agency</a>. This is a skill set it’s important to have, because <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/scam-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overseas scammers</a> are increasingly posing as literary agents, and some are going to elaborate lengths to create websites that, at least at first glance, look pretty convincing.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll be looking at the latest crop of fakers to come across my desk. But first, for comparison purposes…</p>



<h3>What A Real Literary Agency Looks Like </h3>



<p><em>Most or all of these will appear on its website:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>The names and biographies of member agents</li>



<li>A client list</li>



<li>Verifiable book sales, in the form of book covers, announcements, news releases, and the like</li>



<li>Clear submission guidelines</li>



<li>Information on agency history–when it was founded, by whom, etc.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>In addition:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>A real agency will have at least some internet footprint beyond its website (listings on sites like Publishers Marketplace and QueryTracker, sales announcements, mentions in the trade press, references to clients and sales, and the like). Ditto for the individual agents.</li>



<li>A real agency is highly unlikely to email or phone you out of the blue with an offer of representation or a claim that a traditional publisher is interested in your work (real agents don’t pre-shop manuscripts for authors they don’t represent).</li>



<li>A real agency will not require you to pay anything or buy anything as a condition of representation or publication. Other than the agent’s commission, there should never be a cost associated with rights acquisition.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Unmasking the Fakers</h3>



<p><strong>The Elite Scout Society</strong></p>



<p>The Elite Scout Society is brand new, with a web domain registered just 87 days ago as of this writing (it’s always a good idea to check domain registration dates; you can do so using a free resource like <a href="https://who.is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a>). Its attractive <a href="https://www.literaryscouts.live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> appears to include at least some of what you’d expect to see from a reputable agency: covers of published books, agent photos/bios, even some news of recent acquisitions.</p>



<p>As with any scam, however, the deception quickly unravels when you start to dig. The <a href="https://www.literaryscouts.live/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">About page</a> claims the agency started up in 2020, which doesn’t exactly jibe with the May 2024 domain registration. Even more implausible, Elite appears to be <a href="https://www.literaryscouts.live/books" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming credit</a> for Candace Bushnell’s <em>Sex and the City</em>, which was published in 1996 (maybe they’re time travelers?). There are no submission guidelines, just a contact email address.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.literaryscouts.live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster of improbably hot agents</a> also falls apart on closer scrutiny. Not only do their names produce zero search results–which would not be the case if they really had the accomplishments and years of experience their bios claim–their photos are…well, see for yourself. This is “Jim McCarthy” (a real agent, by the way, whose name Elite has falsely appropriated). Check out his mutant hands (a telltale AI-generated image glitch).</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="693" height="768" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Elite-Scout-agent-photo.png" alt="Photo of fake agent &#34;Jim McCarthy&#34;, with the deformed hands  that often signal an AI-generated image" srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Elite-Scout-agent-photo.png 693w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Elite-Scout-agent-photo-271x300.png 271w " sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"/></figure></div>


<p>As for agent Michelle Spahr, she is associated not just with Elite Scout Society but with scammer Leap Write Literary Agency, which among other things impersonates publishers with fake offers involving large upfront fees. Here’s an “invitation” from Celadon Books, sent by Michelle on behalf of Elite but using her Leap Write email address:</p>


<div>

<p><strong>UPDATE 9/9/24:</strong> Whomp whomp. The Elite Scout Society website has vanished. </p>



<p><strong>ImplicitPress Literary Agency</strong></p>



<p>ImplicitPress Literary Agency registered its domain name on June 10, 2024. Its website, which originally looked like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240809034345/https://www.implicitpressliteraryagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> and included false claims about time in business as well as a team of fake agents with stock or AI-altered photos, is now a <a href="https://www.implicitpressliteraryagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placeholder</a>, but it is still sending out solicitations like this one:</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="577" height="1024" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-Literary-solicitation-577x1024.png" alt="ImplicitPress Literary Agency solicitation, claiming the author&#39;s book has been &#34;pre-qualified for acquisition&#34; and promising $250,000-350,000 &#34;acquisition offers&#34; plus a 5% royalty" srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-Literary-solicitation-577x1024.png 577w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-Literary-solicitation-169x300.png 169w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-Literary-solicitation.png 703w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px"/></figure></div>


<p>The author who was targeted with this solicitation was asked to supply a variety of necessary “documents”; note #5, which is what this scam is hoping to sell (no publisher requires or cares about a book trailer):</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="816" height="321" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-literary-solicitation-2.png" alt="&#34;Documents&#34; requested by ImplicitPress: manuscript, book cover, author bio, Library of Congress number,  book trailer, book synopsis and query letter &#34;If you dont [sic] have these, our team can work on the leg work with minimal cost&#34;" srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-literary-solicitation-2.png 816w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-literary-solicitation-2-300x118.png 300w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ImplicitPress-literary-solicitation-2-768x302.png 768w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"/></figure></div>


<p>As incentive to buy, the author also received a fake email supposedly from PRH executive Manuel Sansigre (who really does work at PRH but who, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelsansigre/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chief Financial Officer</a>. would not be involved in book acquisition), encouraging them to “complete the documents today”. </p>



<p><strong>Judith Carter Literary</strong></p>



<p>In the past month I’ve seen a number of identical solicitations from <a href="https://judithcarterliterary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judith Carter Literary</a>.</p>

<p>Whoever is behind this one has taken some trouble to make the enterprise look legit, giving “Judith” a <a href="https://www.publishersmarketplace.com/members/JudithCarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Publishers Marketplace listing</a> (albeit with a number of typos) and adorning “her” website with book covers, claims of relationships with co-agents overseas, a detailed submissions page, and an <a href="https://judithcarterliterary.com/abouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">About Us page</a> with an impressive bio of “Judith” and even, in a final touch of fake verisimilitude, a warning about scams.</p>



<p>However. </p>



<p>The books pictured on the site are all self- or vanity-published–not a single traditional publisher among them. Not, in other words, what you’d expect from a real literary agent. As for “Judith’s” bio…it claims the agency was founded in 2018, which contradicts not just the claim on PM of eight years in business, but the agency’s web domain registration, which wasn’t made until January of 2024. And not only is is there no Judith Carter on <a href="https://aalitagents.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Board of the AALA</a>, as the bio claims…there isn’t even a Judith Carter who’s a member.</p>


<div>

<p>I haven’t heard from anyone who went all the way down the rabbit hole on this one, so I don’t know what the money demand is. But I’m betting there is one.</p>



<p><strong>Literary Agents Association</strong></p>



<p>Per its July 29 <a href="https://www.wdtn.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/731309028/literary-agents-association-partners-with-leading-publishing-houses-to-boost-author-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, this “renowned” agency, founded in 2017, boasts “strong relationships with top publishing houses.” Not just domestic ones, either: it “operates on a global scale, bringing together freelance literary agents and authors from all corners of the world.” </p>



<p>Impressive! Well, not so much. Its (poorly formatted) <a href="https://literaryacademia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> shows no evidence of achievement: no client list, no sales reports, and a <a href="https://literaryacademia.com/members-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directory of agent “members”</a> whose silly videos practically scream “hired from Fiverr”. There are no submission guidelines.</p>



<p>Unusually, the claimed founding date checks out: LAA’s web domain, literaryacademia.com, was indeed registered in 2017. However, until at least mid-2023, what resided at that domain wasn’t a literary agency–even a pretend one–but a <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2022/01/24/how-to-spot-a-ghostwriting-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghostwriting/editing/marketing scam</a> called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230323153316/https://literaryacademia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Literary Academia</a> (link courtesy of the Wayback Machine, which can be a useful way of checking websites’ evolution). Subsequently, Literary Academia seems to have vanished, and until sometime in July the website looked like this:</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="644" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Literary-Academia-Sorry-1024x644.png" alt="SORRY! message indicating that the website once resident at the literaryacademia.com URL no longer exists" srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Literary-Academia-Sorry-1024x644.png 1024w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Literary-Academia-Sorry-300x189.png 300w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Literary-Academia-Sorry-768x483.png 768w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Literary-Academia-Sorry.png 1092w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div>


<p>There’s a lot of competition in the ghostwriting scam space these days; maybe the Literary Academia folks decided to try a new angle. Or maybe a different fraudster took over the URL. It really doesn’t matter: it’s a scam regardless of who is running it.</p>



<p><strong>Mushens &amp; Churchill Literary Agents</strong></p>



<p>This is one of the more elaborate frauds. It’s partially an impersonation scam; Juliet Mushens of the very real <a href="https://www.mushens-entertainment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushens Entertainment</a> contacted me to confirm the misuse of her name. </p>



<p>Here’s the kind of solicitation it sends out:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="852" height="813" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mushens-solicitation.png" alt="Solicitation from Mushens &amp; Churchill:

I hope this correspondence finds you in good health.

 I am Damon Green, a leading literary agent from Mushens and Churchill Literary. Our agency selects up to ten self-published authors every quarter whose books exhibit exceptional potential but have not made considerable progress under their current self-publishing companies.

 I want to offer my representation services to you to secure a traditional publishing company to acquire your book. As your representative, I will assess various factors to determine the most suitable publishing company regarding distribution and initial royalty checks. I will choose a traditional publishing company that will not acquire a hundred percent of your rights but only the right to market and distribute the book.

This is an opportunity for your book to receive the recognition it deserves. My representation services aim to maximize its potential by securing a traditional publishing company that will communicate the message effectively and efficiently to your readers and into the hands of our target investors.

 Please note that there are requirements that must be met during my representation. Firstly, your updated author bio should contain all recent credentials, other published books, and information that will sell you as an author, such as your achievements in this industry. Secondly, traditional publishers must have an International Literary Registration Seal and Bookstore Access Code to distribute your book to their global booksellers. Lastly, a query letter will be submitted, serving as your application. The letter will play a vital role in assessing how to further the manuscript to ensure that any investment made in your book will be accurate and efficient.

 I want to set proper expectations for this journey. Just so you know, we cannot promise the moon and the stars, but we both share a mutual interest in the book to maximize its potential.

 If you are interested, please respond to this email with your updated author bio/website and the best number to reach you at.

 If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I look forward to hearing back from you." srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mushens-solicitation.png 852w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mushens-solicitation-300x286.png 300w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mushens-solicitation-768x733.png 768w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px"/></figure>



<p>(I can’t help wondering who approved that…unfortunate abbreviation.)</p>



<p>The MCLit <a href="https://mclit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> is more professional-looking than some of the examples above: attractively formatted and featuring the covers of multiple traditionally-published books. Look closer, though, and you’ll see that the selection is a bit thin, with many of the same books repeated across three different pages. And double-checking exposes the falsehoods: for example, it would be uh, difficult for an agency that did not exist before February 2024 (the date of its domain registration) to have sold a book like Samantha Silva’s <em>Love and Fury</em>, published in 2021; and a websearch easily confirms that V.E. Schwab, whose <em>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em> is included on the <a href="https://mclit.org/recent-upcoming-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent &amp; Upcoming Titles page</a>, is in fact represented by the Waxman Agency (not to mention, a book published in 2020 is neither recent nor upcoming).</p>



<p>MCLit’s <a href="https://mclit.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">About page</a> includes a bunch of vague claims but no details that could verify them (always at least a caution sign, even where you’re not dealing with an outright scam) and the agency has zero internet presence beyond its own website (well, other than my <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/scam-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overseas Scams List</a>). As noted above, this is not the result you should expect from a websearch of an established agency.</p>



<p>Although I haven’t yet heard from anyone who has actually signed up with MCLit, and therefore don’t know what they’re charging, the fifth paragraph of the solicitation above gives away what they’re selling: an “International Literary Registration Seal and Bookstore Access Code”. Both of these are <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2024/04/05/the-scam-of-book-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely bogus items</a> that scammers have invented to enable them to drain writers’ bank accounts. </p>



<p><strong>Story Arc Literary Groups</strong></p>



<p>Story Arc Literary Groups employs an approach common to many fake literary agency scams: promising to work on commission only, with no other fees due (note especially paragraph 5, which helpfully explains that “a reputable literary agent should not charge upfront fees”): </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="866" height="956" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Story-Arc-solicitation.png" alt="Solicitation from Mary Russo of Story Arc Literary Groups: 

I hope this email reaches you in excellent health and good spirits.

 I&#39;m reaching out to you as Mary Russo, an independent literary agent representing a distinguished New York-based literary agency. I want to clarify that my role specifically entails serving as a literary agent, distinct from a publishing or marketing agent. My responsibilities involve representing writers and their literary works, establishing connections with major publishing houses, film organizations, and prominent book retailers, and facilitating the negotiation and sale of book deals on your behalf.

 As an independent literary agent, I act as an intermediary between you and potential publishers. Leveraging my contacts, experience, and market knowledge, I pitch your book to editors seeking new authors and genres, while also managing the business aspects of publishing such as contracts, royalties, rights, and marketing.

My primary objective is to secure a contract for you, operating within a commission-based framework. The commission typically ranges from 10-20% for domestic contracts and can reach up to 30% for international agreements. Therefore, my primary aim is to ensure that your work possesses the desired qualities sought by traditional publishers and influential figures in the movie industry, thereby minimizing the likelihood of rejection post-submission and saving us valuable time and effort. It&#39;s important to note that there are no upfront fees for the services I provide; instead, the commission is deducted from your earnings at a later stage.

It&#39;s crucial to understand that if, despite our best efforts, we are unable to sell your book, we do not receive any compensation for our services. A reputable literary agent should not charge upfront fees and should prioritize the author&#39;s success over making money from services rendered.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to delve deeper into your vision, assessing whether our aspirations and strategies align seamlessly with your current book and any future projects you may have in mind.

Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss your book and any other literary endeavors you may wish to explore." srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Story-Arc-solicitation.png 866w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Story-Arc-solicitation-272x300.png 272w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Story-Arc-solicitation-768x848.png 768w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"/></figure>



<p>The aim of such solicitations, however, is always money, and writers who sign up with Story Arc soon discover this. In order for Story Arc to successfully pitch a book to traditional publishers, authors are told they must first “re-license” their book (a requirement that, as I’ve explained in <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2024/04/05/the-scam-of-book-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another blog post</a>, is completely fictional). As is typical for this type of scam, they’re referred to a “trusted” company to perform the service–in this case, an outfit called CreativeIP. The price tag: $5,000.</p>

<p>Like other fake agencies discussed in this post, Story Arc’s <a href="https://storyarcliterarygroups.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> makes some stabs at verisimilitude that fall apart under scrutiny, including <a href="https://storyarcliterarygroups.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false claims</a> to have repped traditionally-published books (including many, such as Mark Z. Danielewski’s <em>House of Leaves</em> and Scott Turow’s <em>Presumed Innocent</em>, whose pub dates substantially precede Story Arc’s March 2024 domain registration) and <a href="https://storyarcliterarygroups.com/about/">a roster of “agents”</a> whose names generate no results on a websearch, and whose photos are lightly altered images downloaded from Freepik. Here’s Mary Russo, for example (I used Google Image Search to find the match).</p>

<p><strong>Zenith Literary</strong></p>



<p>Typical of fake literary agency scams, Zenith Literary is an aggressive solicitor.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zenith-literary-solicitation-698x1024.png" alt="Solicitation from &#34;agent Veronika Young of Zenith Literary:

 We have conducted an initial assessment of your book and shared it with our partners across various sectors, including Bookstores, Traditional Publishers, and Movie Producers. I am pleased to inform you that several of them have expressed significant interest in your work. Your book has received favorable reviews, with a rating of 8.87 out of 10, considering both its Market Viability and Readability. The only concern that has arisen is that your book has yet to establish a significant presence in the market, particularly in terms of sales distribution. We are reaching out to you to discuss these concerns and explore potential strategies for addressing them. Our primary objective is to bridge the gap and foster potential collaborations with key decision-makers in these industries.

Zenith Literary Agency is an independent literary representation agency that directly collaborates with Bookstore Owners and Movie Producers. Our vision is rooted in the belief that exceptional literary works should promote the welfare of aspiring and established authors alike, fostering a vibrant, dynamic, and ultimately successful presence in the world of publishing.

What are the advantages of partnering with a literary agent?

Having a literary agent can truly propel the success of your book and elevate your status as a professional writer. Your agent can capture the attention of publishers and negotiate contracts to secure you a favorable book deal.

Staying Informed about Market Trends

 We remain well-informed about the ever-evolving trends in the book publishing landscape. This industry is constantly shaped by technological advancements, cultural shifts, and even the latest developments in Hollywood. We are attuned to current book-to-film trends and understand what book editors are seeking in today&#39;s market.

 As your literary representative, we will serve as your compass in the complex publishing world. We can assist you at every stage, from crafting your query letter and submission package to establishing your book&#39;s presence in the global market.

Securing the Best Opportunities

 Our role is to secure the best opportunities for you. We have a keen understanding of the fluctuating book market and are well-equipped to negotiate a more favorable book advance than you might secure independently.

 Our Goals:

     Facilitate placement of your book in Physical Bookstores
    Present your book to Traditional Publisher scouts for consideration
    If your book exhibits potential for adaptation into a film, we can pitch it to acquisition managers in Movie Production companies.

I am eager to learn more about the current status of your book in order to better position myself as your Literary Manager. I kindly propose that we schedule a meeting to discuss how we can work together to make a meaningful impact on your writing career.

 Choose representation, make a difference." srcset="https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zenith-literary-solicitation-698x1024.png 698w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zenith-literary-solicitation-204x300.png 204w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zenith-literary-solicitation-768x1127.png 768w , https://149686966.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zenith-literary-solicitation.png 869w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px"/></figure>



<p>One writer who responded to this solicitation was told that in order to snag a traditional publisher’s interest, they needed to gather various “action items”, including “ten editorial reviews and endorsements” (hint: reviews and endorsements are nice, but they are absolutely not required by traditional publishers). To obtain these, the writer was referred to Verse Bound Solutions, a company with no apparent existence beyond a <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/wy/verse-bound-solutions-llc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wyoming business registration</a> but active enough to phone the author and offer them ten book reviews for $3,000.</p>



<p>Like others mentioned in this post, Zenith Literary’s website looks good at a glance, but closer examination exposes the usual range of fake agency lies: <a href="https://www.zenithliterary.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false claims to represent traditionally published books</a> (easily confirmed by comparing publication dates with Zenith’s March 2024 domain registration), non-working links (especially in the footer), and “agents” with zero web presence and fake bios that in some cases have been plagiarized from the bios of real agents (phrase search is your friend: compare, for example, the bio of “<a href="https://www.zenithliterary.com/agents/d-lin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lin</a>” with the first paragraph of the <a href="https://www.zenithliterary.com/agents/d-lin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bio of Folio Literary’s Sonali Chanchari</a>).</p>



<p>Zenith’s agent bios were once accompanied by equally fake photos, but these have been removed, possibly as a result of some <a href="https://x.com/pcarterwriter/status/1776076482550370780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vigorous social media discussion</a> back in April, when Zenith’s “Gideon Carlisle” was soliciting submissions on Xitter.</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>The aim of this post isn’t to encourage you to mistrust all literary agencies…just those that contact you out of the blue, rather than in response to your own query or submission. As I’ve said ad nauseam, and apparently can’t say too often judging by the volume of questions I receive, <em>solicitation is one of the first and most common signs of a scam these days</em>. </p>



<p>Is out-of-the-blue contact <em>always</em> fraudulent? No. Literary agents do sometimes reach out to authors to express interest in their work. But that’s rare. And solicitation scams are so overwhelmingly prevalent that you really are safest if you proceed from a standpoint of extreme skepticism.</p>



<p>I hope this post will help with that, by giving you a sense of what to investigate, and how, in order to unveil a potential deception. </p>
