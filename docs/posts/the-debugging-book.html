<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><p><strong>Welcome to &#34;The Debugging Book&#34;!</strong> 
Software has bugs, and finding bugs can involve lots of effort.  This book addresses this problem by <em>automating</em> software debugging, specifically by <em>locating errors and their causes automatically</em>.  Recent years have seen the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in automated software debugging.  They now are mature enough to be assembled in a book – even with executable code.

<div><h2 id="A-Textbook-for-Paper,-Screen,-and-Keyboard">A Textbook for Paper, Screen, and Keyboard<a href="#A-Textbook-for-Paper,-Screen,-and-Keyboard">¶</a></h2><p>You can use this book in four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can <strong>read chapters in your browser</strong>.  Check out the list of chapters in the menu above, or start right away with the <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Intro_Debugging.html">introduction to debugging</a> or <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Debugger.html">how debuggers work</a>.  All code is available for download.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can <strong>interact with chapters as Jupyter Notebooks</strong> (beta).  This allows you to edit and extend the code, experimenting <em>live in your browser.</em>  Simply select &#34;Resources → Edit as Notebook&#34; at the top of each chapter. <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/uds-se/debuggingbook/HEAD?labpath=docs/notebooks/Debugger.ipynb" target="_blank">Try interacting with the introduction to interactive debuggers.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can <strong>use the code in your own projects</strong>.  You can download the code as Python programs; simply select &#34;Resources → Download Code&#34; for one chapter or &#34;Resources → All Code&#34; for all chapters.  These code files can be executed, yielding (hopefully) the same results as the notebooks.  Once the book is out of beta, you can also <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Importing.html">install the Python package</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can <strong>present chapters as slides</strong>.  This allows for presenting the material in lectures.  Just select &#34;Resources → View slides&#34; at the top of each chapter. <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/slides/Debugger.slides.html" target="_blank">Try viewing the slides for how debuggers work.</a></p>

<div><h4 id="Why-does-it-take-so-long-to-start-an-interactive-notebook?">Why does it take so long to start an interactive notebook?<a href="#Why-does-it-take-so-long-to-start-an-interactive-notebook?">¶</a></h4><p>The interactive notebook uses the <a href="https://mybinder.org">mybinder.org</a> service, which runs notebooks on their own servers.  Starting Jupyter through mybinder.org normally takes about 30 seconds, depending on your Internet connection. If, however, you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment, which will take a few minutes.  Reload the page occasionally.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div><h4 id="The-interactive-notebook-does-not-work!">The interactive notebook does not work!<a href="#The-interactive-notebook-does-not-work!">¶</a></h4><p>mybinder.org imposes a <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guidelines.html">limit of 100 concurrent users for a repository</a>.  Also, as listed on the <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reliability.html">mybinder.org status and reliability page</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>As mybinder.org is a research pilot project, the main goal for the project is to understand usage patterns and workloads for future project evolution. While we strive for site reliability and availability, we want our users to understand the intent of this service is research and we offer no guarantees of its performance in mission critical uses.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>There are alternatives to mybinder.org; see below.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><h4 id="Do-I-have-alternatives-to-the-interactive-notebook?">Do I have alternatives to the interactive notebook?<a href="#Do-I-have-alternatives-to-the-interactive-notebook?">¶</a></h4><p>If mybinder.org does not work or match your needs, you have a number of alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Download the Python code</strong> (using the menu at the top) and edit and run it in your favorite environment.  This is easy to do and does not require lots of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Download the Jupyter Notebooks</strong> (using the menu at the top) and open them in Jupyter.  Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/">how to install jupyter notebook on your machine</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For details, see our article on <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Importing.html">Using Debuggingbook Code in your own Programs</a>.</p>
<p>As another alternative, you can also <strong>use our Docker images</strong> (experimental). <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Install Docker</a> and then run</p>

<pre><code>    $ docker pull zeller24/debuggingbook
    $ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 zeller24/debuggingbook</code></pre>
<p>and then in your Web browser, open the URL (<code>http://127.0.0.1/...</code> or <code>http://localhost/...</code>) given in the console output.
This should give you the same environment as in mybinder.org.</p>
<p>If you want to create your own Docker images, use our <a href="https://github.com/uds-se/debuggingbook/blob/master/binder/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> as a starting point.</p>

<div><h4 id="Can-I-run-the-code-on-my-Windows-machine?">Can I run the code on my Windows machine?<a href="#Can-I-run-the-code-on-my-Windows-machine?">¶</a></h4><p>We try to keep the code as general as possible, but occasionally, when we interact with the operating system, we assume a Unix-like environment (because that is what Binder provides).  To run these examples on your own Windows machine, you can install a Linux VM or a <a href="https://github.com/uds-se/debuggingbook/blob/master/deploy/README.md">Docker environment</a>.</p>

If you&#39;d like to host a <a href="http://jupyter.org/hub">JupyterHub</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub">BinderHub</a> instance for the public, please <em>do so</em> and let us know.</p>

<div><h4 id="Do-your-techniques-apply-to-Python-programs-only?-How-about-C-code?">Do your techniques apply to Python programs only? How about C code?<a href="#Do-your-techniques-apply-to-Python-programs-only?-How-about-C-code?">¶</a></h4><p>We use Python to implement our tools and techniques because we can get things done <em>quickly.</em> Building an <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Debugger.html">interactive debugger</a> in Python is less than 100 lines of code and took us 2-3 days; doing the same for C is tens of thousands of lines and a year-long project. Instrumenting code, say for <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Slicer.html">dynamic slicing</a>, gets us savings of similar magnitude. Also, Python code allows us (and you) to focus on the main concepts, rather than implementation details that are out of place in a textbook.</p>
<p>Having said this, many of the techniques in this book can also be applied to C and other code. This is notably true for <em>black-box</em> techniques such as <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/DeltaDebugger.html">reducing inputs</a> or <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/ChangeDebugger.html">changes</a> or <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/DDSetDebugger.html">generalizers</a>; these are all language-agnostic. Tools related to the debugging process such as <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Tracking.html">bug tracking</a> or <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/ChangeCounter.html">mining repositories</a> are language-agnostic as well. Finally, in all chapters, we provide pointers to implementations in and for other languages, for instance for <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Assertions.html">assertions</a> or <a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Repairer.html">program repair</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Initially, we used the slides and code and did <em>live coding</em> in lectures to illustrate how a technique works.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, the goal of the book is to be completely self-contained; that is, it should work without additional support.  Hence, we now give out completed chapters to students in a <em>flipped classroom</em> setting, with the students working on the notebooks at their leisure.  We would meet in the classroom (or in Zoom) to discuss experiences with past notebooks and discuss future notebooks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have the students work on exercises from the book or work on larger (automated debugging) projects.  We also have students who use the book as a base for their research; indeed, it is very easy to prototype in Python for Python.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When running a course, <a href="#Troubleshooting">do not rely on mybinder.org</a> – it will not provide sufficient resources for a larger group of students.  Instead, <a href="#Do-I-have-alternatives-to-the-interactive-notebook?">install and run your own hub.</a></p>
