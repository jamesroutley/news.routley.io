      <p>Since October, I’ve been working at <a href="https://feenk.com">feenk</a> as a “DX crafter”—DX standing for “Developer Experience”. That means that I build tools, and help people and companies reason about their assets and themselves.</p>
<p>But mostly I just have a grand old time working on GT, the Glamorous Toolkit, which is one of the most exciting pieces of technology I know of.</p>
<p>And that’s also why I haven’t talked about this so publicly earlier—I wanted to at least record a demo of it to make sure everyone understands why I switched gears a little bit.</p>
<p>So here it is. It’s unscripted and not the most flashy, but maybe it’ll give you a glimpse of why I’m excited about the Toolkit.</p>

<p>PS: if the Git workflow at the end seems a little unrefined still, that’s entirely because of me! I’m working on it!</p>
