    <h1>Digital Archivists: Protecting Public Data from Erasure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Digital Archivists Are Saving Public Information from the Memory Hole"><div><p>In the three decades since <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/brewster-kahle-on-whats-next-for-the-decentralized-web-movement" target="_self">Brewster Kahle</a> spun up the nonprofit <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet">Internet</a> Archive’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, it has scaled up to include government websites and datasets—many of which are essential to the engineering and scientific communities. U.S. government agencies like the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-energy">Department of Energy</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> are critical sources of research data, technical specifications, and standards documentation in pretty much every area where <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>’s audience works—AI &amp; computer science, biomedical devices, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-and-energy">power and energy</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>, telecommunications…the list goes on.</p><p>Access to that governmental data directly affects the reproducibility of experiments, the validation of models, and the integrity of the scholarly record. </p><p>So what happens if an entire dataset vanishes? Among other things, it can invalidate years of research built upon that foundation. </p><p>Until recently, wholesale deletion of data has been rare. In the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>, presidential transitions typically involve some changes to government websites to reflect new policy priorities. And after 9/11, the George W. Bush administration removed “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7496067&amp;page=1#:~:text=Unclassified%20military%20after%2Daction%20reports%2C%20an%20FAA%20database,amid%20fears%20that%20terrorists%20might%20find%20information" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of bytes</a>” of information from government sites for security reasons as well as hundreds of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> documents and “tens of thousands” of <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulation Commission</a> files. </p><p>The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obama">Obama</a> and Biden administrations likewise made changes to government websites but didn’t engage in large-scale removal of Web pages or datasets. Obama, in fact, expanded public access to government data in 2009 by launching <a href="http://data.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>, whose stated mission is in part “to unleash the power of government open data to inform decisions by the public and policymakers.”</p><p> During President Donald J. Trump’s first term, researchers at the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246450" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that some government sites became inaccessible, and the phrase “climate change” was purged from several government Web pages.</p><p>Access to governmental data directly affects the reproducibility of experiments, the validation of models, and the integrity of the scholarly record.</p><p>The second term has been different. In February, a few weeks after Trump was sworn in for his second term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>The New York Times</em></em> reported</a> that his administration took down more than 8,000 Web pages and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/databases">databases</a>. Many of those pages have since reappeared, but some of the restored pages and files have had changes, including the erasure of <a href="https://grist.org/language/trump-delete-climate-change-words-resilience-order/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terms like “climate change” (again) and “clean energy,”</a><em><em>Grist</em></em> reports. These moves have faced multiple court challenges; on 11 February, for instance, a federal judge ordered that public access to Web pages and datasets belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration be restored. </p><p>In our April <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/internet-archive-saving-us-data" target="_blank">issue</a>, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> Assistant Editor Gwendolyn Rak <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/internet-archive-saving-us-data" target="_self">reports</a> on efforts to preserve public access to information. In addition to the ongoing work at the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-archive">Internet Archive</a>, she describes how archivists at the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School</a> amassed a copy of the 16-terabyte <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/02/06/announcing-data-gov-archive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">archive of Data.gov,</a> which includes more than 311,000 public datasets. That copied archive is being updated daily with new data hoovered up via automated queries to application <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> interfaces (APIs). </p><p>Archivists are the guardians of memory. We depend on them to help us stay in touch with our history, maintain our knowledge base, and provide context, allowing us to understand how we came to be where we are and to light the way forward. In the fields of science, engineering, and medicine, where today’s innovations stand on the shoulders of yesterday’s discoveries, these digital preservationists ensure that the circuit of human knowledge remains unbroken.</p><p><em>This article appears in the April 2025 print issue as “Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe.”</em></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This post was revised to match the print version.</em></p></div></div></div>
