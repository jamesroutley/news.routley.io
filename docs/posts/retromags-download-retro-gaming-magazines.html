	<strong><span>Notice to publishers and content owners</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<span>This site is set up to digitally preserve video game magazines from 10 years ago and earlier. The rules vary on a case-by-case basis. We do this because issues of these magazines are not readily available from publishers/content owners. While we don’t have legal permission, we operate in a way where we do not release anything that will reduce any potential income for you, or magazines that are available from you, nor do we release scans that are of a quality that may reflect poorly on you. So far this has worked, with several publishers/content owners basically ignoring our existence. However, if you wish that we do not make content that you legally have ownership of available on this site, <strong><a href="https://www.retromags.com/contact/" rel="">just let us know</a></strong> and we will remove it. While we would prefer permission, we will fully oblige with your wishes concerning your content. This is a hobby we do out of passion and love for the video game magazines of yesterday, and not worth legal battles of any kind.</span>
