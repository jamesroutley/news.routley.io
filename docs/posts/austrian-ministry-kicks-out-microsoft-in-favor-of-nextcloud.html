            <p>European governments have been steadily moving away from reliance on foreign tech offerings, driven largely by concerns over data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Countries like <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/schleswig-holstein-email-system-migration/">Germany</a> and <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/denmark-set-to-replace-microsoft/">Denmark</a> have already taken steps to reduce their dependence on Microsoft and other foreign cloud providers, opting instead for open source alternatives that keep sensitive data within their borders.</p><p>And, recently, Austria has shown up as another player in this space. Last month, the Austrian Armed Forces <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/austrian-forces-ditch-microsoft-office/">completed a migration of 16,000 workstations</a> from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice.</p><p>Now, another Austrian government body has joined the <em>Ditch Microsoft</em> club.</p><h2 id="a-welcome-move">A Welcome Move</h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrCn_1T9oFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs takes decisive steps towards digital sovereignty"></iframe><figcaption><p><i><em>The video is in German with hard-coded English subtitles.</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Announced</a> at the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/enterprise-day-copenhagen-2025/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Nextcloud Enterprise Day Copenhagen 2025 event</a>, Austria&#39;s Federal Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, or <a href="https://www.bmwet.gv.at/en.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">BMWET</a> for short, <strong>has migrated 1,200 employees to Nextcloud</strong> for internal collaboration and secure data storage.</p><p>The ministry is now operating on Austrian-controlled infrastructure, moving away from foreign cloud providers for handling sensitive government data. The <strong>project went from proof of concept to full deployment in just four months</strong>, an uncommonly fast timeline for a public sector IT migration of this scale.</p><p>The implementation was carried out in partnership with <a href="https://atos.net/de-at/austria?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Atos Austria</a>, which worked alongside Nextcloud&#39;s team to ensure the platform met the ministry&#39;s legal, technical, and organizational requirements.</p><h2 id="how-was-it-done">How Was it Done?</h2><p>The ministry implemented <strong>a hybrid setup</strong> rather than a complete <em>rip-and-replace</em> approach. At the time this project began, BMWET was already in the process of adopting <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft 365</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Teams</a>, so a full reversal wasn&#39;t feasable.</p><p>Instead, Nextcloud now handles all internal collaboration and secure data management, while <strong>Microsoft Teams remains available</strong> specifically for external meetings (<em>read: for people who haven&#39;t moved away from Teams</em>).</p><p>The ministry also worked with Nextcloud partner <a href="https://sendent.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Sendent</a> to integrate with Outlook, allowing employees to continue using familiar email and calendar workflows.</p><p><strong>As for the reasoning behind this move</strong>, it was prompted by a risk analysis that showed foreign cloud services failed to meet the ministry&#39;s privacy requirements, particularly regarding <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng?ref=news.itsfoss.com">GDPR</a> compliance and the upcoming <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive?ref=news.itsfoss.com">NIS2</a> directive.</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, BMWET invested heavily in preparing its workforce. The ministry ran an extensive information campaign that included training sessions, instructional videos, and a detailed internal wiki covering everything employees needed to know about the new platform. </p><p>The <strong>gradual rollout approach meant that employees had time to adjust</strong> rather than being thrown into a completely new system overnight. According to Martin Ollrom, BMWET&#39;s CIO, the preparation paid off. The response from employees has been quite positive, with minimal disruption to daily work.</p><p>During the announcement of this move, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianzinnagl/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Florian Zinnagl</a>, the CISO of BMWET, added that:</p><blockquote>We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data – from employees, companies and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That’s why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.</blockquote><p><strong>Suggested Read </strong>📖</p><figure><a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/austrian-forces-ditch-microsoft-office/"><div><p>Austria’s Armed Forces Gets Rid of Microsoft Office (Mostly) for LibreOffice</p><p>The Austrian military prioritizes independence over convenience.</p><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/icon/android-chrome-192x192-308.png" alt=""/><span>Sourav Rudra</span></p></div><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/thumbnail/austrian-army-switches-to-libreoffice.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure>
