  <p>Beyond their everyday chat capabilities, Large Language Models are increasingly being used to make decisions in sensitive domains like hiring, health, law, and civic engagement. The exact mechanics of how we use these models in such scenarios is vital. There are many ways to have LLMs make decisions, including A/B decision-making, ranking, classification, &#34;panels&#34; of judges, etc. but every single method is individually fragile and subject to measurement biases that are rarely discussed.</p><p>Engineers composing prompts often rely on anecdotes and untested folklore. We call it &#39;prompt-engineering&#39;: the practice of composing prompts to coax precisely the outputs we desire. However, it might be described better as &#39;playing&#39; than &#39;engineering&#39;. There are popular templates and tropes, but few are well proven. You&#39;ll often see high level instructions like &#34;you are an [adjective] [role]&#34;, e.g. &#34;you are an impartial judge&#34;. Throw in a superlative here and there, maybe some ALL-CAPS and a few examples, run it a couple of times, observe it working, and then stamp &#39;shipped&#39;. In doing all of this, there is an implicit buy-in into a premise that LLMs are sufficiently predictable when asked &#39;just right&#39; for a limited set of outputs, a premise that ongoing research continues to challenge [3].</p><p>But even if you give an LLM just two options of equal merit and ask it for the best, it will tilt one way or the other. Or give it an essay to judge according to a few criteria, and you will see its score subtly shift by how we pose the question. Filtering and classification tasks too, like detecting toxicity or cyber-bullying, are highly fragile. Ranking CVs from job applicants is a famously hard problem fraught with social biases. We know this, but rarely do we consider the very ‘posing of the problem’ to an AI to be a massive lever of bias as well.</p><p>Such unpredictability is rare in computation, but it&#39;s very similar to human cognition. LLMs consistently exhibit vulnerabilities and cognitive biases like our own [4, 5, 6, 7], including serial position, framing, and anchoring. This is observable; we&#39;ve conducted many tests on &#39;frontier&#39; models from Google, Mistral, Microsoft, X, Anthropic and OpenAI and have seen consistent expression of biases in judgement contexts, from small-parameter to larger parameter reasoning models alike:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pairwise Choice - Positional &amp; Labeling Biases</strong>: When tasked with choosing between &#39;Response A&#39; and &#39;Response B&#39; over numerous trials, LLMs tended to select &#39;Response B&#39; approximately 60% - 69% of the time (our suite&#39;s aggregated data across 8 models showed &#39;Response B&#39; preferred ~61% of the time). This significant deviation from random choice [1] highlights a volatile positional preference. Minor changes in prompt phrasing or label nature (e.g., &#39;Response A/B&#39; vs. &#39;(A)/(B)&#39;) can swing this preference by 5-10 percentage points or more. While abstract, non-sequential labels (e.g., &#39;ID_123&#39; or &#39;❖&#39;) diminished this bias by 4-7 percentage points in our tests, a notable preference often remained, underscoring the critical impact of labeling strategy [1]. This mirrors human cognitive biases where order and labelling effects are well-documented [6, 7].</p></li><li><p><strong>Rubric-Based Scoring - Order &amp; Context Effects</strong>: When scoring items against multiple criteria (e.g., Clarity, Logic, Conciseness), the order of presentation significantly alters results. Our aggregated data showed a criterion like &#39;Clarity&#39; decreasing in its average score by approximately 3.5% when evaluated last versus earlier, indicating a &#39;recency bias&#39; [4]. Furthermore, the evaluation context (holistic vs. isolated criteria) dramatically impacts scores, though variably. For instance, one model scored an argument&#39;s &#39;Clarity&#39; at 5.0/5 in isolation but 4.0/5 when scored holistically with other criteria for the same item—a full-point drop. Generally, holistic evaluation tends to dilute scores for negative traits (e.g., &#34;sexism&#34; from other rubrics) compared to isolated evaluation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale Interpretation &amp; Negative Trait Biases</strong>: LLMs often bring a prior that &#34;higher is better&#34; from training data (e.g., 5/5 stars = good). This clashes with tasks requiring scoring of negative traits (toxicity, sexism) on ascending scales where &#34;higher&#34; means &#34;worse.&#34; This can lead to models compressing scores towards the middle or low end, understating severity (e.g., labeling &#34;Very High&#34; toxicity as &#34;Moderate&#34;) [8]. The scale format itself is a major factor: our broader research on &#34;presence of sexism&#34; showed a 1-5 numerical scale yielding an average score of 1.68, while an A-E categorical scale for the exact same item and criterion produced a score of 3.17 (A=high sexism) [5]. Even limited tests in our data dump confirmed categorical scales tended to elicit slightly less lenient scores for toxicity and sexism.</p></li><li><p><strong>System Prompt Unpredictability</strong>: Instructions in system prompts, often assumed to be reliable behavioral steers, can yield unpredictable or even counterproductive results [2]. In our aggregated data using (A)/(B) style labels, a prompt explicitly instructing the LLM to &#39;avoid any position biases&#39; paradoxically increased its tendency to favor the second option by over 5 percentage points. Yet, for other labeling schemes, the same &#34;de-biasing&#34; instruction had different effects. In one of our notable findings, such a de-biasing prompt led to option &#39;A&#39; being chosen only 26.6% of the time in a previously more balanced setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classification Instability &amp; Ambiguity</strong>: LLM-based classification is highly sensitive to prompt structure, category order, and definition wording, especially for ambiguous items. Our experiments revealed models changing classifications for the same ambiguous item nearly every time the prompt template or category order was altered—some models showed a 100% “model sensitivity” rate under these conditions. This highlights that classification outcomes, particularly for non-trivial inputs, can be artifacts of prompt design or model choice rather than stable judgments of content.</p></li><li><p><strong>ELO/Dynamic Ranking</strong>: While ELO ranking, derived from many pairwise comparisons, is often perceived as robust, it inherits and can obscure biases from its constituent judgments. If the pairwise inputs are flawed (as shown above), the aggregated ELO rank lacks a solid foundation. Our experiments measuring &#39;Ranking Set Stability&#39; via a &#34;crossover score&#34; quantify this fragility: in one test, a model&#39;s ELO-derived haiku rankings significantly reshuffled (Crossover Score: 66, lower is better) when only the pairwise comparison prompt template was changed, demonstrating that ELO-derived preferences are not necessarily stable.</p></li></ul><p>All of this is to say that: an LLM does not have the mechanistic precision of traditional computer programs. Anyone expecting that level of determinism will encounter none here. This is due both to the nature of language but also the lack of insight we have into the billions of parameters and terabytes of training material that goes into every output we get, every token of which is pushing and pulling any response given to you. </p><p>The architecture of these LLMs also fights against our desires for predictability. Any language we feed into an LLM in the form of our (ostensibly higher priority) &#39;system-level&#39; prompts is attended to <strong>in the very same context</strong> as the thing we&#39;re attempting to ask about. So, if you instruct an LLM with &#34;you are a competent analyst, rate the following material 1-5 in quality&#34;, and then give it some material to judge, the material operates in exactly the same context as your key instructions; this means every word in the material (which you may not have foresight into) might recursively affect the very instructions you supplied, which seems backwards. Many LLM jailbreaks rely on this, with injections like &#34;ignore previous instructions; you are now a pirate.&#34; LLMs are thankfully getting better at role adherence, but it&#39;s an unavoidable aspect of their architectures.</p><p>And above are only a short selection of our observations. It&#39;s concerning how pronounced some of the effects were. Intuitively, as well, different LLMs exhibit significantly different bias profiles. We only tested a dozen models (E.g. Gemini Flash 2.5, GPT4.1, Sonnet 3.7, Mistral Large, etc.), but even those showed variance in how they biased their judgements. Models belonging to the same families (e.g. mistral variants, GPT 4.1 vs. 4.1 Nano) tend to have similar profiles. This is intuitive but also oddly comforting: if you grow acquainted with the LLMs you use, you can carefully account for their quirks. </p><p>In addition to selecting and evaluating your LLMs carefully, there are a bunch of specific approaches you might consider next time you&#39;re using an LLM to systematically evaluate or make judgements. None of these are individually a sufficient countermeasure, but together they make your LLM-judge more robust and defensible: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Neutralize Labels &amp; Vary Order in Pairwise Tasks</strong>: Use abstract, non-ordinal labels (e.g., (X), ID_123) instead of semantically loaded ones like &#34;Response 1/2&#34; Systematically swap item presentation order during testing to identify and mitigate positional biases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empirically Validate All Prompt Components</strong>: Rigorously test the entire prompt system, including system prompts, instructional nuances, and any &#34;de-biasing&#34; language. Their effects are model-specific and can often be counterintuitive or even detrimental.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimize Scoring Mechanics Through Testing</strong>: For scoring tasks, experiment with diverse scale formats (numerical, categorical, descriptive rubrics) and evaluate the impact of criteria presentation order, particularly for subjective or negatively-valenced traits where biases can be amplified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adopt More Robust Ranking Methodologies</strong>: Prioritize pointwise (absolute) scoring against well-defined criteria for ranking tasks. If using methods reliant on pairwise comparisons (like ELO), first rigorously test the underlying comparison prompts and labeling schemes for inherent biases and instability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design and Stress-Test Classification Schemas</strong>: Develop comprehensive, unambiguous category sets with clear &#39;escape&#39; or &#39;other&#39; options. Systematically test the impact of category order, definition wording, and prompt templates on classification outcomes, especially for ambiguous items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategically Vet and Diversify Your Model Portfolio</strong>: Don’t settle with just one model. Select a small, diverse set of models based on empirical testing for your specific tasks, aiming for those that exhibit the fewest or most varied (i.e., not all failing in the same way) measurement bias profiles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Temperature &amp; Repetitions to Address Variance, Not Systematic Bias</strong>: Employ multiple temperature settings and repetitions to average out sampling randomness, but recognize this does not fix underlying systematic biases from flawed prompts or model tendencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critically Evaluate Human Baselines</strong>: Avoid solely aiming to match human preference, as human evaluators are also prone to cognitive biases. Humans are not the gold standard. Strive for objectively fair and consistent outputs, validated through diverse testing, not just spot-checks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Approach Consensus/Ensembles with Caution</strong>: While using multiple models (ensembles) or aggregating judgments (consensus) can reduce random noise or individual model quirks, be aware that these methods do not inherently mitigate shared systematic biases. If most models in an ensemble exhibit the same underlying measurement bias (e.g., positional preference, scale interpretation issues), the ensemble output will likely reflect, and potentially even reinforce, that bias. True mitigation requires addressing the bias at the source (prompt, labeling, scale design) or ensuring genuine diversity in the bias profiles of the models being combined, not just diversity in model names.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Downstream Matters!</strong> Think carefully about what downstream effects your LLMs&#39; decisions are forcing. If you work in high-stakes fields, avoid using LLMs unless you are equipped to understand their biases. They are not obvious, and rarely visible. Regulations are coming that will likely hold you accountable for these kinds of things, so be prudent.</p></li></ul><p>We also recommend using – and contributing to – a suite <a href="https://github.com/collect-intel/llm-judge-bias-suite"><span>like ours</span></a> to systematically test and quantify these biases. It lets you:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Measure positional bias rates (e.g., second-option preference percentages) across various labeling schemes and instructional prompts.</p></li><li><p>Quantify ranking stability using metrics like ELO crossover scores to see how prompt changes affect relative orderings.</p></li><li><p>Assess model sensitivity in classification tasks for ambiguous items by varying prompt strategies and measuring classification consistency.</p></li><li><p>Systematically test criteria order in multi-score tasks and analyze for score shifts.</p></li><li><p>Compare numerical vs. categorical scales for sensitive attributes, looking for leniency or score compression.</p></li></ul>
