The sculpture appears to represent a woman&#39;s face, with engraved eyes, a dimpled chin, and a raised nose and mouth. She may be wearing her hair in an updo or under a hat. Unlike other objects from the site — such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/the-venus-of-vestonice" target="_blank"><u>Venus of Věstonice</u></a>, which lacks facial features — this face seems to be individualized, making it the earliest known depiction of a specific person.</p><p>During the Upper Paleolithic period, a band of mammoth hunters set up camp at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323078777_DOLNI_VESTONICE-PAVLOV_Place_South_Moravia_Time_30_Thousands_Years_Ago" target="_blank"><u>Dolní Věstonice</u></a>, which is now a small village near the southern border of the Czech Republic. This cluster of settlements, sometimes called the &#34;Stone Age Pompeii,&#34; has yielded tens of thousands of ceramics, stone tools and bone objects over the past century of excavations, along with numerous burials.</p><div><p>MORE ASTONISHING ARTIFACTS</p></div><p>In one of these burials, covered in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64138-ochre.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64138-ochre.html"><u>red ocher</u></a> and arrayed with 10 drilled fox teeth, excavators discovered the skeleton of a middle-aged woman in 1949. Her skull was asymmetrical, potentially due to a traumatic childhood injury. When researchers used forensic techniques to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-018-0698-3" target="_blank"><u>reconstruct the woman&#39;s face</u></a> from the skull in 2018, they discovered it was very similar to the tiny ivory carving, whose left eye is significantly smaller than the right.</p><p>Dolní Věstonice is unique in Europe for its abundant artifacts dating to the Late Gravettian period (29000 to 24000 B.C.), including some of the earliest kiln-fired pottery in the world, so it is unsurprising that this little head carved from mammoth ivory is likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ice-Age-Art-Arrival-Modern/dp/0714123331" target="_blank"><u>earliest personal portrait</u></a> in the world.</p><p>Many artifacts from Dolní Věstonice, including this sculpted head, can be found on display at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/place/anthropos-pavilion/" target="_blank"><u>Anthropos Pavilion</u></a>, a museum in Brno, Czech Republic.</p>
