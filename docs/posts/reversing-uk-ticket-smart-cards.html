<p>Following its adoption by the Department for Transport, the ITSO specification has been the legally mandated technological stack for all new smartcard ticketing systems in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Many transit operators have adopted ITSO as their primary ticketing scheme as a result of the government’s endorsement and the plethora of vendors supplying ITSO-certified equipment. Despite this, there has been little research done into the security mechanisms provided by the specification.</p>

<p>After creating a tool to interpret data stored on compliant smartcards, I compromised a public ITSO validator app by abusing backwards compatibility measures to clone a genuine smartcard and alter its contents in an unauthorised manner.</p>

<p>This research was conducted as part of my BSc (Hons) Ethical Hacking dissertation, which can be found at <a href="https://lobi.to/static/posts/papertickets/dissertation.pdf">dissertation.pdf</a> (submitted May 2019)</p>

<p>I presented some of my findings from this research at <a href="https://2020.securi-tay.co.uk/">Securi-Tay 2020</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcdARsqJhEI">recording</a>), <a href="https://campgnd.com/">campGNDd 2021</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7M4rXSxpvk">recording</a>), and <a href="https://dc4420.org/2022/08/30/">DC4420</a>.</p>
