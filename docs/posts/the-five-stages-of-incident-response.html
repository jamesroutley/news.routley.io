    <h1>The five stages of incident response</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><strong>Monday, April 21, 2025</strong></p>

  <div><p>The scene: you&#39;re on call for a web app, and your pager goes off.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial.</strong>
No no no, the app can&#39;t be down.
There&#39;s no way it&#39;s down.
Why would it be down?
It isn&#39;t down.
Sure, my pager went off.
And sure, the metrics all <em>say</em> it&#39;s down and the customer is complaining that it&#39;s down.
But it isn&#39;t, I&#39;m sure this is all a misunderstanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anger.</strong>
Okay so it&#39;s fucking down.
Why did this have to happen on <em>my</em> on-call shift?
This is so unfair.
I had my dinner ready to eat, and <em>*boom*</em> I&#39;m paged.
It&#39;s the PM&#39;s fault for not prioritizing my tech debt, ugh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bargaining.</strong>
Okay okay okay.
Maybe... I can trade my on-call shift with Sam.
They really know this service, so they could take it on.
Or maybe I can eat my dinner <em>while</em> we respond to this...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depression.</strong>
This is bad, this is so bad.
Our app is <em>down</em>, and the customer <em>knows</em>.
We&#39;re totally screwed here, why even bother putting it back up?
They&#39;re all going to be mad, leave, the company is dead...
There&#39;s not even any point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance.</strong>
You know, it&#39;s going to be okay.
This happens to everyone, apps go down.
We&#39;ll get it back up, and everything will be fine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
