    <h1>Meta found &#39;covertly tracking&#39; Android users through Instagram and Facebook</h1>

      <p>Meta and search engine company Yandex have been &#34;covertly tracking&#34; Android users in the background of their devices, according to experts.</p><p>Academics at the Radboud University in the Netherlands and IMDEA Networks said they discovered Meta and Yandex have been tracking Android users&#39; browser activity without their consent and then using the data in their apps.</p>
<p>Meta said it was looking into the issue, while Yandex denied collecting any sensitive data.</p><p>Gunes Acar, assistant professor at Radboud University, said the &#34;covert&#34; data collection was spotted in January.</p><p>He said he discovered Meta&#39;s apps, including Facebook and Instagram, and Yandex&#39;s apps, such as Yandex Maps, were sitting in the background of Android devices and loading a script that sent data locally back to apps on users&#39; phones.</p>
<p>The scripts bypassed Android&#39;s security measures and meant that Meta and Yandex could track what users were doing on web browsers, without the user consenting or even knowing, according to the expert.</p><p>&#34;They are bridging these two worlds that we think are separate; web browsing and mobile app activities,&#34; Dr Acar told Sky News.</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s very shocking.&#34;</p><p>The apps were able to track users&#39; browser data on all major Android browsers, even if the user was in incognito mode, the academics said.</p>        
<p>&#34;It&#39;s really concerning because it negates every privacy control that you have in modern browsers and also in modern mobile platforms like Android,&#34; said Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, associate professor at IMDEA Networks, to Sky News.</p><p><strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/google-5876/1" target="_blank">Google</a></strong>, which owns the Android operating system, confirmed the covert activity to Sky News.</p><p>It said Meta and Yandex used <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/android-8090/1" target="_blank">Android&#39;s</a></strong> capabilities &#34;in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles&#34;.</p><p><strong>What have Meta and Yandex said?</strong></p><p>Meta told Sky News it was quickly looking into the issue.</p><p>&#34;We are in discussions with Google to address a potential miscommunication regarding the application of their policies,&#34; said a Meta spokesperson.</p><p>&#34;Upon becoming aware of the concerns, we decided to pause the feature while we work with Google to resolve the issue.&#34;</p><p>Yandex said it &#34;strictly complies with data protection standards&#34;, adding: &#34;The feature in question does not collect any sensitive information and is solely intended to improve personalisation within our apps.&#34;</p><p><strong>Read more science and tech news:</strong></p>    
<p>Meta appeared to have been doing the data tracking for around eight months, while Yandex had since 2017, the academics said.</p><p>&#34;We found that Facebook was doing it on roughly 16,000 websites when visited from the EU, [...] Yandex was doing this on 1,300 websites,&#34; said Tim Vlummens, a PHD student at KU Leuven who worked on the research.</p><p>Google told Sky News it had already &#34;implemented changes to mitigate these invasive techniques and have opened our own investigation and are directly in touch with the parties&#34;.</p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo">

<p>The tech giant did not respond when asked what repercussions Meta and Yandex were facing for their conduct.</p><p>Firefox, Microsoft Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers were also affected, with Firefox owner Mozilla and DuckDuckGo engineers taking action to stop any future covert tracking.</p>
