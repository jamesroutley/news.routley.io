Veronika, the nurse on shift when we were first admitted, assured us Carla would probably still be waiting for active labour to begin when she came back on shift ~24H later. Baby O had other plans: the next morning at 7:24am he was in our arms.</p><p><span>

And in the seconds after Baby O’s birth, another nurse grabbed my phone and snapped what are now the most precious photos I possess. I’ve heard other parents describe the bond that is formed with the people who help bring your child into the world, but I couldn’t stop marveling at the level of care we received. We are forever indebted to the team at NYU Langone.</p><h2 id="learning-to-parent-in-a-pandemic"><a href="#learning-to-parent-in-a-pandemic" aria-label="learning to parent in a pandemic permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Learning to parent in a pandemic</h2><p>The late summer/fall was a glorious jumble of diapers, long walks and discovering exactly what hour of the early morning my favorite podcasts drop while savouring my half of the night shift.</p><p>Despite the fully vaxxed summer in effect in NYC, having a newborn in many ways felt like being transported to day 0 of lockdown: fewer MTA trips, more walking and park hangs.</p><figure>
