    <h1>Ask HN: More “experimental” UIs for editing/writing code?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>There is a bunch of editors with the traditional model of inserting text with the keyboard, arrows move the cursor around, you click around in menus/using hotkeys to perform actions (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Eclipse). Then there is the &#34;modal&#34; editors that have different modes where you can switch between for example &#34;editing&#34; or &#34;movement&#34; modes, and what your keyboard controls depends on the mode you&#39;re in (editors like Vim). Otherwise there is also very interactive and extensible editors, where eval basically lives within/together with the editor (Emacs, LightTable)<p>Otherwise, most editors fit in somewhere along those lines.</p><p>But what other editors is there out there that have something really different for editing/writing code? Things that come to mind is &#34;editors&#34; like Scratch where you aren&#39;t really &#34;editing&#34; code with your keyboard, but moving things around instead. Or, if I imagine I&#39;d create a editor for programming controlled by a joystick, what kind of UI and UX would that editor have?</p></td></div></div>
