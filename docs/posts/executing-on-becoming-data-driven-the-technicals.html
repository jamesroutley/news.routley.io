    <h1>Executing on Becoming Data Driven: The Technicals</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/07/executing_data_driven_technicals.jpg" alt="Executing on Becoming Data Driven: The Technicals"><p><em>Note: this is Part 8 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">series of blog posts about becoming data driven in business</a>. You may want to read the prior parts before reading this essay.</em></p><p>Let&#x2019;s do a quick recap. At this point in the series, we&#x2019;ve discussed how the purpose of data is &#x2018;<a href="https://commoncog.com/operational-rigour-is-the-pursuit-of-knowledge/">knowledge</a>&#x2019;, which is defined as &#x2018;theories or models that help you make better predictions about the business outcomes of your actions.&#x2019;</p><p>We&#x2019;ve also discussed how this is fancy way of saying that &#x2018;the purpose of becoming data driven is to <em>build a causal model of the business in your head</em>.&#x2019; The purpose of doing all this work is that you want to understand how your business <em>actually</em> works and grows, not rely on superstitious beliefs about how your business works and grows.</p><p>So how do you do that? Readers who have been following along for a bit know that I&#x2019;m putting the entire series to the test right now. In the previous instalment, I <a href="https://commoncog.com/executing-on-becoming-data-driven/">talked about</a> how the really difficult bit with this are the political bits. But let&#x2019;s talk about the technical bits this week: how do you begin?</p><p>The answer: you start with the causal model of the business you <em>currently</em> have in your head.</p><h2 id="everyone-has-a-causal-model-of-their-business-in-their-heads">Everyone Has a Causal Model of Their Business In Their Heads</h2><p>The truth is that everyone has a causal model of their business in their heads. Sure, the model might be wrong. Parts of it may be superstition. But it&#x2019;s worth <em>starting with that model anyway</em> &#x2014; if nothing else, it forces your team to check that they all share the same model of the business.</p>
