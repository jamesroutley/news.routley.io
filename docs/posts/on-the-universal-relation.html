            <p>I took a databases class last year. In it, we learned about some theory and
some practice and one of the most oft-cited papers was “On the Universal
Relation” (1979) by Marc H. Graham (“MH Graham” on Google Scholar) at the
University of Toronto. It’s apparently a classic. It’s got some foundational
work in databases. It’s also nowhere to be found online, and local libraries
did not have it. Everybody cites it… has anybody read it?</p>

<p>I took a couple of days to track down a physical copy from across the country,
ordered it to my local library, scanned the paper, and now I am putting it here
for the world to see. I tried to contact both the university and the author
individually, but the research group is defunct and the author, while seemingly
alive and well, did not respond. It’s been a long time since it was published,
so hopefully nobody minds.</p>

<p>I’m sorry about the bad scan. I had to keep the spine of the book intact and in
decent condition, so I couldn’t press it too flat.</p>
