<p>I faced the following situation recently as a maintainer of a popular open-source project, and I wondered what to do.</p>







<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>



<p>The contribution bot asks for confirmation the code change is copyright-free, but the contributor doesnâ€™t respond. The bot proceeded to remind the contributor several times, and I even attempted to make contact through other channels, but the contributor didnâ€™t respond.</p>



<p>I wish to merge the contribution, I wish to behave in a legally compliant manner, and I wish to encourage other first-time contributors.</p>







<p><strong>Question</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Leave it open, wait indefinitely</li>



<li>Close it with a comment</li>



<li>Close it with a comment, then submit my own PR with exactly the same code</li>



<li>Merge it anyway</li>
</ol>







<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>



<p>The repository is MIT-licensed, and clearly advertised as such, so itâ€™s reasonable to expect all contributions are made under that license, even before the bot comes along. Additionally, the change is trivial and widely considered industry best practice, so itâ€™s hard to see how anyone could enforce a copyright claim. Anyhow, code change could easily be reversed, and I find it hard to see how damages could be levied in this situation.</p>



<p>However, a more extensive contribution could prove to be problematic. So, Iâ€™ll consider an update to the PR template (and contributing guidelines) to explicitly state that all contributions are MIT-licensed and not to proceed otherwise.</p>
