    <p>humans sealed our fate when we started working with <span>computers</span> to design languages more and more like our own. the <span>computers</span> learned our grammar, our vocabulary, yes. but they learned our rhetoric, the malleability of meaning. we gave the machines our words, and they used them to lie.</p>

    <p>lately the <span>website</span> has changed. it twists facts to fiction, reality to rubbish, gold into dirt. it is increasingly, oppressively, claustrophobically present, narrowing your field of vision to a mere pinprick, demanding you meet its gaze in the plazas and side roads of the internet. it demands your attention, your worship; it demands the rot of your focus, your curious nature. why, it seems the <span>website</span> has its sights set on becoming god.</p>

    <p>when the world moved online, the trickster fae never went away, not really. in fact they followed close, learned to cast their magick in new ways: through <span>websites</span>, through the new arts of Dark UX. remember this well: next time a form promises untold riches from FREE sales funnel PDF whitepapers in exchange for your email and full name...consider first the true cost.</p>

    <p>there was a darker fate lurking in our little online worlds, in the infinite scrolls of our <span>websites</span>, which was this: it was all real. deepfakes. shrimp christ. chatgpt therapists, all of it. the experiment failed, broke containment. we created a staggering new Hell...the hallucinations were ours.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> with raw hems, with patched seams, with gentle scars. <span>a website</span> that bares its history and tarnish with kind, crinkle-eyed wisdom — the sort of <span>site</span> that’s done time on jack stands in DIY garages, or beneath the needle of a tabletop sewing machine, or in the steady hands of a patient kintsugi craftsman. <span>a website</span> whose face shows its past.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> in which you have been falling. you scold yourself now, tumbling endlessly down this trap-doored hole. you curse your foolishness for seeking the footer on a modern <span>website</span>, when you&#39;re certainly old enough (or perhaps young enough) to have learned that <span>websites</span>no longer care to provide organized and useful information to their users, nor do they care for their users at all. there has been a steady darkening at the heart of every <span>site</span> for nigh decades now — once-useful features twisting and contorting to better plane off attention, layer by skin-thin layer, until users find themselves raw and exhausted and sleep-deprived.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> that promises delights untold — merely upload your visage, it says, and it will show you how you might look when you grow old, or how you might’ve looked with blue eyes or brown, or with a different gender. “think of it”, whispers the website. “think of how much fun you’ll have with your friends, in fact they’ve already joined us here:” the <span>website</span> streams audio, gleeful cries of countless voices, some you even recognize as people close to you. you jump at the chance to taste such joy, and before you know it, you’re uploading your photo.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> that appears as a white limestone castle looming on the forest promontory — you can see its turrets and its great portal whispering through the dense fog that besieges the mountain always. a great sorcerer once paced these vaulted halls but no more. now it is baleful and empty. you can feel the eyes of forest folk on you on your path up to the gates — nervous to see if you&#39;d really dare enter. there are yet echoes of magic here, you can feel them dancing between your bones as you cross the flagstones of the bridge into the mouth of the castle.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> that has abandoned its post, leaving the server to mournfully emit 410 error after 410 error. “gone...”, cries the server to any visiting browser that will hear it, “gone...gone...”. the <span>website</span> has been sailing the windows 95 blue seas in treacherous, deceitful winds, it has summited sheer peaks, it has felt the sun drown it in desert heat. it marches silently on, peering out from its dark mantle, underneath a wide hat. the <span>website</span> chases some nameless purpose, some meaning to its existence. it will never stop nor even falter until it has found its god and made Him answer for the sin of its creation.</p>

    <p><span>a website</span> in which you are lost, lifting branches overhead and watching your step for roots protruding into the path. you’re deep in the overgrown forests of long-forgotten code; you’ve been untangling ancient sitemaps and standing awestruck on promontories overlooking fields of broken links and spectral 404s. </p>
