    <h1>Unix time is bad and needs replacement, not UTC</h1>

              <p>A few days ago, representatives from across the world
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03783-5">voted to abolish</a>
leap seconds from coordinated
universal time,
the world’s most popular time standard, on which all timezones are based
(abbreviated as UTC).
As it is right now, a leap second is inserted every once in a while
to make sure that UTC stays synchronized with the rotation of
the Earth.
The universe is really quite complex, and so the exact rotation of the Earth is
irregular and unpredictable to us.
As a result, leap seconds are also irregular and unpredictable.
Leap seconds are based upon satellite measurements
and announced by the organization IERS about six months before
their insertion into UTC. On average, a leap second is inserted approximately
every year and a half, but this can vary by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Another important time standard is international atomic time
(abbreviated TAI, from the French name “temps atomique international”),
a standard which is not kept in sync with the rotation of the Earth and does
not have leap seconds.
The difference between TAI and UTC is by
definition an integer number of seconds.
Since 1958 the time in TAI has drifted apart from the time based on the
rotation of the Earth, leading to a difference of 37 seconds in 2022.</p>
<p>The decision to get rid of leap seconds was made because of the havoc that
leap seconds cause on computer systems.
To put it simply, engineers expect that the timestamp
of the next second is equal to the current timestamp plus one
(that is, <code>t_next == t + 1</code>), but because of leap seconds, that is not true.
The timestamp of the next second can be the same as the current timestamp,
or it could hypothetically even be the current timestamp plus two
(“hypothetically”
because a leap second in this direction has not yet happened).
The fact that these assumptions aren’t actually true
breaks a lot of code, and in turn a lot of systems.</p>
<p>However, the abolishment of leap seconds doesn’t mean that the problem is now
solved.
It still has to be decided how UTC is going to stay synchronized with the
rotation of the Earth after the leap second goes away,
and also whether UTC is going to stay synchronized at all.
Both solutions have their downsides:
If UTC becomes a linear system with no discontinuities,
then it will eventually be significantly out-of-sync with the
rotation of the Earth, just like TAI.
On the other hand, if the leap second is replaced by a
leap minute or a leap hour,
then the current problems will still persist,
and albeit less frequently, such problems will have a much bigger effect.</p>
<p>The point I intend to make in this article is as follows:
leap seconds were not a mistake. Leap seconds in UTC are fine,
because UTC was not primarily meant for engineering purposes.
The mistake was, instead, to base Unix time and other computer timestamp
formats on UTC instead of a strictly linear time scale.
The fact that Unix time is not a linear time scale takes away a lot of
mathematical properties that are crucial for its application in computers.
I’ll show this in <a href="#comparison-of-timestamping-techniques">section 3</a>.
In the <a href="#proposal-for-changes-to-unix-time">last section</a>,
I will discuss a proposal for changes to Unix time that
would hopefully resolve this problem once and for all, completely independent of
whatever might happen to UTC in the future and ideally without too much work.
First, let’s talk about Unix time.</p>
<h2 id="unix-time">Unix time</h2>
<p>The simplified definition of Unix time is that Unix time
counts the amount of seconds that have passed since the first of
January 1970 (which is referred to as “the epoch”, similar to the first of
January of 1 AD being the epoch of the Gregorian calendar).
This is of course not the complete definition,
since it does not take leap seconds into consideration.
The exact way Unix time handles leap
seconds<a href="#footnote-unix-time">*</a>
is complex and an unnecessary detail for this article,
but it will suffice to say that
(i) whenever a positive leap second occurs,
a timestamp is used twice, and (ii) if a negative leap second were to occur,
a timestamp is skipped.</p>
<p>Besides Unix time, there is also TAI Unix time, which has
no leap seconds and therefore truly counts the amount of seconds since its
epoch.
The epoch of TAI Unix time is January 1970 00:00:10 TAI,
so ten seconds past midnight. This epoch is exactly the same
moment in time as the epoch of Unix time, despite looking a little different,
because the difference between UTC and TAI was ten seconds in 1970.
TAI Unix time is strictly linear and has a lot of favourable
mathematical properties, but is not very popular.</p>
<p>I’d quickly like to note that TAI Unix time is not Unix time and that
TAI Unix time should always be clearly distinguished from normal Unix time.
I think it’s best to compare it to bread and bread sticks.
They’re both bread, they both have “bread” in the name, but when you ask a baker
for bread, you don’t expect to be given bread sticks.
The same applies with Unix time and TAI Unix time:
When you ask for Unix time, you don’t expect to be given TAI Unix time.
My point being that you should always make sure to clearly distinguish between
the two.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to spoil the proposal at the end of the article, but if
you’re
guessing that it’s “just start using TAI Unix time”, then you’re only partially
correct.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-timestamping-techniques">Comparison of timestamping techniques</h2>
<p>In the table below, I compare the properties of linear timestamping techniques
such as TAI Unix time
to timestamping techniques with leap seconds such as Unix time.
Most of the time I only mention leap seconds,
but the same applies for leap minutes, leap hours or any other leaps.</p>
