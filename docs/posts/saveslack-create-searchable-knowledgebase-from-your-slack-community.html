<h2>What is this for?</h2>

<p>A lot of knowledge is locked up in Slack communities. Recently Slack announced a pricing change which meant that this knowlege would all disappear after 3 months (change effective 1 September - you can read the details <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/pricing-and-plan-updates">on their blog</a>.)</p>

<p>In order to free this knowledge and make it searchable by your community, you can export a .zip file of all public Slack channels in your community, parse the json files, and create a nice, searchable, public website for your community. But that&#39;s kind of a mission, so we built this tool to make it easy.</p>

<p>Interested in custom domains, password-protected private sites (so only your members have access to old messages), automatic updates, and more? Paid plans, including self-hosting, coming soon. Email gareth-at-ritza dot co to tell me more about what you&#39;re looking for and what features are important to you, and you&#39;ll be first on the list when we are ready!</p>
