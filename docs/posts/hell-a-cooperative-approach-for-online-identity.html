    <h1>Show HN: Hellō, a cooperative approach for online identity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-b025b4a0=""><div data-v-b025b4a0=""><div><h2 id="centralized-identity-approach" tabindex="-1">Centralized Identity Approach <a href="#centralized-identity-approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Internet identity is a complicated and unsolved problem. Early centralized offerings, such as <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1999/10/11/microsoft-passport-streamlining-commerce-and-communication-on-the-web/" title="Microsoft Passport: Streamlining Commerce and Communication on the Web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft Passport</a>, were <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2567539/microsoft-scales-back-passport-plan.html" title="Microsoft Scales Back Passport Plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">rejected</a> for fear of giving control to privately-owned entities. Recent centralized offerings – such as Apple, Facebook, and Google’s social login services – only solve a fraction of the problem and access to these free services can be revoked from the <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11851695/facebook-deleted-your-account-good-luck-retrieving-your-data" title="Facebook Deleted Your Account? Good Luck Retrieving Your Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">user</a> or the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-epic-games-idCAKBN2602YG" title="Fortnite says gamers can no longer use Apple sign-in system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">developer</a> at any time.</p><h2 id="decentralized-identity-approach" tabindex="-1">Decentralized Identity Approach <a href="#decentralized-identity-approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>To resolve the concerns with a centralized approach, numerous decentralized identity approaches have been proposed and built. In the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/decentralized-identity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">decentralized approach</a> an issuer provides a credential to a user, and then the user chooses to provide the credential to an application. For example, a school will issue a credential to a student so they can prove they are a student. This puts the user in the middle of the transaction, giving them control of when and where their information is shared.</p><h2 id="the-cold-start-problem-with-decentralized-identity" tabindex="-1">The Cold Start Problem with Decentralized Identity <a href="#the-cold-start-problem-with-decentralized-identity" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>However, all three parties (issuer, user, application) must be using the same, new decentralized technology, but unfortunately none are. This is a three-way cold start barrier that is yet to be broken. There is no value to one party adopting the technology unless the other parties they are interacting with have also adopted it.</p><h2 id="decentralized-governance" tabindex="-1">Decentralized Governance <a href="#decentralized-governance" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Rather than using decentralized technology to address the concerns of a centralized service, our approach is to decentralize the governance of a centralized service with a multi-stakeholder cooperative that has representation from users, organizations, and employees. See <a href="https://www.hello.coop/pages/cooperative.html">Hellō Cooperative</a> for details.</p><h2 id="resolving-the-cold-start-problem" tabindex="-1">Resolving the Cold Start Problem <a href="#resolving-the-cold-start-problem" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The Hellō service provides an abstraction layer between the parties, allowing users and issuers to utilize existing credentials. This removes the cold start problem for those two parties so only applications need to explicitly adopt the solution, which uses existing, proven technology that is readily available.</p><p>Developers of new, greenfield applications that choose to use Hellō will save weeks of development time, while offering their users all the choices they have come to expect – and without the risk of a provider revoking access. Developers will only pay for each new verified claim they receive such as a verified email or phone with pricing comparable to other verification services such as Twilio. Early adopters will be rewarded with credits that will reduce or eliminate the cost of the service. Credits will be provided using the same mechanism we will use to reward investors, employees, and advisors. See <a href="https://www.hello.coop/pages/financing.html">Smart Financing</a> for details.</p><h2 id="centralized-identity-risk-mitigation" tabindex="-1">Centralized Identity Risk Mitigation <a href="#centralized-identity-risk-mitigation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>A centralized service raises concerns of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These are addressed with a verified confidential cooperative computing architecture that ensures only the user can access and release their data, the user can not be impersonated, and the service is resilient to multiple failures. See <a href="https://www.hello.coop/pages/architecture.html">Hellō Computing Architecture</a> for details.</p><p>While our data governance model prevents surveillance by state actors, we do not want to be a safe haven for criminals. In the case of suspected criminal activity, law enforcement must obtain subpoenas from two independent geopolitical jurisdictions to ensure the suspected activity is widely considered to be criminal, and no single jurisdiction can abuse access. See <a href="https://www.hello.coop/pages/data-governance.html">Hellō Data Governance</a> for details.</p><h2 id="faqs" tabindex="-1">FAQs <a href="#faqs" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="_1-why-will-users-adopt-hello" tabindex="-1">1) Why will users adopt Hellō? <a href="#_1-why-will-users-adopt-hello" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Initially, we do not expect users to directly adopt Hellō. Users will instead choose to use an application that uses Hellō and implicitly create a Hellō wallet when they sign up.</p><h3 id="_2-why-will-users-prefer-applications-that-use-hello" tabindex="-1">2) Why will users prefer applications that use Hellō? <a href="#_2-why-will-users-prefer-applications-that-use-hello" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Hellō is as convenient for users as social logins but without the privacy concerns or vendor lock-in. They will not need to create another password or re-verify their email or phone.</p><h3 id="_3-why-will-credential-issuers-adopt-hello" tabindex="-1">3) Why will credential issuers adopt Hellō? <a href="#_3-why-will-credential-issuers-adopt-hello" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Issuers do not need to choose to use Hellō, although they may choose to not allow Hellō to use them. Hellō will integrate all popular issuers using their existing APIs. In the future, Hellō will be a marketplace for commercial issuers to sell their credentials to Hellō developers.</p><h3 id="_4-what-issuers-does-hello-support" tabindex="-1">4) What issuers does Hellō support? <a href="#_4-what-issuers-does-hello-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Currently Hellō supports Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, LINE, Twitch, and Yahoo. Users can also use their email, phone, or crypto wallet to log in to Hellō.</p><h3 id="_5-why-will-developers-adopt-hello" tabindex="-1">5) Why will developers adopt Hellō? <a href="#_5-why-will-developers-adopt-hello" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Developers of greenfield applications will save weeks of development time while providing their users with the login and account management choices they have come to expect. See <a href="https://www.hello.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hello.dev</a> for more details.</p><h3 id="_6-how-does-hello-save-a-developer-weeks-of-time" tabindex="-1">6) How does Hellō save a developer weeks of time? <a href="#_6-how-does-hello-save-a-developer-weeks-of-time" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The developer no longer needs to implement account recovery, email or phone verification, or profile picture upload. Developers no longer need to spend hours registering their apps at the management consoles of social providers such as Apple, Facebook, or Google, and then copying and pasting configuration to and from those consoles. Hellō provides a fully-featured <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenID Connect</a> interface that will work with the libraries and integrations developers are already familiar with. See our <a href="https://www.hello.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">developer portal</a> for details.</p></div></div></div></div>
