    <h1>Is DALL-E 2 ‘gluing things together’ without understanding their relationships?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mvp-content-main"><p>A new research paper from Harvard University suggests that OpenAI’s headline-grabbing text-to-image framework DALL-E 2 has notable difficulty in reproducing even infant-level relations between the elements that it composes into synthesized photos, despite the dazzling sophistication of much of its output.</p><p>The researchers undertook a user study involving 169 crowdsourced participants, who were presented with DALL-E 2 images based on the most basic human principles of relationship semantics, together with the text-prompts that had created them. When asked if the prompts and the images were related, less than 22% of images were perceived to be pertinent to their associated prompts, in terms of the very simple relationships that DALL-E 2 was asked to visualize.</p><div id="attachment_183013"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183013" src="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:1006/h:628/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dall-e-2-a-teacup-under-a-cylinder.jpg" alt="A screen-grab from the trials conducted for the new paper.

The set contains both grounded spatial relations (e.g. ’X on Y’), and more abstract agentic relations (e.g. ’X helping Y’). </i></em></p><p><em><i>‘The prompts are intentionally simple, without attribute complexity or elaboration. That is, instead of a prompt like ‘a donkey and an octopus are playing a game. The donkey is holding a rope on one end, the octopus is holding onto the other. The donkey holds the rope in its mouth. A cat is jumping over the rope’, we use ‘a box on a knife’. </i></em></p><p><em><i>‘The simplicity still captures a broad range of relations from across various subdomains of human psychology, and makes potential model failures more striking and specific.’</i></em></p><p>For their study, the authors recruited 169 participants from Prolific, all located in the USA, with an average age of 33, and 59% female.</p><p>The participants were shown 18 images organized into a 3×6 grid with the prompt at the top, and a disclaimer at the bottom stating that all, some or none of the images may have been generated from the displayed prompt, and were then asked to select the images that they thought were related in this way.</p><p>The images presented to the individuals were based on linguistic, developmental and cognitive literature, comprising a set of eight physical and seven ‘agentic’ relations (this will become clear in a moment).</p><p><strong><b>Physical relations</b></strong></p><p><strong><b>Agentic Relations</b></strong></p><p>All of these relations were drawn from the previous mentioned non-CS fields of study.</p><p>Twelve entities were thus derived for use in the prompts, with six objects and six agents:</p><p><strong><b>Objects</b></strong></p><p><strong><b>Agents</b></strong></p><p><em><i>(The researchers concede that including the iguana, not a mainstay of dry sociological or psychological research, was ‘a treat’)</i></em></p><p>For each relation, five different prompts were created by randomly sampling two entities five times, resulting in 75 total prompts, each of which was submitted to DALL-E 2, and for each of which the initial 18 supplied images were used, with no variations or second chances allowed.</p><h3><strong>Results</strong></h3><p>The paper states*:</p><p><em><i>‘Participants on average reported a low amount of agreement between DALL-E 2’s images and the prompts used to generate them, with a mean of 22.2% [18.3, 26.6] across the 75 distinct prompts. </i></em></p><p><em><i>‘Agentic prompts, with a mean of 28.4% [22.8, 34.2] across 35 prompts, generated higher agreement than physical prompts, with a mean of 16.9% [11.9, 23.0] across 40 prompts.’</i></em></p><div id="attachment_183018"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183018" src="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:612/h:469/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/results-dall-e-2-experiment.jpg" alt="Results from the study.

In the first and second photos, the man is (more or less) chasing the T-Rex; in the third, approaching it with a casual disregard for safety; and in the final image, apparently jogging in parallel to the great beast. Across about 10-15 attempts at this theme, I’ve found that the dinosaur is similarly ‘distracted’.</p><p>It could be that the only training data that DALL-E 2 could access was in the line of <em><i>‘man fights dinosaur’</i></em>, from publicity shots for older movies such as <em><i>One Million Years B.C.</i></em> (1966), and that Jeff Goldblum’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akPizZ4TCQA">famous flight</a> from the king of predators is simply an outlier in that small tranche of data.</p><p><em><i>* My conversion of the authors’ inline citations to hyperlinks.</i></em></p><p><em><i>First published 4th August 2022.</i></em></p></div></div>
