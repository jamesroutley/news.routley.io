    <h1>How to Firefox</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Chrome finally pulled the trigger on the web’s best ad-blocker, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/browsing/google-is-killing-ublock-origin-here-are-your-options">uBlock Origin</a>.</p>
<p>Now that Chrome has hobbled uBO, Firefox—my beloved—<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is surging again. I want to do my part to convince you to switch to Firefox and show you how I use it.</p>

<p>Let’s get through the important talking points, in case you need a quick copy paste to convince a friend.</p>
<ol>
<li>100% open-source</li>
<li>Un-enshittify the web</li>
<li>Android users rejoice</li>
<li>Customize to your heart’s content</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="100-open-source">100% open-source</h2>
<p>This section can be quick.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox">github link</a> to the source code of the Firefox browser. You can clone the repo, pop open your favorite <a href="https://kau.sh/tags/ai/">AI</a> code assistant and start asking questions about your browser - the most important app you use.</p>
<p>What libraries does their Android app use? <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/blob/d17ad8314866c2f95b2a23577e897a0a2ae48cb6/gradle/libs.versions.toml#L4">libs.versions.toml</a> boom! Also 8.11.1 on android gradle plugin? not bad Firefox.</p>
<p>Their license allows you to fork and distribute <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">alternative</a> <a href="https://librewolf.net/">versions</a>. Vibe code a whole new browser.</p>
<h2 id="un-enshittify-the-web">Un-enshittify the web</h2>
<p>Most of the web today is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/enshittification">enshittified</a> with a cesspool of ads, popups, cookie notices, and tracking scripts. Our primary defense has been ad-blockers, with the most powerful being uBlock Origin.</p>
<p>uBO relies on community-curated filter lists that play a cat-and-mouse game to zap known ads, trackers, and other digital sludge. But with Chrome controlling the web, Google followed through on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23964509/google-manifest-v3-rollout-ad-blockers">promise</a> to kneecap <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBO</a> with Manifest V3, effectively blocking the full version from its extension store.</p>
<p>Sure, there’s uBlock Origin “Lite” now, which does the same thing, right? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1067als/comment/j3h00xj/">Nope</a>:</p>

          uBlock Origin Lite != uBlock Origin
        
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
<li>Filter lists update only when the extension updates
<ul>
<li>no fetching up to date lists from servers (this is a big one!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No custom filters
<ul>
<li>so no <strong>element picker</strong> which allows you to point and zap</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many filters are dropped at conversion time due to MV3’s limited filter syntax</li>
<li>No strict-blocked pages</li>
<li>No per-site switches</li>
<li>No dynamic filtering</li>
<li>No importing external lists</li>

<p>Did you know, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox">uBlock Origin works best on Firefox</a>. Why not just use the real thing then? My browsing experience is beautiful because I have most of the shit-bits blocked away.</p>
<p>On my Pixel too.</p>

<p>With Firefox for Android, you get seamless sync of tabs, bookmarks, passwords between browser and phone<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Let’s face it, Safari between Mac and iPhone is a sublime experience. We can get that with Firefox.</p>

<h3 id="real-browser-extensions-for-mobile">Real browser extensions for mobile</h3>
<p>Here’s something the iPhone isn’t getting anytime soon: honest-to-god browser extensions that you use on your desktop, also on your phone. Which means… you can run uBlock Origin on Android, completely <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34377582">unnerfed</a>.</p>
<p>Safari has extensions, but they still require an App Store review for distribution on Apple platforms. They also <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/327"><em>just</em></a> got a version of the uBO “Lite” extension.</p>
<h2 id="customize-to-your-hearts-content">Customize to your heart’s content</h2>
<p>But… Firefox doesn’t look as clean and minimal as Safari. You can claw the vertical tabs out of my cold dead Arc hands!</p>
<p>This is what my Firefox browser looks like:</p>
<figure>

<p>It only takes about five minutes and a browser restart to get this look.</p>

<p>I’ll walk you through my setup now, from essential add-ons to privacy tweaks and a few “nice-to-have” extras.</p>





  
  
  

  <div data-callout-metadata="" data-callout-fold="" data-callout="warning">
    
    <p>This is <em>my</em> setup. I’m a nerd, so I find joy in tinkering. You don’t need to do all of this, but a few small tweaks can give you a massively better browser.</p>
  </div>
<h2 id="the-essentials-ublock-origin">The Essentials: uBlock Origin</h2>
<p>Think of uBO as a powerful, wide-spectrum filter for the web. It uses community-maintained lists to block ads, trackers, cookie notices, and other digital sludge before it ever loads. Your browser stays faster and cleaner.</p>
<p>It can be confusing to know which filter lists to enable. I follow the advice of a uBO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1jmkrw1/comment/mtpsoaa/">wizard on Reddit</a>, and these settings alone make the web 90% better. Check the same boxes, and you’re good to go.</p>

    <div>
        
            <p><img src="https://kau.sh/images/content/uploads/2025/adblock-filers.webp" alt="uBO filters to enable" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p><figcaption>
                

                
                        You&#39;re completely set with this.

                        

                                

                            
                

            </figcaption>
            

    </div>

  <div data-callout-metadata="" data-callout-fold="" data-callout="tip">
    <div dir="auto">
      
      <p>
        
          Custom Filters are an exclusive uBO superpower
        
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <p>The “My filters” tab is where you can write your own rules to block nearly anything, from annoying widgets to entire domains.</p>
  </div>
<h4 id="block-outgoing-network-traffic-to-facebook">Block <em>outgoing</em> network traffic to Facebook</h4>
<p>For the truly privacy-conscious, uBO can block <em>all outgoing traffic</em> to specific domains, like Facebook.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In the past, Firefox’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/facebookcontainer/">Facebook Container</a> add-on helped by isolating your Facebook activity. But if any other site embedded a Facebook widget or tracker, your data could still leak to Meta’s servers, fingerprinting you even if you never visit Facebook directly.</p>
<p>With a custom uBO rule, you can sever that connection entirely from non-Facebook sites. This is a level of control other browsers don’t offer.</p>
<figure>

    
    

</figure>

<p>The other line you see there? That one-liner blocks all those “Sign in with Google?” pop-ups. This granular control is <strong>only</strong> possible with the full uBlock Origin, not the “Lite” version found on other browsers.</p>
<p>If you want to go deeper, <a href="https://youtu.be/2lisQQmWQkY?si=feAVfrYe7qS5PVL-&amp;t=9">this video</a> is a great showcase of its advanced capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-power-up-containers">Privacy power-up: Containers</h2>
<p>Firefox now includes <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introducing-total-cookie-protection-standard-mode">Total Cookie Protection</a> by default. This automatically isolates cookies to the site that created them, giving each site its own “cookie jar”. This stops trackers from following you across the web.</p>
<p>This feature makes the old <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-Account Containers</a> (MAC) add-on redundant for basic anti-tracking. However, the container technology itself is still incredibly useful for managing multiple online identities.</p>
<p>Instead of juggling separate browser profiles, you can use “Containers” to stay logged into two different Gmail accounts (e.g., “Work” and “Personal”) in the same browser window, with zero overlap.</p>
<p>The old MAC add-on made this possible, but it was clunky to setup. For a seamless setup, you just need one <code>about:config</code> tweak: set <code>privacy.userContext.newTabContainerOnLeftClick.enabled</code> to <code>true</code>. Now, when you click the new tab button, you can choose which container to open. This works without the extra MAC add-on because the Container concept is baked natively into Firefox.</p>
<p>But what about links? A work link (like Datadog or Sentry) clicked from your email in a Work container, might open in the default container and use the wrong Google account. You could right click and say “Open in Container &gt;” but that gets old fast. The optional <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containerise/">Containerise</a> add-on solves this by letting you create simple rules that force specific sites to always open in their designated container.</p>
<p>This combination of a native config tweak and the <code>Containerise</code> add-on provides a simple, but more powerful multi-profile setup (than even MAC).</p>
<h2 id="gravy-add-ons">Gravy add-ons</h2>
<p>These are also not essential, but they add a nice layer of polish.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a></strong>: For a consistent, customizable dark mode on every site.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a></strong>: To apply custom CSS. I use it to force my <a href="https://kau.sh/tags/my-new-programming-font/">favorite monospace font</a> on code blocks.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/">Return YouTube Dislike</a></strong>: Does what it says on the tin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-clipper-obsidian/">Obsidian Web Clipper</a></strong>: To save notes and clippings directly to Obsidian, from desktop or mobile.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/">Auto Tab Discard</a></strong>: Suspends background tabs to save RAM. A holdover from my RAM-strapped MacBook days, but it still does its job silently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-customizations">Other Customizations</h2>
<p>Firefox is famously customizable via <code>about:config</code>. Besides the container tweak, I only use one other:</p>
<h3 id="browsertabsinsertaftercurrent--true"><code>browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent</code> → <code>true</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>New tabs open next to your current tab, not at the end.</li>
<li>You catch that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/12/safari_new_tab_next_to_current_tab">Mr.Gruber</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m collecting in this section, some of the cooler Firefox features that’ll make you wonder why every browser doesn’t have them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>/</code> and start typing for quick find (vs ⌘F). But dig this, <code>&#39;</code> and Firefox will only match text for hyper links<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li>If you have an obnoxious site disable right click, just hold Shift and Firefox will bypass and show it to you. No add-one required.</li>
<li>URL bar search shortcuts: <code>*</code> for bookmarks, <code>%</code> for open tabs, <code>^</code> for history</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>The web can still be beautiful. You just need the right tools to see it. Go <a href="https://www.firefox.com/">download Firefox</a> and make your web beautiful again.</p>
