<p>SearchHut is a FOSS search engine I have been hacking on for the past week,
which was &#34;announced&#34; this morning.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really unhappy with how the roll-out went. It was much too early. I had been
discussing the project and sharing access to the development environment for
testing and feedback in the SourceHut off-topic IRC channel, which is a
relatively small community, with an explicit request not to share details of the
project more widely outside of the channel. Someone in this channel
misunderstood my request and posted it to Hacker News, and by the time I woke up
and saw it the next morning, it was too late to stop.</p>
<p>The search engine is not presently capable of producing useful results for a
large variety of queries. The search index, now being rebuilt for production, is
only a quarter of the size of my local development index. I also have not been
able to verify my assumptions at scale, and I have no clue if we&#39;re a few
million pages away from 5-10 second search queries and having to rewrite the
indexing backend, or if our weighting heuristics are wrong and we&#39;re going to
have to rebuild the index after some tweaks. I have not had time to test the
production hardware to the extent that I was planning, or to do a renewed cost
analysis. The site is full of 404 links and documentation stubs, and the form
to request new domains, approve or reject such requests, or browse the list of
domains, is not implemented. The search query syntax was planned to be extended
later on, and the documentation &amp; draft blog post mention several aspirational
features which don&#39;t actually work as if they were already there.</p>
<p>My typical workflow involves coming up with and implementing a design, then
<em>verifying</em> that design by proving it in the crucible of real-world workloads.
Until this process is complete, my software is not done, and I don&#39;t feel
confident shipping it. Without this, I have no basis to establish confidence in
the system, and I don&#39;t want users to rely on it. Nevertheless, I felt forced to
ship this incomplete and unverified software to end-users on short notice.</p>
<p>Consequently, I&#39;ve decided to take the system offline for the time being. I&#39;m
not sure when it will be back; my motivation for this project has evaporated. It
went from a fun experiment to a premature nightmare overnight.</p>
<p>The fault is mine: I should have been clearer about my intentions on IRC. I
apologise if you have been adversely affected by this decision.</p>
