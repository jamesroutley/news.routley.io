<p dir="auto">This repository contains all the source code for the DD Poker
computer game, the underlying game engine, the supporting
backend server, and the companion website. The game itself is
a Java Swing-based desktop application that is capable of running
on Mac, Linux and Windows.  The backend-server is essentially
a Java Spring application that talks to MySQL.  The website
(aka &#34;Online Portal&#34;) is built on the Apache Wicket framework.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, there are currently no new installers for DD Poker, mainly because
the Windows and Linux installers were built with software that requires
a paid license and the Mac version used a tool that has since been removed.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are still the <a href="https://static.ddpoker.com/download/" rel="nofollow">old installers</a>, which
were built many years ago, but may still work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe somebody can help with this in the future.  For now, you can build and
run it from source, as explained in <a href="https://cceckman.com/dougdonohoe/ddpoker/blob/main/README-DEV.md">Developer Notes</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also an option to distribute a jar file, which the <em>Installers</em> section of
the Developer Notes explains.</p>

<p dir="auto">For details on how to build and run DD Poker and
the backend server and website, please see <a href="https://cceckman.com/dougdonohoe/ddpoker/blob/main/README-DEV.md">README-DEV.md</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">DD Poker was developed by Donohoe Digital LLC, a small computer
games studio founded by Doug Donohoe in 2003.  Its first game,
<a href="https://www.donohoedigital.com/war/" rel="nofollow">War! Age of Imperialism</a> was
a computer version of the eponymous table-top board game, and it
was a finalist in the 2005 Independent Games Festival.  After releasing
the game in October 2003, Doug was celebrating in Las Vegas
and, while at a poker tournament, the proverbial lightbulb went
off that there were no good poker software simulators out there,
especially for tournaments.  Leveraging the game
engine he built for War!, Doug immediately started building
a poker game.  Less that a year later, DD Poker was ready for
release.</p>
<p dir="auto">DD Poker 1.0 was originally released (and sold in boxes!) in
June 2004 under the name
<em>DD Tournament Poker No Limit Texas Hold&#39;em</em> and
later re-released in early 2005 as <em>DD Tournament Poker 2005 Collector&#39;s
Edition</em>, featuring Annie Duke on the box.  The game featured
Limit, Pot-Limit and No-Limit Texas Hold&#39;em against computer
components.  There was no online play.</p>
<p dir="auto">DD Poker 2.0 added the ability to play online against other
human opponents, a poker clock, a hand simulator and dozens
of other new features.  It was originally released in August
2005 as <em>DD No Limit Texas Hold&#39;em Tournament Edition</em>, featuring
Phil Gordon on the box.  To support online play, a back-end
API server and companion &#34;Online Portal&#34; was built and operated
by Donohoe Digital.  New functionality continued to be added
until early 2007.</p>
<p dir="auto">DD Poker 3.0 was released as donation-ware in January 2009,
adding only minor new features while removing license-key
validation logic. It continued to be updated sporadically until
it was shutdown in July 2017.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://cceckman.com/dougdonohoe/ddpoker/blob/main/code/poker/src/main/resources/config/poker/help/whatsnew.html">whatsnew.html</a>
for a detailed release history starting with version 2.0.</p>

<p dir="auto">Even though DD Poker and the backend servers was shutdown
in July 2017, folks continue to play it by manually
sharing game URLs.  There was a minor revival during the
2020 pandemic and sporadic inquiries have come in over the
years.</p>
<p dir="auto">While Donohoe Digital LLC no longer exists and cannot
run the old servers, there might be folks out there that
want to run servers for their own local poker communities.
Releasing the code allows them to do this.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, even though the core code is almost 20 years
old, it still actually works and might be useful to
somebody, somewhere.</p>
