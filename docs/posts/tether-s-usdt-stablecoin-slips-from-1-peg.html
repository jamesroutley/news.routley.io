    <h1>Tether&#39;s USDT Stablecoin Slips from $1 Peg</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/shauryamalwa/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/8ba9bdd5-0fa0-4f4f-864f-0da5c290a777.jfif" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Shaurya is an analyst/editor for CoinDesk&#39;s markets team in Asia.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Stablecoin Tether (USDT) changed hands at nearly 97 cents early Thursday, down 3% from its intended $1 peg as traders considered contagion risks from crypto exchange FTX and its related trading arm Alameda Research.</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>USDT usually trades between $0.999 and $1.01. </p></li><li><p>Data from the Kraken, Binance, Coinbase and OKX exchanges show the stablecoin trading in the $0.97-$0.98 range at the four venues. It fell to as low as 93 cents for a few seconds on Kraken.</p></li><li><p>USDT last reached such price levels during <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/">May&#39;s implosion of Terra</a> and its related UST stablecoin.</p></li><li><p>Tether Global CTO Paolo Ardoino pointed out in a Thursday tweet that over 700 million USDT were redeemed for U.S. dollars <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1590671674378067968" target="_blank">in the past 24 hours</a>. &#34;No issues. We keep going,&#34; he said.</p></li><li><p>&#34;During periods of market volatility, the trading price for USDT that is quoted on exchanges may fluctuate. This happens because there is more demand for liquidity than exists on that exchange&#39;s order books and has nothing to do with Tether&#39;s ability to hold its peg nor the value or makeup of its reserves,&#34; the company said in a statement posted to its website on Wednesday.</p></li><li><p>USDT transactional activity jumped to a four-month-high, data from Glassnode shows. The metric calculates the average value of all USDT transfers over a given time period, seven days in this case.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><div><ul><li><p>A representative for Tether told CoinDesk in an email that issuer Tether Global is unexposed to both Alameda and FTX.</p></li><li><p>&#34;We would like to confirm that at this time, Tether has absolutely no credit towards FTX or Alameda Research,&#34; the external representative said. &#34;Tether tokens are 100% backed by our reserves, and the assets that are backing the reserves exceed the liabilities.&#34;</p></li><li><p>USDT prices may deviate from the intended $1 peg, but today&#39;s potential depegging comes amid possible contagion risks from the liquidity issues at embattled crypto exchange FTX.</p></li><li><p>FTX came under scrutiny following a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">CoinDesk report last week</a> that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTXâ€™s native FTT tokens. This meant that Alameda rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 11, 12:22 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds Tether CTO comment in fourth bullet, company statement in fifth, USDT transactional volumes.</i></p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 11, 11:32 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds details.</i></p></div></div><div data-module-name="article-body/newsletter-cta" data-module-version="1"><hr/><p><span>Sign up for Crypto for Advisors, our weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance.</span></p><p><span>By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk product updates, events and marketing and you agree to our <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/terms/">terms of services</a> and<!-- --> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</span></p></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/shauryamalwa/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/8ba9bdd5-0fa0-4f4f-864f-0da5c290a777.jfif" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Shaurya is an analyst/editor for CoinDesk&#39;s markets team in Asia.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/shauryamalwa/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/8ba9bdd5-0fa0-4f4f-864f-0da5c290a777.jfif" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Shaurya is an analyst/editor for CoinDesk&#39;s markets team in Asia.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div>
