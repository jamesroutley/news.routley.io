    <h1>Commercial interests petition FCC for high power allocation on shortwave</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p><span>07/11/2023</span></p><p>The ad hoc group “Shortwave Modernization Coalition” petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow data communications on multiple bands within the HF 2 – 25 MHz range with up to 20 KW, including in bands immediately adjacent to spectrum allocated to the Amateur Radio Service. This group appears to represent high-speed stock trading interests. The FCC has assigned it RM-11953. Comments are due by July 31, 2023, and reply comments by August 15. While the petitioners exclude the amateur bands, high power operations on immediately adjacent bands are proposed. <a href="http://www.arrl.org" target="_blank">ARRL  The National Association for Amateur Radio</a>® is reviewing the petition. A copy of the petition is at: <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1042840187330/1" target="_blank">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1042840187330/</a>1 (PDF).</p>
