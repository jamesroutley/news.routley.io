    <h1>Book Review: Snow Crash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apr 13, 2023</p><div><p>Rating: ‚ùÑÔ∏èüìâ</p><p>My experiences took on a different texture while I read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. The hyper-privatized,
segmented-but-uniform world in which the plot unfolds gave me greater than usual mistrust for every McDonalds, gated
community, and Airport shopping corridor.</p><p>As usual, spoilers ahead.</p><p>I loved the characters in Snow Crash. A mutant Aleut killer who uses glass knives and has a Hydrogen bomb synced to go
off if he‚Äôs killed. A Black/Korean swordsman hacker named ‚ÄúHiro Protagonist‚Äù. A badass 15 year old delivery girl who
rips around at highway speeds on a skateboard and goes by YT (‚ÄúYours Truly‚Äù). A Mafia boss Vietnam vet who operates the
most efficient pizza delivery franchise on Earth. A bespectacled digital Librarian with instant access to all Earth‚Äôs
knowledge, drawing eerie parallels to ChatGPT. Lightspeed distributed robot dogs called ‚ÄúRat Things‚Äù that protect Hong
Kong franchises. There are no boring characters.</p><p>There were boring sections, however. I found the long and detailed exposition of exactly what the ‚ÄúSnow Crash‚Äù virus
did, where it came from, and the winding logic connecting Sumerian water gods to neurolinguistic viruses pretty tedious.
It sort of felt like mixing a Michael Bay movie with the History channel (yes, including Ancient Aliens).</p><p>Some of the more egregious quotes from these parts of the book:</p><blockquote><p>if you stare into a person‚Äôs pupil, you can see the terminal of the brain</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He also has a digital metavirus, in binary code, that can infect computers, or hackers, via the optic nerve‚Ä¶he found
it in space‚Ä¶the metavirus is everywhere. Anywhere life exists‚Ä¶originally it was spread around on comets.</p></blockquote><p>It was like, dude, can you just get on with the awesome parts of your story already please?</p><p>For a novel published in 1992, it‚Äôs fun to see what was predicted to be easy and hard, deprecated and still relevant in
the 21st century dystopian future. The AR/VR and Librarian-GPT elements are spooky accurate. It almost makes me question
how much of modern companies‚Äô future vision is based off Snow Crash‚Äôs world rather than Stephenson making accurate
predictions. Google Earth is basically the Earth program in Snow Crash‚Äôs metaverse, and apparently did inspire Google
engineers directly. Other parts, like the continued ubiquity of paper, the ultra high tech skateboard wheels, and the
briefcase sized gatling guns were a bit more off.</p><p>I found the fate of the government in the Snow Crash world both funny and upsetting. YT‚Äôs mom‚Äôs abuse at the hands of
her fed employers and the bureaucratic death march of programming in the government setting feels less inevitable to me
than the cannibalization of society at the hand of private profit motives. At the same time, well meaning people
replacing money and respect with loyalty to their work in government and social-good-adjacent non-profits and companies
is a familiar story. We really need to make these positions higher status in the real world. ‚ÄúAll‚Äù it would take is
higher salaries, I think.</p><p>I really liked the combination of youth skate culture and the representation of a unified working class. The Kouriers
defined coolness, disrespect for authority, and extreme competence - the glue holding society together. The Code Red
that rescued YT at the end showed that they also embodied extreme solidarity.</p><p>I felt like the novel ended too soon. It felt like the hydrogen bomb should have either gone off or been defused - a
crippled but free Raven at the end was unsatisfying. On the other hand, I think we all got the idea, and I did like that
not all foreshadowed elements (like Uncle Enzo‚Äôs dog tags) had concrete payoffs.</p><p>Overall, I loved the book and look forward to reading more Stephenson.</p></div></div></div></div>
