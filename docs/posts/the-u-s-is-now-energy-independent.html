    <h1>The U.S. is now energy independent</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades,<strong> </strong>politicians have talked about the U.S. achieving energy independence, a seemingly elusive goal of producing enough fuels to avoid relying on the rest of the world to fill up gas tanks and keep electricity flowing.</p><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>It&#39;s elusive no more. The U.S. produced more petroleum than it consumed in 2020, and the numbers were essentially in balance in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The surge in oil prices taking place in 2022 has radically different implications for the U.S. economy — and for key geopolitical relationships in the Middle East and Russia — than in past episodes when energy prices have risen.</p><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> In the past, when oil prices spiked, the impact on the U.S. economy was straightforward: It made America poorer, as more of our income went overseas to pay for imported energy.</p><ul><li>Now, after the shale gas revolution of the last 15 years, the impact is more subtle. Higher fuel prices disadvantage consumers and energy-intensive industries, yes. But there is a counteracting surge in incomes for domestic energy producers and their workers.</li><li>Higher oil prices no longer depress overall measures of prosperity like GDP and national income, but rather shift it around toward certain regions. Texas and North Dakota win; Massachusetts and North Carolina lose.</li></ul><p><strong>By the numbers: </strong>As recently as 2010, America imported 9.4 million barrels a day of oil more than it exported. That had swung to a 650,000 barrel per day surplus in 2020, and preliminary numbers for 2021 show trade pretty much in balance last year.</p><p><strong>Worth noting: </strong>To the degree the U.S. does still import oil, more of it is coming from our closest ally. Canada was the source of 51% of U.S. petroleum imports in the first 10 months of 2021, compared with 8% from the Persian Gulf.</p><ul><li>By contrast, the Gulf states supplied more than 30% of American petroleum imports in 2008.</li></ul><p><strong>Free idea</strong> for an international relations professor: Assign an essay question on how the changing economics of energy could affect America&#39;s stance in Middle Eastern diplomacy.</p><p><strong>The impact on geopolitics</strong> extends to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. Disruptions to European energy supplies would have a less direct effect on the U.S. than they might have in an earlier era.</p><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> When oil prices spike, it&#39;s no longer a problem for overall growth—but because energy is a global market, it still means pain for American consumers and the sitting administration.</p></div></div>
