                                                        <p><em><a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-antivirus/avast/" target="_blank">Avast</a> and <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-antivirus/avg-technologies/" target="_blank">AVG</a> no longer pose a threat to user privacy, meaning both products are 100% safe to use. Since closing down its data-aggregating subsidary, Jumpshot, Avast has undergone significant changes to ensure user privacy isn’t compromised. The company has earned certifications from data privacy advisors like TrustArc and works closely with other privacy experts, so you can rely on Avast and AVG to responsibly manage your data.</em></p>
<p>Our readers have been messaging us and asking why we’re still ranking Avast and AVG on our website, despite them being caught up in a serious scandal. Well, after a lot of consideration and back and forth between departments, we’ve decided to finally remove them from all of our lists.</p>
<p>Why? Because Avast — which also owns AVG — has been caught in a firestorm of controversy over the last several months regarding serious allegations of unethical business practices.</p>
<p>The Avast Online Security browser extension was deleted from Mozilla, Chrome, and Opera marketplaces in December 2019 after <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdkq7/avast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">claims that it was gathering a suspicious amount of user data</a> — not only every website visited, but also user location, search history, age, gender, social media identities, and even personal shipping information. Three months later, Avast shut down a subsidiary company, Jumpshot, in the wake of investigative reports documenting the sale of personal data from around 100 million users, all gained through improper user surveillance.</p>
<p>The SafetyDetectives team has carefully considered our decision to scrub Avast from our website over the next several weeks. At the end of the day, any company that faces such severe allegations has lost our faith and cannot receive our seal of approval.</p>
<h2 id="review-0">Here’s How Avast Allegedly Spied on Its Users for the Last 7 Years</h2>
<p>Wladimir Palant — the founder of Adblock Plus — was the first person to sound the alarm about Avast’s predatory practices. In October 2019, he posted the incriminating information to <a href="https://palant.de/2019/10/28/avast-online-security-and-avast-secure-browser-are-spying-on-you/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">his blog</a> with a detailed explanation of how he claims Avast was able to “transmit data that allows reconstructing your entire web browsing history and much of your browsing behavior.”</p>
<p>Essentially, Avast and AVG’s Online Security extensions were recording their users’ every click — documenting which websites were visited, when, and from where. While Avast claimed that data collection was a necessary part of the Online Security plugin, browser extensions from competing brands seemed to work fine without collecting and retaining such a large amount of personal information.</p>
<p>Then came the disclosure that this data was being sold to big corporate clients like Home Depot, Google, and Pepsi, through an Avast subsidiary called Jumpshot.</p>
<h3>Avast Subsidiary Sold User Data For Millions of Dollars in Profit</h3>
<p>In 2013, Avast acquired Jumpshot, a company that aggregated “anonymous” user data and sold that data to online businesses. Jumpshot’s public information was very vague, but they claimed to have obtained “clickstream data from 100 million online shoppers and 40 million app users”. The source of Jumpshot’s user data was the spyware embedded in Avast and AVG’s Online Security Browser extensions. Palant was a driving force behind this revelation, but the nail in Jumpshot’s coffin was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdkq7/avast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">this article</a> by VICE Motherboard, published in early 2020. It lists out the corporations that purchased data from Jumpshot along with whistleblower testimony and leaked internal documents from Avast and Jumpshot. Jumpshot claimed that no “Personal Identifying Information” was included in the data they sold, but many experts were not convinced.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Jumpshot’s data contained every click performed by Avast Online Security users along with time stamps (accurate to the millisecond), country, city, and zip code information from users’ IP addresses. The algorithm which was designed to censor specific data like email addresses and social media profiles was exposed by Palant to be seriously malfunctioning — whole shipment details from mail carriers, including names and home addresses, were included in data packets sold by Jumpshot.</p>
<h2 id="review-1">US Senators and Investigative Journalists Held Avast Accountable</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/issues/tech-internet-and-cybersecurity?latest=113" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">Oregon Senator Ron Wyden</a>, a well-known proponent of cybersecurity, net neutrality, and digital privacy, called out Avast publicly in December 2019, stating on Twitter that, “Americans expect cybersecurity and privacy software to protect their data, not sell it to marketers. I’m looking into this troubling report about Avast and its failure to protect consumers’ data.”</p>
<p>Then, after being removed from the Chrome, Mozilla, and Opera web stores, Avast had the opportunity to abandon their privacy violating ways and start to act like a respectable cybersecurity company. They changed the privacy settings of the Online Security browser extension, which was returned to web stores at the end of December. However, as the VICE Motherboard exposé revealed, they simply moved their data collection to the main antivirus suite, embedding a data collection “opt-in” question during the installation process.</p>
<p>With the publication of the VICE Motherboard article, and in the face of unanimous public disapproval, Avast finally shut down Jumpshot completely in February 2020. But for SafetyDetectives, and many others in the cybersecurity world, it was too little, too late. 7 years of secretly profiting off of user data makes this one of the largest ethical violations in antivirus software history.</p>
<h2 id="review-2">Why Ethical Violations by Antivirus Companies Are Especially Serious</h2>
<p>Antivirus software is some of the most invasive software around. We give our antivirus software an unprecedented amount of access to our system — sensitive files, browsing history, financial information, and personal networks are all visible to our antivirus. We sign privacy policies and user agreements with the assumption that there isn’t deceptive language buried in all the legalese. But by violating their customer’s privacy in this way, Avast has corroded the relationship between users and antivirus products around the world. There are enough threats from hackers and invasive governments to worry about — antivirus providers should not be another threat to user security.</p>
<p>Jumpshot has been officially shut down, and Avast Online Security is back on Chrome and Mozilla web stores, with tighter privacy protections. But the fact remains that Avast was unethically profiting off of their users’ data for 7 years, and the only thing that stopped them was the citizen reportage of Wladimir Palant and the investigative journalists at VICE Motherboard. In our opinion, if independent professionals hadn’t rigorously documented these serious violations and notified the public, then Avast would still be running this scam. It’s even arguable that Avast only really considered changing their practices after a US Senator stepped up to confront them.</p>
<h3>User Feedback Inspired Us to Remove Avast from SafetyDetectives</h3>
<p>Here at SafetyDetectives, we’ve had other issues with Avast over the years — following a negative review, they actually pulled their advertising from our website. Still, we have always endeavored to bring you the best cybersecurity products on the internet, regardless of our business relationships with the companies that keep our site profitable. That’s why we continued to include Avast and AVG on our lists — we even kept them as our number 1 pick for the best antivirus for mobile devices:</p>

<p>However, amid such glaring violations of user privacy which have been happening over the last 7 years, we can no longer continue to promote Avast or any of their subsidiaries (like AVG) on our site.</p>
<p>We’ve been considering a move like this for a long time. Even though a lot of top review sites continue promoting — and profiting from — Avast, we’ve been steadily moving them off of our lists for a while. The ultimate motivation for us was all of the feedback we received from our readers with messages like this: “<i>After the data selling incident from AVAST, this software shouldn’t get any positive review or recommendation.” </i></p>
<p><strong>We agree completely.</strong> Any violation of privacy should be a matter of concern for everyone who believes in fundamental human rights. That’s why it’s crucial for computer users to stay on top of these issues and safeguard their computers with reliable antivirus software.</p>
<p>It isn’t always the easy or popular thing to do, but standing up to huge companies when they violate our rights is important. SafetyDetectives was founded with the intention of providing people around the globe with the tools to keep their data safe in the digital age — safe from hackers, unethical governments, and even predatory cybersecurity companies like Avast who have shown the world how little they care about their users.</p>
<p>Avast has returned to many web stores, and its large user base may overlook its ethical violations, but our SafetyDetectives team stands firm in our convictions.</p>
<p>So, if you’re wondering why there’s no mention of Avast or AVG on our website, that’s why.</p>
<p>If you need an antivirus which won’t steal your data and sell it to Pepsi, I provided some recommendations below. You can also check out our list of the <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/" target="_blank">top antivirus software of 2023</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/210/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214132" title="Norton" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214132" data-btn-indexed="1">Norton</a> is the best antivirus on the market in 2023.</strong> It includes a powerful malware detection engine that performed perfectly in my tests, and it comes with an excellent range of additional features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-phishing protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Webcam protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smart firewall. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure VPN (virtual private network).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Parental controls.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dark web monitoring.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Identity theft protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Privacy protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cloud backup.</strong></li>
<li><strong>And more…</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of these features performed well in my tests, but I particularly like Norton’s firewall.</strong> It includes excellent protections that the built-in firewall on Windows lacks, such as the ability to hide open ports from attackers and to identify and block man-in-the-middle attacks. I tested Norton’s firewall by running several simulated exploit attacks against my Windows 11 computer, and it detected and blocked every attack — including attacks that the default firewall protections in Windows Defender allowed through.</p>
<p><strong>I’m also really impressed with Norton’s dark web monitoring.</strong> Most dark web monitoring tools do little more than check for your information on publicly available databases, but Norton hires live agents who infiltrate the dark web to look for your personal information. My only complaint with Norton’s dark web monitoring is that it’s only available to users in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and some European countries.</p>
<p><strong>Also, if you’re in the US, Norton offers <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/product-5/210/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2599899" title="Norton" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2599899" data-btn-indexed="1"><em>LifeLock</em> plans</a> that can monitor and protect you from data theft.</strong> These plans start from $99.99 / year and come with credit monitoring, up to 500 GB of cloud storage, up to $1M of identity theft reimbursement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>For both US and non-US users, Norton offers several other internet security packages that start at $54.99 / year.</strong> <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/product-4/210/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214137" title="Norton" rel="sponsored noopener" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214137" data-btn-indexed="1">Norton <i>360 Deluxe</i></a><i> </i>offers the best value for money, as it can protect up to 5 devices and includes every Norton feature (except those included in the LifeLock plans). You can try Norton’s plans with a generous 60-day money-back guarantee.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/192/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214141" title="Bitdefender" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214141" data-btn-indexed="1">Bitdefender</a> has perfect malware detection rates and is one of the most feature-rich antiviruses on the market.</strong> It’s straightforward to use, it caught all malware samples during all of our stress-tests, and because its engine works in the cloud, it doesn’t cause any system slowdown during system scans.</p>
<p>Bitdefender’s wide range of features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ransomware protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure web browser.</strong></li>
<li><strong>System optimization tools.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Password manager.</strong></li>
<li><strong>VPN (virtual private network).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Parental controls.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anti-theft protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Webcam and microphone protection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>And more…</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you’ve been a victim of data theft, you’ll appreciate Bitdefender’s secure web browser.</strong> It activates Bitdefender’s VPN and keeps your data private by stopping keyword trackers and hackers from viewing your screen. The secure web browser performed well in my tests — I couldn’t capture any screenshots while using it, and I could use a virtual keyboard that keyloggers can’t track to enter personal information. My only complaint is that web pages loaded a little more slowly, so I would only recommend using the secure web browser if you’re viewing sensitive pages or entering personal information.</p>
<p><strong>I also really like Bitdefender’s password manager,</strong> which uses 256-bit AES encryption to store your passwords in a super secure vault that hackers can’t infiltrate. It has some great features, such as a password generator that can automatically create strong passwords and a password auto-filler that automatically logs you into your stored accounts. However, while Bitdefender’s password manager is <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/best-antivirus-with-password-manager/" target="_blank">one of the better antivirus-bundled password managers</a>, it still isn’t as good as a standalone product like <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-password-managers/1password/" target="_blank">1Password</a>, which allows for password sharing and customizable password vaults.</p>
<p><strong>Bitdefender comes with several different plans that start from $14.99 / year and are all available on a 30-day money-back guarantee.</strong> I really like <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/192/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214145" title="Bitdefender" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214145" data-btn-indexed="1">Bitdefender <i>Total Security</i></a>, which is cheaper than most competitors and includes every Bitdefender feature and can cover up to 5 devices. The only downside is that it imposes a 200 MB data cap on Bitdefender’s VPN, but you can to upgrade to <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/product-4/192/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214146" title="Bitdefender" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214146" data-btn-indexed="1">Bitdefender <i>Premium Security</i></a> to remove that limit.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/218/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214150" title="Intego" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214150" data-btn-indexed="1">Intego</a> is the <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-antivirus/mac/" target="_blank">best antivirus for macOS</a>.</strong> Its malware scanner has excellent detection rates and can quickly scan your computer, external drive, and iOS devices for any threats. I like how it uses a caching system, so if you need to scan your device a second or third time, you can do so super quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Intego comes with some excellent security features,</strong> which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firewall.</strong></li>
<li><strong>System cleaner and optimizer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Advanced data backup tool.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Parental controls. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, Intego lacks any tools to directly protect you from data theft, but it does include some tools to reduce the chances of it happening.</strong> For example, Intego has an advanced firewall that can alert you when apps try to connect to the internet, allowing you to easily block unrecognized connections. Intego can also detect whether you’re on a home or public network and adjust its protections accordingly, preventing cybercriminals from intercepting and stealing your data in places such as coffee shops.</p>
<p><strong>Although it’s only available on a separate subscription, Intego also offers a good VPN.</strong> It shares the same servers as <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-vpns/privateinternetaccess/" target="_blank">Private Internet Access (PIA)</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-vpns/" target="_blank">best VPNs in 2023</a>, and runs really fast. While connected to Intego’s VPN, I barely noticed a difference in my internet speeds. The VPN also comes with several advanced features, such as split-tunneling, which allows you to choose which applications run through the VPN and which don’t. In other words, you can easily protect sensitive data from data theft while not having to rely on Intego’s VPN for all your online activities.</p>
<p><strong>Intego comes with a few plans starting from $1.67 / month, but I really like <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/go/vendor/218/?post_id=20708&amp;alooma_btn_name=Affiliate+Link+-+2214153" title="Intego" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link - 2214153" data-btn-indexed="1">Mac <i>Premium Bundle X9</i></a>.</strong> It includes every Intego feature (except for the VPN) and offers coverage on 1, 3, or 5 Macs — which is ideal if you want to cover multiple machines in your household. You can try Intego with a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
