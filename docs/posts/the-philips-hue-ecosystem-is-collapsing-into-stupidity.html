    <h1>The Philips Hue ecosystem is collapsing into stupidity</h1>
    
    
<p>
If you&#39;ve gotten into the home automation thing in the past few years, 
it&#39;s possible you set up some Philips Hue devices along the way.  This 
was an ecosystem which had a bunch of bulbs, switches, outlets and a hub 
that spoke Zigbee on one side and Ethernet on the other.  It was pretty 
much no-nonsense, never dropped commands, and just sat there and worked.  
Also, it integrated with the Apple Homekit ecosystem perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the idiot C-suite phenomenon has happened here too, and 
they have been slowly walking down the road to full-on enshittification.  
I figured something was up a few years ago when their iOS app would 
block entry until you pushed an upgrade to the hub box.  That kind of 
behavior would never fly with any product team that gives a damn about 
their users - want to control something, so you start up the app?  
Forget it, we are making you placate us first!  How is that  
user-focused, you ask?  It isn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Their latest round of stupidity pops up a new EULA and forces you to 
take it or, again, you can&#39;t access your stuff.  But that&#39;s just more 
unenforceable garbage, so who cares, right?  Well, it&#39;s getting worse.
</p>
<p>
It seems they are planning on dropping an update which will force you to 
log in.  Yep, no longer will your stuff Just Work across the local 
network.  Now it will have yet another garbage &#34;cloud&#34; &#34;integration&#34; 
involved, and they certainly will find a way to make things suck even 
worse for you.
</p>
<p>
If you ever saw the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informative_Murder_Porn">South Park episode</a>
where they try to get the cable company to do something on their behalf 
and the cable company people just touch themselves inappropriately upon 
hearing the lamentations of their customers, well, I suspect that&#39;s 
what&#39;s going on here.  The management of these places are fundamentally 
sadists, and they are going to auger all of these things into the 
ground to make their short-term money before flying the coop for the 
next big thing they can destroy.
</p>
<p>
What can you do about it?  Before you say &#34;<s>Home Assistant</s>Homebridge&#34;,
let me stop you right there.  Javascript plus a &#34;curl | sudo sh&#34;
attitude to life equals &#34;yeah no, I am never touching this thing&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Instead, I have a simpler workaround, assuming you just have lights and 
&#34;smart outlets&#34; in your life.  Get a hold of an Ikea Dirigera hub.  Then 
delete the units from the Hue Hub and add them to the Ikea side of 
things.  It&#39;ll run them just fine, and will also export them to HomeKit 
so that much will keep working as well.
</p>
<p>
I will warn you that Ikea isn&#39;t perfect here, either.  They won&#39;t plumb 
through the Hue light/motion/temp sensors or the remote controllers to 
HomeKit.  This means you lose any motion sensor data, the light level, 
and the temperature of that room.  You also lose the ability to do 
custom behaviors with those buttons, like having one turn something on 
and then automatically switch it off a few minutes later.  (Don&#39;t laugh 
- this is perfect for making kitchen appliances less sketchy when 
unattended.)
</p>
<p>
Also, there&#39;s no guarantee that Ikea won&#39;t hop on the train to 
sketchville and start screwing over their users as well.
</p>
<p>
My hope is that someone with good taste and some sensibility in terms of 
their technology choices will make something that does Zigbee on one 
side, Homekit on the other, and is at least as flexible as the Hue setup 
that existed originally.  Until then, it&#39;s going to be yet another shit 
show.
</p>
<p>
And people wonder why I don&#39;t trust these things.
