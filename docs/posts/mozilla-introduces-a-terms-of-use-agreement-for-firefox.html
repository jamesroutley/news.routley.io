						<p><strong>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are for web services, not for browsers.</strong></p><p>In a world where you don&#39;t own your computer, your operating system, your software, your content, or even your data, Firefox has always been the exception: &#34;You can do whatever you want with Firefox! Once you download it, it becomes <em>your</em> browser.&#34; But now Mozilla is clawing back that shining, glorious isle of software peacefulness.</p><p>I&#39;ve been a very vocal champion of Mozilla and of Firefox for years. I have defended things like the acquisition of Pocket (I actually use it extensively!), the addition of the AI chatbot sidebar, and the refocusing of energies on advertising and data collection as things that Firefox needed to do in order to stay relevant, grow their market share, and keep people employed.</p><p>And now, in this moment of glimmering opportunity, as Google is taking away a feature and telling Chrome users, &#34;No, this is <em>our</em> browser, and you can&#39;t have any privacy either,&#34; <strong>Firefox had the opportunity to present itself as the refuge from everything that Chromium takes away from users.</strong> You could&#39;ve said, &#34;our terms of use: use the browser for good! Our privacy policy: your data remains private because we don&#39;t collect it at all.&#34; It could&#39;ve been a remarkable distinctive for your user share. It could&#39;ve positioned Mozilla as a paladin for the open web.</p><p>But instead, you&#39;re instituting a terms of use and a privacy policy that are vague and full of platitudes but represent a shift from your mission. <strong>This is a massive unforced error on Mozilla&#39;s part.</strong> If it was a EULA, that would be one thing. But this is not a EULA for an application. It&#39;s a TOS for a data collection service.</p><p>In your post, you said:</p><blockquote><strong>Transparency matters.</strong><span> We’re introducing a Terms of Use to provide clarity on what users agree to before starting to browse.</span></blockquote><p>For twenty years, the agreement has been very simple: you don&#39;t take any data from us unless we explicitly agree to it. But your new TOU has a &#34;nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license&#34; clause, the very same clause that&#39;s been used for decades to excuse horrible abuses of privacy by the worst that Big Tech has to offer.</p><p>While a TOU makes sense when someone makes use of the features you mention, the blanket application to all browsing data makes it feel like you&#39;re preparing us for a rug pull, after which you&#39;re going to start using our data for AI training or ad targeting (something which the Privacy Policy specifically allows).</p><p><strong>You shouldn&#39;t need a Terms of Use if all of the data remains on our device and we haven&#39;t opted-in to sending you any.</strong> You certainly don&#39;t need one to download and render a website. You only need one if Firefox isn&#39;t going to be a browser anymore, but a web service.</p><p>It&#39;s like Randall Munroe said in xkcd #463, many years ago: &#34;Imagine you&#39;re at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching. Strictly speaking, it&#39;s better than the alternative, yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong.&#34; We chose Firefox because we wanted a browser, not a platform.</p><p>You also said:</p><blockquote><strong>Privacy remains a priority.</strong><span> Our updated Privacy Notice gives a more detailed, easy-to-read explanation of our data practices.</span></blockquote><p>But this privacy policy is only necessary for certain parts of the browser, where data is actually sent to Mozilla&#39;s servers, and applying it in a blanket manner (as noted before) seems like the precursor to a rug pull.</p><blockquote><strong>You stay in control.</strong><span> Firefox is designed to respect user choice, with responsible defaults and simple tools to manage your data.</span></blockquote><p>For now. How long until you update the terms of use to prohibit the deactivation of ad targeting on the New Tab page? Or allow you to sell browsing data to third parties? Or train large language models on the things I type into the fields I browse to?</p><p>Please cancel these broad policies and apply them only to the features that need them, agreed to only when we use them. <strong>The only way for us to truly &#34;stay in control&#34; is if the policies don&#39;t apply to us unless we choose to use the features that require giving you that protection.</strong></p><p>The thing is, I don&#39;t know how you fix this breach of trust in a way that anyone can count on. Once you&#39;ve presented yourself as willing to do this sort of thing, I just don&#39;t see a way to get that back. From being a bastion of the open web, poised to provide a product that people want and desperately need, you&#39;ve now become a thin shadow of the thing that you claim to stand against.</p><p>I was a member of mozilla.social, and was very sad when that closed down. While a lot of people said this was a bad sign of the new direction Mozilla was moving in, I didn&#39;t take it as a red flag. Little did I know how much of a red flag it was; you could&#39;ve chosen to promote that version of the next iteration of the web, but instead you went with AI.</p><p>I know that forks of Firefox await, versions of the browser that keep its old spirit alive. But I don&#39;t want to have to leave this browser or this community. Please reconsider.</p>
