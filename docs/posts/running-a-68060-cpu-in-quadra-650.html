    <h1>Running a 68060 CPU in Quadra 650</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This project is a collection of ROM modifications to get a minimum level of functionality out of a Macintosh Quadra 650/800 / Centris 650 with a 68060 installed on an appropriate adapter. As currently sits it can boot an unmodified System 7.1 install. Much will not work and much work is required to bring into a truly usable state; I do not expect to finish it.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a experimental proof of concept ONLY. It is <strong>not</strong> usable. Please don&#39;t rush out to replicate this unless you know <em>exactly</em> what you&#39;re getting into, or you will be disappointed! No warranty is expressed or implied; I&#39;m not responsible if your Macintosh catches fire, attains sentience, or is raptured into an alternate reality where 68K won the CPU wars.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to Jockelill for a pointer on the MMU ROM mapping, Aprezbios for supplying scrap 060s to play with, and Reinauer for his open source <a href="https://github.com/reinauer/68040-to-68060">68040-68060</a> adapter.</p>

<p dir="auto">Build <a href="https://github.com/autc04/Retro68">Retro68</a> or a standard m68K GCC toolchain and point the Makefile at it. Issue make and pray.
Flash the resulting image to a Quadra-compatible ROM SIMM such as those sold by Caymac, install a 68060 on an appropriate adapter, and let &#39;er rip.</p>
