<p>
The most exciting part of Programming Languages (PL) research for me
has always been in Programming Language Design.
</p>

<p>
By carefully crafting a language with a syntax and semantics tailored
for a specific domain, PL designers can provide an interface for end
users that seamlessly aligns with the sensibilities and intuitions of
practitioners, allowing users to focus on the &#34;interesting&#34; parts of a
problem and tackle larger and more complex problems.
</p>

<p>
Instead of writing a verbose sequence of API calls to display a dialog
to a user in a video game:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code><span># </span><span>example code for a VN</span>
character.draw<span>(</span><span>&#34;alice&#34;</span>, character.LEFT, 0.1<span>)</span>
character.draw<span>(</span><span>&#34;bob&#34;</span>, character.RIGHT, 0.1<span>)</span>
character.say<span>(</span><span>&#34;alice&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;hello there!&#34;</span><span>)</span>
character.say<span>(</span><span>&#34;bob&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;hi!&#34;</span><span>)</span>
character.state<span>(</span><span>&#34;alice&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;sad&#34;</span><span>)</span>
character.say<span>(</span><span>&#34;alice&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;did you hear the news?&#34;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
A DSL instead allows designers to focus on the <i>high-level</i> of what the conversation should be:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code><span># </span><span>example DSL for dialog</span>
  <span>[</span> alice @ left <span>in</span> 0.1, bob @right <span>in</span> 0.1  <span>]</span>
alice: hello there!
bob: hi!
alice<span>[</span>sad<span>]</span>: did you hear the news?...
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
By encoding the &#34;common sense rules&#34; of a domain into the language
itself, we can make writing incorrect programs impossible, and
eliminate cognitive load and minimise the surface area for bugs and exploits. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A DSL for every domain.  When you have eliminated all that is
incorrect, then whatever remain, however complex, esoteric or
convoluted, simply must be correct.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This has been a fun, exciting and impactful thread of research for the
past several decades, but it would be remiss of me at this point to
not mention the &#34;e-<b>LLM</b>-ephant&#34; in the room. It has only been a few
years, and LLMs and LLM-generated code has already permeated widely
across the software ecosystem and continuously forces developers to
reevaluate their preconceptions of what is and isn&#39;t possible for a
machine to generate. Namely, this also includes problems that we might
previously have sought to tackle with language design (eliminating
boilerplate, capturing conventions or common sense etc.).
</p>

<p>
This emerging landscape holds a lot of potential, and there are many
interesting questions in asking how LLMs can contribute to software
development, but as I watch, I am also noticing a worrying trend of
LLM developments supplanting advances and interest in the design of
DSLs: why craft a DSL that eliminates all boilerplate when an LLM can
generate whatever code you need?
</p>

<p>
Is there a future for Language Design in this new era of LLMs? The
point of this blog post is to present some thoughts I&#39;ve been thinking
about in this emerging space, prompt for discussion, and outline some
potential ways forward language design can co-exist and collaborate
with the advances in LLMs.

<div id="text-The%20LLM%20Problem%2C%20or%2C%20rather%2C%20Everything%20is%20Easier%20in%20Python">
<div>
<p>
Let&#39;s start with what I see as the biggest problem that the
introduction of LLMs is presenting to language design: <b>everything is
easier in Python</b>.
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s a little hyperbolic, but what I&#39;m really getting at here is
that LLMs have been consistently found to have substantially higher
efficiacies when operating in programming languages that are well
represented within their training set – think languages like Python,
Javascript, Typescript etc.
</p>


<figure id="org0a469f1">
<img src="https://kirancodes.me/images/llm-comparison-graph.png" alt="llm-comparison-graph.png"/>

</figure>

<p>
For example, the above graph taken from the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3689735">&#34;Knowledge Transfer
from High-Resource to Low-Resource Programming Languages for Code
LLMs&#34;</a> (2024) shows the performance of one of the LLM models
(StarCoderBase-15B) on solving programming tasks in several
languages against the proportion of the training data represented by
files from that language.
</p>

<p>
The paper presents a technique for improving the performance of these
&#34;low-reseource&#34; languages by synthetically generating data, and so the
upward lines in this graph represent improvements after fine-tuning
using this data, but such transformations have only been applied to
smaller models, and certainly nothing at the scale of the production
models (ChatGPT, CoPilot, Gemini, Claude etc.) that are the most
actively used nowadays.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the original points in this data, the graph plots a bleak
picture: as languages become more niche and specific, the performance
of these models drops off a cliff and becomes abysmal — and bear in
mind, even these &#34;low-resource&#34; langauges themselves are in their own
right, production, industrial systems with millions of users; just not
producing enough code for the LLM to do well on them.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the performance of LLMs drop so sharply even for these general
purpose languages, then what can anyone expect from running an LLM on
a domain specific language?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suddenly <b>the opportunity cost for a DSL has just doubled</b>: in the land
of LLMs, a DSL requires not only the investment of build and design
the language and tooling itself, but the end users will have to
sacrifice the use of LLMs to generate any code for your DSL.
</p>

<p>
This brings me to my biggest fear moving forward: will DSLs stagnate?
Will anyone bother writing DSLs if using a niche language forces them
to elide any use of LLMs? or has the barrier to entry to DSL design
simply just jumped up, where now developers will have to work extra
hard to build DSLs that justify losing the ability to use LLMs with
your DSL?

<p>
Okay, so with the doomer-posting out of the way, in this section I
want to take a little bit more of a more optimistic perspective and
think about ways in which language design might evolve and adjust to
work in cooperation with LLMs.
</p>

<p>
So far, there are three interesting directions that I immediately see
for the future, but if you have more I&#39;d love to hear about them!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-Language%20Design%20Direction%201%3A%20Teaching%20LLMs%20about%20DSLs%20%28through%20Python%3F%29">
<h4 id="Language%20Design%20Direction%201%3A%20Teaching%20LLMs%20about%20DSLs%20%28through%20Python%3F%29">Language Design Direction 1: Teaching LLMs about DSLs (through Python?)<br/></h4>
<div id="text-Language%20Design%20Direction%201%3A%20Teaching%20LLMs%20about%20DSLs%20%28through%20Python%3F%29">
<div>
<p>
Okay, so the problem with using LLMs on DSLs is that, by their very
nature, the syntax and semantics of a DSL will differ substantially
from general programming languages. This means that without further
context, it can be challenging for an LLM to understand what
constructs in a DSL mean and how they should be used together to
achieve different programming tasks…
</p>

<p>
So… how about we give them that context?
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve seen a trend in recent papers such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/48bb60a0c0aebb4142bf314bd1a5c6a0-Paper-Conference.pdf">Verified Code Transpilation
with LLMs</a> (2024) where researchers have had success in generating
expressions in niche languages (in this case, logical invariants) by
instead asking the LLM to generate expressions in a well-known
language (in this case, Python), and manually translating to the
obscure language of interest.
</p>

<p>
In the mentioned paper, the authors want to use LLMs to automatically
transpile tensor-processing code into different DSLs. In order to
ensure that the code is correct, they also ask the LLM to generate
invariants that can be used to prove equivalence of both programs:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code><span># </span><span>example invariant from the paper Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs</span>
<span>def</span> <span>invariant_outer</span><span>(</span>row, col, b, a, out<span>)</span>:
   <span>return</span> row <span>&gt;=</span> 0 <span>and</span> row <span>&lt;=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span> <span>and</span>
      out <span>==</span> matrix_scalar_sub<span>(</span>255, matrix_add<span>(</span>b<span>[</span>:i<span>]</span>, a<span>[</span>:i<span>]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
The key trick in this paper is the use of Python as an intermediate
language, where the authors ask LLMs to generate code in restricted
subsets of python first, and then write programs to &#34;lift&#34; these
python expressions into their DSLs of choice. In this way, the authors
can effectively use LLMs to generate code for bespoke DSLs without
having to do expensive fine-tuning steps or retraining the model.
</p>

<p>
Generalising this idea and broadening to the problem of language
design in the big, the question I&#39;d like to pose is, can we do this
kind of translation automatically? For example, can we create DSL
design frameworks that also come with LLM-friendly python descriptions
of their semantics? Maybe we can produce frameworks that will test
that these python encodings have the same behaviour as the code they
model, can we automatically generate the python descriptions from the
implementation of the DSL itself?

<p>
Taking another stab at the problem, another interesting direction that
I see at the intersection of DSLs and LLMs is in investigating new
ways of designing DSLs that work with LLM-based coding workflows.
</p>

<p>
Let me start with a brief interlude on how I have been using LLMs in
my own work, and how they have changed how I write certain kinds of
code – namely, scripts.
</p>

<p>
A lot of my programming work on a day-to-day basis involves working on
the internals of various verification systems. For these kinds of
systems, all the code is pretty complex and intricate, and I really
need to write every line myself. In these situations, LLMs really
aren&#39;t that helpful and any LLM-generated code usually fails to
maintain important invariants of the system and use the appropriate
APIs.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, scripts, are things that I write fairly infrequently, are
usually one of, and something where using LLMs has substantially
changed the way in which I write these programs.
</p>

<p>
Here&#39;s an example of a prompt that I recently wrote to generate some
Python code to do some basic data analysis:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>write a massively parallel script that iterates through all thy
files in <code>afp-versions</code>, runs the function <code>split_file</code> which you
pass in the text contents of the file which returns a pandas df with
the columns <code>name</code>, <code>start_line</code>, <code>end_line</code>, <code>first_word</code></li>

<li>for each file, record: version (name of immediate subdir under
<code>afp-versions</code> that we are in), and project, (the thy files will be
under a subdir thys after the verison, so the project is the
immediate subdir under that. (extend all rows in the df returned by
<code>split_file</code> with these params)</li>

<li>iteratively merge all of these files into a single dataframe
incrementally and with restarting, and show progress using tqdm, and
use threadpool for parallelism</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now the description above mostly explains what this code was meant to
do, and the LLM generated code did exactly what I needed it to do.
</p>

<p>
Now, the interesting thing about this snippet from a language design
perspective is that it generates an &#34;incomplete&#34; program – in
particular, I don&#39;t ask the LLM to generate the function <code>split_file</code>,
and instead just give a specification for what its inputs and outputs
will be and as relevant to the rest of the task.
</p>

<p>
In a broad sense, when I&#39;m interacting with the LLM for these kinds of
scrappy one-off scripts, I&#39;m outlining the high level plan, and asking
the LLM to generate the glue code, and then manually implementing the
&#34;interesting&#34; part of the problem myself.
</p>

<p>
From a language design perspective, the question that I&#39;d like to pose
from these experiences is, how can we incorporate these kinds of
workflows into a DSL? Namely, how can we bridge the gap between the
formal and informal? My manually written code is in the realm of
&#34;formal&#34;, and my textual prompt is in the realm of &#34;informal&#34;, and in
this snippet, I do that by encoding a specification of the formal in
the informal as a text component. Can we do this automatically? Can we
build DSLs that integrate seamlessly with informal text? Maybe
automatically generating the natural language specifications based on
the types/analysis that the DSL itself does?
</p>
</div>

<div id="text-Language%20Design%20Direction%203%3A%20Language%20Design%20for%20Verified%20LLM%20Synthesis">
<div>
<p>
This is probably the most actively being researched of the directions
I&#39;ve covered in this post so far, but another interesting area for
Language Design to move towards following the advent of LLMs is
towards the design of specification langauges.
</p>

<p>
So at a high level, since LLMs have been picking up steam, there has
been a cottage industry of researchers jumping into the fray of
investigating whether we can use verification langauges, such as Dafny
or Boogie and so on, to be able to verify the output of LLM-generated
code. The first paper I saw in this direction was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643763">&#34;Towards AI-Assisted
Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods&#34;</a> (2024), though I&#39;m sure there are
now many many more that have been published, and several more in the
works.
</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>// </span><span>Example from Towards AI-Assisted Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods</span>
<span>method</span> <span>FindSmallest</span><span>(</span><span>s</span>: <span>array</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;<span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>min</span>: <span>int</span><span>)</span>
  <span>requires</span> s.Length &gt; 0
  <span>ensures</span> <span>forall</span> i :: 0 &lt;= i &lt; s.Length ==&gt; min &lt;= s<span>[</span>i<span>]</span>
  <span>ensures</span> <span>exists</span> i :: 0 &lt;= i &lt; s.Length &amp;&amp; min == s<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>{</span>
 ...
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Instead of just asking the model to generate some code, which may be
complex, intricate and contain bugs, the authors suggest instead
asking the model to generate programs in verified languages such as
Dafny with specifications. This way, users can just look at the
specifications to understand what the program does and do not need to
understand the LLM code unless the verification fails.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
From a language design perspective, the interesting questions in this
domain consist of asking how we can a) integrate these specifications
into DSLs? and b) how we can better design our verification DSLs to
capture properties of interest in bespoke domains – of course, the
properties you care about for a dialog DSL are going to be quite
different from one for maybe a packet routing DSL. Can we
automatically build specification langauges from the implementation of
our language DSL?

<div>
<p>
To conclude this article, I think LLMs pose an interesting problem for
the DSL designers – the opportunity cost for using niche languages is
now substantially increasing, and so we, as language designers, will
be held to a higher standard to justify the use of our DSLs. At the
same time, they certainly have radically changed the space of what is
possible, and also opened up several interesting problems to explore
moving forwards.
</p>

<p>
Main takeway, language design and DSLs will have to adjust for this
crazy new world we&#39;re living in, and if we&#39;re not careful, there&#39;s a
very real chance the space of language design will stagnate, and we&#39;ll
lose the diversity of fun and interesting DSLs and everyone will just
end up writing Python…
