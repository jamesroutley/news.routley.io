    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone successfully pivoted from web dev to AI/ML development?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am currently working as a senior full-stack web software engineer. I have a BSc in Computer Science, and on my own, I&#39;ve been learning more about AI/ML/deep learning. I really enjoy working with it, and I&#39;d love to find a way to work on AI stuff professionally. The problem is that I&#39;ve been working as a web developer professionally for about 10 years now, and I have no idea how I would pivot to more of a AI/data science role.</p><p>Does anyone have an experience of making this transition? As a web dev, I am senior level, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have to start from scratch on some things in the AI space. At least I have a good foundation of programming in general, math, and computer science.</p></div></div></div>
