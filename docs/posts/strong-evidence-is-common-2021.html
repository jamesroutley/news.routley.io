  <p><em>Portions of this are taken directly from <a href="https://markxu.com/three-bayes-learnings">Three Things I’ve Learned About Bayes’ Rule</a>.</em></p>

<p>One time, someone asked me what my name was. I said, “Mark Xu.” Afterward, they probably believed my name was “Mark Xu.” I’m guessing they would have happily accepted a bet at 20:1 odds that my driver’s license would say “Mark Xu” on it.</p>

<p>The prior odds that someone’s name is “Mark Xu” are generously 1:1,000,000. Posterior odds of 20:1 implies that the odds ratio of me saying “Mark Xu” is 20,000,000:1, or roughly 24 bits of evidence. That’s <strong>a lot</strong> of evidence.</p>

<p>Seeing a Wikipedia page say “X is the capital of Y” is tremendous evidence that X is the capital of Y. Someone telling you “I can juggle” is massive evidence that they can juggle. Putting an expression into Mathematica and getting Z is enormous evidence that the expression evaluates to Z. Vast odds ratios lurk behind many encounters.</p>

<p>One implication of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is that is it difficult to make money on the stock market. Generously, maybe only the top 1% of traders will be profitable. How difficult is it to get into the top 1% of traders? To be 50% sure you’re in the top 1%, you only need 200:1 evidence. This seemingly large odds ratio might be easy to get.</p>

<p>On average, people are overconfident, but <a href="https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/do-rationalists-exist/">12% aren’t</a>. It only takes 50:1 evidence to conclude you are much less overconfident than average. An hour or so of <a href="https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/icg4cze/embed/auth?source=https%3A%2F%2Fprograms.clearerthinking.org%2Fcalibrate_your_judgment.html">calibration training</a> and the resulting calibration plots might be enough.</p>

<p>Running through Bayes’ Rule explicitly might produce a bias towards middling values. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but extraordinary evidence might be more common than you think.</p>
