    <h1>Fast JavaScript-to-WASM Call from FTL</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It has been a great 3 weeks at RC, so far. Not especially proud that I stopped
writing for ~2 weeks, but it has been quite a whirlwind.</p>
<p>The most concrete thing that I&#39;ve been working on is a project I&#39;m calling
<a href="https://brainlove.dev">Brainlove</a> which is basically just random exploration
of Brainfuck tooling. It&#39;s been really cool to see how mature the compile-to-wasm
ecosystem has become. I still don&#39;t think that it would be my first choice for a
professional setting, but the developer experience is <em>much</em> better than I was
expecting. Deploying the debugger to Netlify as a static bundle was a breeze.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I&#39;ve probably been spreading myself a little bit too thin in terms of
what I&#39;m working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paired a lot with <a href="https://healeycodes.com/">Andrew</a>. Learning a lot about
effective communication in these sessions. I&#39;ve also really enjoyed reading Andrew&#39;s
website and blog.
<ul>
<li>We reached a reasonable conclusion on the 2048 strategy project. We attempted
a low-level implementation of board operations that turned out to be slower
than the naiive list-based implementation. Really interesting exercise.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sgeisenh/2048ai">repo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrote a &#34;compiler&#34; for compiling a very small expression language to Brainfuck.
This was a mind bender. We both avoided seeking out external resources so it
was a lot of fun to solve these problems from scratch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paired on a bunch of other things (ranging from Leetcode to an Octave LSP).
<ul>
<li>I think pairing has been the biggest benefit of being at RC so far. There are
so many things I <em>could</em> explore, but I really want to make the most of being
at RC right now, so I hope to continue emphasizing pairing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I put together a small python script for generating LICENSE files. There are
already a bunch of implementations of this, but I thought it would be a fun way to
learn about how to package python libraries and scripts. There are a lot of
outdated resources for python packaging, so this was surprisingly painful.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sgeisenh/genlic">repo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/genlic/">PyPI</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I hobbled together a URL shortener that runs on fly.io but is only accessible
within my tailscale network. I used an existing Flask URL shortener that I had
worked on with Rana (my wife) a while ago. Once I had a reasonable understanding
of how everything fit together, this wasn&#39;t too bad. But my mental model of networking
could probably use some work.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fly-apps/tailscale-router">repo</a> for the router code (I didn&#39;t write this)</li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sgeisenh/reeneeurl">repo</a> for the URL shortener</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/golink/">post</a> discussing go links on tailscale blog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thought a lot about how to set up an election website that enables users to
choose the voting system they use.</li>
<li>Made some progress on Crafting Interpreters in C++.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sgeisenh/cpplox">repo</a></li>
<li>Most of garbage collection is in place</li>
<li>Spent a good amount of time comparing performance with clox across both
x86-64 and Apple silicon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read a few chapters of <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">DDIA</a>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s a small reading group for the book at RC where we&#39;ve had some great
discussion, so far. Planning to coordinate reading some papers as well!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finished the available <a href="https://protohackers.com/">Protohackers</a> problems in Python.
These are a blast. I&#39;ve really been enjoying <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/">Amos&#39;</a>
series covering Advent of Code in Rust. I think it would be fun to put together
a similar style series for Protohackers describing my approach to building out solutions
(first in Python, then translating to Rust).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a ton of structure to this post, but I want to get back into the swing of
writing regularly, so I&#39;m lowering the bar a little bit. If you&#39;ve made it this
far, thanks for reading!</p>
