    NAGOYA (Kyodo) -- Shoichiro Toyoda, the honorary chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. who transformed the Japanese automaker into a leading global brand, died of heart failure on Tuesday, the company said. He was 97.

<p>
    Toyoda, a third-generation scion of the founding family who inherited its stake in the business, is credited with establishing a culture of quality control that helped Toyota evolve into a world-leading automaker. He was also responsible for pushing Toyota, which had started life as a loom manufacturer, to produce vehicles overseas.
</p>

<p>
    A grandson of Sakichi Toyoda, who founded the Toyota group, and son of Kiichiro Toyoda, the founder of Toyota&#39;s predecessor Toyota Motor Co., Shoichiro Toyoda joined the company as a board member at just 27 years of age.
</p>

<p>
    After serving as president of Toyota Motor Sales Co. under the Toyota group, he became the first president of what is now Toyota Motor Corp., a new company formed after the merger of its manufacturing and sales companies in 1982. He held the position until 1992 when he became chairman.
</p>

<p>
    Toyoda propelled overseas production on the back of Japan&#39;s economic growth, with Toyota, headquartered in Aichi Prefecture, setting up a joint venture with General Motors Co. in the United States in 1984.
</p>

<p>
    Plants in Kentucky and Canada were built in 1986, significantly boosting the company&#39;s production capacity. It was also in the 1980s when Toyota actively expanded beyond the North American market.
</p>

<p>
    The auto giant currently has production sites all over the world, including Europe, China and Africa.
</p>

<p>
    Following the family tradition of launching a new business each generation, Toyoda focused his efforts on the housing business. His grandfather Sakichi had started the manufacturing of looms and his father Kiichiro the production of automobiles.
</p>

<p>
    The Toyoda-initiated business, known as Toyota Housing Corp., is now a key unit of Prime Life Technologies Corp., a joint venture between Toyota, Panasonic Holdings Corp, and Mitsui &amp; Co.
</p>

<p>
    It has played a major role as Toyota tries to build next-generation cities that integrate electrified cars with housing.
</p>

<p>
    Toyoda served as the head of the Japan Business Federation, the country&#39;s biggest business lobby, for four years through 1998, grappling with reinvigorating a stagnant Japanese economy and carrying out administrative and financial reforms.
</p>

<p>
    Even after leaving the board in 2009, Toyoda continued to have a heavy influence over the company, which is now one of the world&#39;s largest automakers. Toyoda had been honorary chairman since 1999.
</p>

<p>
    A native of Nagoya, he contributed to the development of the city&#39;s economy, serving as chairman of the organization that hosted the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan.
</p>

<p>
    He also served as the head of Kaiyo Academy, an all-male boarding school he helped establish in Gamagori, Aichi, which is modeled after a British private school.
</p>

<p>
    Toyoda was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in the United States in 2007.
</p>

<p>
    The company plans to hold a farewell gathering at a later date, although details have not been decided, it said.
</p>

<p>
    His son and current president, Akio Toyoda, 66, announced last month he will promote Koji Sato, the 53-year-old head of the auto group&#39;s Lexus brand operation, to succeed him in April, with Toyoda to become chairman.
