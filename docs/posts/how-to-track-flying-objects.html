    <h1>Ask HN: How to track flying objects?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>What technology can be used to track multiple flying objects in a space like football field and up to 100 ft  above it? Attaching something lightweight to each object is fine. I would like to visualise an FPV drone race with computer graphics in realtime.<p>Any ideas are welcome thanks!</p></div></div>
