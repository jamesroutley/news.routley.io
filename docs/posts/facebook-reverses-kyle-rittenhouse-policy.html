    <h1>Facebook reverses Kyle Rittenhouse policy</h1>

Per standard practice in these situations, we are also removing praise and support of the shooter and have also blocked searches of his name on our platforms. 2/n</p>— Brian Fishman (@brianfishman) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianfishman/status/1299084287686434816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

The line between support and glorification of violence is a difficult judgement for moderators.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In December last year <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55212179">the BBC found videos on YouTube</a> of people recreating Kyle Rittenhouse&#39;s shooting at gun ranges. The platform removed them only after they were alerted to the videos. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, YouTube did not remove other videos that glorified Mr Rittenhouse&#39;s actions. YouTube&#39;s moderation of Rittenhouse content was on a case by case basis.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Facebook took a very different approach. It removed Mr Rittenhouse&#39;s accounts. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Even though people were allowed to talk about Mr Rittenhouse on the platform, a search of his name would result in a list of blank pages. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Removing support for Rittenhouse on such a controversial and debated topic proved hugely controversial.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His acquittal made Facebook&#39;s policy difficult to maintain. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The verdict also brought into question whether Facebook had over-corrected in moderating Rittenhouse-related content in such a way. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many right-leaning publications and broadcasters in America slammed Facebook&#39;s decision to block searches of his name. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The New York Post, for example, argued: &#34;Facebook declared Kyle Rittenhouse guilty from the start.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley said after the verdict that big tech had &#34;made up their minds on this case months ago, sought to deny Kyle Rittenhouse the presumption of innocence and censored those who disagreed&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Facebook would argue, however, that a tragic act of violence needed a tangible response.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The BBC understands that Mr Rittenhouse does not currently have a Facebook or Instagram account, but Facebook would not stop him from setting one up.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Americans react to Kyle Rittenhouse’s full acquittal</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><h2>More on this story</h2><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
