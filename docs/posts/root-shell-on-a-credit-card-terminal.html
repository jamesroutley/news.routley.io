    <h1>Root shell on a credit card terminal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>In this project, I started to reverse engineer payment card
        terminals because they seemed to be an interesting target for security
        research, given the high stakes involved. Although I initially didn’t
        know much about this industry, I did expect a ton of security features
        and a very security-hardened device. And to some degree, this was also
        correct.</p>
        <h2>First Look</h2>
        <p>The model I went with is a Worldline Yomani XR terminal. Although it
        seems to be discontinued at the time of writing, this is the model that
        is <i>everywhere</i> in Switzerland. From big grocery chains to the
        small repair shop on the corner, everyone has one or a whole fleet of
        this exact terminal.</p>
        <p>After booting it up and aimlessly clicking through the UI, I did a
        quick port scan, but couldn’t find anything interesting. So naturally,
        I started to take it apart.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg" width="100%" alt="Picture of the main PCB of the Yomani XR terminal with annotation of different board components."/></a>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The housing and the PCBs appear to be well-made. The design consists
        of multiple PCBs: a small connector board for the outward-facing
        connectors, the main board, and a vertical board the card slot sits on.
        The main SoC seems to be a custom ASIC, a dual-core Arm processor
        code-named “Samoa II” in the firmware, but I am jumping ahead.
        According to Worldline documentation, this seems to indeed be a custom
        ASIC, rather than just a rebranded off-the-shelf chip. Next to it,
        there is a small external flash and RAM.</p>
        <h2>Tamper Protections</h2>
        <p>During disassembly, I kept looking for a tamper switch that would
        detect when the device’s housing was opened, like I had seen previously
        on laptops and other devices. However, I couldn’t find such a switch.
        Rather, they use the board-to-board interconnects as a way of detecting
        when the device is opened. Because they use relatively
        pressure-sensitive Zebra strips between the boards, they have to be
        tightly screwed together. Even unscrewing some of the screws is enough
        to break contact and trigger a tamper event. Of course, the tamper
        detection must also work when the power is disconnected, so that’s the
        purpose of the coin cell battery.</p>
        <p>But this is not all in terms of tamper resistance: The “vulnerable”
        PCBs are covered by zick-zack traces that act as a tamper detection
        mechanism. Accidentally breaking a single copper trace during a
        physical penetration attempt (hole drill etc.) is enough to trigger the
        tamper detection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The card slot itself is contained in an additional, internal
        housing. Wrapped around this housing, there is a flex PCB acting as
        tamper protection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inner plastic housing is wrapped in a flex PCB with zick zack traces, acting as a temper detection mechanism."/></a>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>After putting the device back together, it was clear that my
        intrusion had not gone undetected. Sure enough, the device would now
        only show a big red screen screaming “TAMPER DETECTED”. In this mode,
        the device seems to be fully unresponsive to any kind of external
        input. So, game over?</p>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <h2>Chip-Off Firmware Extraction</h2>
        <p>Since any “runtime” exploration seems to be futile now, I wanted to
        take a look a the firmware. For this, I desoldered the on-board flash
        chip, soldered some wires to it in “dead bug” style and proceeded to
        dump the contents.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg" width="100%" alt="Flash chip in BGA housing mounted upside-down on a perfboard. Thin copper wires are connected from the chip’s contacts to a flash reader."/></a>
            <figcaption>
              BGA flash chip of the card terminal desoldered and connected to a
              flash reader.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>To my surprise, the contents seemed to be entirely unencrypted!
        However, the contents seemed to have a strange ECC layout. Instead of
        following the flash chip’s inherent page layout and putting the ECC
        data in the interleaved spare areas, it appeared as if the some ECC
        data was present in the page and some clear text was in the spare
        areas. With the help of some friends, I figured out the layout: instead
        of using the standard 2048 byte payload + 64 byte ECC/spare layout, it
        uses 3x 694 byte chunks of data each followed by 10 ECC bytes. The ECC
        bytes do not appear to be all used. Instead, the last 16 bytes of the
        spare area seem to act as metadata for the YAFFS2 file system. Now
        normally, there are less ECC bytes per page and therefore the usable
        metadata area for the filesystem is larger than 16 bytes. For this
        reason, the YAFFS2 filesystem had to be patched to work with smaller
        metadata structures.</p>
        <p>I implemented a compatible filesystem reader and with it, I could
        successfully dump the filesystem contents!</p>
        
        <p>Now it was clear that this device runs Linux. I found a standard
        Linux filesystem with a lot of interesting files to browse through. The
        system runs a 3.6 kernel, built with Buildroot 2010.02 (!) in February
        of 2023. The system seems to use a custom bootloader, “Booter v1.7”.
        Although I don’t know how recent the firware version was that I ended
        up dumping, it must have been released after February 2023. So finding
        such an ancient kernel is rather concerning. Userspace-wise, the system
        uses classy init scripts, busybox, and uClibc (final release was 13
        years ago). libcrypt has version 0.9.26, ouch.</p>
        <h2>Finding a Root Shell on Accident</h2>
        <p>Having seen the firmware gave me some new confidence that there
        might be more stuff to find. So I reattached the flash chip using
        wires, ignoring everything I know about signal integrity. To my
        surprise the device booted up again (showing the tamper message).</p>
        <div>
          <figure>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>My next goal was to find the serial console of the Linux system.
        Surely, it must have one for debugging. By looking at a boot log, I
        might get some more valuable information. So, equipped with a logic
        analyzer, I started poking.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It didn’t take long until I found some activity on one pad of the
        unpopulated debug connector. Bingo!</p>

samoa login: 
</pre>
        <p>It even shows a login prompt, neat! So this is definitely the Linux
        boot log. Many embedded Linux systems will have such a more or less
        exposed serial console, but most of the time the login is disabled
        altogether or a random, hard-to-crack password is either hard-coded or
        generated at boot. Not expecting much, just out of curiosity, I entered
        “root” as the login, and...</p>
        <pre>samoa login: root
~ #
</pre>
        <p>Wait, what!? That’s it? I’m in?</p>
        <p>Well, yes. That was the boring story of how I got the root shell. It
        is just there, exposed. No sophisticated exploit chain, no brute-force
        password cracking required. Additionally, everything seems to still
        work although the device still shows the tamper message.</p>
        <p>Now you may say: well okay, that’s not ideal, but in order to get
        access to the exposed root shell, you need to open up the device, which
        triggers the tamper protection and effectively renders the device
        useless. But in fact, the <b>serial port is accessible from the
        outside!</b>. Without opening up the device and triggering the tamper
        protection, the debug connector can be accessed through a little hatch
        on the back of the device. All an attacker needs is just 30 seconds
        alone with the device to attach to the serial port, log in, deploy
        malware, and leave. This sounds really bad.</p>

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Actually, no. Hear me out: During my analysis of this device, it
          became clear that the Linux system is not the whole story. For
          example, there seems to be no graphics driver for the display and the
          only framebuffer device does not seem to do anything. Instead, only
          text strings seem to be passed to a binary
          (<code>display_tool</code>), that issues some inter-processor
          messages. The same goes for the key pad or the card reader itself. I
          could not find any evidence that these peripherals could be accessed
          directly from Linux.</p>
          <p>Instead, there is an entirely separate processor, refered to as
          <code>mp1</code>, that seems to handle all the “secure” stuff, like
          handling the card, getting the pin and showing information on the
          screen. The “insecure” Linux, running on the second processor,
          <code>mp2</code>, only handles the networking, the updating, and the
          business logic.</p>
          <p>The Linux core seems to always boot, regardless of the tamper
          state. From there, the secure core is booted. For this, Linux
          apparently loads a secure bootloader (named <code>loadercode</code>)
          into memory. This loadercode checks whether the tamper protections
          have been triggered and based on the result, either show the red
          screen or continue to boot the actual “secure” image
          (<code>mp1.img</code>, in the Linux filesystem). This secure image
          seems to be properly encrypted and signed by two entities.</p>

                the secure image on the second core. The loadercode is what
                displays the tamper messages on screen. The secure image, that
                handles the card, display, and key pad, is properly encrypted
                and signed.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While concerning, the exposed root shell does not seem to be as
          big of a risk as initially feared.
			While still being a huge unnecessary attack surface, and a massive oversight from the engineers in my opinion,
			I could not find any evidence that sensitive data, such as card details, could become compromised this way.
			Also, I could not definitively prove which firmware versions were vulnerable. During my research, I also encountered devices that
			had a disabled root login. My guess is that somehow this debug feature accidentally made it into production firmware at some point.
			Chances are that this was discovered and fixed internally before I reported it to the manufacturer (as I had no way of updating the firmware,
			or verifying that I was running the latest firmware).</p>
			<p>
			This project was a lot of fun and I wish I had some more time to dig deeper into the firmware and explore more possibilities.
			If you want to take on this challenge, feel free to reach out to me.
			I’d like to thank anyone involved in this project for their valuable input.
