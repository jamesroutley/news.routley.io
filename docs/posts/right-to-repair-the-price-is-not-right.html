    <h1>Right to Repair: The Price Is Not Right</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><em>This article was written by Thomas Opsomer </em></p>



<p>For many years, Right to Repair activists have been <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9712/expensive-washing-machine-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denouncing outrageously high spare parts prices</a> that effectively eliminate repair as an option, often making it more expensive than replacement. And while over these last few years, a lot has happened for the right to repair both in the EU and the US, not that much has actually changed for consumers faced with broken appliances.</p>



<p>For vacuum cleaners, washing machines and a handful of other products, repairability requirements have now been laid down in Ecodesign regulations. Manufacturers need to make sure that key parts are removable with commonly available tools and are made available to professional repairers for a number of years after the last unit is sold. All of which goes a long way toward making repair possible… But these requirements still ignore one of the biggest problems: the price of spare parts<sub><sup>. (1) </sup></sub> </p>



<p><strong>The part is more than the whole</strong></p>



<p>For about 5 years now, we’ve been keeping an eye on the price of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9712/expensive-washing-machine-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a particular circuit board for a washing machine</a> as it fluctuated between 299€ and 1073€—which is more expensive than the whole of the machine ever cost. Surely a glitch? Don’t be so sure. When looking into spare prices in more detail as we were preparing for our ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcBbBdmdvuc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Price is Right’ game</a>, we had no trouble at all finding similar examples for various products, ranging from a Samsung LCD panel that costs nearly 25% more than the TV that it’s used in, to a <a href="https://www.gardena.com/nl/producten/spareparts/motor/520437901.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">60€ motor</a> for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/Gardena-SmallCut-Electric-Trimmer-Cutting/dp/B0811VFQ6D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gardena grass trimmer that costs only 37€, shipping included</a> (see image).<sup>(2)</sup> That’s over 160% of the product price, for a single part! Unless you find a repairer that’s <em>willing to pay you </em>for the opportunity to repair your lawn trimmer, that doesn’t leave much room for any repair scenario, does it?</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a__lNpqQqeupa3NW0JrlWN_0m1CPINIaE54OAyKQLyJmBYs8Hd3NqjgvidmcslfibKNVkIijuawzhVICR8d7l03AFl1ffLGdEqmeRAuKG8cwVAbfMXMlpymCooS5mq8ckh4JgZtlFekRsPoIawPR3Ro"/></figure>



<p><em>37€ for the whole trimmer, 60€ for its motor. That’s a bad day for repair.</em></p>



<p>Now these are quite extreme examples, but it actually takes much less to kill any chance of repair. Most people will only consider a repair if the total cost of the repair is less than 30–40% of the product value.<sup>(3)</sup> Given that the cost of any given repair is usually composed of labor cost and spare parts cost (assuming there is no transportation cost for the repairer), in order for the repair to stay below the critical threshold, it is reasonable to estimate that the price of spare parts should stay below 15-20% of the product price.<sup>(4)</sup></p>



<p><strong>Bundling</strong></p>



<p>One typical reason why parts can be very costly, is a practice called <em>bundling</em>. This means that instead of selling individual parts, manufacturers only offer certain spare parts as an assembly or group of parts. This can be related to poor design choices—as in the case of a Macbook Air with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failure-prone keyboard that cannot be separated from the top housing, leading to a 500€ repair cost</a>. However bundling can also just be a matter of policy. This is the case for the above mentioned washing machine example, for which you have to buy a set consisting of two circuit boards, a knob and several other plastic parts even if just the display goes bad. These are technically different parts that can be individually replaced; it’s just that the manufacturer chose to not sell them individually. You could break something as trivial as a closing lid for a laser printer and find that it is only available together with the laser unit, setting you back a hefty 553€.<sup>(5)</sup> A particularly striking example we came across is a single, non-standard screw (if you must know it has a <em>left-hand trapezoidal thread</em>) used to fix the base plate to a <a href="https://www.toolmax.nl/ste-140-decoupeerzaag-750-watt-in-metabox-145.html?utm_source=adhouse7&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%5B201863-66745%5D%5Bec3dd4bf-05d7-4d83-9bbe-0dfd4d3d88eb%5D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">265€ Metabo jig saw</a>. The screw is not available for sale separately: you have to buy the whole base assembly (see image). <a href="https://www.toolmax.nl/metabo-316065980-grondplaat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cost: 49€</a>. </p>

<p><em>These are all the parts of a jig saw you have to buy even if you just need the screw at the bottom left…</em></p>



<p><strong>Price setting</strong></p>



<p>Bundling is just one of the ways in which some manufacturers make parts unnecessarily expensive. The simplest way is obviously to just set a high price for the parts. So what determines the price of spare parts? As with any product, a manufacturer’s price setting takes into account a series of considerations including production, transportation and storage costs as well as supply and demand, market segmenting and of course general company strategy. Hence, there can be a number of reasons for the high prices of spare parts.</p>



<p>Now we’re not saying that cost doesn’t play a role. It is true that managing a parts inventory over time is a costly affair—it’s definitely easier to sell a container of gadgets and forget about it. But the spread of prices that we encounter in the parts market is so absurdly large that it’s hard to explain based on cost factors alone. In some cases, it seems clear that manufacturers are simply applying extortionate profit margins to spare parts (a member of the EU Parliament leading work on <a href="https://repair.eu/news/broad-support-for-repair-in-the-imco-committee-of-the-eu-parliament-will-the-council-keep-up-with-the-ambition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new regulations to enable repair</a> recently said that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231027-how-the-right-to-repair-might-change-technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it reminded him of cartels</a>). The very least one can say is that most producers<em> wouldn’t be upset</em> if you bought a whole new appliance instead of paying for a part.</p>



<p><strong>Lack of competition and transparency</strong></p>



<p>Astute readers may have noticed one typical element missing from the price setting factors listed above: competitiveness. Indeed, competition is normally a key element that affects product prices, and it is counted on by many policy makers to also solve the repair cost issue. However, when it comes to spare parts, there is very little actual competition. At the risk of stating the obvious: you can’t just go shopping with Bosch and Miele to find a cheaper part for your AEG washing machine. Once you’re at the repair stage, you’re pretty much at the mercy of the brand owner, who often has a monopoly on spare parts and can therefore charge you any price they like. Whatever you choose—pay for an overpriced part or buy a new appliance—it’s a win for the industry.</p>



<p>So the trick is to take spare part prices into account well before you’re in need of repair: that is, when deciding which appliance to buy. However, this requires transparency on spare parts prices at that point in time. Some brands, such as those of the French SEB group, have made repairability into a major selling point. In principle, SEB aims to limit spare parts prices to max. 50% of the product price—although you may still end up <a href="https://www.midi-pieces-menager.fr/hachoir-moulinex-moulinette-compact-dj300/193180-ss-194295-moteur-complet-hachoir-moulinette-compact-dj300-moulinex-3077000003512.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying about 18€ for the motor</a> of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/Moulinex-DJ300110-Hachoir-Electrique-Moulinette/dp/B00I96MAXC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 28€ Moulinex chopper (produced by SEB)</a>, for a 60% part-to-product price ratio.<sup>(6)</sup> Other brands don’t share any information about their spare parts price policy, making it impossible for you to make an informed decision. </p>



<p>For some products, the French <em>indice de réparabilité </em>can help you take this into account, in order to choose a <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/lave-linge-hublot-samsung-ecobubble-ww90t634dhh-9-kg-induction-1400-trs-min-blanc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">washing machine that scores 10/10 for spare parts price</a> instead of <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/lave-linge-lave-linge-hublot-electrolux-ew2f6712bs-7-kg-1400-trs-min-blanc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that scores 2,5/10</a>, or a <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/televiseur-lg-65gx3-tv-oled-uhd-4k-65-165cm-smart-tv-4xhdmi-3xusb-dolby-atmos-noir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV that scores 7,5/10</a> instead of <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/televiseur-lg-oled65cx6-tv-oled-uhd-4k-65-164cm-smart-tv-dolby-vision-iq-4-x-hdmi-3-x-usb-classe-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that scores 0/10</a>.<sup>(7)</sup> However, you cannot search for or filter products by spare parts score on any website. You have to check them one by one by reviewing the scoring grid, which may not even be available online—although the seller is legally required to provide it upon request. </p>



<p>Ideally, we would create the necessary transparency at the EU level. However, <a href="https://repair.eu/news/new-eu-rules-for-smartphones-and-tablets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our efforts to get spare part prices included in the first EU-wide repairability score (for smartphones) were to no avail</a>. Smartphone manufacturers will have to communicate parts prices from 2025 onwards—but nothing says they can’t change them at will after you’ve bought your phone.</p>



<p>Wouldn’t it be so much easier if all manufacturers (not just for the handful of products we can expect to cover with new Ecodesign rules in the following years) had to list spare part prices on their website? Better yet, what if manufacturers had to stick to their originally published prices over time (or at least keep variations due to inflation or changes in logistics within reasonable limits)? Together, these two transparency measures would ensure prices stayed comparable instead of having them fluctuate all over the place, as was the case for that washing machine board that ranged from 299€ to 1073€. Add to that an EU repair score taking parts prices into account, and consumers would finally be able to make an informed choice when shopping for repairable products.</p>



<p><strong>Aftermarket parts</strong></p>



<p>Now interestingly, when competition <em>is</em> at work, it does indeed drive down prices—and it gives us an idea of the sometimes insane profit margins that brand owners apply to spare parts.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tyzAh_OSstSGqzVNR9TqSUbFKpOksnXOPeoDQOV5MUv3yR2VL0VzoJZtYDSt44vweffx81GZ6gOClpO5sQvOXkj3iqK9aYk0waaHq8-HpEYNNuGJ-4NokCRIy5QYTou8v14JrO3q79TQ3CyvFoPa3L4"/></figure>



<p><em>Prices (ex. VAT) for ‘original’ vs aftermarket heating element and inlet valve for a washing machine as offered on </em><a href="https://www.visynet.be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Visynet</em></a><em>, a spare parts distribution platform aimed at professional repairers.</em></p>



<p>The same goes for your Dyson vacuum cleaner motor and your Bose headphone earpads. And should the carburettor of your Husqvarna brushcutter need servicing, a set of just three rubber gaskets the size of a postage stamp will <a href="https://www.wolfswinkel.nl/husqvarna-onderdelen-parts/580684801/packningssats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set you back 47€ when bought from the product brand</a>, <a href="https://www.techniekwebshop.nl/membraanset-walbro-d20wat-d20-wat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12€ when bought from the very manufacturer that makes them for the brand</a>, and <a href="https://www.sosmembranes.com/42-kit-membranes-d20-wat-pour-walbro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 5€ from a generic aftermarket supplier</a>. While there may be subtle differences in quality between some of these parts, a 900% markup is hard to justify —and one can understand how some repairers would simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nww5Hm5BAT8&amp;t=133s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call this a rip-off</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Used parts</strong></p>



<p>Second-hand parts scavenged from discarded products may also offer a solution. Remember that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500€ keyboard repair</a> we mentioned earlier? You can also get a <a href="https://www.appleparts.nl/Topcase-incl.-keyboard-voor-MacBook-Pro-Retina-15-inch-A1398-jaar-2015-EU-layout?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqP2pBhDMARIsAJQ0CzoRNlyaKlYsYwME3WWxL9fdruvvFuEUraOrAvOy415lVcGYL4EbctkaAtqIEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refurbished keyboard for 99€</a>. This may also save you if you need a part that the manufacturer no longer provides, such as a <a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/macbook-pro-15-retina-mid-2012-early-2013-left-fan?variant=46804202029396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooling fan for that same MacBook</a>. Long-time repairers and thrift stores that recover electric appliances often have shelves full of harvested parts that they can use to fix a variety of appliances both old and new (see image).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;%20viewBox=&#39;0%200%200%200&#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FlUXorVh_PqFD1j44RcYnDCP--QwDb8a_RowuaA8WwIIS2OPpzshYAaL4X0ioQ4xfIRdH-Uircv30kgoAHu7HyPh0CiC5xfwG-e2_sYQguaTAvCzVdKFaEsOmJ3kmFxEfbK5X8XGig-TbsOb9Jc5-Kc"/></figure>

<p><strong>Serialisation limits opportunities</strong></p>



<p>However, the use of aftermarket and used parts might soon come to an end, as product manufacturers are increasingly using a technique called <a href="https://repair.eu/news/part-pairing-a-major-threat-to-independent-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>parts pairing</em></a> to restrict the use of non-original as well as recovered original parts. This means that the product refuses to operate normally, or even at all, if it detects the presence of a part – ‘original’ or not – that was not installed at the factory. Parts pairing is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already used in a wide variety of products</a> ranging from smartphones, computers and game consoles over coffee machines and blenders to tractors and other machinery, and it may soon spill over to just about any product that has any electronic components.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the solution?</strong></p>



<p>The spare parts price problem could be solved with regulations, through competition, or both. If we’re serious about repairing products instead of chucking them out, manufacturers should simply be required to offer spare parts at reasonable prices. The current proposal on <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/consumer-protection-law/consumer-contract-law/rules-promoting-repair-goods_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common rules promoting the repair of goods</a> offers a unique chance to create an obligation for fair prices for all spare parts. If on the other hand we are counting on competition to really drive spare parts prices down, we need transparency on the prices charged by brand owners as well as a level playing field for the use of new original parts, aftermarket parts and used parts. This requires a complete ban on anti-repair practices such as parts pairing and parts bundling. Ideally, we need all of this… In short, we need a <a href="https://repair.eu/news/we-need-the-right-to-repair-to-be-universal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Right to Repair</a>.</p>
