			<h3>Spotify has tried time and time again to appease Apple in a way that will follow their rules but won’t make the entire experience terrible—and Apple has said no each and every time, and they send us back to the drawing board without clear direction. Our initial flow? REJECTED. Our first fix? REJECTED. Our second fix? Again, REJECTED. The third fix? Approved, but an experience dictated by Apple at your expense.</h3>

<h3>Apple doesn’t just make the rules. They also <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-03-13/consumers-and-innovators-win-on-a-level-playing-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arbitrarily change them</a> to favor their own services and punish app developers who choose not to implement in-app purchases (IAP). And in this case that means audiobook listeners as well as authors and publishers bear the brunt, too.</h3>

<p>But Apple rules are artificially constraining the potential for audiobooks to enrich our lives every day. It’s just not fair, but that’s the game they play. Over and over again.</p>
