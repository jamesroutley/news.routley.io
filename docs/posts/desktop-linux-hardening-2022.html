    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux is <a href="https://privsec.dev/posts/linux/linux-insecurities/">not a secure desktop operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to harden it, reduce its attack surface, and improve its privacy.</p><p><strong>Before we start…</strong></p><p>Some of the sections will include mentions of unofficial builds of packages like linux‑hardened, akmod, hardened_malloc, and so on. These are not endorsements — they are merely to show that you have options to easily obtain and update these packages. Using unofficial builds of packages means adding more parties to trust, and you have to evaluate whether it is worth doing so for the potential privacy/security benefits or not.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://privsec.dev/images/fedora-tux.png" alt="Fedora Tux"/></p><h2 id="during-installation">During Installation</h2><h3 id="drive-encryption">Drive Encryption</h3><p>Most Linux distributions have an option within its installer for enabling LUKS full disk encryption. If this option isn’t set at installation time, you will have to backup your data and re-install, as encryption is applied after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning">disk partitioning</a> but before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">filesystem</a> creation.</p><p>By default, <code>cryptsetup</code> does not setup authenticated encryption. If you are configuring partitioning using the command line, you can enable integrity with the <code>--integrity</code> argument.</p><h3 id="encrypted-swap">Encrypted Swap</h3><p>Consider using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Swap_encryption">encrypted swap</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#zram-generator">ZRAM</a> instead of unencrypted swap to avoid potential security issues with sensitive data being pushed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging">swap space</a>. While ZRAM can be set up post-installation, if you want to use encrypted swap, you should set it up while partitioning your drive.</p><p>Depending on your distribution, encrypted swap may be automatically set up if you choose to encrypt your drive. Fedora <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SwapOnZRAM">uses ZRAM by default</a>, regardless of whether you enable drive encryption or not.</p><h2 id="privacy-tweaks">Privacy Tweaks</h2><h3 id="networkmanager-trackability-reduction">NetworkManager Trackability Reduction</h3><p>Most desktop Linux distributions including Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and so on come with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a> by default to configure Ethernet and Wi-Fi settings.</p><p>WfKe9vLwSvv7rN has detailed guide on <a href="https://privsec.dev/posts/linux/networkmanager-trackability-reduction/">trackability reduction with NetworkManager</a> which I highly recommend you check out.</p><p>In short, if you use NetworkManager, add the following to your <code>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-macrandomize.conf</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>[device]
</span></span><span><span>wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=yes

</span></span><span><span>wifi.cloned-mac-address=random
</span></span><span><span>ethernet.cloned-mac-address=random
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, restart your NetworkManager service:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, set your hostname to <code>localhost</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo hostnamectl hostname <span>&#34;localhost&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that randomizing Wi-Fi MAC addresses depends on support from the Wi-Fi card firmware.</p><h3 id="other-identifiers">Other Identifiers</h3><p>There are other system identifiers which you may wish to be careful about. You should give this some thought to see if it applies to your <a href="https://privsec.dev/posts/knowledge/threat-modeling/">threat model</a>:</p><dl><dt>Username</dt><dd>Your username is used in a variety of ways across your system. Consider using generic terms like “user” rather than your actual name.</dd><dt>Machine ID</dt><dd>During installation a unique machine ID is generated and stored on your device. Consider <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#machine-id">setting it to a generic ID</a>.</dd></dl><h4 id="system-counting">System Counting</h4><p>Many Linux distributions sends some telemetry data by default to count how many systems are using their software. Consider disabling this depending on your threat model.</p><p>The Fedora Project offers a <a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html#countme-label">“countme” variable</a> to much more accurately <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DNF_Better_Counting">count unique systems accessing its mirrors</a> without involving unique IDs. While currently disabled by default, you could add <code>countme=false</code> to <code>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</code> in case the default changes in the future. On rpm‑ostree systems such as Fedora Silverblue and Kinoite, the <code>countme</code> option can be disabled by <a href="https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/countme/">masking the rpm-ostree-countme timer</a>.</p><p><a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Statistics">openSUSE uses a unique ID to count systems</a>, which can be disabled by deleting the <code>/var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId</code> file.</p><p><a href="https://zorin.com/legal/privacy/#census">Zorin OS also uses a unique ID to count systems.</a> You can opt‑out by running <code>sudo apt purge zorin-os-census</code> and optionally holding the package with <code>sudo apt-mark hold zorin-os-census</code> to avoid accidental reinstallation.</p><p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-store-metrics">snapd (Snap) assigns a unique ID to your installation and uses it for telemetry.</a> While this is generally not a problem, if your threat model calls for anonymity, you should avoid using Snap packages and uninstall snapd. Accidental reinstallation on Ubuntu can be prevented with <code>sudo apt-mark hold snapd</code>.</p><p><em>Of course, this is a non‑exhaustive list of telemetry on different Linux distributions. If you are aware of other tracking mechanisms used by these or other distributions, feel free to make a <a href="https://github.com/PrivSec-dev/privsec.dev/blob/main/content/posts/linux/Linux-Desktop-Hardening.md">pull request</a> or <a href="https://github.com/PrivSec-dev/privsec.dev/discussions">discussion post</a> detailing them!</em></p><h3 id="keystroke-anonymization">Keystroke Anonymization</h3><p>You could be <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization">fingerprinted based on soft biometric traits</a> when you use the keyboard. The <a href="https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak">Kloak</a> package could help you mitigate this threat. It is available as a .deb package from <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Packages_for_Debian_Hosts">Kicksecure’s repository</a> and an <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kloak-git">AUR package</a>.</p><p>With that being said, if your threat model calls for using something like Kloak, you are probably better off just using Whonix.</p><h2 id="application-confinement">Application Confinement</h2><p>Some sandboxing solutions for desktop Linux distributions do exist; however, they are not as strict as those found in macOS or ChromeOS. Software installed with distro package managers (DNF, APT, etc.) typically have <strong>no</strong> sandboxing or confinement whatsoever. Several projects which aim to tackle this problem are discussed here.</p><h3 id="flatpak">Flatpak</h3><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GkgPIJp8_30" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p><a href="https://flatpak.org">Flatpak</a> aims to be a distribution-agnostic package manager for Linux. One of its main goals is to provide a universal package format which can be used in most Linux distributions. It provides some <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html">permission control</a>. With that being said, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#flatpak">Flatpak sandboxing is quite weak</a>.</p><p>You can restrict applications further by setting <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak-override">Flatpak overrides</a>. This can be done with the command line or by using <a href="https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal">Flatseal</a>. Some sample overrides are provided by <a href="https://github.com/tommytran732/Flatpak-Overrides">me</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rusty-snake/kyst/tree/main/flatpak">rusty-snake</a>. Note that this only helps with lax high‑level default permissions and cannot solve the low‑level issues like <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> access or an insufficient seccomp blacklist.</p><p>Some sensitive permissions of note:</p><ul><li><code>--share=network</code>: network and internet access</li><li><code>--socket=pulseaudio</code>: the PulseAudio socket, grants access to all audio devices (including inputs)</li><li><code>--device=all</code>: access to all devices (including webcams)</li><li><code>--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets</code>: D‑Bus access to secrets stored on your keychain</li></ul><p>If an application works natively with Wayland (<em>not</em> running through the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html">XWayland</a> compatibility layer), consider revoking its access to X11 (<code>--nosocket=x11</code>) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">inter‑process communications (IPC)</a> socket (<code>--unshare=ipc</code>) as well.</p><p>Many Flatpak apps ship with broad filesystem permissions such as <code>--filesystem=home</code> and <code>--filesystem=host</code>. Some applications implement the <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/portal-api-reference.html">Portal API</a>, which allows a file manager to pass files to the Flatpak application (e.g. VLC) without specific filesystem access privileges. Despite this, many of them <a href="https://github.com/flathub/org.videolan.VLC/blob/master/org.videolan.VLC.json">still declare <code>--filesystem=host</code></a>.</p><p>My strategy to deal with this is to revoke all filesystem access first, then test if an application works without it. If it does, it means the app is already using portals and no further action is needed. If it doesn’t, then I start granting permission to specific directories.</p><p>As odd as this may sound, <strong>you should not enable (blind) unattended updates of Flatpak packages</strong>. If you or a Flatpak frontend (app store) simply executes <code>flatpak update -y</code>, Flatpaks will be automatically granted any new permissions declared upstream without notifying you. Using automatic update with GNOME Software is fine, as it does not automatically update Flatpaks with permission changes and notifies the user instead.</p><h3 id="snap">Snap</h3><p>Snap is another distribution-agnostic package manager with some sandboxing support. It is developed by Canonical and heavily promoted in Ubuntu.</p><p>Snap packages come in <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement">two variants</a>: classic, with no confinement, and strictly confined, where AppArmor and cgroups v1 are used to facilitate sandboxing. If a snap uses classic confinement (“classic snap”), you are better off installing an equivalent package from your distribution’s repository if possible. If your system does not have AppArmor, then you should avoid Snap entirely. Additionally, most modern systems outside of Ubuntu and its derivatives use cgroups v2 by default, so you have to set <code>systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0</code> in your kernel parameters to get cgroups v1 working.</p><p>Snap permissions can be managed via the Snap Store or Ubuntu’s custom patched GNOME Control Center.</p><p>On Ubuntu, you can replace various .deb packages with strictly confined snaps to minimize the attack surface. Some examples of these packages are the printing stack or <code>ufw</code>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://privsec.dev/images/ubuntu-cups-snap.png" alt="Cups Snap"/>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://privsec.dev/images/ubuntu-ufw-snap.png" alt="UFW Snap"/></p><p>One caveat with Snap packages is that you only have control over the interfaces declared in their manifests. For example, Snap has separate interfaces for <code>audio-playback</code> and <code>audio-record</code>, but some packages will only declare the legacy <code>pulseaudio</code> interface which grants access to both play and record audio. Likewise, some applications may work perfectly fine with Wayland, but the package maintainer may only declare the X11 interface in their manifest. For these cases, you need to reach out to the maintainer of the snap to update the manifest accordingly.</p><h3 id="firejail">Firejail</h3><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uUEkHd60Zyo" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p><a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/">Firejail</a> is another method of sandboxing. As it is a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">setuid</a> binary, it has a large attack surface which increase susceptibility to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation">privilege escalation vulnerabilities</a>. <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#firejail">Madaidan offers additional details on how Firejail can worsen the security of your device.</a></p><p>If you do use Firejail, <a href="https://github.com/netblue30/firetools">Firetools</a> can help to quickly manage application permissions and launch sandboxed applications. Note that Firetools configurations are temporary with no option to save profiles for long‑term use.</p><p>Firejail can also confine X11 windows using Xpra or Xephr, something that Flatpak and Snap cannot do. I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/x11-guide/">their documentation on X11 sandboxing</a>.</p><p>One trick to launch applications with their Firejail profile is to use the <code>sudo firecfg</code> command. This will create a symlink <code>/usr/local/bin/app_name_here</code> pointing to Firejail, which will get used automatically by most .desktop files (which do not specify the absolute paths of their binaries) to use will launch the application through the symlink and have Firejail sandbox them this way. Of course, this is bypassable if you or some other applications launch the application directly from <code>/usr/bin/app_name_here</code> instead.</p><h3 id="mandatory-access-control">Mandatory Access Control</h3><p>Common Linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control">mandatory access control (MAC)</a> frameworks require policy files in order to force constraints on the system. The two most notable are <a href="https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux">SELinux</a> (used on Android and Fedora‑based distributions) and <a href="https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor">AppArmor</a> (used on Debian‑based distributions and most openSUSE variants).</p><p>Fedora includes SELinux preconfigured with some policies to confine system daemons (background processes). You should keep it in <em>enforcing</em> mode.</p><p>openSUSE gives the choice of SELinux or AppArmor during the installation process. You should stick to the default for each variant (AppArmor for <a href="https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/">Tumbleweed</a> and SELinux for <a href="https://microos.opensuse.org/">MicroOS</a>). openSUSE’s SELinux policies are derived from Fedora.</p><p>Arch and its derivatives often do not come with a mandatory access control system, and you must manually install and configure <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AppArmor">AppArmor</a>.</p><p>Note that, unlike Android, traditional desktop Linux distributions typically do not have full system Mandatory Access Control policies; only a few system daemons are actually confined.</p><h3 id="making-your-own-policiesprofiles">Making Your Own Policies/Profiles</h3><p>You can make your own AppArmor profiles, SELinux policies, <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">bubblewrap</a> profiles, and <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">seccomp</a> blacklist to have better confinement of applications. This is an advanced and sometimes tedious task, but there are various projects you could use as reference:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/apparmor-profile-everything">Kicksecure’s apparmor-profile-everything</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/krathalan/apparmor-profiles">Krathalan’s AppArmor profiles</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/noatsecure/hardhat-selinux-templates">noatsecure’s SELinux templates</a></li><li><a href="https://sr.ht/~seirdy/bwrap-scripts">Seirdy’s bubblewrap scripts</a></li></ul><h3 id="securing-linux-containers">Securing Linux Containers</h3><p>If you’re running a server, you may have heard of containers. They are more common in server environments where individual services are built to operate independently. However, you may sometimes see them on desktop systems as well, especially for development purposes.</p><p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is one of the most popular container solutions. It does <strong>not</strong> offer a proper sandbox, meaning there is a large kernel attack surface. You should follow the <a href="https://privsec.dev/posts/linux/docker-and-oci-hardening/">Docker and OCI Hardening guide</a> to mitigate this problem. In short, there are things you can do like using rootless containers (via configuration changes or <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>), using a runtime which provides a psuedo‑kernel for each container (<a href="https://gvisor.dev/">gVisor</a>), and so on.</p><p>Another option is <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a> which masquerades virtual machines as containers. Each Kata container has its own kernel and is isolated from the host.</p><h2 id="security-hardening">Security Hardening</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://privsec.dev/images/opensuse-computer.jpg" alt="opensuse-computer.jpg"/></p><h3 id="umask-077">Umask 077</h3><p>On distributions besides openSUSE, consider changing the default <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Umask">umask</a> for both root and regular users to <code>077</code> (symbolically, <code>u=rwx,g=,o=</code>). <em>On openSUSE, a umask of 077 can break snapper and is thus not recommended.</em></p><p>The configuration for this varies per distribution, but typically it can be set in <code>/etc/profile</code>, <code>/etc/bashrc</code>, or <code>/etc/login.defs</code>.</p><p>Note that, unlike on macOS, this will only change the umask for the shell. Files created by running applications will not have their permissions set to 600.</p><h3 id="microcode-updates">Microcode Updates</h3><p>You should make sure your system receives microcode updates to get fixes and mitigations for CPU vulnerabilities like <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>.</p><p>Debian does not ship microcode updates by default, so be sure to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList">enable the non-free repository</a> and install the <code>microcode</code> package.</p><p>On Arch Linux, make sure you have the <code>intel-ucode</code> or <code>amd-ucode</code> package installed.</p><p>If you are looking to use the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/">GNU Guix</a> distribution, you should absolutely use the <a href="https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix">Nonguix channel</a> or similar to get microcode updates.</p><p>Avoid the Linux-libre kernel at all costs, as they <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNU-Linux-Libre-5.13">actively block loading binary‑only microcode</a>.</p><h3 id="firmware-updates">Firmware Updates</h3><p>Many hardware vendors offer firmware updates to Linux systems through the <a href="https://fwupd.org/">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>. You can download and install updates using the following commands:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Update metadata</span>
</span></span><span><span>fwupdmgr refresh
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Download and install firmware updates</span>
</span></span><span><span>fwupdmgr update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Some distributions like Debian do not have fwupd installed by default, so you should check for its existence on your system and install it if needed.</p><p>Several graphical frontends integrate with fwupd to offer firmware updates (GNOME Software, KDE Discover, Snap Store, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gnome-firmware">GNOME Firmware</a>, Pop!_OS Settings app). However, not all distributions offer this integration by default, so you should check your specific system and setup scheduled update notifications using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd/Timers">systemd timers</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cron">cron</a> if needed.</p><h3 id="firewall">Firewall</h3><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewall</a> may be used to secure connections to your system.</p><p>Red Hat distributions (such as Fedora) and openSUSE typically use <a href="https://firewalld.org/">firewalld</a>. Red Hat maintains <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/using-and-configuring-firewalld_configuring-and-managing-networking">extensive documentation about firewalld and its graphical frontend firewall-config</a>.</p><p>Distributions based on Debian or Ubuntu typically use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)</a>. As the name suggests, it is much less sophisticated than firewalld. One notable missing feature is the ability to apply different firewall rules for different connections (see <em>zones</em> in firewalld).</p><p>You could also set your default firewall zone to drop packets. To implement this with firewalld (with the necessary exceptions for IPv6):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=drop
</span></span><span><span>firewall-cmd --add-protocol=ipv6-icmp --permanent
</span></span><span><span>firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcpv6-client --permanent
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These firewalls use the <a href="https://netfilter.org/">netfilter</a> framework and therefore cannot (without the help of strict <a href="#mandatory-access-control">mandatory access control</a>) protect against malicious software running privileged on the system, which can insert their own routing rules that sidestep firewalld/ufw.</p><p>There are some per‑binary outbound firewalls such as <a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch">OpenSnitch</a> and <a href="https://safing.io/portmaster/">Portmaster</a> that you could use as well. But, just like firewalld and ufw, they are bypassable.</p><p>If you are using Flatpak packages, you can <a href="#flatpak">set an override to block network access</a>. This is not bypassable.</p><p>If you are using non‑classic Snap packages on a system that <a href="#snap">supports proper confinement (both AppArmor and cgroups v1 present)</a>, you can use the Snap Store to revoke network permission. This is also not bypassable.</p><h3 id="kernel-hardening">Kernel Hardening</h3><p>There are several things you can do to harden the Linux kernel, including setting appropriate <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_parameters">kernel parameters</a> and blacklisting unnecessary kernel modules.</p><p><em>This section extensively references <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html">Madaidan’s Linux Hardening Guide</a> and in the interest of brevity does not repeat all the information contained there. You are strongly encouraged to read through the relevant sections of Madaidan’s guide (linked for convenience).</em></p><h4 id="runtime-kernel-parameters-sysctl">Runtime Kernel Parameters (sysctl)</h4><p><em>See <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#sysctl">“2.2 Sysctl”</a> in Madaidan’s guide.</em></p><p>Madaidan recommends that you disable <a href="https://www.containerlabs.kubedaily.com/LXC/Linux%20Containers/User_namespaces.html">unprivileged user namespaces</a> due to the <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">significant attack surface for privilege escalation</a>. However, some software such as Podman and LXC relies on unprivileged user namespaces. If you wish to use such software, do not disable <code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone</code>.</p><p>If you are using Kicksecure or Whonix, most of this hardening is included by default. If you are using Debian, you should consider <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian">morphing it into Kicksecure</a>. On other distributions, you can copy the <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/tree/master/etc/sysctl.d">configuration files from Kicksecure</a> into <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> (but note that these configurations do not disable unprivileged user namespaces). There are also a few things in <code>30_security-misc.conf</code> to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The <code>bluetooth</code> and <code>btusb</code> kernel modules are disabled. You need to comment out <code>install bluetooth /bin/disabled-bluetooth-by-security-misc</code> and <code>install btusb /bin/disabled-bluetooth-by-security-misc</code> to use Bluetooth.</li><li>Apple filesystems are disabled. This is generally fine on non-Apple systems; however, if you are using an Apple device, you <strong>must</strong> check what filesystem your EFI partition uses. For example, if your EFI filesystem is HFS+, you need to comment out <code>install hfsplus /bin/disabled-filesys-by-security-misc</code>, otherwise your computer will not be able to boot Linux.</li><li>The <code>cdrom</code> and <code>sr_mod</code> modules are merely <em>blacklisted</em> (can still be loaded at runtime with <code>modprobe</code>). If you have no intention to ever use CD‑ROM devices, they should be <em>disabled</em> by <em>un</em>commenting the respective <code>install</code> lines. (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module#Using_files_in_/etc/modprobe.d/_2">More about how this works on the ArchWiki</a>)</li><li>To produce informative errors when utilising the configuration file, all 10 of the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/tree/master/bin">debugging scripts</a> should be copied into <code>/bin/</code>.</li></ul><h4 id="boot-parameters">Boot Parameters</h4><p><em>See <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#boot-parameters">“2.3 Boot parameters”</a> in Madaidan’s guide and <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/tree/master/etc/default/grub.d">Kicksecure boot parameters</a>.
