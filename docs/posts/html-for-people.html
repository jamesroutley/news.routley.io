<p>HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody, the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very special one—the one the web is built on.</p>
<p>I’m <a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a>. I’ve been building websites since the early 2000s. Though I work professionally in the field, I feel strongly that <em>anyone</em> should be able to make a website with HTML if they want. This book will teach you how to do just that. It doesn’t require any previous experience making websites or coding. I will cover everything you need to know to get started in an approachable and friendly way.</p>
