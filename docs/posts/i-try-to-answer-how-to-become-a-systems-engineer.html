    <h1>I try to answer “how to become a systems engineer”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
I got some anonymous feedback a while back asking if I could do an 
article on how to become a systems engineer.  I&#39;m not entirely sure that 
I can, and part of that is the ambiguity in the request.  To me, a 
&#34;systems engineer&#34; is a Real Engineer with actual certification and 
responsibilities to generally not be a clown.  That&#39;s so far from the 
industry I work in that it&#39;s not even funny any more.
</p><p>
Seriously though, if you look up &#34;systems engineering&#34; on Wikipedia, it 
talks about &#34;how to design, integrate and manage complex systems over 
their life cycles&#34;.  That&#39;s definitely not my personal slice of the 
world.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever taken anything through a whole &#34;life 
cycle&#34;, whatever that even means for software.
</p><p>
In the best case scenario, I suppose some of my software has gotten to 
where it&#39;s &#34;feature complete&#34; and has nothing obviously wrong with it.  
Then it just sits there and runs, and runs, and runs.  Then, some day, I 
move on to some other gig, and maybe it keeps running.  I&#39;ve never had 
something go from &#34;run for a long time&#34; to &#34;be shut down&#34; while I was 
still around.
</p><p>
This is not to say that I haven&#39;t had long-lived stuff of mine get shut 
down.  I certainly have.  It&#39;s just that it&#39;s all tended to happen long 
enough after I left that it wasn&#39;t me managing that part of the &#34;life 
cycle&#34;, so I heard about it second- or third-hand and much much later.
</p><p>
If anything, some things have lived far too long.  My workstation at the 
web hosting support gig started its life with me in 2004 as a pile of 
parts that had formerly been a dedicated server.  It had a bunch of 
dumb tools that I wrote and other people found useful.  It should 
have been used to inspire the &#34;real&#34; programmers at that company to 
code up replacements, but seemingly did not.  That abomination lived 
until *at least* 2011, or five years after I moved on from that 
company.  None of that stuff was intended to run long-term, but 
someone kept tending it for years and years.  It was awful.
</p><p>
But, okay, let&#39;s be charitable here.  Maybe the feedback isn&#39;t asking 
for that exact definition, but rather something more like &#34;how to get a 
job sort-of like the things I&#39;ve done over the years&#34;.  That&#39;s the kind 
of thing I definitely could take a whack at answering, assuming you like 
caveats.
</p><p>
I think it goes something like this: you start from the assumption that 
when you see something, you wonder why it is the way it is.  Then maybe 
you observe it and maybe do a little research to figure out how it came 
to be the thing you see in front of you.  This could go for just about 
anything: a telephone, a scale, a crusty old road surface, a forgotten 
grove of fruit trees, you name it.  By research, I mean maybe you go 
poking around: try to open that scale with a screwdriver, get out of 
the car and walk down the old road, or turn over some of the dirt in 
the field to see if you can find any identifying marks.
</p><p>
I should also point out that this goes for trying to understand 
how people and groups of people came to be the way they are, too, but 
most tend to not respond well to being opened with screwdrivers, walked 
on, or turned over in the dirt.  (And if they do, well, don&#39;t yuck their 
yum.)
</p><p>
Anyway, if you start from this spot, then maybe you start coming up with 
some hypotheses for how something happened, and then sort of mentally 
file that away for later.  Or, maybe you even write it down.  Then as 
more data comes down the pipe over the years, you revisit those thoughts 
and notes and refine them.  Some notions are discarded (and noted as to 
why), but others are reinforced and evolved.
</p><p>
Do this for a while, and sooner or later you might have some working 
models.  They might not necessarily be the actual explanation for why 
something is the way it is, but it gives you a starting point.
</p><p>
Then, one day, something breaks, and you end up getting involved.  It 
might be a high-level system that&#39;s new to you, but it has some 
low-level stuff deep inside, and you recognize some of that.  One of 
those low-level things had a history of doing a certain thing, and that 
never changed.  They might&#39;ve built a whole obscure system over top of 
it, but the fundamentals are still there, and they still break the same 
way.  You go and look, and sure enough, some obscure thing has 
happened.  Nobody else saw something like this before, and so when you 
point it out and flip it back to sanity to restore the rest of the 
system, they look at you like you just pulled off some deep magic.
</p><p>
The question is: did you, really?  It&#39;s all relative.  If you&#39;ve been 
poking and prodding at things and have remembered the results of these
experiments from over the years, it&#39;s not really new to you.  It&#39;s just 
one of many events and might not be anything particularly special by 
itself.  It just happened to be important on this occasion.
</p><p>
Some people will accept this explanation.  Others will refuse it and 
will insist that you are a magician for fixing &#34;the unfixable&#34;.  A few 
others will know exactly what you did because they did it themselves 
once upon a time.
</p><p>
Then there are the one or two in every sufficiently large crowd who will 
see that you are being celebrated for knowing and utilizing some obscure 
factoid, and they will make it their mission to wreck your world.  
Basically, they have to make your random happenstance about them 
somehow, and so they make it about how it hurt them and how they need to 
get back at you.  If this sounds pathological, it&#39;s because it is, and 
unfortunately you will encounter this at any company which doesn&#39;t have 
the ability to screen out the psychos.
</p><p>
This also goes for the web as a whole.  Having something you&#39;ve done be 
(temporarily!) elevated to a point of visibility somewhere public will 
just set these people off.  This, too, is enabled by having forums which 
don&#39;t notice this and deal with their pests.
</p><p>
Now, for some examples of obscure knowledge that paid off, somehow.
</p><p>
pid = fork(); ... kill(pid, SIGKILL); ... but they didn&#39;t check for -1.  
&#34;kill -9 -1&#34; as root nukes everything on the box.  This takes down the 
cat pictures for a couple of hours one morning because it turns out you 
need web servers to run a web site.  Somehow, the bit in the kill(1) 
man page about &#34;it indicates all processes except the kill process 
itself and init&#34; stuck in my head.  Also, the bit in the fork(2) man 
page that says &#34;on failure, -1 is returned in the parent&#34;.
</p><p>
malloc(1213486160) is really malloc(0x48545450) is really 
malloc(&#34;HTTP&#34;).  I think this came from years of digging around in hex 
dumps and noticing that the letters in ASCII tend to bunch together 
(this is entirely deliberate).  Seeing four of them in a row in the same 
range with nothing going over 0x7f suggested SOME WORD IN ALL CAPS.  It 
was.
</p><p>
The fact I had seen some of this stuff before is just linked to some 
chance events in my life, combined with doing this kind of ridiculous 
work for a rather long time now.  There are plenty of other times when 
something broke (or was generally flaky) and I had no idea what it could 
possibly be, and had to work up from first principles.
</p><p>
For someone who&#39;s just getting started, it&#39;s a given that you haven&#39;t 
seen many of these events yet.  Don&#39;t feel too badly about it.  If you 
keep doing it, you&#39;ll build up your own library of wacky things that 
could only be earned by slogging away at the job for years and years.
</p><p>
Also, if you think this is nuts and choose another path, I don&#39;t blame 
you.  This *is* nuts, and it&#39;s entirely reasonable to seek something 
that doesn&#39;t require years of arcane experiences to somehow become 
effective.
