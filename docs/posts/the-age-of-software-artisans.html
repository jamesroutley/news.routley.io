<blockquote>
<p><em>Writing software is dead, long live writing software!</em></p>

<p>The world always changes. It’s the only true, everything else is guessing.</p>
<p>People who’ve worked in tech for a long time know that things come and go. We’ve been through this before, and we’ll go through it many times again.</p>
<p><em>Maybe they do now,</em></p>

<p>For years, I’ve seen people call themselves software artisans. Now that title makes sense.</p>
<p>In the coming years, we’ll see more and more people making software like someone building a table in their backyard or garage, they’ll enjoy the process and add their own personal touch.</p>
<p>If you love coding the way we do it now, keep at it! enjoy every moment, improve yourself, learn new things, keep coding!</p>

<p>Maybe AI won’t replace all developers, maybe it’s just a new FORTRAN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me? I’ll keep writing code my way for fun. But for work, I’ll change with the times. That’s my choice.</p>
<p>See u soon!</p>
