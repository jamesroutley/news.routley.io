      </h2>
      <h3>The web is losing. Badly. But a comeback is possible.</h3>
      
    </header>
    <p><em>This post is an edited and expanded version of a now-mangled <a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/113346554300095442">Mastodon thread</a>.</em></p>

<p>Some in the JavaScript community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_9JYPLU-8s&amp;t=404s">imagine that I harbour an irrational dislike of their tools</a> when, in fact, I want nothing more than to stop thinking about them. Live-and-let-live is excellent guidance, and if it weren&#39;t for React <em>et. al.</em>&#39;s predictably ruinous outcomes, the public side of my work wouldn&#39;t involve educating about <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the problems JS-first development has caused.</a></p>
<p>But that&#39;s not what strategy demands, and strategy is my job.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been holding my fire (and the confidences of consulting counterparties) for most of the last decade. Until <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/reckoning/">this year,</a> I only occasionally posted traces documenting the worsening rot. I fear this has only served to make things look <em>better</em> than they are.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, my work helping teams deliver competitive PWAs gave me a front-row seat to a disturbing trend. The rate of failure to deliver minimally usable experiences on phones seemed to be <em>increasing</em> over time, despite the accelerating costs associated with the client-side JS-based stacks that teams were reaching for. Worse <em>and</em> costlier is a bad combo, and the opposite of what competing ecosystems did.</p>
<p>Native developers reset <em>hard</em> when moving from desktop to mobile, getting deeply in touch with the new constraints. Sure, developing a codebase multiple times is more expensive than the web&#39;s write-once-test-everywhere approach, but at least you got speed for the extra cost. But that&#39;s not what happened on the web. Contemporary frontend practice pretended that legacy-oriented, desktop-focused tools would perform fine in this new context, without ever checking if they <em>did</em>. When that didn&#39;t work, the toxic-positivity crowd blamed the messanger.</p>
<p>Frontend&#39;s <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">tragically timed turn towards JavaScript</a> means the damage isn&#39;t limited to <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/">the public sector</a> or &#34;bad&#34; developers. Some of the strongest engineers I know find themselves mired in the same quicksand. Today&#39;s popular JS-based approaches are simply unsafe at any speed. The rot is now ecosystem-wide, and JS-first culture owns a share of the responsibility.</p>
<p>But why do I care?</p>
<h2 id="platforms-are-competitions">Platforms Are Competitions <a href="#platforms-are-competitions">#</a></h2>
<p>My primary motivation is that I want the web to win.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Concretely, folks should be able to accomplish most of their daily tasks on the web. But capability isn&#39;t sufficient; for the web to win in practice, users need to turn to the browser for those tasks because it&#39;s easier, faster, and more secure.</p>
<p>A reasonable diagnostic metric of success is <em>time spent as a percentage of time on device</em>. The fraction of <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">&#34;Jobs To Be Done&#34;</a> happening on the web would be the natural leading metric, but it&#39;s hard to track.</p>
<p>This phrasing — fraction of time spent, rather than absolute time — has the benefit of not being thirsty. It&#39;s also tracked by various parties.</p>
<p>OK, but why should anyone prefer one platform over another?</p>
<p>As I see it, the web is the only generational software platform that has a reasonable shot at delivering a potent set of benefits to users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh</li>
<li>Frictionless</li>
<li>Safe by default</li>
<li>Portable and interoperable</li>
<li>Gatekeeper-free (no prior restraint on publication)</li>
<li>Standards-based, and therefore...</li>
<li>User-mediated (extensions, browser settings, etc.)</li>
<li>Open Source compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>No other successful platform provides all of these today and others that could are too small to matter.</p>
<p>Platforms like Android and Flutter deliver subsets of these properties but capitulate to capture by the host OS agenda, allowing their developers to be taxed through app stores and proprietary API lock-in. Most treat user mediation like a bug to be fixed.</p>
<p>The web&#39;s inherent properties have created an ecosystem that is unique in the history of software, both in scope and resilience.</p>
<h2 id="...and-we&#39;re-losing">...and We&#39;re Losing <a href="#...and-we&#39;re-losing">#</a></h2>
<p>So why does this result in intermittent antagonism towards today&#39;s JS community?</p>
<p>Because the web is losing, and instead of recognising that we&#39;re all in it together, then pitching in to right the ship, the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">Lemon Vendors</a> have decided that predatory delay and <em>&#34;I&#39;ve got mine, Jack&#34;</em>-ism is the best response.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &#34;losing&#34;?</p>
<p>Going back to the time spent metric, the web is cleaning up on the desktop. The web&#39;s JTBD percentage and fraction of time spent both continue to rise as we add new capabilities to the platform, displacing other ways of writing and delivering software, one fraction of a percent every year.</p>
<p>But make no mistake; the web is the indispensable ecosystem for desktop users. Who, a decade ago, thought the web would be such a threat to Adobe&#39;s native app business that it would need to respond with a <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/adobe-to-acquire-figma">$20BN acquisition attempt</a> and a full-fledged version of <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web">Photoshop (<em>real</em> Photoshop) on the web?</a></p>
<p>Model advantages grind slowly but finely. They create space for new competitors to introduce the intrinsic advantages of their platform in previously stable categories. But only when specific criteria are met.</p>
<h2 id="win-condition">Win Condition <a href="#win-condition">#</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, challengers need <strong>a cost-competitive channel</strong>. That is, users have to be able to acquire software that runs on this new platform without a lot of extra work. The web drops channel costs to nearly zero, assuming...</p>
<p><strong>80/20 capability</strong>. Essential use-cases in the domain have to be (reliably) possible for the vast majority (90+%) of the TAM. Some nice-to-haves might not be there, but the model advantage makes up for it. Lastly...</p>
<p><strong>It has to feel good</strong>. Performance can&#39;t suck for core tasks. It&#39;s fine for UI consistency with native apps to wander a bit. It&#39;s even fine for there to be a large peak performance delta. But the gap can&#39;t be such a gulf that it generally changes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/planning-and-measuring-performance#time">interaction class</a> of common tasks.</p>
<p>So if the web is meeting all these requirements on desktop – even running away with the lead – why am I saying &#34;the web is losing&#34;?</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265878/global-shipments-of-pcs-tablets-ultra-mobiles-mobile-phones/">more than 75% of new devices that can run full browsers are phones</a>. And the web is getting <em>destroyed</em> on mobile.</p>
<p>Utterly routed.</p>

  <figcaption>Public data <a href="https://vimeo.com/364402896">shows what I warned about, citing Google-private data, in 2019.</a> In the US, time spent in browsers continues to stagnate while smartphone use grows, and the situation is even more dire outside the states. The result is a falling fraction of time spent. This is not a recipe for a healthy web.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If that graph looks rough-but-survivable, understand that it&#39;s only this high in the US (and other Western markets) because the web was <em>already</em> a success in those geographies when mobile exploded.</p>
<p>That history isn&#39;t shared in the most vibrant growth markets, meaning the web has fallen from &#34;minuscule&#34; to &#34;nonexistent&#34; as a part of mobile-first daily life globally.</p>
<p>This is the landscape. The web is extremely likely to get cast in amber and will, in less than a technology generation, become a weird legacy curio.</p>
<p>What happens then? The market for web developers will stop expanding, and the safe, open, interoperable, gatekeeper-free future for computing will be entirely foreclosed — or at least the difficulty will go from &#34;slow build&#34; to &#34;cold-start problem&#34;; several orders of magnitude harder (and therefore unlikely).</p>
<p>This failure has many causes, but they&#39;re all tractable. This is why I have worked so hard to close the capability gaps with <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers">Service Workers</a>, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">PWAs</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/explore/notifications">Notifications</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/fugu-showcase">Project Fugu</a>, and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/">structural solutions</a> to the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">governance problems</a> that <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/08/doing-science-on-the-web/">held back progress.</a> All of these projects have been motivated by the logic of platform competition, and the urgency that comes from understanding that that web doesn&#39;t have a natural constituency.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve read any of my writing over this time, it will be unsurprising that this is why I eventually had to break silence and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">call out what Apple has done on iOS, and what Facebook and Android have done to more quietly undermine browser choice.</a></p>
<p>These gatekeepers are kneecapping the web in different, but overlapping and reinforcing ways. There&#39;s much more to say here, but I&#39;ve tried to lay out the landscape <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">over the past few years,</a>. But even if we break open the necessary 80/20 capabilities and restart engine competition, today&#39;s web is unlikely to succeed on mobile.</p>
<h2 id="you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that&#39;s-what-really-hurts">You Do It To Yourself, And That&#39;s What Really Hurts <a href="#you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that&#39;s-what-really-hurts">#</a></h2>
<p>Web developers and browsers have capped the web&#39;s mobile potential by ensuring it will feel terrible on <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">the phones most folks have.</a> A web that can win is a web that doesn&#39;t feel like sludge. And today it does.</p>
<p>This failure has many fathers. Browsers have not done nearly enough to intercede on users&#39; behalf; hell, we don&#39;t even warn users that links they tap on might take them to sites that lock up the main thread for seconds at a time!</p>
<p>Things have gotten so bad that even the extremely weak pushback on developer excess that Google&#39;s <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> effort provides is a slow-motion earthquake. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/introducing-inp">INP,</a> in particular, is forcing even the worst JS-first lemon vendors to <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">retreat to the server</a> — a tacit acknowledgement that their shit stinks.</p>
<p>So this is the strategic logic of why web performance matters in 2024; for the web to survive, it must start to grow on mobile. For that growth to start, we need the web to be a credible way to deliver these sorts of 80/20 capability-enabled mobile experiences with not-trash performance. That depends both on browsers that don&#39;t suck (we see you, Apple) and websites that don&#39;t consistently lock up phones and drain batteries.</p>
<p>Toolchains and communities that retreat into the numbing comfort of desktop success are a threat to that potential.</p>
<p>There&#39;s (much) more for browsers to do here, but developers that want the web to succeed can start without us. Responsible, web-ecology-friendly development is more than possible today, and the great news is that <a href="https://wpostats.com/">it tends to make companies more money, too!</a></p>
<p>The JS-industrial-complex culture that pooh-poohs responsibility is self-limiting and a harm to our collective potential.</p>
<h2 id="groundhog-day">Groundhog Day <a href="#groundhog-day">#</a></h2>
<p>Nobody has ever hired me to work on performance.</p>
<p>It&#39;s (still) on my plate because terrible performance is a limiting factor on the web&#39;s potential to heal and grow. Spending nearly half my time diagnosing and remediating easily preventable failure <em>is not fun</em>. The teams I sit with <em>are not having fun either</em>, and goodness knows there are APIs I&#39;d <em>much</em> rather be working on instead.</p>
<p>My work today, and for the past 8 years, has only focused on performance today because until it&#39;s fixed <em>the whole web</em> is at risk.</p>
<p>It&#39;s actually that dire, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the research I publish</a> indicates that we are not on track to cap our JS emissions or mitigate them with CPUs fast enough to prevent ecosystem collapse.</p>
<p>Contra the framework apologists, pervasive, preventable failure to deliver usable mobile experiences <em>is</em> often because we&#39;re dragging around IE8 compat and long toolchains premised on outdated priors like a ball and chain.</p>
<h2 id="reboot">Reboot <a href="#reboot">#</a></h2>
<p>Things look bad, and I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t acknowledge that it could just be too late. Apple and Google and Facebook, with the help of a pliant and credulous JavaScript community, might have succeeded where 90s-era Microsoft failed — we just don&#39;t know it yet.</p>
<p>But it seems equally likely that the web&#39;s advantages are just dormant. When browser competition is finally unlocked, and when web pages aren&#39;t bloated with <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript">half a megabyte of JavaScript (on average)</a>, we <em>can</em> expect a revolution. But we need to prepare for that day and do everything we can to make it possible.</p>
<p>Failure and collapse aren&#39;t pre-ordained. We <em>can</em> do better. We <em>can</em> grow the web again. But to do that, the frontend community has to decide that user experience, the web&#39;s health, and their own career prospects are more important than whatever JS-based dogma VC-backed SAAS vendors are shilling this month.</p>
