                        <p><strong>The web scraping API idea</strong></p><p>While building PricingBot, we used a lot of web scraping tools. And we noticed that all of them shared common flaws: hard to use, slow, not reliable, not transparent about who operates the business.</p>
<p>Having a lot of experience in web scraping, we decide to scratch our own itch by developing a web scraping API.</p>

                        <p><strong>Building the MVP</strong></p><p>We spend the whole month of June working as much as we could on the MVP. We want to validate the product quickly, and to do that we need something that works.</p>
<p>Leveraging some friends we made on web scraping forums and growth marketing communitis, we get around ten free beta-testers to try our product.</p>
<p>It allows us to iterate on what is essential to develop quickly.</p>

<p>In June, we close the free beta and ask people to take a paid subscription to continue using the product.</p>
<p>To our biggest surprise, the first customer comes 50 minutes after sending the first email. We&#39;re delighted, but we know that now the <strong>hard part begins</strong>.</p>

                        <p><strong>The keys to building a good business</strong></p><p>We know that if we want to do ScrapingBee works we need two essential things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a product that sticks: recurring revenue</li>
<li>a scalable acquisition channel</li>
</ol>
<p>About the first point, we make the bet that most of our customers have regular web scraping needs and that if we make a good product, they&#39;ll stay with us.</p>
<p>For the second one, we bet on content. Kevin had been writing a lot about web-scraping in the past years, including a full <a href="https://bellmar.medium.com/java-webscraping-book/">book</a>, and we think we can attract potential customers by writing good content.</p>

We shared it a bit all over the place, and it quickly got 20,000 visitors. A proof that people like good content, event if it is written on a company blog.</p>
<p>PS: this article has now been read by more than 70,000 people 😎</p>

                        <p><strong>Avoiding distraction.</strong></p><p>Writing good content was working well, but it was very slow. Slow to produce, but also slow to rank on Google. So we start trying a lot of other acquisition channels to try to speed the business up. It was a mistake, making us lose focus and waste money. We go back to content and spend the time to write other web scraping guides in several languages carefully:</p>

<p>But talking to customers can be challenging. Their time is precious, and most of them don&#39;t like to speak to companies for fear of getting trapped in an endless upsell call.</p>
<p>So Kevin had the idea to offer 10,000 API calls to anyone willing to discuss their web-scraping needs for 15 minutes over the phone.</p>
<p>This move allowed us to talk to around 100 people in less than three months and learn invaluable insights.</p>

                        <p><strong>Joining Tinyseed</strong></p><p>The goal with ScrapingBee was always to find a sustainable business, where we would be in complete control of what happens in the company without having the pressure to grow at all costs.
And this is precisely why we never decided to raise money. However, a few years ago, Rob Walling and his friends launched <a href="https://tinyseed.com">TinySeed</a>. An accelerator designed precisely to help people grow their business, but without any pressure to become a unicorn.</p>
<p>We applied and got lucky enough to get accepted. The money and the support we got from the program helped us grow ScrapingBee into what it is now.</p>

                        <p><strong>Improving the product</strong></p><p>2020 was a very &#34;grind&#34; year. And to be honest, all we did was the same thing over and over. Improving the product, releasing new content.
In the spring we focused a lot on the customer experience, doing everything we could to make the API as easy as possible to use. We developped SDK in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/scrapingbee/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrapingbee">JavaScript</a>, a brand new <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/documentation/">documentation</a> with snippets in 7 languages and a request builder.</p>

                        <p><strong>Slowly reaching $10k MRR</strong></p><p>In November, we finally reach $10,000 Monthly Recurring Revenue. A very symbolic milestone for us, because for the first time, it allowed us to get paid (almost) the same as our previous job, and it also meant that we were profitable.</p>
<p>But as you can see, this took a while. We started working on ScrapingBee almost 18 months before this moment.</p>

<p>And while it took us almost 18 months to get to $10k MRR, it took us only 3 months to double our revenue to $20k MRR.</p>
