    <h1>Quetzal-1 Satellite Goes Open Source</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I kind of miss the days when custom solutions were being developed.</p>
<p>– You can’t even use new or new old technologies because the whole design had been shoe-horned for Arduino/Lithium Ion batteries ( can’t use big powerful batteries, electron tubes or robust relay logic). </p>
<p>About twenty years ago, students (pupils) and radio amateurs still had to developed their own satellites based on their own ideas.</p>
<p>The solutions were fresh, unconventional. A contribution, in short. This is an aspect I don’t like about CubeSats. They’re too strict, too standarized, lacking any character, carbon copies. In short: lame.</p>
<p>Here’s an example what I’m thinking about when I think of real “hobbyists” or pupils satellites. Those were being hand-tossed by astronauts of MIR orbital complex in 1997:</p>
<p>Old project site:</p>
<p>The satellite:</p>
<p>Humble students, like you and me.</p>
<p>I kind of miss those times, in which things weren’r being so commercialized. The ISS is nice and so are Cubesats. But it’s nolonger the science and human factor that’s has priority. It’s all just commerce now and prestige. The shiny ISS is, in contrast to rusty old MIR, an instrument of publicity. </p>
<p>That being said, I’m just an user, a layman. So it’s just an opinion, after all. I saw this site years ago when learning about history of space exploration.</p>
