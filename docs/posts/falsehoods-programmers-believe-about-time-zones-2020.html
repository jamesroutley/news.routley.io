						<p>My aunt has a problem</p><p>She loves joining Zoom meetings, but they&#39;re all hosted in different time zones. It&#39;s hard to remember if she should add 4 hours, subtract 3, or what. She&#39;s not the most technical person, so google isn&#39;t an option. She has to ask for help.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And, for the less technically minded, it&#39;s also error-prone.</p><p>It got me thinking:</p><p>What if event organizers could share a link that would do the work for you? If someone clicked on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/mytime.io/5pm/EST">mytime.at/5pm/EST</a>, they would see their local version of that time. It sounded simple enough.</p><p>I began coding. </p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="699" height="493" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-5.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png 699w"/><figcaption>I later discovered mytime.io had already implemented a very similar thing, and run into the same pitfalls</figcaption></figure><p>I knew trying to manage time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&amp;ref=zainrizvi.io">is a fool&#39;s errand</a>, but that&#39;s what datetime libraries are for. I would merely build an extra time zone conversion layer on top.</p><p>Surely that couldn&#39;t be complicated</p><p>...Right?</p><p>I soon discovered just how wrong I was. One after another, I kept learning the falsehood of yet another &#34;fact&#34; that had seemed obviously true. Eventually my original vision became literally impossible to pull off without making serious compromises (more about that in a future blog post).</p><p>Hopefully this list will help you avoid the landmines I stepped on. All the falsehoods below are ones I&#39;d considered true at some point in my adult life. </p><p>Most of them I believed just one month ago.</p><h3 id="misconception-1-utc-offsets-go-from-12-to-12"><strong>Misconception #1: UTC offsets go from -12 to +12</strong></h3><p>Turns out, UTC offsets span from -12 to +14. Yeah, +14. That&#39;s gives you 27 hours UTC can be offset by (don&#39;t forget the zero offset)</p><p>How does it work? UTC-12 has the same time as UTC+12, but is one day behind. Same goes for UTC-11 and UTC+13, etc.</p><p>Why that crazy range? That was a result of pacific islanders decided they wanted to be on a specific side of the international date line. </p><p>It makes for a very jagged international date line</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--1-.png 600w"/></figure><h3 id="misconception-2-every-utc-offset-corresponds-to-exactly-one-time-zone">Misconception #2: Every UTC offset corresponds to exactly one time zone</h3><p>Here are 10 distinct time zones which are all at UTC+5:</p><ul><li>Aqtobe Time</li><li>Mawson Time</li><li>Maldives Time</li><li>Oral Time</li><li>Pakistan Standard Time</li><li>French Southern and Antarctic Time</li><li>Tajikistan Time</li><li>Turkmenistan Time</li><li>Uzbekistan Time</li><li>Yekaterinburg Time</li></ul><p>You might be wondering: if they’re all at the same UTC offset, why couldn’t all those countries just use the same time zone?

Well...</p><ol><li>Many countries want their very own time zone (how many do you think run on Myanmar Time?)</li><li>Some countries split themselves up into multiple time zones (e.g. eastern and western times)</li><li>Military time alone uses 25 time zones, one for each hour from UTC-12 to UTC+12</li><li>DST.

Or as the Europeans call it &#34;Summer Time.&#34;  </p><p>Countries practicing DST change their UTC offset twice every year.</p><h3 id="misconception-8-there-is-a-standard-format-for-declaring-time-zones">Misconception #8: <strong>There is a standard format for declaring time zones</strong></h3><p>Hah, I wish. Here are some standards I discovered, there may be more:</p><h4 id="common-name">Common name</h4><p>These are the traditional time zone names we’re used to. Example: Pacific Standard Time.</p><p>But I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an official term for these names, they just that unstandardized.</p><h4 id="iana-zone-keys">IANA zone keys</h4><p>This is as close to the official standard as you can get. It&#39;s not at all official, but it&#39;s something the developer community has rallied around.</p><p>It&#39;s a <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones?ref=zainrizvi.io">painstakingly maintained database</a> which contains all known time zone data representing the entire history of local time for places around the globe.  It doesn&#39;t give any zone a name though, preferring to use the name of the most prominent city in there, which leads to:</p><h4 id="prominent-city-based">Prominent city based</h4><p>This one is &#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/pganssle/status/1319794747876253697?ref=zainrizvi.io">basically bad UI that derives from the IANA zone keys</a>&#34;</p><p>Full time zone names come with naming complications, which we discussed above. If that wasn&#39;t enough fun, there&#39;s also the political implications of recognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.</p><p>Some developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name of a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That&#39;s why the Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select &#34;New York&#39;&#39; instead of Eastern Standard Time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="826" height="611" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h4 id="forget-time-zones-use-the-raw-utc-offset">Forget time zones, use the raw UTC offset</h4><p>W3&#39;s international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared that engineers should only store a timestamp&#39;s<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime?ref=zainrizvi.io"> raw UTC offset</a>.</p><h4 id="gps-coordinates">GPS Coordinates</h4><p>Fun fact: Many APIs for getting a region&#39;s UTC offset only want a UTC time and latitude/longitude coordinates. This lets them define any moment unambiguously and not have to worry about Daylight Saving Time.</p><p>If you squint your eyes a bit, you could consider this a fourth standard.</p><h3 id="misconception-9-daylight-saving-time-starts-at-the-same-time-every-year">Misconception #9: <strong>Daylight Saving Time starts at the same time every year</strong></h3><p>Did you think this would be the one thing world powers agree on? Each country choose when to start it&#39;s own DST</p><h3 id="misconception-10-a-country-s-time-zone-never-changes">Misconception #10: <strong>A country&#39;s time zone never changes</strong></h3><p>Almost every year some country will pass a law to edit their time zone.</p><p>In a particularly memorable example, a few years ago the Samoan islands wanted to be on the other side of the international date line to get the same weekends as their Australian trading partners. So on midnight Dec 29th, they changed their UTC offset from -11 to +13 UTC, skipping Dec 30th and going straight to Dec 31st.</p><p>Samoan citizens had one less day to celebrate the holidays that year.</p><p>On the plus side, just 40 miles away the American Samoa Islands stayed on the other side of the international date line. Now Samoans can celebrate new years on the Western Island, and then boat over to American Samoa for a second new year’s party the next night.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1169" height="461" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 1169w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h3 id="misconception-11-a-country-stays-in-the-same-time-zone-during-daylight-saving-time">Misconception #11: <strong>A country stays in the same time zone during Daylight Saving Time</strong></h3><p>Funny thing about DST, it doesn&#39;t actually change the time zone&#39;s UTC offset.  Instead, Daylight Saving Time countries switch to a different time zone, with a different name.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Texas goes from Central Standard Time to Central Daylight Time.</p><p>Chile goes from Chile Standard Time to Chile Summer Time</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="881" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 1600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 2168w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h3 id="misconception-12-daylight-saving-time-starts-around-march-and-ends-around-october">Misconception #12: <strong>Daylight Saving Time starts around March and ends around October</strong></h3><p>The Southern hemisphere has their summer in the other half of the year.
