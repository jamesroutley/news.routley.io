While this UX  element (from companies such as Crazy Egg and Rooster) has great  potential, I’ve found it far too common that websites use this to  overlay huge pop-ups across the entire screen as a last-ditch effort to  convert users.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4cdob"><span><span>The exit-intent overlay has to have been popularized by people siloed off from user experience design, because it becomes clear quite quickly  that these exit-intent overlays (1) arguably do a poor job of serving  the initial intent of increasing conversions, and (2) work against the  user’s goals, which exist [gasp!] <em>outside</em> that website.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-1vk3l"><span><span>Let me explain:</span></span></p><ol><li id="viewer-8qjn6"><p><strong>Does a poor job of increasing conversions.</strong> A  person opens a blog post about the psychology of color in marketing. The  first paragraph looks promising and she moves her cursor to the top  right to access the scrollbar. This then triggers the exit-intent  overlay, obscuring her view of the rest of the article. “Sign up for our  newsletter!” the overlay implores. If time on page and the amount a  person scrolls down a page are positive engagement metrics, why has the  site just stopped her from engaging with the rest of the article? If “<a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/management_concepts/the_rule_of_seven.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>the rule of seven</u></a>” — that  a customer needs to interact seven times before buying — is marketing  101, why does the site demand a newsletter conversion before a new user  has even finished reading one article?</p></li><li id="viewer-762lp"><p><strong>Works against user goals.</strong> At the end of my workday, I usually open a row of new tabs of  that day’s UX-related tweets that pique my interest — many people engage  in this kind of parallel browsing and page parking (keeping many tabs  open to multi-task, and opening multiple tabs at once to research a  particular topic). Sites that trigger exit overlays when I switch tabs,  or after a specified amount of time, guarantee that I must close the  overlay <em>before I interact with their content for the first time.</em>  Some overlays even insult my intelligence by making me click a button  that says “No, I don’t want free things” or “I hate good advice” <em>before I interact with their content for the first time</em>.</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-64t8v"><span><span>A variety of companies will try to convince you that <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://blog.getrooster.com/what-are-exit-overlays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>exit overlays</u></a> <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://blog.crazyegg.com/2015/07/27/6-exit-overlays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>are</u></a> <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/exit-overlays-make-your-landing-page-offer-more-persuasive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>great</u></a>, or at least that you can use them <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/09/14/popups-and-user-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>responsibly</u></a>.  I’ll grant that some websites may see increased newsletter conversions,  but at what long-term cost to their brand? While some users may sign up  for the newsletter willingly, many others may feel bullied into signing  up or even leave in disgust. As a research psychologist recently  transitioned to UX, I recognize this aggressive persuasion technique as  an example of <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/10/01/dark-patterns-the-sinister-side-of-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>dark design patterns</u></a> and <a data-hook="linkViewer" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/needy-design-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>needy design patterns</u></a>.  With some reworking, perhaps mouse-out trackers can help users and  companies achieve aligned goals — like how Google Calendar sends  notifications to my phone when it knows I do not have Calendar opened in  my browser. When it comes to conversions, however, there are no magic  bullets and there are no short-cuts. Companies that want to up  conversions must allow potential clients time to research on their own  terms.</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
