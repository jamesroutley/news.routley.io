            <h2>What is Lockdown Mode?</h2>
            <p>Lockdown Mode is an optional, extreme protection that’s designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats. Most people are never targeted by attacks of this nature.</p>
            
        </div>

    
        

    
        <div>
    

    
            <h2>How Lockdown Mode protects your device</h2>
            <div><p>When Lockdown Mode is enabled, some apps and features will function differently, including:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages - Most message attachment types are blocked, other than certain images, video, and audio. Some features, such as links and link previews, are unavailable. </li>
<li>Web browsing - Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.</li>
<li>FaceTime - Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked unless you have previously called that person or contact.</li>
<li>Apple Services - Incoming invitations for Apple Services, such as invitations to manage a home in the Home app, are blocked unless you have previously invited that person.</li>
<li>Shared albums - Shared albums are removed from the Photos app, and new Shared Album invitations are blocked. You can still view these shared albums on other devices that don’t have Lockdown Mode enabled.</li>
<li>USB accessories - To connect your device to a USB accessory or another computer, the device needs to be unlocked.</li>
<li>Configuration profiles - Configuration profiles can’t be installed, and the device can’t be enrolled in Mobile Device Management or device supervision while in Lockdown Mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phone calls and plain text messages continue to work while Lockdown Mode is enabled. Emergency features, such as SOS emergency calls, are not affected. <br/>

            <h2>How to enable Lockdown Mode on iPhone</h2>
            <div><ol>
<li>Open the Settings app.</li>
<li>Tap Privacy &amp; Security.</li>
<li>Under Security, tap Lockdown Mode and tap Turn On Lockdown Mode.</li>
<li>Tap Turn On Lockdown Mode.</li>
<li>Tap Turn On &amp; Restart, then enter your device passcode.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Lockdown Mode is enabled, you might receive notifications when an app or feature is limited, and a banner in Safari indicates that Lockdown Mode is on.<br/>

            <h2>How to exclude apps or websites from Lockdown Mode</h2>
            <div><p>While your device is in Lockdown Mode, you can exclude an app or website from being impacted and limited. Exclude only trusted apps or websites and only if necessary.</p>
<p>To exclude a website while browsing: Tap the Page Settings button <img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/ios15-markup-text-size-icon.png" alt="" width="30"/> &gt; Website Settings, then turn off Lockdown Mode.</p>
<p>To exclude an app or to edit your excluded websites:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Settings app.</li>
<li>Tap Privacy &amp; Security.</li>
<li>Under Security, tap Lockdown Mode.</li>
<li>Tap Configure Web Browsing.</li>
</ol>
<p>To exclude an app, turn that app off in the menu. Only apps that you have opened since enabling Lockdown Mode and which have limited functionality appear on this list.</p>
<p>To edit your excluded websites, tap Excluded Safari Websites &gt; Edit.</p>

            <h2>Configuration profiles and managed devices</h2>
            <div><p>If a device is in Lockdown Mode, new configuration profiles can&#39;t be installed, and the device can&#39;t be enrolled in Mobile Device Management or device supervision. If a user wants to install a configuration profile or management profile, they need to turn off Lockdown Mode, install the profile, and then re-enable Lockdown Mode, if necessary. These restrictions prevent attackers from attempting to install malicious profiles.</p>
<p>A device that is enrolled in Mobile Device Management before Lockdown Mode is enabled remains managed. System administrators can install and remove configuration profiles on that device.</p>
<p>Lockdown Mode is not a configurable option for Mobile Device Management by system administrators, as it’s designed for the very small number of individual users who might be targeted by extreme cyber attacks.<br/>
