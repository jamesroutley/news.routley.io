It is expected to bring back “pristine material from Bennu – rocks and dust collected from the asteroid’s surface in 2020” and will offer scientists a window into 4.5bn years ago, when the sun and planets were forming, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> Nasa.</p><p><a href="https://www.asteroidmission.org/objectives/" data-link-name="in body link">According to</a> Nasa, Bennu is one of the most potentially hazardous asteroids and has a relatively high probability of impacting the Earth in the late 22nd century. The Osiris-Rex mission will determine Bennu’s various attributes including its physical and chemical properties, which, as Nasa describes, “will be critical to know in the event of an impact mitigation mission”.</p><p>In addition to featuring the world’s first atlas of an asteroid, Lauretta and May’s new book will include previously unseen stereoscopic three-dimensional images of Bennu, as well as analysis of what it may reveal about the origins of life.</p><figure id="d32aad72-f903-44ff-b991-6c41213f1119" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="An photograph of Bennu composed of 12 separate images collected on 2 December 2019 by the Osiris-Rex spacecraft." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b306bb8fbd5ccdd85612664b89a2143429d59e/0_0_1190_1125/master/1190.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="420.6932773109244" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>An photograph of Bennu composed of 12 separate images collected on 2 December 2019 by the Osiris-Rex spacecraft.</span> Photograph: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>In the book’s preface, Lauretta describes his first meeting with May back in 2016, writing: “Brian and I corresponded briefly about the mission and my hometown of Tucson, Arizona, where he had spent some time enjoying the natural beauty of the Sonoran Desert and using it for self-reflection, as many do,” Tucson.com <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/queen-guitarist-writes-asteroid-book-university-of-arizona/article_b4949f66-2721-11ee-a1c8-ef115f270dea.html" data-link-name="in body link">reports</a>.</p><p>“I was, of course, a huge fan of Brian’s music,” Lauretta, who is the leader of the Osiris-Rex mission, wrote, adding: “The fact that I was corresponding with one of my childhood heroes was beyond cool.</p><p>“As the OSIRIS-REx mission progressed, I couldn’t help but share some of the latest developments with him … To my delight, Brian showed a keen interest in the mission and the science behind it. It was clear that he was not just a casual fan, but a true space enthusiast and an advocate for space exploration.”</p><p>Lauretta eventually brought May on to the mission, who, alongside his collaborator Claudia Manzoni, created stereo images from original images that were collected by the Osiris-Rex cameras.</p><p>The images of the asteroid’s surface ultimately helped researchers find a safe landing site for sample collection.</p><p>Speaking about the mission, May <a href="https://brianmay.com/brian-news/2023/06/brian-may-new-book-bennu-3d-and-virtual-talk/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> that it “undertook by far the most intimate exploration of any asteroid to date, and here are the results, the fruits of the labours of a huge team of top scientists and engineers”.</p><p>“Our aim has been to deliver this extraordinary portrait in a form which is understandable and enjoyable to scientists and non-scientists alike,” May added.</p><p>In addition to the book featuring the three-dimensional images, as well as illustrations and maps, Tucson.com <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/queen-guitarist-writes-asteroid-book-university-of-arizona/article_b4949f66-2721-11ee-a1c8-ef115f270dea.html" data-link-name="in body link">reports</a> that it comes with a <a href="https://www.berezin.com/3d/owl_lite.htm" data-link-name="in body link">Lite Owl</a><a href="https://shop.londonstereo.com/LITE.html" data-link-name="in body link">,</a> a stereoscopic viewer designed by May that allows readers to see the images in their three-dimensional form.</p><p>Before founding Queen in 1970 alongside Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor, May studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London.
