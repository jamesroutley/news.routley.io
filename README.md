# news.routley.io

Hello! This repo houses the code that generates my personal RSS feed. It's hosted at [news.routley.io](https://news.routley.io/). The code itself is non-generic and personalised to my use case, but it might serve as interesting inspiration.

I've also [written a blog post about this](https://routley.io/posts/bespoke-software-rss-aggregator/).

## How does it work?

### Building the website

The RSS feed is generated by the script [main.go](/main.go). It:

1. Stores a list of RSS feeds to pull from
2. Iterates over them, and reads the posts from the last month and stores them in a big list of all posts
3. Sorts the posts by time, and templates them into a HTML file, which it writes to [docs/index.html](docs/index.html)

### Hosting the website

The website is hosted by GitHub pages, which serves the files in the [docs](/docs) directory.

### Automation

We use a GitHub [Action](/.github/workflows/build-website.yml) to run the `main.go` script every hour. It commits any changes to `docs/index.html`, which are automatically deployed by GitHub Pages âœ¨
